He is cold and wet from the falling snow. A concerned citizen called EMS to trans-port the patient to the Emergency Department.

On examination， he is thin， disheveled，malodorous， and his extremities are pale and cold.

The patient has an irregular heart rhythm， likely atrial fibrillation. He is not shivering and his rectal temperature is 30℃ (86°F).1\\. Recognize the spectrum of cold exposure injuries.\n\n【6】2\\.

Know the treatments for frostbite and hypothermia.HYPOTHERMIA： Condition in which the core body temperature drops below that required for normal metabolism， which is less than 35℃ (95°F).The human cold response is aimed at maintaining the core body temperature and the viability of the extremities. The skin’s thermoreceptors are densest on the upper torso. These peripheral thermoreceptors signal a central thermostat，located in the preoptic region of the anterior hypothalamus to activate autonomic as well as behavioral heat loss and gain mechanisms. Peripheral cooling of the blood leads to a cascade of events including catecholamine release， thyroid stimulation， shivering thermogen-esis， and peripheral vasoconstriction. Heat loss is reduced by peripheral vasocon-striction mediated by sympathetic stimulation and catecholamine release. By using stored glycogen， shivering thermogenesis can provide several hours of heat， however once glycogen stores are depleted shivering stops. The extremities are protected by the hunting reaction， which consists of irregular， 5- to 10-minute cycles of alternat-ing periods of vasodilation and vasoconstriction that protect the extremities against sustained periods of vasoconstriction. If the body is exposed to cold of prolonged duration or magnitude and the core body temperature is threatened， this mechanism is abandoned-the so-called life-versus-limb mechanism. Once the body has physi-ologically lost the ability to compensate for the cold， injury is inevitable. The physi-ologic consequences of cold injury are thus considered by a systems approach.| Table 42-1HYPOTHERMIA RISK FACTORS  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Disrupted Circulation  | Increased Heat Loss  |\n| Tight-fitting clothing  | Cold， windy environments  |\n| Medications  | Medications  |\n| Smoking  | Ethanol  |\n| Diabetes  | Extremes of age  |\n| Peripheral vascular disease  | Burns  |\n| Dehydration  |  |\n| Decreased Heat Production  | Impaired Thermoregulation  |\n| Hypothyroidism  | Stroke  |\n| Hypoadrenalism  | Tumor  |\n| Hypoglycemia  | Ethanol  |\n| Malnutrition  | Benzodiazepines  |\n| B-blockers  | Opioids  |\n| Neuroleptics  | Barbiturates  |\n| Extremes of age  | Phenothiazines Atypical antipsychotics Alpha blockers Extremes of age  |There are many predisposing factors for the development of hypothermia 删除25：<u></u>. These can be generalized into four overlapping categories： disrupted circulation， increased heat loss， decreased heat production， and impaired thermo-regulation.\n\n【8】Two high-risk populations include individuals who consume ethanol and the elderly. Ethanol use predisposes to hypothermia in many ways. First， it impairs judg-ment and thermal perception， therefore， increasing the risk to cold exposure. Etha-nol predisposes to hypoglycemia， impedes shivering (ie， lack of fuel interferes with shivering)， and causes peripheral vasodilation (ie， increases heat loss). In addition， ethanol's affect on the hypothalamus results in a lower thermoregulatory set point， resulting in a reduction of the core temperature. The elderly exhibit age-related impairments in many of the systems of thermoregulation. The elderly often have an impaired shivering response， decreased mobility， and malnutrition. They are less able to discriminate cold environments and often lack the ability to vasoconstrict adequately. Their risks are also increased secondary to their medications， particu-lar cardiac medications， which may impede thermoregulation. The risk of falls is increased in the elderly. It is also critical to rule out sepsis as the cause of hypother-mia in the elderly； particularly hypothermic individuals who are found indoors.

A multitude of cardiac dysrhythmias are seen in hypothermia with atrial fibrillation being the most common. The Osborn or J wave is a well-known manifestation of hypothermia seen on ECGs 删除33：<u></u>. It is characterized by elevation at the junction of the QRS complex and the ST-segment and is typically seen at temperatures below 32℃ (89.6°F). As temperatures drop below 28℃(82.4°F)， ventricular fibrillation occurs. As the core body temperature drops so does oxygen consumption. It is thought that in some people this decline in oxygen consumption may explain why profoundly hypothermic patients have been successfully resuscitated.\n\n【10】删除3：<u>Figure 42-1.

When the body is exposed to a magnitude or duration of cold that is significant enough to disrupt the core body temperature， continuous and intense vasoconstriction occurs， promoting frostbite to the exposed tissue. Frostbite occurs when tissue temperatures are less than 0℃ (32°F). There are two mechanisms for tissue damage： architectural cellular damage from ice-crystal formation and micro-vascular thrombosis and stasis. The initial phase of frostbite， the “prefreeze phase，”is characterized by tissue temperatures dropping below 10℃ (50°F)， and cutane-ous sensation being lost. There is microvascular vasoconstriction and endothelial leakage of plasma into the interstitium. Crystal formation does not occur until tis-sue temperatures drop below 0℃ (32°F). Areas of skin that experience a slow rate of cooling will develop ice crystals in the extracellular matrix， whereas cells that undergo rapid cooling develop intracellular ice crystals， the latter of which is less favorable to cell survival. During the freeze-thaw phase， extracellular ice crystals form. In an attempt to maintain osmotic equilibrium， water leaves the cells causing cellular dehydration and intracellular hyperosmolality. This leads to cellular col-lapse and demise. The third phase is the progressive microvascular collapse phase. Red cells sludge and form microthrombi during the first few hours after the tissues are thawed. The exact mechanism is unclear. Hypoxic vasospasm， hyperviscosity， and direct endothelial damage all adversely affect flow. Ultimately， there is plasma leakage and arteriovenous shunting resulting in thrombosis， increased tissue pressure，As with all patients who present to the ED with serious conditions， evaluation and stabilization occurs simultaneously and the ABCs should always be promptly addressed. The patient should be placed on a cardiac monitor and have an intra-venous catheter placed. Once this occurs， a thorough history should be obtained including ambient temperature， wind velocity， duration of exposure， type of clothing worn， medication history， and preexisting medical problems that could affect heat loss. A core temperature needs to be determined. This is best achieved by obtain-ing a rectal temperature. Most standard hospital thermometers only read as low as34°℃ (93.2°F). Therefore， in patients suspected to be hypothermic， it is critical to measure core temperature using a specialized thermometer that is capable of reading low temperatures.After stabilizing the core temperature and addressin1ITeg associated conditions， rapid thawing should be initiated. The core temperature will continue to fall even after the patient is extricated from the cold environment due to temperature equili-bration between the core and peripheral blood. Most patients are dehydrated. Warm intravenous fluids (crystalloid) should be administered. For frostbite， rapid rewarm-ing of frozen or partially thawed tissue is accomplished by immersion in gen-tly circulating water that is carefully maintained at a temperature of 37℃ to41℃ (99°F-106°F). Rewarming is continued until the tissue is pliable and distal 删除换行1 erythema is noted， usually about 10 to 30 minutes. Active， gentle motion is encour-aged but direct tissue massage should be avoided. Parenteral analgesics should be administered because tissue rewarming causes throbbing， burning pain， and tender-ness. Sensation is often diminished after thawing and then disappears with bleb formation. Sensation does not normalize until healing is complete.</u></u>\nAfter thawing， the injured extremities should be elevated to minimize swelling. Sterile dressings should be applied and involved areas handled gently. Digital exer-cises are encouraged to help avoid venous stasis. Treatment also includes NSAIDs， topical aloe vera， debridement of clear blisters (hemorrhagic blisters should be left alone)， and tetanus vaccine if indicated. Antibiotics are also often given. In cases of gangrene， amputation is often delayed for up to 3 weeks， because the extent of tissue injury is difficult to initially assess.Passive external rewarming allows patients to warm by endogenous heat produc-tion. This requires the ability to shiver. Individuals who are malnourished， hypo-glycemic， or have a core temperature below 30℃ are not candidates for passive external rewarming. Therefore， this is a good option in healthy patients with a mild degree of hypothermia. The patient should be removed from the cold or wet envi-ronment， and be wrapped in blankets， sleeping bags， or other insulating materials.Hypothermic patients may experience complications secondary to rewarming. Afterdrop refers to the continual decline in core body temperature after the patient is removed from the cold environment. The current theory holds that rewarming causes disequilibrium across a gradient such that the body is cooled from the periph-ery to the inside and the core body temperature will continue to drop until core temperature is equal to peripheral temperature. This was thought to predispose to ventricular fibrillation. However， there is little evidence to support this. Nonethe-less， ventricular fibrillation is typically resistant to defibrillation until core tempera-tures are above 28℃(82.4°F).\n\n【11】For patients who are pulseless and show no signs of life， death pronouncement only occurs when the individual’s core body temperature is greater than 35℃. Since the physiologic response to hypothermia is extremely varied， the well known adage，“no one is dead until they are warm and dead” is often valid.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

When she sees a spider she becomes fearful. She  删除换行1 sweats, shakes and her heart rate increases. She needs to get out of the room very quickly and  删除换行1 requires family members to come and remove the spider. She cannot re-enter the room until  删除换行1 she is certain the spider is gone. She cannot sleep in a room if she has seen a spider there and  删除换行1 could not go on two school trips because of worries about encountering a spider.\n\n【3】She has been offered a job in a hotel as an apprentice domestic supervisor. She is keen to take  删除换行1 it, but does not think she can do the job with her fears. She is also thinking of committing to a  删除换行1 new relationship and up until now her family have helped her solve her problems. She has not  删除换行1 revealed the extent of her difficulties to her boyfriend. She requests diazepam tablets, because  删除换行1 her aunt uses these for her fear of aeroplanes, and believes them to be effective for phobias.\n\n【4】Mental state examination\n\n【5】When she comes in it is noticeable that she is on edge. She scans the room quickly and  删除换行1 explains later that this was to check for spiders and that she does this routinely. Once she has  删除换行1 done this she is relaxed and discusses her fears. She explains that they are ‘irrational’ and she  删除换行1 knows that most spiders are harmless, but nevertheless experiences very intense anxiety. She  删除换行1 has no evidence of other mental illness and no symptoms or signs of psychosis or depression.\n\n【6】Questions\n\n【7】• What do you say in reply to her request for diazepam?\n\n【8】• What is the treatment of choice?\n\n【9】ANSWER 22\n\n【10】1. A phobia is a persistent fear of a situation or object, with avoidance of the feared  删除换行1 situation or object and powerful anticipatory anxiety. There is usually insight that  删除换行1 the fear is irrational or out of kilter with the true risk of the situation.\n\n【11】2. Medication would not be used with spider phobia. Dependency is common with  删除换行1 benzodiazepines.\n\n【12】The treatment of choice for spider phobia is cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT). This involves  删除换行1 desensitization where exposure leads to habituation. A hierarchy of feared situations is built  删除换行1 up, and client and therapist work their way through this hierarchy. This may, for example,  删除换行1 begin with pictures, plastic spiders, cartoons and videos, and move on to dead and then live  删除换行1 spiders. Different-sized spiders can be used. At first these may be in jars or Perspex boxes,  删除换行1 then they may be put onto the table or into the therapist’s hands. Many therapists will finish by putting a live spider on the table, teaching the client to cover it with a jar, sealing the  删除换行1 jar with a card and then depositing the spider outside. The therapy can also lead to people  删除换行1 touching live spiders, letting them run on their hands or using a ‘spider hoover’ to catch and  删除换行1 deposit them outside. The end goal is usually mutually agreed and reviewed as it may change  删除换行1 when therapy progresses.\n\n【13】Cognitively, the therapist may use psychoeducation explaining how humans are genetically  删除换行1 programmed to fear certain shapes (as part of natural selection). Discussion about the purpose of fear and a systematic assessment of the dangerousness of spiders compared to other  删除换行1 creatures (bees, wasps, rats, etc.) can help in the appraisal of threat. Personification of the spider as vulnerable (as opposed to threatening) and an understanding of how the human mind  删除换行1 automatically interprets the body language of a spider as threatening can all help. A rational  删除换行1 understanding of changes in fear after habituation goes hand in hand with the behavioural  删除换行1 strategies and desensitization. Finally, the woman’s memories of not coping in the presence of  删除换行1 spiders need to be replaced through therapy and supplemented with many new experiences  删除换行1 of coping. Much can be done in sessions, but homework also allows the client to see that he  删除换行1 or she can cope on his or her own without help. The therapy should provide plenty of healthy  删除换行1 experiences of coping with spiders that establish confidence.\n\n【14】Key Points\n\n【15】• Spider phobia is common.\n\n【16】• Benzodiazepines can lead to dependence and are not usually used in most  删除换行1 phobias.\n\n【17】• Cognitive behaviour therapy is the treatment of choice.\n\n【18】删除29：<u>Case 23: Déjà vu and amnesia\n\n【19】</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

She has “always” had headaches, but they became more bothersome approximately 3 years ago in association with onset of menses, and decreased sleep. Her typical headache begins with a sense of slowed thinking and malaise followed soon after by a throbbing pain over the left side of her head, the right side of her head or, at times, over her forehead. The pain increases to its maximum severity of 8 to 9 out of 10 over the course of approximately 1 hour and will last for “many hours” if untreated. The patient reports that even light touch over the affected part of her head causes pain, and she is sensitive to bright lights and loud sounds. She typically feels nauseous and will occasionally have emesis. Acetaminophen and ibuprofen seem to help, but the best pain relief comes with sleeping in a dark room. After the pain resolves, she feels cognitively slow and “out of sorts” for up to a full day. Over the past year, however, the incidence of such attacks has increased to once every 2 to 3 weeks leading to frequent missed days in school and a drop in school performance. They seem to be associated with menses or poor sleep. Her physical examination and neurologic examination are completely normal. She consistently has had motion sickness “for as long as she can remember.” Neurodevelopmentally she met all milestones. The patient’s mother had “bad headaches” as a teenager and young adult and she has a maternal aunt, who was diagnosed with migraines at approximately 20 years of age. No other neurologic diseases are noted in the family.\n\n【3】 What is the most likely diagnosis?\n\n【4】 What is the next diagnostic step?\n\n【5】 What is the next step in therapy?\n\n【6】### ANSWERS TO CASE 46: Pediatric Headache (Migraine Without Aura)\n\n【7】Summary : This 13-year-old right-handed healthy girl presents with a history of recurrent hemicranial headaches that are throbbing with moderate to moderately severe pain in a crescendo–decrescendo pattern associated with nausea and occasional emesis. She also reports photophobia and phonophobia. The headaches will last for many hours untreated, are improved somewhat with low doses of acetaminophen, and resolved if the patient can get to sleep. There is a brief prodrome of malaise and a more prolonged postdrome of cognitive dulling. The only noted triggers are sleep deprivation, and she has noted an association with her menstrual cycle. Her neurologic examination is completely normal, and her family history is significant for two people with probable migraines.\n\n【8】• Most likely diagnosis: Migraine without aura ( common migraine ).\n\n【9】• Next diagnostic step: No diagnostic workup necessary at this point.\n\n【10】• Next step in therapy: Trial of appropriately dosed nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) followed by a trial of triptans if necessary. Consider prophylactic therapy given headache frequency.\n\n【11】#### ANALYSIS\n\n【12】##### Objectives\n\n【13】1\\. Understand the difference between primary and secondary headaches.\n\n【14】2\\. Know the clinical criteria for pediatric migraine headaches.\n\n【15】3\\. Understand the role of neuroimaging in evaluating headaches.\n\n【16】4\\. Know the different options available for acute abortive therapy for pediatric migraines.\n\n【17】5\\. Recognize when daily prophylactic therapy is warranted in migraine treatment and what possible options exist.\n\n【18】##### Considerations\n\n【19】This otherwise healthy and neurodevelopmentally normal 13-year-old girl is brought in for evaluation of frequent headaches. Because she is currently headache-free with a normal neurologic examination, attention can be turned to classifying her headache disorder, which will aid in dictating any necessary workup and intervention. A primary headache is one in which the head pain itself is the principal clinical entity, and there is no other underlying causative disorder. Tension-type headaches and migraine headaches would be common examples of such conditions. Secondary headaches, conversely, are headaches caused by another underlying disorder such as intracranial hemorrhage, central nervous system infection, temporomandibular joint pain, or substance abuse. In general, secondary headaches are defined by the underlying principal problem and require a more extensive and prompt evaluation. Primary headaches, however, are generally defined by their clinical symptoms and can require no workup if clinical criteria are met. The history in this scenario is classic for migraine with the unilateral aspect, throbbing, aura, family history, and triggers.\n\n【20】### APPROACH TO: Pediatric Headache\n\n【21】Head pain in children and adults can be divided into primary and secondary headaches. It can also be useful to consider the pattern of the patient’s headaches: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> acute recurrent —episodic head pain with pain-free intervals in between; 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> chronic progressive —gradually worsening head pain with no pain-free intervals; 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> chronic daily headache—a persistent headache that neither worsens nor remits; and 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> a mixed headache —a chronic daily headache with episodic exacerbations. Chronic progressive headaches raise the possibility of increasing intracranial pressure and require further evaluation with neuroimaging. Chronic daily headaches can be a secondary headache caused by cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, or can arise from a primary headache disorder. This condition as well as mixed headaches can require referral to a headache specialist.\n\n【22】In 2004, the International Headache Society defined the criteria for pediatric migraine:\n\n【23】A. Headache attack lasting 1 to 72 hours\n\n【24】B. Headache has at least two of the following four features:\n\n【25】通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> Either bilateral or unilateral (frontal/temporal) location\n\n【26】通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> Pulsating quality\n\n【27】通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> Moderate-to-severe intensity\n\n【28】通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> Aggravated by routine physical activities\n\n【29】C. At least one of the following accompanies headache:\n\n【30】通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> Nausea and/or vomiting 删除换行1 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> Photophobia and phonophobia (can be inferred from their behavior)\n\n【31】D. Five or more attacks fulfilling the above criteria\n\n【32】The mean age of onset for pediatric migraine is approximately 7 years of age for boys and 11 years of age for girls. With regard to prevalence, 8% to 23% of children meet criteria for migraines in the second decade of life making such primary headaches a very common problem. Although migraines can be seen in children as young as 3 years of age, the prevalence is less than 3%. This is likely an underestimate, however, given the difficulty of making the diagnosis in very young children. Migraines commonly “run in families” and have a significant genetic component although only relatively rare migraine syndromes have been directly linked to a single gene mutation. Many cases of familial hemiplegic migraine, for example, have been linked to a mutation in the CACNA1A gene that encodes a voltage-gated P/Q-type calcium channel. One interesting association with migraine is that many patients report having motion sickness (ie, “car sickness”) as children. Although this clinical finding is useful if present, its absence in no way diminishes the possibility of migraine.\n\n【33】As in adults, migraines in children often begin with a prodromal premonitory phase with neurologic or constitutional symptoms lasting for hours or days before the headache. These “warning signs” can slowly increase over time or remain constant. Some patients develop an aura prior to the onset of pain that consists of a stereotyped focal symptom usually preceding the headache by no more than an hour. Visual auras are the most common type and can involve a variety of visual aberrations such as scotomata, flashes, or geometric forms. Motor, sensory, and cognitive auras can also be seen. The pattern of the pain is typically crescendo in onset and decrescendo in offset and is certainly not maximal from the beginning. As the pain continues, the patient often develops cutaneous allodynia, which means that normally non-noxious stimulation is perceived as painful during the headache. Associated elements such as nausea, photophobia, phonophobia, vertigo, and nasal congestion are common. Following the headache, most patients experience a post-dromal phase with symptoms such as difficulty concentrating, particular food cravings, and fatigue. Triggers commonly associated with migraine headaches include strong smells, particularly if noxious, exercise, sleep deprivation, missing meals, and mild head trauma. Many patients associate certain foods with the onset of their migraines, but this can at times be difficult to distinguish between food cravings occurring during the prodromal phase. Women with migraines are more likely to experience headaches around the time of menses.\n\n【34】#### EVALUATION\n\n【35】A careful history and physical examination are the most important aspects of the evaluation. When the history is unequivocally consistent with migraine and the neurologic examination is completely normal, no further workup is needed. In particular, neuroimaging is unnecessary, and the yield is low. However, an abnormal neurologic examination, or worrisome feature on history necessitates an MRI scan. Although most parents fear the presence of a brain tumor, more than 98% of patients with intracranial masses have abnormalities on their neurologic examination. It is important that the neurologic examination include an assessment of head circumference, visualization of the optic discs, assessment of nuchal rigidity, and palpation of the sinuses in order to carefully screen for underlying causes. Electroencephalography (EEG) is not routinely indicated in the evaluation of headaches. Patients with epilepsy often have postictal headaches, but it would be quite unusual for the headache to be the primary presenting complaint. Lumbar puncture (LP) is essential if head pain is thought to be caused by a CNS infection and is part of the evaluation of subarachnoid hemorrhage (if a CT scan is unrevealing). LP however has no routine role in the evaluation of primary headache disorders.\n\n【36】#### TREATMENT AND MANAGEMENT\n\n【37】Treatment of migraine focuses on two concepts: acute pain relief (abortive therapy) and headache prevention (prophylactic therapy) . There are an ever-increasing number of available medications that can be used for abortive therapy with few controlled trials to help guide decision making. Perhaps the best studied medications are ibuprofen and acetaminophen and both have been shown to be safe and effective in children. Many patients will already have tried such medications prior to coming to see their doctor, but they often have been underdosed or given late in the progression of the headache, which renders them as much less effective. In such patients, it is worth a trial of adequately dosed ibuprofen (10 mg/kg) or acetaminophen (15 mg/kg) given as soon as possible after the onset of the pain. If these medications prove ineffective, then a trial of 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor agonists (the triptans ) is indicated. These agents are available in a variety of formulations and also differ from one another in terms of half-life. At present, the best pediatric data supports the use of sumatriptan nasal spray as an abortive agent in children . Oral formulations and subcutaneous injections have not been subjected to adequate trials in children at this point.\n\n【38】For patients with frequent migraines (eg, two or more a month) or particularly long-lasting or disabling migraines, daily prophylactic medications can be considered with the treatment goal being to decrease headache frequency. Compliance with a daily medication is a requirement. Sometimes, avoidance of triggers can significantly diminish headache frequency obviating the need for prophylactic medications. Simple lifestyle modification, such as keeping to a regular schedule of eating and sleeping and avoiding triggers, can significantly decrease the headache burden. Should medication be necessary, several classes of pharmacologic agents are used as prophylactic treatments: beta-blockers, tricyclic antidepressants, antihista-mines, calcium channel blockers, and anticonvulsants. As is the case with abortive therapies, much better data exists for the use of prophylactic medications in adults. Cyproheptadine has long been used in younger children for this purpose, but supportive data is based on retrospective nonblinded trials. Similarly, amitriptyline is somewhat sedating although generally well tolerated, but its efficacy has only been shown in retrospective studies. The use of anticonvulsants, particularly topiramate, for migraine prophylaxis is increasing in both adult and pediatric patients. Although good quality studies have supported its use in adults, there have yet to be adequate clinical trials in children.\n\n【39】####", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

This is a case of Ewing sarcoma, which can present with symptoms similar to those of an infection. The x-ray illustrates the classic location and appearance of the sarcoma. Ewing sarcoma is a small blue-cell tumor of childhood that most commonly arises in the medullary cavity in the diaphyses of long bones and the pelvis. It is found most often in boys <15 years of age. Patients typically present with localized pain over the site of the tumor. The periosteal reaction results in reactive bone deposition in an onion-skin manner. The tumor cells carry the t(11;22) translocation 85% of the time, and this would be seen on karyotype. Positive staining for glycogen with periodic acid-Schiff is also seen. In all cases, there is a fusion of the EWS gene on 22ql2 to a transcription factor.  \nAnswer A is incorrect . t(8;14) is most commonly associated with Burkitt lymphoma.  \nAnswer B is incorrect . t(9;22), the Philadelphia chromosome, is most commonly associated with chronic myeloid leukemia.  \nAnswer C is incorrect . t(11;14) is associated with mantle cell lymphoma.  \nAnswer E is incorrect . Although the translocation t(21;22) is seen in 5%-10% of cases of Ewing sarcomas, it is not as common as the t(11;22) translocation.  \nAnswer F is incorrect . The translocation t(15;17) is associated with the M3 type of acute myeloid leukemia. This type is treatable by all- trans retinoic acid.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "621170c0-b1fc-4edf-b558-007cba242319", "title": null, "text": "【0】DESCRIPTION OF OPERATIONS\n\n【1】The old scar is seen with the swelling. The hernia may  删除换行1 occur through a small portion of the scar, often the lower  删除换行1 end. Usually the diffuse bulging may occur involving the  删除换行1 whole of the scar. Usually the swelling is reducible and  删除换行1 an expansile cough impulse is present. The defect in the  删除换行1 abdominal wall is often palpable.\n\n【2】It may so happen that the hernia is irreducible. Such  删除换行1 cases become difficult to diagnose. These cases must be  删除换行1 differentiated with (differential diagnosis) :\n\n【3】(i) A deposit of tumour.\n\n【4】(ii) An old abscess.\n\n【5】(iii) A haematoma.\n\n【6】(iv) A foreign body granuloma.\n\n【7】Two distinct types of  删除换行1 incisional hernia should be recognized, as the principles  删除换行1 of treatment are different in these two cases.\n\n【8】(a) In type /, this hernia is situated in the upper  删除换行1 abdomen or in the midline of the lower abdomen. There  删除换行1 is a wide gap in the musculature which is easily recognized  删除换行1 and whose margin is smooth and regular. This hernia  删除换行1 reduces spontaneously as soon as the patient lies down.\nSo mostly it is a reducible hernia. This type of hernia  删除换行1 takes the form of a diffuse bulge. Risk of strangulation is 删除换行1 almost negligible. These herniae can be treated by simple  删除换行1 abdominal corsets.\n\n【9】(b) In type II, this hernia is situated in the lateral part  删除换行1 of the abdomen. The defect in the musculature is relatively  删除换行1 small and irregular. The contents are normally bowel and  删除换行1 omentum both. These are usually matted together and  删除换行1 are adherent to loculated peritoneal sac. These are usually  删除换行1 multiple loculi. So this hernia is partially or wholly  删除换行1 irreducible. As the muscular defect is small, risk of 删除换行1 strangulation is high.\n\n【10】A.\n\n【11】A few 删除换行1 preoperative measures should carefully be adopted to  删除换行1 reduce the chance of incisional hernia. These are :\n\n【12】(a) If the patient is obese, weight should be reduced  删除换行1 by dieting if an elective operation has to be performed.\n\n【13】(b) Nutritional or metabolic deficits, that may be  删除换行1 present to contribute to recurrence of hernia should be  删除换行1 corrected.\n\n【14】(c) If the patient has a tendency of chronic  删除换行1 bronchitis, it should be treated first.\n\n【15】(d) During operation one must be very careful  删除换行1 during closure of the abdomen. Deeper layers must be  删除换行1 sutured with due respect.\n\n【16】(e) All precautions should be adopted to prevent  删除换行1 immediate postoperative wound infection.\n\n【17】(f) Some measures to increase intra-abdominal  删除换行1 volume may be necessary in patients with chronic 删除换行1 pulmonary dysfunction. In these cases progressive  删除换行1 pneumoperitoneum has proved to be very effective.\n\n【18】There is 删除换行1 hardly any scope for conservative treatment in cases of 删除换行1 incisional hernia. Conservative method may be only tried  删除换行1 in type I cases if they are reducible. This method cannot  删除换行1 be adopted if the hernia is irreducible. After reducing  删除换行1 the hernia a belt is fitted with a suitable pad so that the  删除换行1 hernia does not get an opportunity to come out. If such  删除换行1 treatment is continued for a long time without giving a  删除换行1 chance of hernia to come out, there is a possibility of  删除换行1 cure. Moreover this treatment may be applied to those  删除换行1 type I cases where operation is contraindicated due to  删除换行1 the general condition of the patient.\n\n【19】This is always 删除换行1 indicated in type II cases and irreducible type I cases.\nOperative treatment is also justified when conservative  删除换行1 method has failed. In fact majority of the cases of incisional  删除换行1 hernia need operation sometime or the other.\n\n【20】OPERATION.— An elliptical incision is made  删除换行1 enclosing the area of unhealthy skin. The outer edges are  删除换行1 undermined. Now the incision is deepened to the  删除换行1 aponeurosis. The unhealthy skin is now gradually  删除换行1 dissected off the sac, which is nothing but a redundancy  删除换行1 of peritoneum. The sac is not opened. If the sac is  删除换行1 loculated and very adherent it is better to open the sac  删除换行1 around its neck. The contents are freed. Adherent  删除换行1 omentum may be ligated and removed alongwith the sac.\nAny adhesions involving the bowel should be separated  删除换行1 as far as practicable before the hernial contents are  删除换行1 returned to the abdomen.\n\n【21】Repair of the hernia depends on the type of hernia,  删除换行1 its position and its size. Followings are the different  删除换行1 methods one of which may be applied :—\n\n【22】1. Anatomical restoration.— This is suited for small  删除换行1 herniae with minimal scar. The edges of the defect are  删除换行1 carefully dissected and each layer e.g. the peritoneum,  删除换行1 the muscle layers or the aponeurosis are freed sufficiently.\nThese layers are sutured individually without tension with  删除换行1 non-absorbable sutures.\n\n【23】2. Mass closure.—The method is particularly good  删除换行1 when there are rigid margins of the hernia capable of  删除换行1 holding sutures. The peritoneum is opened as mentioned  删除换行1 above, the adhesions are lysed. The hernia is then closed  删除换行1 with mass closure of interrupted or continuous nonabsorbable suture such as No.l nylon. The bites in the  删除换行1 abdominal wall are made about 2.5 cm away from the  删除换行1 edges of the hernia. The repair may be reinforced with an  删除换行1 onlay graft of Marlex mesh.\n\n【24】3. Approximation of the rectus sheath.— This is only  删除换行1 performed in case of midline herniae, particularly below  删除换行1 the umbilicus. Here also each layer is separated 删除换行1 individually. The peritoneum is first sutured. The anterior  删除换行1 rectus sheaths are now freed from the underlying rectus  删除换行1 muscles.The rectus muscles of both sides are sutured in  删除换行1 the midline. Some overlapping may be done. Now the  删除换行1 anterior rectus sheath is sutured in the midline if possible  删除换行1 by overlapping. To reduce tension one may have to make  删除换行1 release incision vertically on the lateral part of the rectus  删除换行1 sheath.\n\n【25】4. Keel operation.— In this operation the hernial sac  删除换行1 is not opened but is pushed back into the abdomen. With  删除换行1 non-absorbable sutures it is pleated so that it deeps into  删除换行1 the abdominal cavity. A few layers of sutures are applied  删除换行1 one after the other till the healthy margins of the muscles  删除换行1 and aponeurosis are brought close. Now the margins of  删除换行1 the healthy muscles and aponeurosis are sutured to each  删除换行1 other. As in this operation the hernial sac is pushed into  删除换行1 the peritoneal cavity in a pattern which on cross-section  删除换行1 looks like the ‘keel’ of a ship, this operation is called ‘keel  删除换行1 operation’.\n\n【26】5. Cattell’s operation.— In this operation the hernial  删除换行1 sac is dissected out with equal care as has been described  删除换行1 in the earlier operations. But the sac is opened. The viscera  删除换行1 are reduced after freeing the contents from the sac. The  删除换行1 peritoneum is repaired. The edges of the abdominal wall  删除换行1 are now approximated and are sutured with thick chromic  删除换行1 catgut or better with non-absorbable suture material layer  删除换行1 by layer. After the surrounding aponeurosis has been  删除换行1 sutured, an incision is made half inch away from the suture  删除换行1 line. The medial edges of this incision are sutured over  删除换行1 the previous line of suture and the lateral margins are  删除换行1 then sutured over this medial layer of suture. This is  删除换行1 continued till the edges of the healthy aponeurosis are  删除换行1 brought together firmly.\n\n【27】6. Nuttal's operation.— Nuttal described repair of  删除换行1 lower abdominal midline incisional hernias by  删除换行1 overlapping the rectus abdominis muscle on each side.\nThe anterior sheath is incised on each side of the defect.\nThe rectus abdominis is detached from its insertion to  删除换行1 the symphysis pubis. Each rectus abdominis muscle is  删除换行1 now reattached to the pubic tubercle of the opposite side  删除换行1 with nylon sutures. The overlap of rectus muscles are  删除换行1 loosely sutured together. The anterior rectus sheath is  删除换行1 now closed with non-absorbable suture material.\n\n【28】7. Repair by fascial sutures or skin ribbon.— This  删除换行1 operation is more or less similar to hernioplasty. This  删除换行1 type of repair is necessary when the muscular defect is  删除换行1 considerable and cannot be closed without tension. The  删除换行1 peritoneum is freed and is sutured. The other layers in  删除换行1 the margin are separated particularly the muscle layers.\nThe defect is closed with the fascial sutures in an  删除换行1 interlacing manner from muscles of one side to the muscles  删除换行1 of the other side. The interlacing suture is made in the 删除换行1 form of Lattice work of ‘darn’.\n\n【29】8. Mesh closures.— These are becoming increasingly  删除换行1 popular. The incision and the sac are dealt with similarly  删除换行1 as done in the previous operations. The deficiency in the  删除换行1 abdominal wall is easily made good without tension by  删除换行1 laying and stitching a sheet of Tantalum gauze or a mesh  删除换行1 made of Dacron or marlex or polypropylene to the  删除换行1 surrounding aponeurosis. River-Stoppa hernioplasty  删除换行1 consisting of a large Mersilene prosthesis is quite popular  删除换行1 nowadays. The prosthesis is implanted deep to the  删除换行1 muscles of the abdominal wall but superficial to the  删除换行1 posterior rectus sheath or fascia transversalis. The  删除换行1 prosthesis extends far beyond the borders of  删除换行1 myoaponeurotic defect. It is firmly held in place by intraabdominal pressure and later by fibrous ingrowth. Repair  删除换行1 with synthetic mesh is only advised when the defect is  删除换行1 very large and cannot be closed effectively by autogenous  删除换行1 tissue. It cannot be used routinely as there is increased  删除换行1 chance of infection. Collection of oozing fluid inside the  删除换行1 wound acts as a good nidus of infection. The following  删除换行1 points should be considered whenever a synthetic mesh  删除换行1 is used :\n\n【30】(i) Asepsis should be maintained at all costs.\n\n【31】(ii) Too much handling of the tissues should be  删除换行1 minimised.\n\n【32】(iii) Haemostasis must be carefully maintained.\n\n【33】(iv) Even the pre-sterilized mesh should be handled  删除换行1 as little as possible.\n\n【34】(v) The extra mesh may be used in another patient  删除换行1 only after autoclaving. Not more than two autoclavings  删除换行1 should be advised.\n\n【35】(vi) The mesh should be placed as deeply as possible.\nIt should be used as an onlay on the sutured peritoneum.\nUnder no circumstances the intestine should be allowed  删除换行1 to come in contact with the mesh lest dense adhesions  删除换行1 should form. The recti muscles and anterior rectus sheath  删除换行1 should then cover the mesh completely. The mesh should  删除换行1 not be used just under the skin.\n\n【36】(vii) The mesh should be sutured all round with fine  删除换行1 prolene sutures.\n\n【37】(viii) A suction drainage in the form of Redivac should  删除换行1 always be given to aspirate the oozing fluid and thus to  删除换行1 prevent infection.\n\n【38】(ix) Collection of oozing fluid inside the wound  删除换行1 acts as a good nidus of infection. So local antibiotics and  删除换行1 postoperative parenteral antibiotics should be used.\n\n【39】(x) Nasogastric decompression and intravenous  删除换行1 fluid should be continued postoperatively. Nothing by  删除换行1 mouth is allowed till bowel sounds are heard.\n\n【40】(xi) Early ambulation is not encouraged, but  删除换行1 movements of the legs and exercises of the legs are  删除换行1 encouraged.HERNIA 219 删除换行1 (xii) Patient must not resume work or strenuous  删除换行1 exercise for 6 months.\n\n【41】9. Muscle pedicle flaps.— Defect in the lower  删除换行1 abdominal wall below the umbilicus may be reconstructed  删除换行1 using active and viable muscle belly. Two muscles are  删除换行1 particularly suitable for this purpose. These are the tensor  删除换行1 fascia lata and the rectus femoris.\n\n【42】Postoperative care.— Gastric decompression and  删除换行1 intravenous fluid are the key points in postoperative care.\nNothing should be given by mouth till the peristalsis  删除换行1 returns. Early ambulation is not much encouraged, but  删除换行1 the legs are instructed to move. The patient should not  删除换行1 do any strenuous exercise for 6 months.\n\n【43】UMBILICAL HERNIA\n\n【44】This condition means that the two recti muscles  删除换行1 separate from each other and a good gap exists between  删除换行1 the two recti muscles.\n\n【45】Causes.—\n\n【46】(i) Multiple pregnancies.\n\n【47】(ii) Repeated midline abdominal operations, in  删除换行1 which the linea alba may stretch.\n\n【48】The two recti are inserted  删除换行1 to the pubis close to each other, but their origins are  删除换行1 quite apart from the anterolateral aspects of the lower  删除换行1 ribs. When the recti contract the upper portions tend to  删除换行1 move apart from each other. Moreover contraction of the  删除换行1 oblique and transverse abdominal muscles is added to  删除换行1 this. So it is not surprising that the recti can separate a  删除换行1 few inches if the linea alba is weak.\n\n【49】This condition is principally seen 删除换行1 in elderly multiparae.\n\n【50】During straining, abdominal contents bulge through  删除换行1 the gap between the two recti muscles.\n\n【51】On examination one can easily detect the gap between  删除换行1 the two recti, through which fingers can be introduced.\n\n【52】A similar condition of divarication of recti may be seen  删除换行1 in babies particularly above the umbilicus.\n\n【53】As this condition is usually symptomless  删除换行1 and there is hardly any danger of obstruction or  删除换行1 strangulation, operation is usually not advised.\n\n【54】An abdominal belt should be advised.\n\n【55】In case of children also no treatment is required as  删除换行1 spontaneous cure is almost inevitable as the child grows.\n\n【56】B.\nThere are three types of lumbar hernia. The first two  删除换行1 are primary lumbar-herniae which come out through the  删除换行1 superior lumbar triangle and the inferior lumbar triangle.\n\n【57】The 3rd one is an acquired lumbar hernia and is better  删除换行1 called an ‘incisional lumbar hernia’.\n\n【58】This is rarer than the  删除换行1 inferior lumbar hernia. Superior lumbar hernia is  删除换行1 protrusion of abdominal contents through the superior 删除换行1 lumbar triangle, which is bounded above by the 12th rib,  删除换行1 medially by the sacrospinalis and laterally by the posterior  删除换行1 border of the obliquus internus abdominis.\n\n【59】is more common than the  删除换行1 superior one and the hernia protrudes through the inferior 删除换行1 lumbar triangle or lumbar triangle of Petit. This triangle is  删除换行1 bounded below by the crest of the ilium, medially by  删除换行1 the anterior border of the latissimus dorsi and laterally  删除换行1 by the posterior border of the obliquus externus  删除换行1 abdominis.\n\n【60】may occur in the lumbar  删除换行1 region — (a) following an operation or an infected kidney  删除换行1 or drainage of lumbar abscess, in which the wound gets  删除换行1 infected postoperatively OR\n\n【61】(b) Following paralysis of the muscles of the lumbar  删除换行1 region either due to injury of the nerve supplying this  删除换行1 region or due to poliomyelitis. This is also known as  删除换行1 phantom hernia.\n\n【62】Patient complains of a swelling  删除换行1 in the typical lumbar region.\n\n【63】On examination there is soft swelling which  删除换行1 corresponds to the superior or inferior lumbar triangle.\nThe swelling is reducible. It may be reduced by itself  删除换行1 when the patient lies down. Impulse on coughing is also  删除换行1 present.\n\n【64】Differential diagnosis.—.\n\n【65】When there is reducibility and impulse on coughing  删除换行1 diagnosis may not be difficult, yet the following  删除换行1 conditions should be kept in mind.\n\n【66】(i) Lipoma.— It is a firm or soft swelling, which  删除换行1 moves easily over the taut muscles. It is not reducible  删除换行1 and there is no impulse on coughing. On moving the  删除换行1 swelling one will see puckering of the skin.\n\n【67】(ii) Cold abscess pointing to this region.— \n\n【68】Paravertebral cold abscess may become superficial through  删除换行1 the lumbar triangle. This condition very much mimics  删除换行1 lumbar hernia. It gives rise to a soft cystic swelling.\nFluctuation test is positive. This swelling is not reducible.\n\n【69】But cough impulse may be present. X-ray of the thoracic  删除换行1 and lumbar spine is confirmatory.\n\n【70】(iii) Phantom hernia due to local muscular paralysis\n\n【71】— discussed above.\n\n【72】Primary lumbar hernia is treated by  删除换行1 herniotomy and repair of the gap i.e. herniorrhaphy.\n\n【73】Incisional hernia or phantom hernia is treated as  删除换行1 incisional hernia (discussed earlier).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

He had persistent high-grade fever over 5 days, along with 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> rashes all over the body; 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> bilateral conjunctivitis; 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> cervical lymphadenectasis; 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> red and cracked lips, strawberry tongue and pharyngeal hyperemia; 通用删除7(英):<u>(5)</u> red and edema finger joints and later skin peeling around fingernails. At his second time admission, he had prolonged fever over 5 days (during oral methylprednisolone and aspirin) along with all the same symptoms as shown at the first time except edema hands and feet. Thus he met the 4 out of 5 criteria for KD. When admitted at the third time, he had fever over 5 days along with all the same symptoms presented before except for conjunctiva congestion. His blood routine revealed WBC over 15 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> , NE% over 75%. CRP was significantly elevated whereas blood culture was negative. He had KD three times.\n\n【27】### 11.4.8 Case Specific Clinical Features\n\n【28】1.  1.\n    Both initial and the third time with KD, he was IVIG standardly and 48 h later, fever not regressed and spiking over 38.5 °C, with more than one KD symptom. Thus he was definitely diagnosed IVIG no-response 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 \\]</u>. For the second incidence of coronary artery dilatation, it may be related to the literature report that re-KD is prone to coronary artery dilatation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 20 \\]</u>. It suggests that more aggressive treatment strategies in conjunction with IVIG may be indicated for the second episode of KD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 21 \\]</u>. Thus, though he was afebrile after infused 2 mg methylprednisolone in the third time KD, we persuaded his parents to IVIG another 2 g/kg and his prognosis was nice which confirmed our therapy was appropriate.\n2.  2.\n    One literature reported after initial IVIG there was nearly a third KD patients who had recurrent fever. In two-thirds of these patients, the fever had subsided spontaneously without retreatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 22 \\]</u>. Thus recurrence in the USA was 1.7%. Among the US Asian/Pacific Islanders KD recurrence was 3.5%, which is same as with Japan (3.5%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 21 \\]</u>. As to incidence of three times of KD, we have no idea, nor the long-term prognosis of such patients because the third time KD was rare 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 22 \\]</u>. Totally there were 2 cases with three times KD in our center in 30 years. Their prognoses were well.\n3.  3.\n    With the publicity of KD and the recognition of its symptoms, parents of children with KD, even if they are not doctors, often can diagnose by themselves when KD reappears due to its special clinical manifestations, and can come to see the doctor within 5 days after the onset of KD. Therefore, once the symptoms of KD are recognized, usually there will be no misdiagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 23 \\]</u>.\n\n【29】Hong Wang", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

There were no complications during the pregnancy or labor and delivery. His birthweight was 3.23 kg and he passed the newborn hearing screen, cardiac screen, and metabolic testing. He is up to date on his routine vaccinations, and he will receive 15‐month vaccines today. Weight is at the 40th percentile, height is at the 50th percentile, and head circumference is at the 90th percentile. The Pediatric Evaluation of Developmental Status (PEDS) screening tool was administered at 9 months of age and was negative for developmental delay. Other screening questions at each previous visit have been within normal limits. His past medical history is significant for transient tyrosinemia, which resolved in the newborn period, and two episodes of otitis media, both treated and resolved.Past Surgical History\n---------------------\n\n【2】Only surgical history includes circumcision during newborn hospitalization.Family History\n--------------\n\n【3】There is no significant family medical history. There is a 6‐year‐old brother and an 8‐year‐old sister who are both healthy and live with the family. Parents are healthy. There are no family members with learning disabilities or other developmental delays.Current Status\n--------------\n\n【4】The toddler appears well nourished and happy. His physical examination is unremarkable. A brief developmental assessment finds that he is not speaking any words, just babbling. He does not say “mama” or “papa” specifically. He follows directions (such as putting trash in the trash can) and will point to what he wants. He is walking, climbing and beginning to run. He uses a spoon to feed himself and scribbles with a crayon. Per mother’s report, he is always busy and rarely sits still.Questions\n---------\n\n【5】Answer the following questions using the details provided.\n\n【6】1.  Based on the data provided, what are the differential diagnoses and the most likely diagnosis for this child?\n2.  What is the best way to address this child’s developmental concerns?\n3.  What other referrals or diagnostic studies would be indicated at this time?Rationale and Evidence‐based Practice Explanation\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【7】### Based on the data provided, what are the differential diagnoses and the most likely diagnosis for this child?\n\n【8】Differential diagnoses for this child include language delay, autism, and hearing loss. Language delay is the most likely diagnosis. Language development begins early: infants in the early months of life will make cooing sounds, and begin to vocalize and babble. By one year of life, an infant should make sounds to get attention and has one to two words that are usually most understandable to parents. By age 2, a toddler should be able to put some words together in short sentences.\n\n【9】A diagnosis of autism does include lack of or limited language, but also will involve other social findings, including avoidance of eye contact and hand flapping, Congenital hearing loss is less likely as the child passed the hearing screen at birth and the other forms of hearing loss would be associated with illness; for example, conductive hearing loss would occur as a result of otitis media and/or fluid in the middle ear. The most likely diagnosis for this child is language delay, as language development has begun; however, autism and hearing loss must also be ruled out.\n\n【10】### What is the best way to address this child’s developmental concerns?\n\n【11】Early language screening is important for identifying autism and hearing loss, but also language delay as a primary diagnosis. Recent research indicates that children with language delay present with middle ear ventilation disorders, have family histories of language disorders, and fall into categories representing expressive language delay, mixed receptive and expressive language delay, delay with cognitive impairment or intellectual disability, and autism 删除10：<u>(Singleton, 2018 )</u>. Another consideration which is more prevalent today is the issue of English as a second language, and the many children who will grow up in bilingual families. Challenges to the evaluation of these children, who may be “late talkers,” include the linguistic variations between the child’s language, variations of timing of learning each language, and potential cultural differences in screeners and the child/family 删除10：<u>(Singleton, 2018 )</u>.\n\n【12】At any well child visit, the care provider should first address the concerns of the parent. The Bright Futures recommendations for the 15‐month visit include evaluating social skills and communication, sleep patterns and issues, oral hygiene, and safety. This child’s mother is concerned that he is not speaking, so a few more specific questions are asked about his language and social development, which appears to be normal as he is interactive and does respond to directions and questions. Referral to a pediatric developmental specialist will help identify any specific delays or concerns to determine what services can be utilized to help him. Early intervention is key to improving outcomes in children with developmental delay 删除10：<u>(Bright Futures Steering Committee, 2006 , pp. 405–406)</u>.\n\n【13】Collaboration with the developmental specialist and others involved in his care, such as the speech therapist, will assist in determining if the child is meeting milestones. He will also be assessed at each well child visit, using formal developmental assessment tools, to ensure he is making progress and receiving all needed services. The primary care provider should receive reports from the pediatric developmental specialist and support the family in utilizing recommendations.\n\n【14】### What other referrals or diagnostic studies would be indicated at this time?\n\n【15】This young boy is referred to the state developmental assessment and support program, where he will undergo complete evaluation by a developmental pediatrician. He will have an assessment to determine any social, gross motor, fine motor and/or language problems. Recommended therapy and/or other specialty referrals will be identified. The developmental pediatrician and hearing specialist determine that he has language delay and recommend speech therapy and an audiology referral to rule out hearing loss. The primary care provider will continue to follow this child’s developmental progress and his social/adaptive skills at each well child visit to determine if any other referrals are warranted.\n\n【16】An autism evaluation is also recommended by the state program, and therefore the child is referred to a pediatric psychologist who specializes in developmental pediatrics and autism. It can be difficult to quickly refer to an autism program or evaluation specialist, and it may be hard to diagnose autism at this age, but there are also office‐based tools to utilize such as M‐Chat, which is a parent‐response tool that identifies typical features and behaviors of children with autism.Case Resolution\n---------------\n\n【17】At his 18‐month visit, the child’s mother answers another PEDS screening assessment. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends routine developmental screening at the 9‐, 18‐, and 30‐month well child visits using a standardized screening tool such as the PEDS screening assessment, which is a 10‐question survey of development for parents to complete and which can be used for young ages 删除10：<u>(Bright Futures, 2006, p. 406)</u>. This screen asks general questions with regard to speech, behavior, getting along with others, and use of hands and fingers among others. This child underwent 18‐month screening with use of the PEDS questionnaire. Mother has concerns that he is not speaking, but he receives speech therapy twice weekly and he is also undergoing an autism assessment.Language Delay\n===================\n\n【18】删除30：<u>Jolene Dickerson\n\n【19】Nemours/Alfred I. duPont Hospital for Children, Wilmington, DE, USA\n\n【20】</u>\nA 15‐month‐old boy presents with his mother to the primary care office for his well child visit.

He has an unremarkable physical examination. He is normotensive and is a nonsmoker, but he has a strong family history of hypercholesterolemia and premature atherosclerotic coronary artery disease (CAD).\n\n【11】 Diagnosis: Familial hypercholesterolemia.\n\n【12】 Next step: Counsel regarding lifestyle modification with low-fat diet and exercise, and offer treatment with an HMG-CoA (β-hydroxy-β-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A) reductase inhibitor.\n\n【13】 Complications if untreated: Development of atherosclerotic vascular disease, including coronary heart disease (CHD).\n\n【14】#### ANALYSIS\n\n【15】##### Objectives\n\n【16】1\\. Know the risk factors for developing coronary artery disease and know how to estimate the risk for coronary events using the Framingham risk scoring system.\n\n【17】2\\. Be familiar with the recommendations for cholesterol screening and for the treatment of low-, intermediate-, and high-risk patients.\n\n【18】3\\. Understand how the different classes of lipid-lowering agents affect lipid levels and the potential side effects of those agents.\n\n【19】4\\. Know the secondary causes of hyperlipidemia.\n\n【20】##### Considerations\n\n【21】A young man presents to the clinic for a checkup and is found to have markedly elevated total cholesterol (normal <200 mg/dL) and LDL levels (normal <100 mg/dL), and low HDL levels (normal >45 mg/dL). He does not have any apparent secondary causes of dyslipidemia, and has no signs or symptoms of vascular disease. He does have a strong family history of hypercholesterolemia and premature death caused by myocardial infarction (MI). The decisions regarding the method and intensity of lipid-lowering therapy are based on one’s estimation of the patient’s 10-year risk of major coronary events. Because of his very high lipid levels and family history, he is a high-risk patient and, thus, should be counseled about lipid-lowering medical therapy. The very high cholesterol levels at a young age in the absence of secondary causes leads one to suspect familial hypercholesterolemia, a condition caused by defective or absent LDL surface receptors and subsequent inability to metabolize LDL particles. Meanwhile, the importance of lifestyle modification cannot be overemphasized.\n\n【22】### APPROACH TO:\n\n【23】#### Hyperlipidemia\n\n【24】#### DEFINITIONS\n\n【25】HYPERLIPIDEMIA: An excess of fats or lipids in the blood, principally due to either elevated cholesterol or triglycerides.\n\n【26】ATHEROSCLEROSIS: Deposition of atheromatous plaques containing cholesterol and lipids on the innermost layer of the walls of large- and medium-sized arteries.\n\n【27】STATIN MEDICATIONS: A class of agents that lower cholesterol by inhibiting 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, which is a key enzyme in cholesterol synthesis.\n\n【28】#### CLINICAL APPROACH\n\n【29】Atherosclerotic coronary artery disease is the leading cause of death of both men and women in the United States. Because of the association of hypercholesterolemia and development of atherosclerotic heart disease, most authorities recommend routine screening of average-risk individuals at least every 5 years. Clinical laboratories usually measure total cholesterol, HDL, and triglycerides. The LDL cholesterol may be calculated by using the formula:\n\n【30】A fasting sample should be measured, if possible, but the total cholesterol and HDL are still reliable in a nonfasting sample. The triglycerides and the calculated LDL levels are affected by recent dietary intake and should be drawn in the fasting state.\n\n【31】Approximately 25% of American adults have a total cholesterol level of more than 240 mg/dL, which is considered elevated according to the guidelines of the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP). Management of patients with hypercholesterolemia involves assessment of other atherosclerotic risks to estimate the 10-year risk of coronary events, such as fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction. The LDL goal is set based on the estimated cardiovascular risk as described in the 2002 Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III).\n\n【32】High-risk patients already have an established CHD or other atherosclerotic vascular disease : their 10-year risk for future coronary events is more than 20% . The presence of diabetes now is considered a “CHD risk equivalent” in patients because of their higher risk of vascular disease as well as higher mortality rate from myocardial infarction than is the case with nondiabetics. High-risk individuals have an LDL goal of less than 100 mg/dL according to the ATP III. The intensity of lipid lowering for secondary prevention of CHD in patients with established atherosclerosis is controversial and is evolving. Based on additional studies published after the ATP III, some authors have proposed lower targets (LDL <70 mg/dL) for patients in the very-high-risk category: those with established CHD plus multiple major risk factors such as diabetes or severe and poorly controlled risk factors such as continued smoking, or a recent acute coronary event.\n\n【33】The LDL goal for individuals who do not have established CHD or CHD equivalents (diabetes or other vascular disease such as stroke, peripheral vascular disease, or abdominal aortic aneurysm) is based on a risk stratification process. First, the number of risk factors for CHD is counted . The absolute 10-year risk for patients with two or more risk factors may be estimated using a scoring system based on data from the Framingham heart study 删除33：<u></u>. Patients with multiple risk factors then are assigned to high risk (>20%), intermediate risk (10%-20%), or low risk (<10%). Those in the intermediate-risk category should have an LDL goal of less than 130 mg/dL, whereas the lowest-risk patients have an LDL goal of less than 160 mg/dL.\n删除4：<u>Table 46–1 • CHD RISK FACTORS</u>\n\n【34】Cigarette smoking\n\n【35】Hypertension (elevated blood pressure when seen, or patient on antihypertensives)\n\n【36】Low HDL cholesterol (<40 mg/dL)\n\n【37】Family history of premature coronary artery disease (in men <55 y or in women <65 y)\n\n【38】Age of the patient (men >45 y, women >55 y)\n\n【39】Diabetes mellitus\n\n【40】One should exclude a secondary cause of lipid disorder , either by clinical or laboratory evaluation. The most common underlying causes of dyslipidemia are hypothyroidism and diabetes mellitus . Other conditions to consider are obstructive liver disease, chronic renal failure/nephrotic syndrome, and medication side effects (progestins, anabolic steroids, corticosteroids). Very-high-cholesterol levels in young patients in the absence of secondary causes suggest familial hypercholesterolemia, a condition caused by defective or absent LDL surface receptors and subsequent inability to metabolize LDL particles. Homozygotes for this condition may develop atherosclerotic disease in childhood and usually require intensive lipid-lowering drug therapy.\n\n【41】删除3：<u>Figure 46–1. Risk stratification for coronary heart disease and LDL goals based on CHD risk factors.</u>\n\n【42】Lowering serum cholesterol levels decrease the risk of major coronary events and death in hypercholesterolemic patients without a prior history of CHD (primary prevention) , as well as reducing the overall mortality and coronary disease mortality in patients who have established cardiovascular disease (secondary prevention). All patients should first be educated regarding therapeutic lifestyle changes. These changes include a diet low in saturated fat (<7% of total daily calories) and low in cholesterol (<200 mg/d), as well as exercise, which can help to lower cholesterol.\n\n【43】When lifestyle modifications are not enough to reach the LDL goal, multiple lipid-lowering medications are available. Table 46–2 lists their effects on lipids and their potential side effects. Statins are generally very well tolerated, but the most common side effect is myopathy , which may manifest as muscle tenderness with elevated creatine kinase (CK) levels. Low-grade myalgias occur in <10% of patients, but severe myopathy is reported in 0.5% of statin-treated patients. Less commonly, elevated liver enzymes , or even severe hepatitis, have been reported. When these drugs are used, routine clinical or laboratory monitoring for these effects is advisable. After initiating statins, LDL cholesterol should be checked after 6 weeks, and every 6 to 12 months thereafter, or as the clinical situation dictates.\n删除4：<u>Table 46–2 • DRUGS FOR HYPERLIPIDEMIA</u>\n\n【44】####", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

The mother states that she will not eat anything and is obsessed with exercise and losing weight. She also states that her daughter has been more withdrawn from friends and family. After discussion with the mother, the patient comes in for a physical examination. The patient is 5 foot 1 inch tall and weighs 85 pounds. She is in no acute distress but appears to have a depressed affect. The patient states she is worried that her friends will think she is fat if she eats more. She denies any binge eating.

Although their weight is less than 30% below ideal body weight, they see themselves as overweight. Anorectics often use diuretic and laxative agents to accomplish their weight loss. Patients with bulimia, who usually induce emesis, may be at normal weight or even above ideal body weight; by contrast, anorectics are almost always under ideal body weight. Often, affected individuals become amenorrheic, have fine lanugo hair, and become hypothermic. Therapy must be multifaceted and include family and individual counseling, behavioral modification, and possibly medication.

The disorder usually occurs in young women and can result in death if the condition is not successfully treated.\n\n【23】NITROGEN BALANCE: The condition wherein the amount of nitrogen ingested (via protein) is equal to that excreted. Negative nitrogen balance is a condition wherein more nitrogen is excreted than ingested, usually during prolonged periods of calorie restriction. Positive nitrogen balance results when more nitrogen is ingested than excreted, as in growing children.\n\n【24】PYRIDOXAL PHOSPHATE: The coenzyme that is required for transaminase (aminotransferase) reactions, as well as other enzymes. It is the active form of pyridoxine (vitamin B <sub>6 </sub> ).\n\n【25】### DISCUSSION\n\n【26】Proteins are polymers of α-amino acids covalently linked via peptide bonds. α-Amino acids consist of a central (α) carbon atom to which an amino group, a carboxylic acid group, a hydrogen atom, and a side-chain group are covalently linked. Twenty different amino acids are used for protein synthesis, each of which is encoded by at least 1 codon (the 3 nucleotide genetic code) and differ only in their side-chain group. Amino acids can be divided into 2 classes, essential and nonessential amino acids. Essential amino acids cannot be synthesized by humans (unlike nonessential amino acids) and, thus, must be ingested to meet the requirements of the organism. Certain nonessential amino acids can become pseudoessential if the starting material from which they are synthesized becomes limiting (eg, methionine-derived cysteine). Amino acids are also used for the synthesis of nonprotein biomolecules (eg, nucleotides, neurotransmitters, antioxidants), as well as participating in critical whole body processes, such as interorgan nitrogen transfer and acid–base balance. Unlike carbohydrate and fatty acids, no storage form of excess amino acids exists per se. Instead, dietary amino acids in excess to the body’s synthetic needs are used as an energy source and/or converted to glycogen and lipid. During periods of insufficient nutrient ingestion (eg, starvation, anorexia nervosa), noncritical skeletal muscle and liver proteins are preferentially degraded to release utilizable amino acids, to meet both the biosynthetic and energy needs of the body 删除33：<u></u>.\n\n【27】删除3：<u>Figure 39-1. Schematic diagram showing the source and utilization of α-amino acids in metabolic processes.</u>\n\n【28】The major sites of ingested protein digestion are the stomach and the small intestine. Gastric, pancreatic, and intestinal peptidases hydrolytically cleave peptide bonds. The released amino acids, dipeptides, and tripeptides are transported into small intestinal epithelial cells, wherein dipeptides and tripeptides are further degraded to free amino acids. The latter are subsequently released into the circulation. A healthy, well-fed adult is generally in nitrogen balance. This means that the amount of nitrogen ingested (as protein) is equal to that excreted (primarily as urea). When rates of dietary amino acid incorporation into new protein exceed rates of amino acid degradation and nitrogen excretion, the individual is said to be in positive nitrogen balance. Growing children are normally in positive nitrogen balance. By contrast, an individual is said to be in negative nitrogen balance when more nitrogen is excreted than ingested. This occurs during prolonged periods of calorie restriction (eg, starvation, anorexia nervosa), when protein is degraded to release amino acids as an utilizable energy source.\n\n【29】A general tactic employed during catabolism of amino acids is the removal of the α-amino group, followed by conversion of the remaining carbon skeleton into a major metabolic intermediate. The main way in which α-amino groups are removed is through transamination, the transfer of an amino group from an α-amino acid to an α-keto acid. This transamination reaction is catalyzed by a class of enzymes called transaminases (or aminotransferases). These enzymes use pyridoxal phosphate, a vitamin B <sub>6 </sub> derivative, during the catalytic process. Pyridoxal phosphate acts as an initial acceptor of the α-amino group, forming a Schiff base (–CH = N–) intermediate. The pyridoxamine phosphate intermediate subsequently donates the amino group to an acceptor α-keto acid, forming a new α-amino acid. The acceptor α-keto acid is most often α-ketoglutarate, thus resulting in glutamate generation. Not all amino acids are substrates for transaminases. Certain amino acids are initially converted into an intermediate that is subsequently transaminated (eg, asparagine is hydrolyzed to aspartate, the latter of which is transaminated by aspartate aminotransferase, forming oxaloacetate). Given that the majority of amino acids use transaminases in their pathways of degradation (although a select few amino acids can also be directly deaminated, eg, threonine), glutamate formation increases markedly during periods of increased amino acid catabolism. Ultimately, the majority of this glutamate is oxidatively deaminated in the liver, where the released ammonium is incorporated into urea, via the urea cycle, and subsequently excreted in urine 删除33：<u></u>.\n\n【30】删除3：<u>Figure 39-2. General pathway for the degradation of amino acids showing the relationship between extrahepatic tissues and the liver, which is the site of the formation of urea.</u>\n\n【31】The carbon skeleton released during amino acid catabolism can undergo multiple fates, depending on the metabolic situation during which it was formed, the cell type within which it was generated, and the amino acid from which it is derived. For example, during periods of excess amino acid ingestion, the amino acid–derived carbon skeleton is either used as a metabolic fuel or converted to glycogen or lipid. By contrast, when rates of amino acid catabolism are increased as a result of prolonged caloric insufficiency, a large portion of the carbon skeleton is used by the liver for the synthesis of either glucose or ketone bodies, depending on the specific amino acid. Indeed, glucogenic amino acids (those amino acids whose carbon skeleton can generate net glucose through gluconeogenesis) are essential for maintenance of blood glucose levels during prolonged caloric insufficiency. Maintenance of blood glucose is also made possible by increased reliance of skeletal muscle on amino acids as a fuel source, thereby decreasing glucose utilization.\n\n【32】Certain amino acids are preferentially used in a tissue-specific manner. For example, skeletal muscle has a relatively high capacity for branched-chain amino acid (leucine, isoleucine, and valine) utilization. Following transamination, the carbon skeleton is oxidatively metabolized as an energy source during situations such as sustained exercise and caloric insufficiency. The amino group is transported in the circulation to the liver as either glutamine (formed by the enzymatic addition of an amino group to the side-chain group of glutamate) or alanine (formed by enzymatic transfer of the α-amino group from glutamate to pyruvate). Once at the liver, the transferred amino groups are ultimately used in urea synthesis, as described above 删除33：<u></u>.\n\n【33】By contrast to skeletal muscle, which is the primary site of endogenous glutamine synthesis, rapidly dividing cells (eg, lymphocytes, enterocytes) preferentially use glutamine. The reason for this is that rapidly dividing cells require both energy as well as precursors for biosynthetic reactions. The carbon skeleton of glutamine enters intermediary metabolism via α-ketoglutarate, a Krebs cycle intermediate, providing the required energy for cellular processes. In addition, the amino groups of glutamine are used in purine and pyrimidine biosynthesis, which in turn are required for the synthesis of both RNA and DNA. Indeed, lymphocyte proliferation is greatly accelerated when glutamine is used as a metabolic substrate (as opposed to glucose), leading to suggestions that glutamine deficiency may result in immunosuppression and therefore increased susceptibility to infection. An additional reason for high rates of glutamine utilization in enterocytes appears to be for the synthesis of citrulline. The latter is transported to the kidney, where it is converted to arginine. Arginine is not only important in protein synthesis but also essential in cellular signaling (via nitric oxide production) and in maintaining adequate levels of urea cycle intermediates 删除33：<u></u>.\n\n【34】删除3：<u>Figure 39-3. Schematic diagram showing the central role of glutamine as a transporter of amino acid nitrogen to various tissues.</u>\n\n【35】Glutamine also plays an important role in maintenance of whole body acid–base balance. High rates of catabolism of positively charged and sulfur-containing amino acids result in the net formation of hydrogen ions. To maintain an acid–base balance, the kidney uses glutamine as a gluconeogenic precursor, resulting in the formation of glucose, bicarbonate ion, and ammonium (NH <sub>4 </sub> +) ion formation. The bicarbonate is released into the circulation, where it associates with a proton (forming CO <sub>2 </sub> and H <sub>2 </sub> O), thereby increasing blood pH. By contrast, the ammonium ion is excreted 删除33：<u></u>.\n\n【36】As noted above, amino acids are not only used for protein synthesis but are also essential for the biosynthesis of other biomolecules. These include carnitine (a derivative of lysine), creatine (a derivative of glycine and arginine), glutathione (a derivative of glutamate, cysteine, and glycine), serotonin and melatonin (derivatives of tryptophan), dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine (derivatives of tyrosine), as well as purines and pyrimidines (requiring aspartate and glutamine for biosynthesis). Alterations in dietary intake of amino acids can influence the rates at which these macromolecules are synthesized. For example, ingestion of a tryptophan-rich meal elevates neuronal serotonin synthesis, resulting in lethargy. Tryptophan crosses the blood–brain barrier via a transporter that is also specific for the branched-chain amino acids. Conditions that influence the tryptophan-to-branched-chain amino acid ratio in the circulation have been shown to affect serotonin levels in the brain because of competition for this transporter. For example, increased skeletal muscle branched-chain amino acid catabolism during starvation is associated with an increase in the blood tryptophan-to-branched-chain amino acid ratio, increased tryptophan uptake in the brain, and increased serotonin synthesis. The latter then influences wakefulness.\n\n【37】Amino acids also play an important role in cellular signaling. The guanidino group from arginine is used in the synthesis of nitric oxide, a ubiquitous, highly reactive signaling molecule that regulates multiple physiologic processes, including blood pressure, immune response, learning, and metabolism. Much less understood is the mechanism by which leucine affects cellular signaling. This amino acid has been termed a “pseudohormone” following the observations that one or more of its early metabolites (eg, α-ketoisocaproate) are among the strongest regulators of protein turnover identified to date.\n\n【38】###", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

The disease described in this patient is acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). This condition is characterized by acute onset of myelosuppression and the presence of increased myeloblasts in the peripheral smear and bone marrow. One subtype of AML is acute promyelocytic leukemia with abnormal presence of t(15;17), which encodes for a fusion protein of the retinoic acid receptor with the promyelocytic leukemia gene. Auer rods, as shown in the image, are often present in this condition.  \nAnswer A is incorrect. In general, translocations involving chromosome 14 occur in B-cell lymphomas, as the locus for immuno-globulin production is on chromosome 14. Translocation t(8:14) is associated with Burkitt lymphoma and induces overproduction of the c-myc oncogene.  \nAnswer B is incorrect. Translocation t(9;22), also known as the Philadelphia chromosome, which encodes the Bcr-Abl fusion protein, is found in more than 90% of cases of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). If this translocation is found in an acute leukemia, it is associated with a poor prognosis. The Bcr-Abl fusion protein is a constitutively active tyrosine kinase that drives the cells to express a cancerous phenotype.  \nAnswer C is incorrect. Translocation t(11;22), found in Ewing sarcoma of bone, results in production of the EWS transcription factor, which induces the overexpression of various oncogenes such as bcl-1 .  \nAnswer D is incorrect. Translocation t(11;14) is associated with mantle cell lymphoma, a type of lymphoma with a very poor prognosis. The translocation produces increased activity of cyclin D1, which causes rapid progression of the cell cycle.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

When evaluating a patient with back pain, what are the key features in the history  删除换行1 and physical examination that would indicate serious or sinister pathology?\n\n【7】2. What is the likely diagnosis, and what additional clinical information should be  删除换行1 elicited?\n\n【8】3. Outline the next steps in managing this patient acutely in the Emergency Department.\n\n【9】DISCUSSION\n\n【10】Acute back pain is not an uncommon reason for presentation to the Emergency Department,  删除换行1 and the ability to determine if it requires urgent evaluation and possible admission to the  删除换行1 hospital is an important skill. Although the majority of such presentations represent benign  删除换行1 pathology, it is important to exclude more serious pathology such as cord or cauda equina  删除换行1 compression, infection or abscess. Features in the history warranting greater concern include  删除换行1 a prior history of cancer, recent infection or steroid use, fever, pain in the thoracic region, pain  删除换行1 that improves with rest and the presence of urinary symptoms. Similarly, ‘red flag’ examination  删除换行1 findings include gait ataxia, generalised weakness, upper motor neurone signs (clonus, hyperreflexia, extensor plantars), a palpable bladder, saddle anaesthesia and reduced anal tone.\n\n【11】In this case, the history of active cancer together with the neurologic findings point strongly  删除换行1 to a diagnosis of malignant spinal cord compression (MSCC). MSCC affects up to 5% of all  删除换行1 cancer patients and is the first manifestation of cancer in a fifth of patients. It is more common in cancers that metastasise more frequently to bone, namely prostate, breast, lung and  删除换行1 kidney; the majority of bone metastases involve the thoracic (60%) or lumbosacral spine (25%).\nThe presentation of MSCC usually involves increasing pain that is often focal, together with  删除换行1 weakness; sensory deficits are seen less frequently, whilst autonomic symptoms (i.e. bladder  删除换行1 or bowel dysfunction) occur late in the evolution of MSCC and are a poor prognostic sign.\n\n【12】In this patient, a comprehensive neurologic examination at presentation is paramount, as it  删除换行1 will serve as a baseline. It is important to document a sensory level (it appears to be around  删除换行3 T11 here so as to guide where one may anticipate abnormalities on imaging). Furthermore, it  删除换行1 is important to assess autonomic dysfunction through the history (enquiring about bladder  删除换行1 symptoms, urinary retention and incontinence) and examination (looking for saddle anaesthesia and reduced anal sphincter tone).\n\n【13】MSCC is an oncologic emergency, and most institutions have protocols that guide clinicians  删除换行1 through the investigations and immediate management when it is suspected. Firstly, radiologic confirmation is required, with the modality of choice being MRI, which carries a sensitivity of 93% and an overall diagnostic accuracy of 95%. A whole-spine MRI is required as  删除换行1 there may be several levels of compression, some of which may be clinically occult.\n\n【14】Once MSCC is suspected, the patient should receive corticosteroids with gastric protection;  删除换行1 typically, IV dexamethasone at a dose between 8 and 16 mg is administered. Further treatment usually involves radiotherapy and/or surgery, with treatment decisions based on prior  删除换行1 radiotherapy or surgery, spinal stability, ambulatory status and location of spinal disease. In  删除换行1 the rare instances of a highly chemosensitive tumour (e.g. germ cell or lymphoma), upfront  删除换行1 chemotherapy may be suitable. Regardless, intensive rehabilitation is required after definitive  删除换行1 treatment to maintain and possibly enhance neurologic recovery.\n\n【15】Key Points\n\n【16】• When evaluating patients with back pain, it is useful to look for ‘red flag’ symptoms  删除换行1 or signs, which indicate serious or sinister pathology.\n\n【17】• Spinal cord compression is an oncologic emergency and usually presents with  删除换行1 pain, weakness and sensory deficits.\n\n【18】• Assessment requires careful neurologic examination, including assessment of  删除换行1 bladder and bowel function, and imaging by way of whole-spine MRI.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

This has been ongoing and progressive over the last 10 years. He reports associated scalp symptoms of pruritus, itching, tenderness and burning. He occasionally develops large pus-filled nodules with drainage, with bacterial cultures growing Staphylococcus aureus in the past. On examination, there are scattered papules coalescing into plaques on the parietal scalp with areas of patchy, scarring alopecia, with loss of follicular ostia and increased interfollicular distance 通用删除7(英):<u>( 44 )</u>. Two 4-mm punch biopsies are performed, which demonstrates dense perifollicular inflammation in the upper portion of the hair follicles with a mixed inflammatory infiltrate consisting of lymphocytes, neutrophils and plasma cells.\n\n【4】i. What is the most likely diagnosis?\n\n【5】ii. What other forms of hair loss should be included on the differential diagnosis?\n\n【6】iii. Depending on the severity of disease, what treatment options are available?\n\n【7】Answer 44\n\n【8】i. Based on the patient’s clinical presentation and histological findings, the most likely diagnosis is folliculitis decalvans, a rare cicatricial or scarring alopecia that affects adolescents and adults. Clinically, folliculitis decalvans presents as inflammatory perifollicular papules and pustules on the scalp with associated scarring alopecia. Superinfection with S. aureus is often observed, with some authors hypothesizing a role of a primary S. aureus infection of the scalp in the pathogenesis of this disease.\n\n【9】ii. Folliculitis decalvans can appear similar to other scarring forms of hair loss, such as central centrifugal cicatricial scarring alopecia and lichen planopilaris. A skin biopsy can be helpful in distinguishing between these other forms of hair loss. Characteristic features of folliculitis decalvans include a dense perifollicular inflammatory infiltrate confined to the upper third of the follicle, a lymphocytic, neutrophilic or granulomatous inflammatory infiltrate and occasional plasma cells.\n\n【10】iii. For mild cases of folliculitis decalvans, topical clindamycin and antibacterial shampoos can be used to control the inflammation.

Occasionally he has to go to the school nurse because of headaches.

Why is this of importance to you as an anesthesiologist? What else would you like to know specific to his growth that would influence your anesthetic plan? Why does this happen? Is it more or less common for children with OSA to be underweight?\n2.  2.\n    How do the other symptoms and signs influence your plan? What is the significance of his good behavior at naptime? Are headaches common in children with OSA? Why? Why is he hypertensive and tachycardiac? What is the significance of his respiratory rate? Do you think he has “white coat hypertension” or could this be something else? Does this patient need a preoperative echocardiogram? What specifically on the echo would be worrisome or reassuring to you as an anesthesiologist? Would a preoperative ECG suffice?\n3.  3.\n    Would you premedicate this patient? What are your concerns? What are the advantages? What agent(s) would you consider? Would you modify your anesthetic technique as a result?\n\n【13】Answers\n\n【14】1.  1.\n    In contrast to the popular association of hypoventilation and airway obstruction with the Pickwickian (obesity-hypoventilation) syndrome, most pediatric sleep-disordered breathing is associated with either a normal body habitus or weight below normal, even to the point of failure to thrive. The reason for this is that often children with chronic airway obstruction are slow eaters because they are forced to chew and swallow between episodes of mouth breathing. Many will choose to avoid foods that require a lot of chewing, such as meats, and therefore they will limit their own diet. They may also have impaired taste and smell if they have substantial nasal obstruction.\n    Interestingly, following adenotonsillectomy , approximately 75% exhibit an increase in growth hormone, insulin-like growth factor 1, and significant weight gain. Comorbidities that may be associated with prolonged upper airway obstruction involve effects on the cardiovascular system such as pulmonary hypertension, systemic hypertension, morphometric facial changes (“adenoid facies”), and sleep fragmentation.\n2.  2.\n    Behavioral abnormalities typically exist on a spectrum of irritability to somnolence and are difficult to separate out from normal toddler development. The constellation of symptoms is more important, and chronic airway obstruction is often associated with parental nighttime complaints of fears that their child will stop breathing, loud snoring, gasping, choking, coughing, periods of apnea, restless sleep, and the child’s head extension in an effort to unconsciously resolve the airway obstruction. Morning or daytime headaches are a frequent complaint and may be a result of systemic hypertension, nighttime fragmented sleep, head and neck muscular pain, or various combinations. Hypertension in children may be associated with a visit to the doctor’s office, so-called white coat hypertension, but in this patient population, elevations in blood pressure, especially systolic pressure, are also associated with sleep-disordered breathing in direct relationship to the apnea-hypopnea index. Moreover, these patients may have biventricular dysfunction on echo features of left ventricular hypertrophy, pulmonary hypertension, and impaired right ventricular performance. It would not be unreasonable to seek this kind of evaluation in patients with long-standing sleep-disordered breathing because of these possibilities. An ECG may not reveal an increase in right ventricular forces but an echocardiogram might reveal findings consistent with pulmonary hypertension such as right ventricular or pulmonary hypertension, interventricular septal shifting, or stiffening.\n3.  3.\n    Premedication would depend on assessment in the preoperative period; the strategy has to take into account the concerns of the parent about the child’s behavior, the judgment of the anesthesiologist with regard to the effects of immediate preoperative stress on the cardiopulmonary system, and concerns about any abnormalities of ventilatory control being aggravated by the premedication. Benzodiazepines alone would not be likely to shift the CO <sub>2 </sub> response curve much if at all, but residual effects may very well emerge in the immediate postoperative period following inhalation anesthetics and/or opioids, so this must be kept in mind.\n\n【15】Intraoperative Course\n---------------------\n\n【16】Questions\n\n【17】1.  1.\n    Does this patient need any monitors beyond standard noninvasive monitoring ? What monitors do you have available among your standard monitors that help you evaluate the pulmonary circulation and the right heart?\n2.  2.\n    Mask vs. intravenous induction —are both acceptable? Is an intravenous induction safer? Mom insists on being present for induction—is this a good idea? As the patient enters Stage II, he develops “see-saw” breathing with phonation and profuse salivation, is moving all extremities in a flexion pattern, and seems to be struggling. What’s happening and why? His SpO <sub>2 </sub> is 94%, but in 5 seconds it goes to 88%—your next move? Choices of drugs? How and where would you deliver them? The child was given an adequate dose of intramuscular succinylcholine and atropine (40 mg and 0.4 mg), but his heart rate has slowed to 62 although you are now moving the chest with adequate ventilation. What is your next move? Should you begin CPR?\n3.  3.\n    He now has an IV. How will you plan your anesthetic at this point? Do these events influence your plan? The surgeon suggests a deep extubation because he thinks the wakeups are less problematic. Do you agree? Would you choose that strategy? Why?\n4.  4.\n    Does this patient need to go to the ICU?\n\n【18】Answers\n\n【19】1.  1.\n    No further monitoring is needed beyond standard noninvasive monitors. That said, the available standard monitors should be regarded with an additional level of interpretation to reflect possible aggravation of pulmonary hypertension and biventricular performance. Oxygen saturation will depend to some extent on pulmonary artery pressures as well as right-heart performance; blood pressure will be a reflection of this as well. Left ventricular dysfunction may also be reflected in abnormal blood pressure responses, but it will depend on the balance of chronically elevated catecholamines along with any myocardial contractility impairment, especially with propofol or higher doses of inhalation anesthetics. Because of the solubility of carbon dioxide, it is not likely that patients will exhibit significant alterations of ETCO2 as a reflection of elevated pulmonary artery pressures. ECG findings in severe circumstances might include bradycardias, right-heart strain patterns, or ectopy.\n2.  2.\n    While both are acceptable, there is no doubt that a mask induction would be easier, unless there was a pre-existing IV. That is not very likely, as this child is probably coming in from home. However, an IV induction should not be completely ruled out, because it affords a more rapid induction, bypassing the likelihood of passing through an excitement stage during an inhalation induction and allowing the rapid administration of neuromuscular blocking agents to minimize the chance of laryngospasm, which is higher in this patient population. There are also recent reports on increased safety with intravenous inductions of anesthesia. Mom can certainly be present for the induction, with careful discussion beforehand that the primary job of the anesthesiologist remains the care of the patient, and not the parent, and the use of the euphemism “falling asleep” is just that—it is, after all, a euphemism, and not really “sleep.”\n    The excitement stage during an inhalation induction is associated with the increased elaboration of endogenous catecholamines, which may be associated with all of these signs of reactivity and in addition will produce an increase in oxygen consumption and therefore carbon dioxide production. Some positive pressure in the circuit by closing the APL valve is a reasonable strategy as is the insertion of an oral airway to improve upper airway patency. Occasionally, laryngospasm can only be treated with neuromuscular blockade; a depolarizing agent such as succinylcholine can be co-administered with an anticholinergic intravenously or intramuscularly (if prior to IV insertion), or a nondepolarizing drug such as rocuronium can be used. If the heart rate continued to decrease for a few seconds following administration of neuromuscular blockade, and the chest was rising and adequate gas exchange was the result, I think I would wait a few more seconds to see if the saturation began to improve. There is a little bit of a delay in the display of the SpO <sub>2 </sub> in relation to improvement in ventilation. If the heart rate continued to decrease and there was evidence of impaired gas exchange, worsening hypoxia, and bradycardia, then CPR should be quickly initiated to augment the circulation of further resuscitation drugs and augment cardiac output and cerebral blood flow.\n3.  3.\n    Once an IV is in place, then the anesthetic planned for this patient can be continued. This may or may not include a “deep” extubation , which has the advantage of a well-anesthetized airway at the end of the case so coughing and “bucking” are avoided, but also has the disadvantage of an anesthetized unprotected airway at the end of the case. Those experienced in the technique typically have very few difficulties with either strategy; those less experienced should perfect their technique in healthy tonsillectomy patients first before using this technique in patients with significant comorbidities and a tendency to more irritable airways.\n4.  4.\n    The ICU is the appropriate perioperative destination for this patient, in accordance with typical concerns about their perioperative risk of airway obstruction and ongoing disordered breathing, especially following a general anesthetic. It is now part of the guidelines of the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery for tonsillectomy in children as well as the American Academy of Pediatrics. Children less than 3 years of age should be kept overnight in the intensive care unit.\n\n【20】Postoperative Course\n--------------------\n\n【21】Questions\n\n【22】1.  1.\n    The patient is brought to the ICU, extubated. His SpO <sub>2 </sub> on arrival, with blow-by oxygen, is 94% and he is sleepy. What are the possibilities? On auscultation, he has diffuse, moist and coarse breath sounds without wheezing. You think you can hear rales at the lung bases. Is this kind of patient at risk for post-tonsillectomy pulmonary edema? How does this happen? What is the appropriate course of action at this point? At what point will it be safe to transfer him from the ICU?\n2.  2.\n    What will you counsel the parents about with regard to his recovery course for the next few days? Over what period of time will he actually “normalize” his cardiopulmonary system alterations to chronic upper airway obstruction?\n\n【23】Answers\n\n【24】1.  1.\n    Impaired oxygenation in the immediate post-op period can have a variety of reasons—aspiration, somnolence, atelectasis, or a phenomenon well recognized with tonsillar hypertrophy: post-extubation pulmonary edema. While an abnormal chest X-ray aids the diagnosis, rales will often reveal themselves prior to radiological confirmation, as will impairment in oxygenation. Likewise, improvement in oxygenation and auscultation will be more rapid than radiological resolution of abnormalities. Appropriate intervention may simply include elevating the inspired fraction of oxygen using a non-rebreathing mask, but diuretics, CPAP, or reintubation and positive pressure ventilation may be required in severe cases. Discharge directly from the ICU after an overnight stay is possible with complete normalization in room air; otherwise, continued inpatient observation may be warranted if resolution is slower.\n2.  2.\n    There will be no “immediate” effect on snoring or respiratory control in the first few postoperative days, although there will be noticeable improvement in snoring over the first few weeks. If there is a central control component, that will improve in the first few weeks to months after surgery. Pulmonary hypertension and right-heart dysfunction will improve in most patients over weeks to months following surgery.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

However, as long as there are ways to control jaw position via the occlusion or splints, non-surgical management of the problem has proven to be a predictable and reliable way to handle these fractures.\n\n【51】When analyzed by age groups, the fractures in children 10 years or younger were judged to be intracapsular; children represent a special category when younger than age 12. The condylar neck tends to be shorter, and many fractures are thus high neck with only the condyle fractured free from the mandible. Considering their healing capabilities (e.g. regeneration of a new condylar head) 删除10：<u>(Hovinga et al. 1999 )</u>, the technical difficulty of reducing and fixing a condylar head displaced medial to the coronoid notch and the amount of soft tissue dissection required, open reduction in children younger than 12 should logically be performed infrequently.\n\n【52】Children between 12 and 18 years old still benefit from their growth potential following close reduction, but have fractures similar to adults (i.e. more low necks/ramus due to the mandibular reaching adult shape). Thus open reduction with rigid fixation and immediate function is a strong option in this age range.\n\n【53】12.2 Ankylosis\n--------------\n\n【54】Although TMJ ankylosis is one of the most common pathologies affecting the facial skeleton, it is also the most overlooked and under-managed problem in children. Ankylosis leads to reduced mandibular opening, from partial reduction to complete restriction.\n\n【55】Ankylosis in growing children affects the growth and development of the jaws and occlusion.\n\n【56】It can be defined as “inability to open the mouth due to either a fibers or bony union between the head of the condyle and the glenoid fossae” 删除10：<u>(Shashikiran et al. 2005 )</u>.\n\n【57】Ankylosis is most commonly associated with trauma, local or systemic infection or systemic disease. The onset of incidence frequently believed to be before the age of 10.\n\n【58】Clinical features of TMJ ankylosis in childhood are:\n\n【59】   Restricted mouth opening and its associated results including poor oral hygiene and rampant caries\n   Facial asymmetry\n   Mandibular macrognathia and bird face deformity\n   Class II malocclusion with posterior crossbite/anterior open bite\n\n【60】TMJ ankylosis occurring in childhood can impair mandibular growth and function, which may later produce severe facial asymmetry and mandibular retrusion. Early diagnosis of TMJ ankylosis is important, and early surgical intervention is an accepted mode of treatment 删除10：<u>(Chidzonga 1999 )</u>. Surgery is indicated to restore mandibular opening. Early and aggressive postoperative opening of the mandible is necessary to maintain good opening.\n\n【61】The treatment of TMJ ankylosis faces a significant challenge because of technical difficulty and a high incidence of recurrence.\n\n【62】Recurrence is a major problem that occurs after the release of TMJ ankylosis.\n\n【63】At present the surgical procedures most frequently used for treatment of ankylosis are:\n\n【64】1.  1.\n    Gap arthroplasty, in which a joint space is recreated either at the side of the pre-existing space or below it; in this case no substance is interposed between the recreated bony surfaces.\n2.  2.\n    Interpositional arthroplasty, which also recreates a joint space but, in addition, an autogenous temporalis muscle flap or alloplastic material, is introduced into the gap 删除10：<u>(Brusati et al. 1990 )</u>.\n\n【65】Case 2\n\n【66】A 3-year-old child reported with the complaint of inability to open his mouth wide, deflexion of the mandible to the left and facial asymmetry 删除33：<u></u>.

The use of the appliance after offers comfort while haematomas are resolving and tissues are recovering. Furthermore, it provides stimulation to the muscles and favours the removal of metabolites resulting from the muscle spasms and help the mandible to keep its normal position.\n\n【106】Early stimulation and control of muscular activity is an important key in treatment; the mobilization of tissues within and around the joint frees restraints of fibrotic capsule components, and the lateral eminences increase disc mobility, reducing load concentrations. In this way we improve condylar remodelling, favour restoration of a proper function of the masticatory system and prevent mechanical restrictions originated by scarring and loss of motion.\n\n【107】In my experience, results with functional appliance therapy are more effective than those obtained with traditional physiotherapeutic exercises which are more difficult to perform for children. Such treatment is indicated not only during healing but also during the following years (at least 2) when bone regeneration and compensatory growth are to occur. In this case both the child and his parents were provided comprehensive psychological assistance before, during and after the surgical intervention. The parents were similarly motivated and encouraged to prepare their child for surgery.\n\n【108】删除3：<u>Fig. 12.39\n\n【109】Panoramic X-Ray after surgery</u>\n\n【110】删除3：<u>Fig. 12.40</u>\n\n【111】Idem.

The Mental Capacity Act 2005  删除换行1 emphasises the need for facilitation and enhancement of capacity, and covert medication  删除换行1 might be seen to help achieve those objectives. Neither the Royal College of Psychiatrists  删除换行1 nor the Nursing and Midwifery Council rules out covert medication as an option. Mental  删除换行5 Welfare Commission for Scotland has also drawn up specific criteria for the administration  删除换行1 of covert medication.\n\n【9】The Royal College of Psychiatrists statement on covert administration of medicines recognises that there are times when severely incapacitated patients can neither consent nor  删除换行1 refuse treatment. In these circumstances, treatment should be made available according to  删除换行1 the patient’s best interests and administered in the least restrictive fashion, which may, in  删除换行1 exceptional situations, require administration of medicines within food without the patient’s  删除换行1 awareness of this being done.\n\n【10】Ethical issues\n\n【11】Administering covert medication to patients who have the capacity to make healthcare  删除换行1 decisions fails to respect their autonomy. It deprives them of the ability to decide whether  删除换行1 or not to take the medication and is unjustifiably paternalistic. Although Doris is no doubt  删除换行1 calmer and happier with the medication, the issue of whether she has capacity to make this  删除换行1 particular decision regarding medication needs to be further explored. The fact that Doris is  删除换行1 unaware that she is taking risperidone inevitably compromises the assessment of her capacity because the purpose, relative benefits and harms of either taking medication or refusing  删除换行1 it cannot be explored adequately. To assess her capacity properly necessitates disclosure that  删除换行1 she is already taking risperidone.\n\n【12】The benefits of disclosing include the following:\n\n【13】• Maximising autonomy. Healthcare professionals have a duty to empower patients to  删除换行1 make informed decisions about their care.\n\n【14】• Continuing with covert medication may be denying Doris the opportunity for better  删除换行1 treatment after re-assessment by a mental health specialist.\n\n【15】• The side effects of medication could be monitored better.\n\n【16】• Continuing with covert medication may compromise her relationship with professionals in the future if she were to discover that she was being given medication  删除换行1 without her knowledge.\n\n【17】The harms of disclosing include the following:\n\n【18】• Disclosure may lead to refusal of medication with detrimental consequences to \n\n【19】Doris’s mental state and possible risk of harm to others.\n\n【20】• Disclosure would potentially put the medical practice and care home in conflict  删除换行1 with services and lead to distrust by the families of other residents.\n\n【21】• The upset and disruption of a situation that is being managed at present, albeit  删除换行1 imperfectly.

His pulse rate is  删除换行1 110/min, blood pressure 115/63 mmHg. He has marked abdominal tenderness with  删除换行1 rebound and guarding; his bowel sounds are reduced. There is a mild and cool effusion  删除换行1 of his right knee, which is extremely tender. The rest of his examination is normal.\n\n【5】Questions\n\n【6】• What diagnosis might explain recurrent abdominal pain, pleurisy and fever?\n\n【7】• How would you investigate this patient?\n\n【8】• What is the feared complication of the underlying diagnosis?\n\n【9】• How would you treat this patient?\n\n【10】ANSWER 65\n\n【11】The admitting senior house officer decided to refer this adolescent to the surgical team as  删除换行1 an acute abdomen. Although the SHO made the right decision to admit under the surgical  删除换行1 team, it is worth keeping an open mind to the diagnosis in view of its recurrent nature  删除换行1 and family history. The combination of recurrent serositis (peritonitis and pleuritis), fever  删除换行1 and eastern Mediterranean origin raises the possibility of familial Mediterranean fever  删除换行1 (FMF) as the underlying diagnosis.\n\n【12】FMF is an autosomal recessively inherited periodic syndrome characterized by stereotyped attacks of fever and inflammatory features which last up to 4 days and then remit  删除换行1 spontaneously. The most common manifestations are:\n\n【13】• fever\n\n【14】• peritonitis\n\n【15】• arthritis\n\n【16】• pleuritis\n\n【17】• rash (erysipelas-like).\n\n【18】The arthritis is classically monoarticular and symptoms often outweigh the signs, with  删除换行1 extreme tenderness despite only mild effusions and a marked absence of increased  删除换行1 temperature.\n\n【19】This patient should still be investigated for acute abdomen with blood tests including  删除换行1 inflammatory markers, amylase and lactate and imaging in the form of an abdominal and  删除换行1 erect chest X-ray. Patients in whom one suspects FMF should be referred to a specialist  删除换行1 centre for genetic testing.\n\n【20】One of the feared complications of FMF is the development of amyloidosis. Amyloidosis  删除换行1 is a multisystem disease caused by the deposition of insoluble protein in the extracellular  删除换行1 matrix: renal, cardiac and hepatic tissues are commonly affected. Primary amyloid (AL) is  删除换行1 formed from deposition of immunoglobulin light chains and occurs in isolation or in the  删除换行1 context of myeloma. Secondary or reactive amyloid (AA) is caused by the deposition of  删除换行1 amyloid A rather than light chains and may complicate any chronic infective, malignant  删除换行1 or inflammatory process such as FMF.\n\n【21】Colchicine is the treatment of choice. It is not only very effective at diminishing the  删除换行1 attacks of serositis in FMF, but has also been shown to reduce the development of renal  删除换行1 amyloidosis in these patients by up to two-thirds.\n\n【22】KEY POINTS\n\n【23】• Consider a periodic syndrome in anyone presenting with recurrent serositis and fever.\n\n【24】• The arthritis in FMF often generates a greater level of pain than one would expect from  删除换行1 the clinical signs.\n\n【25】删除29：<u>Rheumatology\n\n【26】</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

E： Treatment will be required\n\n【27】The history of contact with TB， along with the positive Mantoux test， makes the possibility of TB infection very likely. Despite the normal chest radiograph， it is possible that this child has active TB. The most useful investigation would be to send gastric washings on 3 consecutive mornings for microscopy for acid and alkaline fast bacilli (AAFB) and a culture of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis， in order to confirm a microbiological diagnosis of TB infection.\n\n【28】The key point in this case is to differentiate between latent and active TB infection， as this will determine the type and duration of treatment given. The UK NICE guidelines on the treatment of TB published in 2011 suggest that children aged between 4 weeks and 2 years who have been in close contact with smear-positive pulmonary TB should have a Mantoux test or tuberculin skin test (TST) 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u>.\n\n【29】Table 2.1： Interpretation of TST reaction\n\n| Induration of >5 mm is considered positive in：  | Induration of >10 mm isconsidered positive in：  | nduration of >15 mm isconsidered positive in：  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| HIV-infected individuals A recent contact of an indi-vidual with TB disease Individuals with fibrotic changes on chest radiographconsistent with previous TB infection Patients who have under-gone organ transplants Individuals who are immuno-suppressed for other reasons(e.g. taking the equivalent of>15 mg/day of prednisone for1 month or longer， or takingTNF-a antagonists)  | Recent immigrants (<5 years) from high-prevalencecountries Intravenous drug users Residents and employees ofhigh-risk congregate set-tings， e.g. detention facili-ties/refugee camps Mycobacteriology laboratorypersonnel Individuals with clinical con-ditions that place them at high risk Children <4 years of age Infants， children， and adoles-cents exposed to adults inhigh-risk categories  | Any individual， includingpersons with no known riskfactors for TB， includingthose with previous BCG vaccination  |\n\n【31】Fa ositive TSTs can result from contact with nontuberculous mycobacteria or vaccination with BCG，because the TST test material contains antigens that are also in BCG and certain nontuberculous mycobacteria. False positive results may also be due to the incorrect administration of TST or an incorrect interpretation of the test.\n\n【32】False negative results can also occur due to the following reasons：\n\n【33】Cutaneous anergy (the inability to react to skin tests because of a weakened immune system)\n\n【34】Recent TB infection (within 8-10 weeks of exposure) Very old TB infection Very young age (less than 6 months old) Recent (less than 4 weeks) live-virus vaccination (e.g.measles) Overwhelming TB disease Some viral illnesses (e.g. measles and chicken pox) Incorrect method of TST administration Incorrect interpretation of the reaction，insufficient dose and inadvertent subcutaneous injection 删除换行1 the TST is positive， the child should be assessed for an active TB infection. For a child who has previously received a BCG vaccination and has a TST result of less than 15 mm， the test should be repeated after 6 weeks， together with an IGRA.\n\n【35】Gastric washings are based on the premise that young children are generally unable to expectorate， nstead swallowing sputum into the stomach. Early morning gastric washings taken prior to the child eating or drinking， from a nasogastric tube already in situ， enable swallowed sputum to be sampled.In children with pulmonary TB， gastric lavage is more sensitive than bronchoalveolar lavage for the isolation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis， so bronchoalveolar lavage is a less appropriate option 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u>.\n\n【36】A.CT scan of the chest may be a useful investigation to determine the nature and extent of lung disease， view of the history of prolonged cough with a normal chest x-ray. A chest x-ray has low sensitivity and specificity in the diagnosis of TB， as its interpretation is very subjective； thoracic CT may identify hilar or mediastinal adenopathy in children with a positive TST and a normal chest X ray 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u>. However， a detailed radiological assessment of TB is less helpful than a microbiological diagnosis in this case.\n\n【37】Galactomannan is a polysaccharide component of the cell wall of the aspergillus species and other fungi. The galactomannan assay is an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and is used as a non-invasive test to screen for invasive aspergillus. It is has no role in the diagnosis of a suspected TB infection.\n\n【38】GRAs detect sensitisation to Mycobacterium tuberculosis by measuring interferon gamma (IFN-y) release an response to antigens representing Mycobacterium tuberculosis. IGRAs cannot distinguish between atent infection and active TB disease， and should not be used for diagnosis of active TB， (which is a microbiological diagnosis). A positive IGRA result may not necessarily indicate active TB and a negative GRA result may not rule out active TB 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u>.\n\n【39】IGRAs are not affected by the BCG vaccination status， and are therefore useful for the evaluation of a latent TB infection in BCG-vaccinated individuals. IGRAs also appear to be unaffected by most infections with environmental nontuberculous mycobacteria， which can cause false-positive TSTs， with the exception of Mycobacterium marinum， Mycobacterium kansasii， Mycobacterium szulgai， and Mycobacterium flavescens 通用删除7(英):<u>(5)</u>.\n\n【40】At best， BCG provides 70-80% protection to children in developed countries and significantly less to those in developing countries.

The jugular venous distention， distant heart sounds， and pulsus paradoxus all are suggestive of cardiac tamponade. The major diagnostic considerations in this case， each with very different treatment， are pericardial effusion causing cardiac tamponade，con-strictive pericarditis， and restrictive cardiomyopathy. All of these conditions can impede diastolic filling of the heart and lead to cardiovascular compromise. Urgent differentiation among these conditions is required because the treatment is very different， and the consequences of mistreating these diseases can be immediately fatal. Clinically， the patient’s fall in systolic blood pressure with inspiration (pulsus paradoxus) is suggestive of cardiac tamponade， which would be treated with evacu-ation of the pericardial fluid via pericardiocentesis.\n\n【21】APPROACH TO：Cardiac Tamponade\n\n【22】DEFINITIONS\n\n【23】CARDIAC TAMPONADE： Increased pressure within the pericardial space caused by an accumulating effusion， which compresses the heart and impedes diastolic filling.\n\n【24】PERICARDIAL EFFUSION： Fluid that fills the pericardial space， which may be due to infection， hemorrhage， or malignancy. A rapidly accumulating effusion may lead to cardiac compromise.\n\n【25】CLINICAL APPROACH\n\n【26】Pathophysiology\n\n【27】Cardiac tamponade refers to increased pressure within the pericardial space caused by an accumulating effusion， which compresses the heart and impedes diastolic filling. Because the heart can only pump out during systole what it receives during diastole， severe restriction of diastolic filling leads to a marked decrease in cardiac output， culminating in hypotension， cardiovascular collapse， and death. If pericar-dial fluid accumulates slowly， the sac may dilate and hold up to 2000 mL (produc-ing notable cardiomegaly on chest x-ray) before causing diastolic impairment， If the fluid accumulates rapidly， as in a hemopericardium caused by trauma or surgery， as little as 200 mL can produce tamponade.\n\n【28】Clinical Presentation\n\n【29】The classic description of Beck’s triad (hypotension， elevated jugular venous pres-sure， and small， quiet heart) is a description of acute tamponade with rapid accu-mulation of fluid， as in the cases of cardiac trauma or ventricular rupture. If the fluid accumulates slowly， the clinical picture may look more like heart failure， with cardiomegaly on chest x-ray (although there should be no pulmonary edema)， dys-pnea， elevated jugular pressure， hepatomegaly， and peripheral edema. A high index of suspicion is required： Cardiac tamponade should be considered in any patient with hypotension and elevated jugular venous pressure.\n\n【30】The most important physical sign to look for in cardiac tamponade is pulsus para-doxus. This refers to a drop in systolic blood pressure of more than 10 mm Hg during inspiration. Although called\"paradoxical， this drop in systolic blood pressure is not contrary to the normal physiologic variation with respiration； it is an exaggeration of the normal small drop in systolic pressure during inspiration. Although not a specific sign of tamponade (ie， it is often seen in patients with disturbed intratho-racic pressures during respiration， eg， those with obstructive lung disease)， pulsus paradoxus is fairly sensitive for hemodynamically significant tamponade.\n\n【31】To test for this， one must use a manual blood pressure cuff that is inflated above systolic pressure and deflated very slowly until the first Korotkoff sound is heard during expiration and then， finally， during both phases of respiration.\n\n【32】The difference between these two pressure readings is the pulsus paradoxus. When the pulsus paradoxus is severe， it may be detected by palpation as a diminution or disappearance of peripheral pulses during inspiration.\n\n【33】Treatment\n\n【34】Acute treatment of cardiac tamponade consists of relief of the pericardial pres-sure， by either percutaneous pericardiocentesis (possibly echocardiographically guided) or a surgical approach. The choice between percutaneous versus surgi-cal effusion relief is dependent on clinical and institutional expertise. Resection of the diseased pericardium is the definitive treatment of constrictive pericardi-tis. There is no effective treatment for restrictive cardiomyopathy. Any patient with evidence of cardiovascular compromise (ie， cardiac tamponade) should have immediate drainage of effusion in the pericardium. If there is no evidence of hemodynamic collapse， then urgent drainage is not necessary. Patients with large effusions who are hemodynamically stable may require close monitoring， serial echocardiography， and careful volume status regulation with management directed to treat the underlying cause of the effusion. Beyond its described thera-peutic benefit， pericardiocentesis can offer diagnostic value when the presumed etiology cannot be established.\n\n【35】Complications\n\n【36】Constrictive pericarditis is a complication of a prior episode of acute or chronic fibrinous pericarditis. The inflammation with resultant granulation tissue forms a thickened fibrotic adherent sac that gradually contracts， encasing the heart and impairing diastolic filling. In the past， tuberculosis was the most common cause of this problem， but now that is a rare cause in the United States. Currently， this is most commonly caused by radiation therapy， cardiac surgery， or any cause of acute pericarditis， such as viral infection， uremia， or malignancy. The pathophysiology of constrictive pericarditis is similar to that of cardiac tamponade in the restricted ability of the ventricles to fill during diastole because of the thickened noncompli-ant pericardium.\n\n【37】Because the process is chronic， patients with constrictive pericarditis gener-ally do not present with acute hemodynamic collapse but rather with chronic and slowly progressive weakness， fatigue， and exertional dyspnea. Patients commonly have what appears to be right-sided heart failure， that is， chronic lower extrem-ity edema， hepatomegaly， and ascites. Like patients with tamponade， they have elevated jugular venous pressures， but pulsus paradoxus usually is absent. Exami-nation of neck veins shows an increase in jugular venous pressure during inspira-tion， termed the Kussmaul sign. This is easy to see because it is the opposite of the normal fall in pressure as a person inspires. Normally， the negative intratho-racic pressure generated by inspiration increases blood flow into the heart， but because of the severe diastolic restriction， the blood cannot enter the right atrium or ventricle， so it fills the jugular vein. Another physical finding characteristic of constrictive pericarditis is a pericardial knock， which is a high-pitched， early dia-stolic sound occurring just after aortic valve closure. Chest radiography frequently shows cardiomegaly and a calcified pericardium. Table 11-1 compares features of\n\n| Table 11-1·FEATURES OF CARDIAC TAMPONADE， ACUTE PERICARDITIS，  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| RESTRICTIVE CARDIOMYOPATHY， AND CONSTRICTIVE PERICARDITIS  |  |  |  |  |\n| Disease  | Pathophysiology  | Clinical Features  | ECG Findings  |  |\n| Cardiac tamponade  | Increased pressure inpericardial space dueto effusion， impedingdiastolic filling  | Pulsus paradoxus，hypotension， elevatedjugular venous disten-tion， small quiet heart  | Low voltage diffusely，electrical alternans  |  |\n| Constrictivepericarditis  | Inflammation andgranulation tissueforms a thickened fibrotic adherent sac，commonly caused byradiation， viral infec- tion， uremia  | Absent pulsus paradoxus， Kussmaulsign， pericardial knock， chronic andslow progressive weakness，and exer-tional dyspnea  | Low voltage  |  |\n| Acute pericarditis  | Acute inflammationof the parietal pericar-dium and superficialmyocardium  | Chest pain， fever， peri-cardial rub  | ST-segment elevation，low voltage diffusely  |  |\n| Restrictive cardiomyopathy  | Myocardial fibrosis，hypertrophy，orinfiltration leadingto impaired diastolicfilling  | No pulsus paradoxusor Kussmaul sign； progressive exertionaldyspnea and depen-dent edema  |  |  |\n\n【39】cardiac tamponade， acute pericarditis， restrictive cardiomyopathy， and constrictive pericarditis.\n\n【40】Restrictive cardiomyopathy， like the previous diagnoses， is primarily a problem of impaired diastolic filling， usually with preserved systolic function. This is a rela-tively uncommon problem in the Western world. The most common causes are amy-loidosis， an infiltrative disease of the elderly， in which an abnormal fibrillar amyloid protein is deposited in heart muscle， or fibrosis of the myocardium following radia-tion therapy or open-heart surgery. In Africa， restrictive cardiomyopathy is much more common because of a process called endomyocardial fibrosis， characterized by fibrosis of the endocardium along with fever and marked eosinophilia， accounting for up to 25% of deaths due to heart disease.\n\n【41】Clinically， it may be very difficult to distinguish restrictive cardiomyopathy from constrictive pericarditis， and various echocardiographic criteria have been pro-posed to try to distinguish between them. In addition， magnetic resonance imag-ing (MRI) can be very useful to visualize or exclude the presence of the thickened pericardium typical of constrictive pericarditis and absence in restrictive cardiomy-opathy. Kussmaul sign can be seen in both restrictive cardiomyopathy and constric-tive pericarditis. Nevertheless， it may be necessary to obtain an endomyocardial biopsy to make the diagnosis. Differentiation between the two is essential because constrictive pericarditis is a potentially curable disease， whereas very little effective therapy is available for either the underlying conditions or the cardiac failure of restrictive cardiomyopathy.\n删除16：<u>CASE CORRELATION\n\n【42】● See also Case 3 (Acute Coronary Syndrome)， Case 4 (Heart Failure Due to Critical Aortic Stenosis)， Case 8 (Atrial Fibrillation/Mitral Stenosis)， and Case 10 (Acute Pericarditis Caused by Systemic Lupus Erythematosus).\n</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

The roommate states that she has not been taking her depression medications and has been overwhelmed by the upcoming final examinations. The roommate bought the bottle of aspirin earlier that morning. In the emergency center， the patient is lethargic and confused with a low-grade fever and is hyperventilating. Her urine drug screen is negative， but the arte-rial blood gases reveal an anion gap metabolic acidosis， probably as a result of the aspirin overdose.\n\n【1】What is the anion gap and what is its significance?\n\n【2】What effect does metabolic acidosis have on the respiratory system?\n\n【3】What chemoreceptors are involved in the response to an acid-base disturbance?\n\n【4】Are the lung stretch receptors fast- or slow-acting reflexes?\n\n【5】ANSWERS TO CASE 20： CONTROL OF BREATHING\n\n【6】Summary： A 19-year-old college student with a history of depression presents to the emergency center with salicylate poisoning and an anion gap acidosis.\n\n【7】Significance of the anion gap： Anion gap=\\[Na\\\\]-(\\[Cl-\\]+\\[HCO，\\]). An increase in the rate of production (eg， lactic acid or ketoacids) or ingestion of noncarbonic acids or substances that increase lactic acid or ketoacid production will cause a decrease in the plasma concentration of bicarbonate. The anion gap helps identify the type of acidosis and estimate the magnitude of the acid load to the system.\n\n【8】Effect of metabolic acidosis on the respiratory system： Increases ventilation to lower the arterial \\[CO，\\] to compensate for the fall in plasma pH.\n\n【9】Chemoreceptors involved in response to an acid-base disturbance：Two groups of chemoreceptors respond to a metabolic acidosis：\n\n【10】1L.Peripheral chemoreceptors located in the carotid bodies detect changes in arterial \\[H\\\\]， \\[CO，\\]， and \\[O，\\].\n\n【11】2\\.

A thorough history and physical examination often will reveal clues necessary to make the diagnosis. In this case， the history of depression with stressful final examinations coming up and an empty bottle of recently purchased aspirin make one think of the possibility of salicylate poi-soning. Salicylate poisoning may cause clinical symptoms of vomiting， sweat-ing， tachycardia， fever， lethargy confusion， coma， seizures， cardiovascular collapse， and possibly pulmonary or cerebral edema. Salicylate ingestion can cause a multitude of effects， depending on the magnitude of the ingestion. A complication is that salicylates can alter metabolic processes， causing an increase in lactic acid production， and directly stimulate central respiratory centers， causing hyperventilation and a fall in arterial PCO，. Symptoms usu-ally occur 3 to 6 hours after an overdose. Abnormal laboratory findings may include anion gap metabolic acidosis， hypokalemia， hypoglycemia， and a positive urine ferric chloride test. Other agents are also possible， including acetamino-phen， alcohol， and illicit drugs. Treatment of salicylate toxicity includes activated charcoal to decontaminate the stomach (possibly gastric lavage)， correction of 删除换行1 electrolyte abnormalities， supportive care with intravenous (IV) fluids， and alkalization of urine (promotes excretion of salicylates). Elevated levels of sal-icylates increase the sensitivity of the respiratory center in the brain. The meta-bolic acidosis results in hyperventilation and a compensatory respiratory alkalosis.\n\n【15】APPROACHTO CONTROL OF BREATHING\n\n【16】Objectives 删除换行1 1Know the central and peripheral centers for control of breathing.\nDescribe the different types of chemoreceptors.\n\n【17】Know the different types of receptors (lung stretch， irritant， etc.).\n\n【18】Definitions\n\n【19】Respiratory center： Located in the reticular formation of the medulla it is responsible for maintaining a rhythmical cycle of breathing and inte-grating neural input from a variety of receptors (e.g. central and periph-eral chemoreceptors) to adjust the rate and depth of breathing in response to perturbations in environmental or physical conditions.\n\n【20】Central chemoreceptors： Located in the ventrolateral surface of the medulla directly respond to a change in the pH of the CSF， however， since the blood brain barrier is impermeable to either H+ or HCO-，these receptors detect changes in the arterial PCO.\n\n【21】Peripheral chemoreceptors： Located on the carotid and aortic bodies these receptors respond directly to changes in the arterial pH， PCO。and PO·\n\n【22】CO，/HCO， buffering system： The central buffering system in the body for maintaining H+ homeostasis. The importance of this buffering sys-tem is the ability to control the arterial PCO， by pulmonary function and\\[HCO，\\] through renallfunction 1 to compensate for acid-base disturbances.\n\n【23】DISCUSSION\n\n【24】The pH of the arterial blood is normally 7.4 and is dependent mainly on the CO， / HCO， buffering system in the blood：\n\n【25】The control of the pH， or hydrogen ion homeostasis is dependent on an interaction of the respiratory control of arterial PCO， and renal control of arterial HCO， and H\\excretion. Acid-base disturbances are generally iden-tified as being of respiratory or metabolic origin. Respiratory acid-base dis-orders are a consequence of a respiratory disturbance that results in a change 删除换行1 in the arterial PCO，. Until the disturbance is corrected， renal function will compensate the disruption. Metabolic disturbances are the consequence of a change in the arterial pH caused by initial changes in \\[H\\\\] or \\[HCO，\\]. The respiratory system serves to compensate for metabolic disturbances. The respiratory system is finely tuned to and highly sensitive to changes in CO， and H\\. The O， concentration is an important regulator， but has a minimal role until the arterial PO， falls to less than 55 to 60 mm Hg. Acid-base disturbances have immediate effects on respiration caused by specific chemoreceptors that are sensitive to changes in CO。Ht， and O，.\n\n【26】This case involves a metabolic acidosis caused by the ingestion of an acidic substance. The respiratory system can compensate for this disturbance only by controlling the CO， concentration and shifting the equilibrium of the CO，/HCO， buffering system and maintaining hydrogen ion homeostasis. Acid-base balance is markedly disturbed， as indicated by the anion gap. Acid-base balance can be restored only by renal excretion of the acid and reabsorption of HCO， 删除25：<u></u>.\n\n【27】Respiration is spontaneously and rhythmically initiated by the respira- 删除换行1 tory center located in the reticular formation of the medulla. Neural sig-naling to the inspiratory and expiratory muscle groups maintains the cycle of breathing. Numerous mechanisms are capable of modifying the signal to alter the frequency and depth of breathing in response to voluntary stimuli， reflexes and other neural stimuli， and a variety of chemical or mechanical stimuli. Acid-base disturbances are characteristically identified by their effects on plasma pH， PCO。 and \\[HCO\\] Chemoreceptors located centrally and in the periphery respond to changes in arterial pH and PCO， with input to the respi-ratory center that causes compensatory changes in breathing. Peripheral chemoreceptors are located in the carotid bodies and the aortic bodies and detect changes in pH， O。 and to a lesser extent PCO，. Under normal condi-tions， O， has little role in the control of ventilation. However， under hypoxic conditions in which the PO， begins to approach 50 mm Hg or lower，O， stim-ulates ventilation directly and increases sensitivity to Ht and CO，. Impulses from the peripheral chemoreceptors are carried by the glossopharyngeal nerve to the respiratory center. Stimulation of the peripheral chemoreceptors causes an increase in ventilatory rate. Central chemoreceptors located on the medulla are separated from the blood by the blood-brain barrier. These recep-tors are bathed by the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)， which is essentially a pure bicarbonate buffer. Because the blood-brain barrier is impermeable to H+ and HCO， but freely permeable to Co。 a change in the arterial CO， will cause a change in the CSF CO， with a concomitant change in the CSF pH. Thus， although directly sensing a change in CSF pH， central chemoreceptors respond to changes in the arterial PCO，. A fall in the arterial PCO， (hypocapnia) will increase the CSF pH and slow respiration. An increase in the arterial PCO，(hypercapnia) will decrease the CSF pH and stimulate respiration.\n\n【28】Physiologically， a metabolic acidosis or an initial decrease in pH (an increase in H\\) stimulates the peripheral chemoreceptors， resulting in hyperventilation. The hyperventilation leads to a compensatory fall in PCO，. Normally， the magnitude of the hyperventilation is limited and controlled by a negative feedback from the central chemoreceptors， which detect only a decrease in PCO，. This important control mechanism serves to dampen the respiratory response to an acid-base disturbance. In the present case of sali-cylate intoxication， there also may be a direct stimulation of the respiratory center that will cause a further increase in the respiratory rate with a result-ant respiratory alkalosis (hypocapnia) superimposed on the metabolic acidosis. This example emphasizes the importance of the interactions between the central and peripheral chemoreceptors. A metabolic alkalosis will have exactly the opposite response. The peripheral chemoreceptors respond to an increased pH (a fall in H+) by slowing ventilation with a compensatory rise in PCO. The rise in arterial PCO， is sensed by central chemoreceptors， which respond with an increase in the ventilatory rate to dampen the response. In dis-orders in which one or the other chemoreceptor is blocked or nonfunctional， severe aberrations in breathing patterns are observed.\n\n【29】In addition to the chemoreceptors outlined above， there are three receptor groups that are located in the lungs. J-receptors (juxtapulmonary capillary receptors) are located in the interstitium near alveoli and blood capillaries. Increasing pressure in the interstitium by edema or capillary engorgement stimulates J-receptors， causing bronchoconstriction and tachypnea. Irritant receptors are located in the airways between epithelial cells. They are located in such a way that they have immediate contact with inhaled air and are stim-ulated by cigarette smoke， dust， fumes， and cold air. Stimulation of irritant receptors leads to bronchoconstriction， hyperpnea， coughing， and sneezing. Pulmonary stretch receptors are located in airway smooth muscle and are stimulated by distention of the lung and serve to protect the lungs against being overinflated.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

A physical examination reveals an enlarged liver and jaundice. Laboratory analysis reveals an elevated blood galactitol level and increased urinary reducing substance. Which of the following could correctly describe the levels of intermediates of galactose metabolism in this patient?\n\n【1】> (A) Decreased galactose\n\n【2】> (B) Decreased uridine diphosphoglucose\n\n【3】> (C) Elevated glucose-1-phosphate\n\n【4】> (D) Increased galactose-1-phosphate\n\n【5】> (E) Increased glycogen\n\n【6】 Answer: The correct answer is D . Elevated galactitol levels is the cause of clinical symptoms in patients with galactosemia. Galactose is converted in two steps to glucose-1-phosphate. The first step is catalyzed by the enzyme galactokinase, which phosphorylates galactose to galactose-1-phosphate. The second step is catalyzed by galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase (G1PUR), which converts galactose-1-phosphate to glucose-1-phosphate. In the absence of G1PUR, upstream intermediates in galactose metabolism accumulate, including galactose-1-phosphate and galactitol. A deficiency in enzymes involved in other aspects of galactose metabolism leads to a much milder presentation (ie, only infantile cataracts). Although treatment is not available, prevention of disease progression involves excluding galactose-containing foods from the diet, including breast milk and lactose-containing formulas.  \nAnswer A is incorrect . Galactose is upstream from G1PUR and ts levels would be elevated.  \nAnswer B is incorrect . Classic galactosemia is caused by a deficiency of this uridyltransferase and would theoretically lead to a build up of galactose-1-phosphate, uridine diphosphoglucose, and galactose, and decreased glucose-1-phosphate.  \nAnswer C is incorrect . Glucose-1-phosphate is a downstream product of G1PUR, and would be decreased in galactosemia.  \nAnswer E is incorrect . Glucose-1-phosphate is an intermediate in glycogen pathways.

{"seq_id": "395866ae-1585-4cbc-80ec-1e55a4ee95fb", "title": null, "text": "【0】##### Ethical issues\n\n【1】The present indications for psychosurgery, although exceptional, have not entirely disappeared. In 2001, a prominent specialist stated:\n\n【2】> “However, despite the plethora of pharmacological agents that are available today, there remains a small but significant proportion of patients who suffer horribly from severe, disabling, intractable psychiatric illness. It is in these patients that surgery might still be appropriate if intervention is safe, reasonably effective, and without significant morbidity.”\nThe main ethical issues connected to these interventions involve the scientific validity of the therapy and its evaluation, the validity of patient consent, and the possibility of conflict between the interests of the patient and those of society – particularly in the case of dangerous or violent individuals.\n\n【3】Accordingly, many questions remain to be answered. What are the indications? How are these techniques being evaluated and researched? What are the limits of informed consent? Are patients able to consent who have, in essence, lost a significant aspect of their freedom of judgment?\n\n【4】###### Current indications\n\n【5】A primary indication for psychosurgery is obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Treatment-refractory OCD is both tormenting and disabling. About 70% of psychosurgical procedures are currently performed for OCD, with notable objective improvement. Patient consent is not usually an issue, since patients are frequently aware of their disability, competent, and eager to pursue treatment.\n\n【6】Other possible indications include severe depression refractory to extreme pharmacologic therapy and sismotherapy (ECT), selected affective disorders such as treatment-refractory schizophrenic psychosis, and selected cases of aggressiveness to self or others.\n\n【7】In practical terms, pre-surgical evaluation to enable medical selection of patients applies solely to patients suffering from OCD. Selection criteria that are considered are: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> an established diagnosis for at least 5 years; 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> significant suffering evidenced by validated clinical and social function scores; 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> failure of the usual medications to control the disorder, either singly or in combination when administered for at least 5 years, or inability to continue medication due to intolerable side effects; 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> appropriate treatment of an associated co-morbid disorder, and 通用删除7(英):<u>(5)</u> a poor prognosis for the disorder in question. In all cases, it is necessary to inform the patient of the risks, prefer less intrusive stereotaxic techniques, and obtain patient consent.\n\n【8】###### The relationship between therapy and research procedures\n\n【9】For all other indications, the scientific demand for research is dominant, in view of the uncertainties veiling both the pathology and its presumed treatment. Although a degree of tension emerges whenever potentially irreversible cerebral manipulation is considered, obviously the actual reversibility of new techniques can only be formally established through research. It therefore seems ethically improper to oppose research which aims to examine reversibility of the effects produced. According to a report of the French Bioethics Advisory Commission on the subject of consent通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>6 </sup></u> :\n\n【10】> The intricacy of the care and research relationship has become a major characteristic of “scientific medicine”. This should be a subject of pride. When it engages in research, medicine questions its own principles, corrects its mistakes, and progresses. Good research is not sufficient in itself to ensure quality health care, but it does contribute.\n\n【11】###### Consent\n\n【12】The concept of consent has very different implications depending on whether the perspective is medical, legal, philosophical, or ethical; whether it only concerns the individual in question; or whether it is given for the benefit of a third party. Consent remains a crucial issue in psychiatry, more than for any other medical discipline, and particularly so when psychosurgery is one of the options.\n\n【13】In the case of severe obsessive psychoses and OCD patients are fully conscious of the torment they endure and are often the first to call for the intervention. In the presence of this desire, physicians need to recognize the anguish created by the pathology, and consider whether they should accede to such requests. Understanding and sensitivity to the reality and intensity of the patient’s distress may bring the conviction that it non-ethical to deny such treatment to patients suffering from a disabling, chronic, and intractable disease. Furthermore, the risk of social, somatic and mental complications of non-treatment, including the risk of suicide cannot be discounted.\n\n【14】Consent may be easy to secure because some patients endure such suffering that they may be ready to accept, or for that matter demand, intrepid action. It is precisely this ease of securing consent that paradoxically raises ethical concerns. But an alternate, equally legitimate question is how long a patient can ethically be left to suffer medical therapeutic failure before offering the option of neurostimulation.\n\n【15】For patients suffering from aggressive delusional conditions (who may be dangerous for themselves or others), the question of consent is much more problematic. It is wishful thinking to imagine that the validity of consent (“free and informed”) does not bear scrutiny in cases where judgment is severely impaired. Nevertheless, all efforts must be made to secure the patient’s assent, even though this “consent” may be dubious in legal terms. Cerebral neurostimulation techniques may be appropriate in some particularly disabling treatment-refractory psychiatric pathologies. However, because neurostimulation for such patients is not established standard therapy and therefore is inextricably involved with research, a very specific concept of consent, validated by external appraisal, must be provided. For further discussion of consent for human subjects in research, see Chapter 27 .\n\n【16】In situations where both therapy and research are involved, consent takes on a new dimension. A physician must inform his patient of the consequences of the expected therapeutic effects, and also of the value of the research activity. Although it is clear that consent may be defective for patients suffering from psychiatric disorders, every effort must nevertheless be made to obtain agreement prior to treatment. Even though a particular patient’s “intervals of lucidity” may be very rare, assent should still be sought persistently to try to assure whenever possible that the patient has been able to understand, at least to some degree, the medical expectations and their consequences.\n\n【17】Confronted with a mentally disabled individual whose condition may risk violence to self or to others, society has a duty to protect the vulnerable, but while doing so, must also respect and protect the sick individual – who is also vulnerable. In the clinical setting as well as in biomedical research, pains should always be taken to do as much good and as little harm as possible, while respecting the freedom of decision of those one seeks to help. Even though duty calls for a constant effort to combine and reconcile these two principles, there often conflict between beneficence and autonomy. For example, the French Code of Ethics of the medical profession states: <sup>7</sup>\n\n【18】> Consent from the person under examination or care must always be sought …. when the patient is in a fit state to express his/her wishes, and rejects the investigation or treatment offered, the physician must respect that rejection, after having informed the patient of the consequences. If the patient is unable to express his/her wishes, the physician may not take action unless next of kin have been warned or informed, unless that is an impossibility or urgent action is required.\n\n【19】Therefore, the issue of “being or not being fit to express a wish” is the crux of the matter. Further detailed instruction in the Code of Ethics on this difficult matter is unambiguous:\n\n【20】> Consent from a mentally sick patient to treatment offered is most advisable and, if necessary, attempts to secure it may be insistent ; however, in case of refusal, the physician and the family must, in certain cases, ignore the patient’s wishes. When mental aberration is clearly established, or if the patient is dangerous, commitment by certification or voluntarily to a mental hospital or institution becomes necessary. The law dated June 27, 1990 <sup>8 </sup> on the commitment of the mentally ill, allows for the wishes of the patient to be ignored in certain cases, both as regards admission to a public hospital and administering treatment. When neurotic disorders or affective disturbances, even of a spectacular nature, do not alter the patient’s personality nor prevent reasonable decision, no treatment may be applied without the patient’s consent.\n\n【21】While the advisory and, in some cases, authoritative role of family members in providing consent for mentally disabled patients is recognized in Europe, such is not universally true elsewhere. In the US, where psychosurgical techniques and psychiatric interventions have been associated in public perception with manipulation or obliteration of free will, restrictions have been placed on consent for psychosurgical procedures and ECT. In some of the US, such treatments can be obtained for decisionally incompetent patients only by court order.\n\n【22】In many cases, a casuistic approach, based on a case-by-case discussion, is needed. In fact, the Madrid Declaration of the World Psychiatric Association states:\n\n【23】> Ethical behavior is based on the psychiatrist’s individual sense of responsibility towards the patient and their judgment in determining what is correct and appropriate conduct. External standards and influences such as professional codes of conduct, the study of ethics, or the rule of law by themselves will not guarantee the ethical practice of medicine.\nOne solution might be the formation of a formal committee tasked with establishing decision-making procedures for the purpose of providing support and protection to such patients. In the presence of severe psychotic conditions, it may not be best to accept a surrogate consent between the attending physician, the expert, and the family or legal representative. Rather, a committee including non-medical personnel as well as individuals capable of evaluating both the handicaps and misery endured by the patient, the family, and the entourage, might attenuate the pain and anxiety of making such decisions.\n\n【24】For procedures that involve considerations of research and care, every protocol should be approved by a special committee, according to criteria which define: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> conditions for approaching potential candidates; 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> criteria for patient selection such as severity, chronicity, gravity and failures of prior medical treatment; 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> validity of consent; and 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> mode of evaluation of results.\n\n【25】In view of new issues arising out of the emergence of experimental therapy, the committee’s task would be to preserve the integrity of suffering human beings and safeguard respect for their autonomy, as well as to consider what alternative objective help can be given to them. On the subject of psychosurgery, a working group of the Steering Committee on Bioethics of the Council of Europe stated:\n\n【26】> where States continue to sanction the use of it, the consent of the patient should be an absolute prerequisite for its use. Furthermore, the decision to use psychosurgery should in every case be confirmed by a committee which is not exclusively composed of psychiatric experts.\n###### Electroconvulsive therapy\n\n【27】Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a procedure performed under general anesthesia during which a seizure is induced by application of electricity through electrodes applied on the head. After its introduction in the 1940s, as with psychosurgery, excesses involving its use in the 1960s and 1970s led to sharp criticisms questioning its very necessity. As with psychosurgery, negative associations of its use in public perceptions, both real (e.g. Frances Farmer and Ernest Hemingway) and fictional (e.g. Robert Pirsig’s Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance ) perpetuate suspicion regarding ECT. It nevertheless remains widely used throughout the world. Current indications for ECT are severe psychiatric disorders (severe depressions, melancholia) with a tangible risk of suicide. It is also used in cases of documented resistance to medical therapies for severe depressions and in selected patients suffering from maniac-depressive psychosis or severe schizophrenic disorders.\n\n【28】General anesthesia including muscle relaxants is mandatory to prevent musculoskeletal complications of seizures. Preoperative clinical evaluation allows recognitions of classic contraindications such as certain arrhythmias, or intracranial hypertension complicating some neurological disorders. ECT might even, in selected patients, have less morbidity than certain antidepressants.\n\n【29】The main controversy surrounding ECT involves the fear of psychiatric pathologies and their therapies. An important symbolic question also raised by ECT is the issue of dignity, which is deeply embedded in the concept of free will. Accordingly, the aim of safeguarding the patient’s freedom is central to the official declarations of psychiatric associations regarding patient rights. The World Health Organization recently condemned the abuses and violation of the human rights of people with mental disorders and Dr Jong-Wook Lee, former Director General of WHO urged:\n\n【30】> countries, international organizations, academia, the healthcare and legal sectors and others to take a hard look at the conditions of people with mental disorders and take action to promote and protect their rights.\nThe question of how to best preserve the interests of the patient while having effecting human behavior, is key to this subject. The use of ECT should be performed in a non-passionate and dramatic way, and in cooperation with the patient. When obtaining consent, the clinician must believe that the treatment is performed in what he/she thinks is in the patient’s best interests, yet always keep open the possibility of patient refusal.\n\n【31】#### Key points\n\n【32】• Special societal implications of psychosurgery and ECT lead us to reconsider the hierarchy of cardinal ethical principles.\n\n【33】• Because of the investigational nature of more recent, less invasive and potentially reversible techniques, research and patient care cannot always be disengaged from one another.\n\n【34】• When considering Autonomy, Beneficence, Non-Maleficence and Distributive Justice, the physician has a moral obligation to respect the common good, with a fair balance between beneficence and the autonomy of the patient.\n\n【35】• Psychosurgery raises fundamental questions, such as those linked to the definition of person and free will, concepts of dignity, integrity, and the validity of true consent.\n\n【36】• In the quest for authentic harmony in the relationships between the health care provider and the patient, tensions between means and ends should be recognized, as well as the understanding of contextual influences, such as economic, political, scientific, and social perceptions, that may alter the consent process.\n\n【37】• Ultimately, decisions regarding psychosurgical interventions and ECT must be made on a case-by-case basis, taking into account patient suffering and disability, and balancing these considerations with patient autonomy.\n\n【38】• Decisions regarding involuntary treatments may benefit from the input of established committees including non-medical personnel and representatives of the patient and their entourage.\n\n【39】####", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

The first， and most important， step in diag-nosis of a patient presenting with these symptoms and exam finding of bradycardia is electrocardiogram (ECG). The ECG will provide the diagnosis of what the conduc-tion abnormality is (sinus bradycardia vs. second-degree AV block type 1 or type 2 Vs. complete heart block)， where the ventricular activation is coming from if complete heart block is present (narrow complex suggesting junctional escape， wide complex suggesting ventricular escape)， as well as providing other pertinent information such as the presence of active myocardial ischemia or infarction， or interventricular con-duction abnormalities (right or left bundle branch block). This ECG shows complete heart block， identified by dissociation of the atrial and ventricular activation， with more P waves than QRS complexes. Further， the ventricular rate is very slow， and in the presence ofsymptoms， is not ultimately sustainable. The next immediate step is to stabilize the patient with temporary ventricular pacing. While this patient ultimately may require permanent pacemaker implantation， this process would not occur likely for hours at a minimum， and therefore more immediate intervention is warranted.\n\n【18】Transcutaneous pacing with external pads is an option， but not an ideal one as they are often uncomfortable for the patient and are typically unreliable with either com-plete inability to pace， or intermittent loss ofcapture. Transvenous temporary pacing provides more reliability， better pacing options， and aside from initial venous access， is more comfortable for the patient while further workup and planning is done； this can be performed by a trained cardiologist or intensivist.\n\n【19】Finally， after stabilization， baseline workup can commence. Careful review of the patient’s medication list， as well as recent changes， is needed as many medi-cations (beta-blockers， calcium channel blockers， digoxin， antiarrhythmics) may cause AV block that can be resolved with decreasing dose， cessation， or pharma-cologic reversal of the agent. Lab evaluation with complete blood count (CBC)， comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP； a standardized group of 14 blood tests)， and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) blood tests are important to rule out end-organ dysfunction， which may result from hypoperfusion due to bradycardia， as well as ensure that electrolyte or thyroid dysfunction are not culprits in the presenting situ-ation. Cardiac evaluation should include exclusion of myocardial infarction with serial CK， CK-MB， and troponin T or I， as active ischemia or infarct may cause AV conduction abnormalities； and an echocardiogram should be performed to evaluate for baseline LV function， wall motion， and valvular abnormalities. In patients with known severe coronary artery disease， or suspicion of disease due to concomitant symptoms (chest pain， shortness of breath， heart failure symptoms)， evaluation for ischemia or severe coronary disease may be necessary with noninvasive stress testing or cardiac catheterization.\n\n【20】APPROACH TO：\n\n【21】DEFINITIONS\n\n【22】BRADYCARDIA： Ventricular rate <60 bpm.\n\n【23】COMPLETE HEART BLOCK： Dissociation ofatrial and ventricular activation.\n\n【24】SECOND-DEGREE HEART BLOCK， MOBITZ TYPE 1： PR interval that pro-gressively prolongs before a nonconducted P wave occurs， resulting in a“dropped”QRS for a single beat.\n\n【25】SECOND-DEGREE HEART BLOCK， MOBITZ TYPE 2： PR interval is consis-tent beat to beat， and a QRS is consistently dropped， typically at a regular interval(3：2， 4：3，etc).\n\n【26】CLINICALAPPROACH\n\n【27】Etiologies\n\n【28】The most common etiology of acquired AV nodal block is idiopathic fibrosis and sclerosis of the conduction system， accounting for approximately 50% of cases of 删除换行1 new AV block. This is termed Lenegre’s disease in young patients， and it is due to slow fibrosis and associated with a slow progression to complete heart block. In the elderly， Lev’s disease is conduction disease due to progressive calcification of fibrous structures of the heart adjacent to the conduction system. This may often start as bifascicular block in the form ofright bundle branch block (RBBB) with left ante-rior fascicular block， which then progresses to complete heart block.\n\n【29】Ischemic heart disease accounts for up to 40% of cases of AV block， and can result from chronic disease or acute myocardial infarction. Ofpatients with acute MI，5% will develop second-degree AV block， and 6% will develop complete heart block.\n\n【30】Atrioventricular block can also be caused by increased vagal tone (sleep， carotid sinus massage， pain， athletic training)， typically also associated with slowing of the sinus rate. Other causes of AV block include myocarditis， cardiomyopathy， infiltra-tive diseases， neuromuscular disorders， rheumatologic disorders， thyroid dysfunction(hyper-and hypothyroidism)， cardiac tumors， and hyperkalemia. Congenital heart block is diagnosed at birth， and usually associated with a higher ventricular rate than acquired complete heart block.\n\n【31】Iatrogenic causes of AV block include AV nodal blocking medications (beta-blockers， calcium channel blockers， digoxin， amiodarone， and adenosine)， cardiac surgery， or percutaneous interventions (including transcatheter valve replacement， alcohol septal ablation， catheter ablation of arrhythmias， and VSD closure).\n\n【32】Types of AV block\n\n【33】First-degree AV block is defined as a prolongation of the conduction between the atria and ventricles， as determined by a PR interval of>200 ms on ECG.\n\n【34】Second-degree AV block comes in two varieties： Mobitztype 1 (or Wenckebach) and Mobitz type 2. Mobitz type 1 AV block is defined by a progressive PR prolon-gation with eventual“dropped”QRS complex 删除33：<u></u>. The subsequent PR interval after the dropped beat is short， and again shows progressive prolongation in subsequent beats. Mobitz type 1 block typically occurs within the AV node； there-fore， maneuvers that improve AV conduction will improve the block (exercise，atro-pine)， whereas maneuvers which decrease AV conduction will worsen the degree of block (carotid sinus massage). Mobitz 1 block does not typically progress to high-grade block (Mobitz II or complete heart block).\n\n【35】Mobitz type 2 second-degree AV block is defined by a stable PR interval in con-secutive beats， with nonconduction or “dropped QRS\"occurring at either regular or irregular intervals 删除33：<u></u>. Mobitz 2 block typically occurs below the AV node， in the His-Purkinje system. As a result of the disease at this level， Mobitz 2is more often associated with bundle branch block (but not the rule). Maneuvers that improve conduction through the AV node actually worsen Mobitz 2 block， as this decreases recovery time for the His-Purkinje system (exercise， atropine)； by contrast， carotid sinus massage will improve Mobitz 2 block， as this slows AV nodal conduction enough to allow the His-Purkinje system to recover and conduct more impulses. Because of instability of the His-Purkinje system in Mobitz 2 block， there is a high rate of progression to complete heart block.\n\n【36】Differentiation between Mobitztypes 1 and 2 second-degree AV block is difficult when the ratio of AV conduction is 2：1 删除33：<u></u>. This is clinically relevant\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n\n【38】删除3：<u>Figure 12-2. Types ofatrioventricular (AV) block： (A) second-degree AV block， Mobitz type 1(Wenckebach)； (B) second-degree AV block， Mobitz type 2； (C) second-degree AV block with 2：1 AV conduction； (d) third-degree (complete) AV block.</u>\n\n【39】because the likelihood of progression to complete heart block is higher with Mobitz type 2 AV block and knowing the mechanism may influence management (such as the decision to place a transvenous pacing wire). In this circumstance there are some characteristics that may help one distinguish between types land 2 .\n\n【40】Third-degree block (complete heart block) is defined as complete dissociation of the atria and ventricles 删除33：<u></u>. Typically， in complete heart block， the PP interval and the RR interval are consistent from beat to beat， but are not the same. PR interval will vary as well due to the dissociation. Typically， atrial rate will be higher than the junctional or ventricular escape rate， and more P waves will be noted than QRS complexes.\n\n【41】Clinical Presentation\n\n【42】Patients presenting with complete heart block， or even second-degree AV block， can have various symptoms at presentation. Patients typically experience symptoms consistent with decreased perfusion to end organs. Specifically， lightheadedness， diz-ziness， fatigue， confusion， and syncope are common. Also associated are shortness of\n\n| Table 12-1·CHARACTERISTICS OF TYPE 1 (AVNODAL) VS.  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| TYPE 2 (HIS-PURKINJE) BLOCKIN 2：1 BLOCK  |  |  |\n| Parameter  | AV Node (Mobitz 1)  | His-Purkinje (Mobitz 2)  |\n| Typical QRs complex  | Narrow  | Wide (bundle branch block)  |\n| PR duration  | Long， lengthens  | Normal  |\n| Response to carotid sinus massage  | Worsens  | improves  |\n| Response to exercise  | Improves  | Worsens  |\n| Response to atropine  | improves  | Worsens  |\n\n【44】breath with exertion and angina-like pain. Block due to acute myocardial in farction may present with chest pain or referred pain. Onset ofthe symptoms may be gradual over hours， or abrupt； in some cases symptoms are not noted until the patient begins physical activity， at which point they cannot increase cardiac output enough to match oxygen demand.\n\n【45】The history taken should be detailed， and specifically focused on when the symp-toms started， as that will likely indicate the duration oftheir bradyarrhythmia. Asso-ciated concerning symptoms such as chest pain should elicit evaluation for ischemic heart disease. Detailed review of medications， particularly in those with multiple comorbidities， is necessary； medications with AV nodal blocking activity need to be identified， and dosing， frequency， compliance， and changes in regimen of these medications needs to be discussed.\n\n【46】The physical examination should first note vitals， particularly heart rate (before pacing) and blood pressure. Some patients tolerate bradycardia well with normal blood pressure， whereas others may experience significant hypotension as well. Neck examination may reveal “cannon A waves” of the jugular venous pulsation， consistent with right atrial contraction against a closed tricuspid valve. Lung exami-nation is typically normal， but findings consistent with heart failure such as crackles need to be addressed quickly and portend a more significant disease process. Cardiac exam will identify bradycardia， but also may note variable intensity of S1. An S3 may also identify those with volume overload due to uncoordinated atrial and ventricular conduction. Murmurs should be noted as well， as valvular endocarditis may cause regurgitant disease with infiltration of the conduction system.\n\n【47】Treatm ent\n\n【48】The first step in management of a patient presenting with bradycardia is deter-mination of the rhythm. In those with symptoms consistent with their brady-cardia， or high-degree block， immediate action should be taken to increase the ventricular rate， typically with temporary pacing. Once stabilized， determination of the etiology is the next step. Evaluation for electrolyte disturbance， thyroid or renal dysfunction， and myocardial ischemia should all be undertaken with initial laboratory tests. Any of these abnormalities should be treated aggressively， as cor-rection of the underlying problem (hyperkalemia， thyroid dysfunction， etc) may improve the conduction and obviate the need for permanent pacing. Evidence of myocardial ischemia or active infarction should be addressed with cardiac cath-eterization and intervention if necessary. Recent cardiac surgery may cause sinus node dysfunction and subsequent bradycardia， particularly junctional bradycardia， but this often improves with time.\n\n【49】Careful medication review is ofextreme importance in the assessment of patients with bradycardia， particularly elderly patients in whom polypharmacy is quite com-mon. Medications that can cause AV block (and medications that may potentiate their effect) should be of particular concern. Changes in regimen and compliance(double dosing) should be noted， or changes in organ function that may cause ele-vated drug levels. Monitoring and withholding ofthe medication is often all that is required， and once levels decrease， AV function may improve. However， in extreme cases， medication reversal may be necessary with appropriate reversal agents.\n\n【50】Finally， in cases of persistent symptomatic bradycardia， permanent pacing may be required. Consultation with a cardiac electrophysiologist is necessary， for implant of the device， as well as selection ofthe appropriate type of device (single-chamber， dual-chamber， etc).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Since she has already taken 1 month of intensive phase of therapy,  删除换行1 she may continue to take same drugs for next 1 month, following which ethambutol and  删除换行1 pyrazinamide may be stopped and rest of drugs to be continued for next 4 months.\nDISCUSSION\n\n【8】Isoniazid is considered safe in pregnancy except for some chance of postpartum hepatitis.\nThe ATS (American Thoracic Society) recommends supplementation of pyridoxine  删除换行1 during pregnancy (25 mg/day). Use of rifampicin and ethambutol is safe in pregnancy.Data regarding other rifamycins (rifabutin and rifapentine) is insufficient, and thus they  删除换行1 should be cautiously used. Safety regarding pyrazinamide could not be assured but WHO  删除换行5 and IUATLD recommend its use in pregnancy because when used for 6-month regimen,  删除换行1 benefits may outweigh possible risk.\n\n【9】Streptomycin may cause congenital deafness, as this drug interferes with development of ear. Other injectables such as amikacin, kanamycin, and capreomycin having  删除换行1 pharmacokinetics similar to streptomycin, may also cause fetal nephrotoxicity and  删除换行1 ototoxicity. Ethionamide and prothionamide are contraindicated in pregnancy as they  删除换行1 are found teratogenic in animal studies. Cycloserine crosses placenta and since its  删除换行1 safety in pregnancy is not established, it should be avoided and used only if no other  删除换行1 suitable alternatives are available. Para-aminosalicylic acid (PAS) has been used safely in  删除换行1 pregnancy in past but since no well-designed study has been done to ascertain its safety  删除换行1 in pregnancy, it should be used in absence of any other alternative. Fluoroquinolone,  删除换行1 being toxic and inhibitor of growing cartilage in animals, is to be avoided in pregnancy.\nAnimal studies demonstrated teratogenicity (retardation of fetal skull ossification) for  删除换行1 clofazimine and crossing of placenta and excretion in milk. However, WHO has approved  删除换行1 this drug safe in pregnancy. Similarly, clarithromycin is not safe in pregnancy as higher  删除换行1 dose has been associated with embryo toxicity. There are no adequate and well-controlled  删除换行1 studies regarding teratogenicity of linezolid in pregnant women. It should be used during  删除换行1 pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Bedaquiline  删除换行1 is not recommended during pregnancy or breastfeeding due to limited data. Reproduction  删除换行1 studies performed in rats and rabbits have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus. There  删除换行1 are very limited data from the use of delamanid in pregnant women. Studies in animals  删除换行1 have shown reproductive toxicity. Available pharmacokinetic data in animals have shown  删除换行1 excretion of delamanid and/or its metabolites in milk.\n\n【10】Regarding treatment of tuberculosis in a pregnant lady, it is said that treatment of  删除换行1 tuberculosis is far less hazardous than leaving the disease untreated, both with regard  删除换行1 to baby and mother. Tuberculosis in pregnant lady may lead to underweight infant or  删除换行1 congenital tuberculosis. Risk of miscarriage is much higher in active tuberculosis than  删除换行1 risk from the drug treatment, so standard treatment should be given. Treatment regimen  删除换行1 for drug sensitive tuberculosis should include rifampicin, isoniazid, and ethambutol.Streptomycin should not be used. Opinion regarding use of pyrazinamide is divided, but  删除换行5 WHO and IUATLD recommend its use. ATS does not confidently advocate it. According  删除换行1 to WHO, 6-month regimen based upon isoniazid, rifampicin, and pyrazinamide should  删除换行1 be used whenever possible and ethambutol should be used if a fourth drug is needed  删除换行1 during initial phase. Contrary to this, ATS recommends that pyrazinamide should better  删除换行1 be avoided in pregnancy because of lack of sufficient data for its safety. If pyrazinamide  删除换行1 is not used, duration of treatment should be 9 months. Although isoniazid, rifampicin, and  删除换行1 ethambutol cross the placenta, they are not found to be teratogenic.\n\n【11】Women taking firstline antitubercular drugs should not be asked for termination of  删除换行1 pregnancy, while those on reserve-line drugs should be counseled for possible adverse  删除换行1 effects. Breastfeeding should not be discouraged as amount secreted in milk is insufficient  删除换行1 to cause any toxic or therapeutic effect. Supplemental pyridoxine is recommended for  删除换行1 both nursing mother and her infant, even if no isoniazid is being given to the infant. All  删除换行1 antitubercular drugs could be used during lactation, except fluoroquinolones because  删除换行1 of possible risk. Baby of woman who has taken rifampicin during pregnancy should 删除换行1 receive vitamin K at birth to avoid the risk of postnatal hemorrhage as rifampicin may  删除换行1 induce metabolism of vitamin K and hamper hepatic synthesis of vitamin K-dependent  删除换行1 coagulation factors.\n\n【12】Women taking oral hormonal contraceptives should be counseled for possible  删除换行1 contraceptive failure and occurrence of pregnancy, especially in rifampicin-containing  删除换行1 antitubercular treatment regimen because of induction of metabolism of contraceptive  删除换行1 drug by rifampicin. Such ladies should be advised to use nonhormonal contraceptive  删除换行1 during and for 1 month after treatment with rifampicin-containing regimen.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

This patient presents with a pleural effusion, the accumulation of excess fluid in the pleural space. Pleural effusions can have a number of etiologies, including pneumonia, congestive heart failure, and cancer. Therapeutic thoracentesis can be performed to relieve symptoms and improve respiratory function. The intercostal vein, artery, and nerve run in the intercostal groove on the inferior surface of each rib. When thoracentesis is performed, the needle is always inserted at the most inferior aspect of an intercostal space to avoid these structures running along the superior aspect of the space.  \nAnswer B is incorrect. The parietal pleura is the outer layer of the pleura and is attached to the chest wall. When performing a therapeutic thoracentesis, it is necessary to pierce the parietal pleura in order to access the pleural space.  \nAnswer C is incorrect. The phrenic nerve is found deep in the thorax, running along the mediastinum and pericardium; it is too deep to be injured by thoracentesis.  \nAnswer D is incorrect. The pericardiophrenic vessels travel with the phrenic nerve along the mediastinum and pericardium. These vessels are too deep to be injured by this procedure.  \nAnswer E is incorrect. The needle here is inserted above the tenth rib, in the ninth intercostal space. The tenth intercostal vessels and nerve run below the tenth rib, in the tenth intercostal space.  \nAnswer F is incorrect. The visceral pleura is the inner layer of pleura that covers the lungs and adjoining structures in the thorax. It is important to avoid piercing the visceral pleura because of its association with the lung. Avoidance of this structure, however, is not strongly dependent on inserting the needle at the inferior aspect of the intercostal space. This is instead best aided by asking patients to hold their breath.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

This can be seen from the positive pregnancy test, 删除换行1 ultrasound confirming a pregnancy in the adnexa (with fetal heart beat present in this 删除换行1 case), and laparoscopic confirmation of a distended right uterine tube, showing the typical 删除换行1 bluish bulge. There is no evidence of blood in the pouch of Douglas (haemoperitoneum) to 删除换行1 suggest rupture of the ectopic pregnancy.\n\n【19】Classic symptoms of ectopic pregnancy are amenorrhoea, iliac fossa pain and dark  删除换行1 vaginal bleeding. Ectopic pregnancies are, however, often diagnosed in women with any 删除换行1 combination of symptoms from heavy vaginal bleeding with clots to period-type pain, to 删除换行1 no symptoms at all. Ectopic pregnancies occur in 1–2 per cent of pregnancies and the 删除换行1 majority are diagnosed before rupture but occasionally women still present with collapse 删除换行1 and this is a medical emergency – a woman with collapse and a positive pregnancy test 删除换行1 should be initially assumed to have a ruptured ectopic pregnancy.\n\n【20】Management options\n\n【21】General ectopic pregnancy management options are:\n\n【22】• surgical (salpingectomy or salpingotomy)\n\n【23】• medical (methotrexate injection)\n\n【24】• expectant (wait and see).\n\n【25】In this case, the only option is surgical in view of the fact that a fetal heart beat is present, rendering conservative options both dangerous (because of risk of rupture) and 删除换行1 unlikely to be successful. The ectopic pregnancy should be removed laparoscopically if 删除换行1 possible to minimize hospital stay and postoperative pain and to reduce postoperative 删除换行1 complications including adhesions. If the contralateral tube is healthy, then the tube may 删除换行1 be removed (salpingectomy). If the other is damaged then salpingotomy (incision into the 删除换行1 tube to remove the pregnancy) should be attempted.\n\n【26】• Explanation of diagnosis and operation\n\n【27】• Appropriate counselling that the woman may grieve (this is the loss of a pregnancy) 删除换行1 with advice about further support\n\n【28】• Avoid the progesterone only contraceptive pill (POP) and intrauterine 删除换行1 contraceptive device (IUCD) (both are associated with a slightly higher risk of 删除换行1 ectopic pregnancy)\n\n【29】• Approximately 65–70 per cent of women who have had an ectopic pregnancy go on 删除换行1 to have a live birth following this, but there is a 10–15 per cent chance of a further 删除换行1 ectopic pregnancy\n\n【30】• Early transvaginal scan is indicated at around 5 weeks’ gestation to confirm the 删除换行1 location of any future pregnancy\n\n【31】• Effective contraception should be used if she does not wish to become pregnant 删除换行1 again at the moment\n\n【32】Postoperative counselling points after ectopic pregnancy !\n\n【33】• The symptoms of an ectopic pregnancy are highly variable, from no symptoms to pain 删除换行1 and bleeding, to sudden life-threatening collapse.\n\n【34】• Ectopic pregnancy can only be ruled out after positive visualization of an intrauterine 删除换行1 gestation sac.\n\n【35】• ‘Viable’ ectopic pregnancies (where the fetal heart beat is visualized) should always be 删除换行1 treated surgically.\n\n【36】KEY POINTS删除6：<u>This page intentionally left blank 102</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

He is not intubated. He needs a central line for better vascular access and has a 24-guage peripheral IV.\n\n【8】Preoperative Evaluation\n-----------------------\n\n【9】Questions\n\n【10】1.  1.\n    How will you evaluate and manage his airway?\n2.  2.\n    What fluid/electrolyte problems can you anticipate?\n3.  3.\n    Nutritional problems?\n4.  4.\n    What is the nature of this skin problem? How long will it take to resolve? Can it recur? Is this problem different than erythema multiforme?\n\n【11】Answers\n\n【12】1.  1.\n    Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) is on a spectrum of immune-complex-mediated inflammatory skin reactions characterized by disseminated epidermal necrolysis, commonly related to drug exposure in the case of SJS and toxic epidermal necrosis (TEN), and herpesvirus in the case of erythema multiforme (EM) . Drugs more highly associated with SJS/TEN in children less than 15 years of age include sulfonamides, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, and lamotrigine 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. The differentiating feature is the percent of skin detachment from total body surface area, with SJS at <10% detachment and TEN >30%. The mucosal injury may consist of erythema, edema, sloughing, blistering, ulceration, or necrosis.\n    Mucous membranes are affected in more than 90% of patients, particularly at ocular, oral, or genital sites. The vermilion border is almost always involved. Specific considerations for the airway include the amount of patient discomfort, the accumulation of sloughed/necrotic tissue which can worsen dramatically with airway manipulation through the use of oral airways, laryngoscopy and suction equipment, tissue friability, bleeding, and the risk of subsequent scarring, aspiration of necrotic intraoral debris, and edema of intraoral as well as soft tissue structures of the pharynx and neck, making visualization difficult. A central line would typically require endotracheal intubation , but consideration in these circumstances should also be given to avoiding a general anesthetic if possible and considering a TIVA technique for PICC line placement, perhaps in the radiology suite.\n2.  2.\n    Stomatitis and mucositis lead to impaired oral intake with consequent malnutrition and dehydration. Other laboratory abnormalities include hypoalbuminemia, electrolyte imbalance, and increased blood urea nitrogen and glucose in severe cases, due to massive transdermal fluid loss and hypercatabolic state. Mild elevations in serum aminotransferase levels (two to three times normal) are present in approximately one-half of patients with TEN, while overt hepatitis occurs in approximately 10%. The generalized epidermal sloughing results in large, raw, painful areas of denuded skin which makes intravascular volume support the equivalent of burn management.\n3.  3.\n    Depending on the length of the interval between onset and the time of critical care intervention , the patients have already been in an extremely high metabolic state (e.g. very high fevers up to 400 C) with poor nutritional intake, hence the hepatic injury, hypoproteinemia/hypoalbuminemia, frequently prerenal azotemia, and intravascular volume depletion. There may be insulin resistance as well. The recovery course can be prolonged, with the acute phase lasting 8–12 days followed by reepithelialization lasting 2–4 weeks.\n4.  4.\n    Medications are the leading cause (about 2/3) of SJS/TEN in adults and children. In 25–33% of cases, a drug etiology cannot be identified. In children, the most commonly associated drugs are sulfonamides, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, and lamotrigine. M. pneumoniae is the next most common trigger, especially in children. HIV and malignancy are recognized comorbid risk factors.\n    Following initiation by whatever mechanism, a cell-mediated cytotoxic reaction against keratinocytes leads to massive apoptosis. Cytotoxic T cells are direct against the native form of the drug which then stimulates the immune, resulting in the clonal expansion of a population of drug-specific cytotoxic T cells that kill keratinocytes directly and indirectly through the recruitment of other cells that release soluble death mediators. The severe reaction is similar to acute graft-versus-host disease.\n    The differentiating feature is the percent of skin detachment from total body surface area, with SJS at <10% detachment and TEN >30%. The mucosal injury may consist of erythema, edema, sloughing, blistering, ulceration, or necrosis.\n\n【13】Intraoperative Course\n---------------------\n\n【14】Questions\n\n【15】1.  1.\n    Does this patient need an IV in order to accomplish a “quiet” induction? How will you accomplish this?\n2.  2.\n    The medical student suggests an IM pre-induction dose of ketamine and midazolam; do you think this is a good idea?\n3.  3.\n    An elderly attending says “in the old days we would use rectal methohexital to get started.” What do you think about this idea?\n4.  4.\n    You proceed with a gentle mask induction with a well-lubricated mask . What airway management considerations do you have? Do you anticipate having any difficulty visualizing the airway?\n5.  5.\n    What are your equipment considerations?\n6.  6.\n    Can this case be done without intubation of the trachea? What are your choices? What are your risk-benefit considerations for those choices?\n\n【16】Answers\n\n【17】1.  1.\n    A calm induction is best, no matter how one accomplishes it. A collaborative approach among the OR team and parents is best; generous premedication may help considerably if needed. This can be accomplished orally with midazolam , rectally with methohexital , or even parenterally (spray the skin prep rather than rubbing the skin). If an IV option is chosen, especially in patients who are wrapped in bandages, it will be wise to have the parent remove the bandages, for patient comfort. The need for restraint must be avoided, however. Securing of an IV can be accomplished with tape over nonadhesive dressings; they may also be sutured in place.\n2.  2.\n    Within the general guidance above, it is an acceptable alternative as long as restraint is avoided and the area to be injected is not rubbed with a prep pad but rather sprayed with alcohol, Betadine, or chlorhexidine.\n3.  3.\n    Again, a perfectly acceptable idea as long as the perianal area is carefully examined with regard to blistering and skin irritation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. The usual induction dose (methohexital) of 25–30 mg/kg (10% solution) may have to be increased if the patient is on concurrent enzyme-inducing drug therapy.\n4.  4.\n    As outlined above, the first consideration is with application of the mask; a “tight” mask fit is risky because of the inevitable friction it creates and subsequent bleeding. Liberal lubrication should be generously applied between the cuff of the mask and the skin of the face. As a result of the EB, the small mouth and any intraoral lesions will restrict access of any visualizing device except a fiberoptic scope. Limitation of head and neck movement could make visualization more difficult, and any intraoral scarring could result in a loss of laryngeal or tongue mobility. Most of this is assessable with a careful physical examination. The mouth opening has to be large enough to accommodate a rigid blade, whether a conventional laryngoscope blade or a videolaryngoscope. Laryngoscopy must be gentle, especially close to and around the areas of mucosal fragility. Supraglottic airway devices such as a laryngeal mask airway can be used but are probably ill-advised because of the trauma with blind insertion.\n5.  5.\n    Almost all routine monitors will involve adhesives or shearing forces to the skin, which must be eliminated. Pulse oximeters can be applied via clip probes or can be wrapped after the adhesive is cut off. Blood pressure cuffs can be applied over cotton; inflation applies direct pressure rather than a shearing movement, although the “compression” of the underlying skin can be minimized by lengthening the cycle interval. ECG can be monitored with needle electrodes (which present personnel risks of their own) or by cutting off the adhesive circumference 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Older patients should position themselves while awake in order to confirm comfort and pressure points (elbows, heels, ischium, occiput, etc.) should be well lubricated/padded. The entire operating table should be padded as well.\n6.  6.\n    This depends on the kind of line planned. A peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) can easily be accomplished with local anesthesia and sedation. A cutdown approach for the internal jugular vein can be accomplished with spontaneous breathing as well, although there is a greater chance of venous air embolism during the final vein cannulation after the initial cutdown. A laryngeal mask can be used with the same considerations, but may be contraindicated depending on the extent of the mucous membrane lesions. A total intravenous technique can be utilized with various combinations of propofol, propofol-remifentanil, dexmedetomidine, or ketamine; however, the patient will be covered up with a general anesthetic in the absence of a protected airway, itself a significant risk when the patient is in a fragile, hypermetabolic state.\n\n【18】Postoperative Course\n--------------------\n\n【19】Questions\n\n【20】1.  1.\n    When would you extubate? Deep? “Awake?”\n2.  2.\n    You extubate, and the patient has inspiratory stridor in the OR. What will you do? How will you evaluate? Should you do a rigid bronchoscopy?\n\n【21】Answers\n\n【22】1.  1.\n    Minimizing struggling and the need for restraint is key for emergence and recovery. While a deep extubation would provide immediate satisfaction as far as calmness, emergence through stage 2 remains hazardous and might require, as it would with anyone else, application of a tightly fitting mask, continuous positive airway pressure, and manual ventilation. I would prefer a sedate, stage 1 emergence with easy arousability, which would provide reassurance about the patient’s ability to protect his airway but at the same time not struggle. This could be accomplished with narcotics or dexmedetomidine .\n2.  2.\n    Depending on the degree of stridor, management will likely be medical, with standard nebulized racemic epinephrine.

These are  删除换行1 typical symptoms of end stage kidney failure.\n\n【28】The elevated urea and creatinine levels confirm renal failure but do not distinguish between  删除换行1 acute and chronic renal failure. Usually, in the former, there is evidence of either a systemic  删除换行1 illness or some other obvious precipitating cause (e.g. use of nephrotoxic drugs/prolonged  删除换行1 episode of hypotension), whereas in the latter there is a prolonged history of general malaise.\nIf the patient has had previous blood tests measuring serum creatinine, these will be informative about the progression of deterioration of renal function. In this patient, the anaemia  删除换行1 and hyperparathyroidism (raised alkaline phosphatase) are features indicating chronicity of the renal failure. The normochromic, normocytic anaemia is predominantly due to  删除换行1 erythropoietin deficiency (the kidney is the major source of erythropoietin production).\nHyperparathyroidism is a result of elevated serum phosphate levels due to decreased renal  删除换行1 clearance of phosphate and reduced vitamin D levels (the kidney is the site of hydroxylation  删除换行1 of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol to the active form 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol). A hand X-ray  删除换行1 showing the typical appearances of hyperparathyroidism (erosion of the terminal phalanges  删除换行1 and subperiosteal erosions of the radial aspects of the middle phalanges) can help to confirm  删除换行1 long-standing renal failure.\n\n【29】Renal ultrasound is the essential investigation. Ultrasound will accurately size the kidneys and identify obvious causes for renal failure, such as polycystic kidney disease or  删除换行1 obstruction causing bilateral hydronephrosis. Asymmetrically sized kidneys suggest reflux  删除换行1 nephropathy or renovascular disease. In this case, ultrasound showed two small (8 cm) 删除换行1 echogenic kidneys consistent with long-standing renal failure. A renal biopsy in this case  删除换行1 is not appropriate as biopsies of small kidneys have a high incidence of bleeding complications, and the sample obtained would show extensive glomerular and tubulointerstitial  删除换行1 fibrosis and may not identify the original disease. The patient’s renal failure may have been  删除换行1 due to hypertension or a primary glomerulonephritis such as immunoglobulin A (IgA) 删除换行1 nephropathy. African-Caribbeans are more prone to develop hypertensive renal failure  删除换行1 than other racial groups.\n\n【30】Antihypertensive medications are needed to treat her blood pressure adequately, oral phosphate binders and vitamin D preparations to control her secondary hyperparathyroidism,  删除换行1 and erythropoietin injections to treat her anaemia. The case raises the dilemma of whether  删除换行1 dialysis is appropriate in this patient. Hospital-based haemodialysis and home-based peritoneal dialysis are the options available. Her age and comorbid illnesses preclude renal transplantation. Conservative management without dialysis may be appropriate in this case.\n\n【31】KEY POINTS\n\n【32】•\tPatients often become symptomatic due to renal failure only when their glomerular  删除换行1 filtration rate (GFR) is less than 15mL/min and thus may present with end-stage renal  删除换行1 failure.\n\n【33】•\tPrevious measurements of serum creatinine enable the rate of deterioration of renal  删除换行1 function to be known.\n\n【34】•\tRenal ultrasound is the key imaging investigation.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

He is sitting there playing happily with one of his toys and you’re eating popcorn from a small bowl. The phone rings and you get up to find where you left your phone, leaving Jordan on the floor. While you’re up, Jordan becomes curious and he reaches into the bowl of popcorn and grabs a piece. He puts it into his mouth, just as he had seen you do, but he cannot chew it and it gets caught in the back of his throat. Jordan starts coughing, but the popcorn is really stuck and it’s not coming out. Meanwhile, you return with your phone to see him struggling, unable to breathe. You scream—your worst nightmare is coming true! You pick him up and start hitting his back to try to dislodge the piece of popcorn, but it’s not working. Jordan is not able to breathe. He is turning a bluish gray color because he can’t get any oxygen, and you see his eyes close. You’re in a panic now… heart racing, sweating, feeling dizzy. What’s happening!? Can this be it? Is Jordan going to die? Why did you leave him there with the popcorn? No one else is home and you’re completely overwhelmed with panic. All sorts of things race through your head as you try desperately to save your son. You’re holding Jordan’s lifeless body as you dial 911 and explain what’s happening. But the voice on the other end is saying it will take 15 minutes to get an ambulance to your house. You know that it will be too late. Jordan will be gone by then….\n\n【5】Jennifer read this scene into her smart phone and practiced listening to the recording for the remainder of the session. Rather than keeping track of subjective anxiety levels, the therapist kept track of Jennifer’s expectations of being able to tolerate thinking about this scene as well as the anxiety and the distress that it provoked. As the exposure began, Jennifer believed that she would only be able to “handle” thinking about this scene for a few minutes. But after a few minutes, she realized that she could manage it, despite the distress it provoked. After about 30 min of listening to the scene, Jennifer was able to articulate that although the thought was very distressing, she could think about it and recognized that the probability of such an event was acceptably low—although not zero. After about 40 min, the therapist left the office and allowed Jennifer to practice confronting the thought on her own. Again, Jennifer exceeded her expectations for tolerating the thought on her own. At the end of the session, Jennifer felt very good about completing the exercise and was instructed to practice the same task once each day between sessions. At the end of each treatment session, Jennifer chose an item from the exposure list to practice confronting during the next session (some of which included bringing Jordan to the session).\n\n【6】Jack’s Involvement in Treatment\n\n【7】Jack attended several exposure sessions in which the therapist taught him how to play the role of “coach” and offer emotional support to Jennifer as she completed exposure practices within and outside the sessions. Jack was also taught how to provide gentle, but firm reminders to Jennifer not to engage in avoidance or rituals. The emphasis was placed on helping Jennifer tolerate and “get through” the obsessional anxiety, as opposed to trying to immediately alleviate this distress. The therapist also helped Jennifer and Jack to use two types of communication skills when dealing with OCD-related matters between sessions. The first skill involved “sharing thoughts and feelings” or emotional expressiveness training (EET) in which the couple was taught to discuss with one another how they feel (as opposed to offering solutions) during exposure, while also listening effectively to each other. The second skill involved learning how to make decisions as a couple around choosing and implementing exposure tasks, and resisting rituals 删除10：<u>(Abramowitz et al. 2013 ; Epstein and Baucom 2002 )</u>.\n\n【8】Because Jennifer had a history of occasionally manipulating Jack into providing reassurance, the therapist explained the deleterious effects of such accommodation, noting that while well intended, “helping” Jennifer alleviate her anxiety by providing assurances served to maintain obsessional fear. Next, the therapist helped the couple develop a list of activities which had become hampered by OCD and then use the decision-making skills learned earlier to choose how to handle these situations by promoting the idea of exposure, rather than relying on avoidance and compulsive rituals. In other words, the couple was instructed in how to build ERP techniques into their everyday life and functioning as a couple. For example, Jennifer and Jack resumed sleeping in their own bedroom, and Jack stopped checking on Jordan whenever Jennifer had obsessional fears that he might not be safe in his crib. The therapist’s aim was to help Jennifer and Jack to work toward a life in which they confront the situations and stimuli that Jennifer had been avoiding in order to teach Jennifer how to tolerate anxiety and uncertainty.\n\n【9】Sessions 12–16\n\n【10】Over the course of the next month, Jennifer practiced CT and ERP. She quickly recognized how effective it was to confront her fears, rather than avoid, and diligently completed all in-session and homework assignments. She and Jack worked extremely well together and were able to reclaim the life they had before Jennifer’s anxiety had taken over. After 4 months of treatment, Jennifer reported that her depressive symptoms had improved greatly and her BDI score at session 16 was only 5 (an 82 % reduction in depressive symptoms). Moreover, she had resumed sharing with Jack the caretaking responsibilities for Jordan. She was no longer avoiding being alone with Jordan, and the couple was no longer arguing about OCD-related matters. Checking and reassurance-seeking behavior had almost disappeared, and although Jennifer occasionally experienced negative thoughts about Jordan, she was able to tolerate these and recognize that the risks of catastrophic consequences were acceptably low. Her YBOCS severity score at session 16 was 9 (a 67 % reduction in OCD symptoms). With input from both Jennifer and Jack, it was decided that for the next 3 months, Jennifer would see the therapist on a monthly basis for follow-up sessions. Jennifer continued to remain improved through this time, and treatment was therefore terminated.\n\n【11】Complicating Factors\n--------------------\n\n【12】### Religious Scrupulosity and Fear of Sin\n\n【13】In session 6, when Jennifer and her therapist first began applying CT techniques to her unwanted thoughts, Jennifer described that while these techniques made sense for challenging depressive thoughts, she was hesitant to apply what she had learned to her OCD symptoms. Specifically, she told her therapist that her Christian background had taught her that thoughts are morally equivalent to actions and that therefore thinking of something immoral was the same as committing an immoral act 删除10：<u>(i.e. moral thought–action fusion; Shafran et al. 1996 )</u>. She could recall several biblical passages that exemplified the importance of control over thoughts in order to avoid sin and punishment.\n\n【14】Jennifer and her therapist discussed the definition of sinful behavior. Jennifer said she had learned that a sin is something a person does that he or she (a) does deliberately, (b) knows is wrong, and (c) does not feel remorseful about. When Jennifer was asked to evaluate her intrusive thoughts against this definition, she recognized differences, but said that she could not be sure whether God was upset with her for having the thoughts she had. Thus, for Jennifer, the mere possibility that her obsessions meant that she is an immoral person and may do something to hurt her child, provoked high levels of anxiety and distress. They discussed how no one, including other practicing Christians, really knows for sure whether God is upset with them and therefore must accept such things on faith. It was explained that OCD had led Jennifer to essentially “lose her faith in faith.” Thus, the therapist framed the purpose of cognitive restructuring and exposure as helping Jennifer to become a more faithful Christian. This would involve exposure to external (actual stimuli and situations) and internal (i.e. thoughts) triggers of religious obsessions to give her opportunities to confront such stimuli and learn healthier and more productive responses to them. Jennifer said that this explanation made sense to her and that she was willing to give cognitive restructuring and exposure a try .\n\n【15】### Intolerance of a Partner’s Distress\n\n【16】While Jack seemed to understand the rationale for exposure and was able to adhere to the guidelines during in-session exposure practice, he described that it was difficult for him to resist providing reassurance when obsessional triggers would provoke Jennifer’s anxiety in their daily life. Jack said that in those moments (e.g. when Jennifer would call him at work asking him to calm her fears that she was developing schizophrenia), he knew that reassuring her was contrary to the treatment model, but that it felt wrong to withhold comfort from Jennifer when he knew what he needed to say in order for her to feel better. He also said he hated to see Jennifer feeling so distressed all the time and was even concerned that too much anxiety could harm Jennifer. The therapist reemphasized that although providing reassurance seemed like the right thing to do when Jennifer was very anxious, that this would only relieve Jennifer’s anxiety in the moment, and in the long-term it would fuel her OCD and keep her from learning to tolerate her obsessions and learn skills for managing these situations on her own. Furthermore, because accommodation had become the primary means by which Jack would express care and concern for Jennifer, the therapist helped the couple redefine the ways in which they showed affection and love for one another so that they continue to feel emotionally close while reducing accommodation. For example, Jack and Jennifer decided to have a weekly date night on Thursdays, now that Jennifer was feeling more and more capable of being away from Jordan, in order to focus on the two of them as a couple (outside of OCD). Jack said that these types of activities gave him the strength to resist accommodating Jennifer’s OCD because he felt like overall he was becoming a better partner.\n\n【17】Conclusions and Key Practice Points\n-----------------------------------\n\n【18】Jennifer’s case illustrates the use of CBT for OCD with comorbid depression. Table 25.3 highlights several key practice points we feel were important in the success of Jennifer’s course of therapy and are important to consider in the treatment of this comorbidity pattern. In particular, CT methods for depression and OCD symptoms were used to augment traditional ERP procedures. Given Jennifer’s helplessness and hopelessness at baseline, it is likely that she would have had difficulty with adherence (if not discontinued therapy altogether) if ERP had been begun immediately. Consequently, ERP was delayed to a point in treatment that is significantly later than in typical implementation. Instead, by the introduction of CT first, she had the opportunity (a) to establish rapport with her therapist, (b) to see that the therapist understood her OCD symptoms, (c) to understand her own symptoms better, and (d) to develop cognitive coping strategies to reduce her depressive symptoms and prepare for ERP exercises. It is interesting to speculate whether these factors contributed to her engagement in the more difficult aspects of the therapy. Indeed, some have advocated that CT strategies be used routinely to help patients confront feared situations during exposure 删除10：<u>(e.g. Kozak 1999 )</u>.\nTable 25.3 删除换行 Key practice points in the treatment of comorbid OCD and depression\n\n| Assess for the temporal nature of the relationship between OCD and depression |\n| --- |\n| Consider adding cognitive therapy for depression and OCD before starting with exposure and response prevention |\n| Consider involving a spouse, partner, or other support person in treatment |\n| Use an inhibitory learning approach to exposure and help the patient to learn fear tolerance, as opposed to relying on habituation of anxiety as an indicator of success |\n\n【20】Another important practice point was the inclusion of Jennifer’s husband, Jack, in treatment. The reestablishment of healthy ways of relating was viewed as important for (a) the reduction of accommodation behavior that maintained Jennifer’s OCD symptoms and (b) reducing Jennifer’s depression symptoms by alleviating the distress in her relationship with Jack.\n\n【21】Jennifer’s depression was quite straightforward and clearly secondary to her OCD. That is, she was primarily depressed about having obsessional thoughts about the very subject that was most important to her—her newborn baby. Very likely, the reduction in her OCD symptoms in the middle and later stages of treatment resulted in further improvements in her depression. It is likely that many patients with postpartum depression also experience obsessional thoughts and indeed OCD, but present with depressive complaints because postpartum OCD is less recognizable than postpartum depression 删除10：<u>(e.g. Fairbrother and Abramowitz 2007 )</u>. In some instances, however, patients’ depressive symptoms represent primary disorders, which transcend the distress associated with OCD. For example, one patient we evaluated had experienced depression for several years before the onset of her OCD. An important question is whether patients whose depressive symptoms are related to the distress or functional impairment associated with OCD would fare better in CBT for OCD when compared to patients for whom OCD and depression represent truly unrelated diagnoses.\n\n【22】In summary, although research demonstrates that ERP is the best available treatment for OCD, the presence of comorbid disorders may interfere with its strong effects. In particular, severely depressed OCD patients tend not to fare as well with ERP as do nondepressed patients. The introduction of CT techniques is one strategy that might improve depressed OCD patients’ response to exposure therapy. Given that SRI medications are effective in the treatment of OCD, pharmacotherapy might also be suggested in such cases.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

She had a retroverted uterus without any abnormality and multiple cysts on the left ovary indicative of polycystic ovarian syndrome.\n\n【3】To rule PCOS in or out， evaluating androgens is recommended， along with a hemoglobin A1c to evaluate insulin resistance. Hypothyroidism can be diagnosed with a TSH level. Serum prolactin and DHEA are needed to rule in or rule out the suspicion of hyperprolactinemia. Since Annette reported being sexually active without a form of contraception， getting an HCG is wise. Other labs for routine health maintenance include a vitamin D level， HIV test， and urinalysis. In addition to laboratory studies， a transvaginal ultrasound is needed to evaluate for the presence of ovarian abnormalities. An abdominal ultrasound can also help pinpoint the cause of the abdominal pain.\n\n【4】What is the most likely differential diagnosis and why?\n\n【5】H. pylori infection and PCOS\n\n【6】Since the laboratory studies give a positive result， we can conclude that Annette's abdominal pain is at least in part due to an H. pylori infection. The ultrasound reveals that she does have gallstones， though her LFTs are within normal limits and her constellation of symptoms do not suggest an acute gallstone emergency. While her symptoms do still fall under the possible realm of GERD， it is likely that the plan to eradicate the H. pylori infection will include gastric acid suppression， therefore alle-viating the shared symptoms.\n\n【7】It is now commonly known that greater than 95% of duodenal ulcers and greater than 90% of gastric ulcers are caused by an infection by the bacterium H. pylori. Other causes of aggravation of peptic ulcer disease include stress， smoking， alcohol， and coffee. H. pylori affects the mucosal defenses 删除换行1 by attaching to the epithelium， causing apoptosis and an inflammatory response. This leads to increased gastric acid production， increased pepsin secretion， and a decrease in mucosal defense. Symptoms of peptic ulcer disease include intermittent epigastric pain that can last for days at a time and then be absent for months. The pain is most often relieved by antacids.\n\n【8】Annette's secondary amenorrhea， hirsutism， acne， and obesity reflect a constellation of symptoms associated with PCOS. PCOS affects 5%-7% of women， and many symptoms overlap with those of metabolic syndrome. Since PCOS is a condition of hyperandrogenism， it would explain Annette's increased male-pattern hair growth and her acne. PCOS is a clinical diagnosis based on 2 of the fol-lowing criteria： 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> oligo or anovulation， 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> hyperandrogenism or hyperandrogenemia， or 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> poly-cystic ovaries. Lab studies for PCOS would show androgen elevation， decreased sex hormone binding globulin， increased LH， low-normal FSH， and hyperinsulinemia.\n\n【9】PCOS is the most likely diagnosis given the subjective reports of Annette， coupled with the objec-tive laboratory study and ultrasound findings. While the Rotterdam criteria for diagnosis only require2 of the 3 diagnostic criteria， Annette meets all 3， along with the very common constellation of signs and symptoms. At least 50% of women with PCOS also have marked insulin resistance， which is seen with Annette as demonstrated by her A1c level. Due to the overlap with metabolic syndrome， she will find herself at risk for cardiovascular disease and diabetes mellitus. The condition of PCOS also has repercussions for fertility， as anovulation is among the symptoms. While there is a great deal about PCOS that is still unknown， the common treatment approach is the correction of hyperinsu-linemia via either weight loss， medications， or both.\n\n【10】Hypothyroidism can be ruled out due to the normal TSH level. The shared symptoms of hair growth， weight gain， and menstrual irregularities can also be explained by PCOS. Though Annette does not appear to have this disorder， hypothyroidism can be easily treated with exogenous thyroid hormone replacement. Monitoring is required and dose adjustments may be needed to assure a con-stant euthyroid state， but many individuals with the disease only require daily maintenance medication.\n\n【11】While the lab results show that Annette does in fact have hyperprolactinemia， knowing that it often occurs with PCOS suggests that Annette has both disorders. The treatment approach would be to address the PCOS first and hope that both states are normalized through a streamlined treatment.\n\n【12】1\\. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)： Epigastric abdominal pain exacerbated by high-fat foods is a common complaint of individuals with reflux. Heartburn， regurgitation， and difficulty swallowing often accompany the abdominal pain. The physical exam of someone with GERD can often be negative， while other times dental erosion is seen and epigastric tenderness is noted. Contributing lifestyle factors to GERD include tobacco use， alcohol use， excessive chocolate inges-tion， high-fat meals， and high-carbohydrate meals.\n\n【13】2\\. Cholecystitis： The fact that a previous practitioner noted gallstones on an ultrasound sug-gests that Annette’s abdominal pain could be caused by an acute gallbladder infection. Cholecys-titis is often hallmarked by dyspepsia， belching， bloating， and sudden onset colicky epigastric pain that is accompanied by nausea and vomiting. An acute gallstone emergency， choledo-cholithiasis， will present as recurrent pain plus mildly increased LFTs. It is possible to have asymptomatic gallstones， as well， which is often an incidental finding and does not require intervention.\n\n【14】3\\. Hypothyroidism： Annette’s unexplained weight gain， along with her goiter， dark hair， and heavy periods suggest the diagnosis of hypothyroidism. Hypothyroidism is fairly common， and occurs much more often in women than men. The disease presents with the symptoms above， along with fatigue， constipation， dry skin， and cold intolerance. On exam， besides a goiter， there may be diminished bowel sounds or delayed deep tendon reflexes. The diagnosis of hypothyroidism can be confirmed by an increased TSH level and a low or normal free T4 level.\n\n【15】4\\. Hyperprolactinemia： Hyperprolactinemia is a possible explanation for Annette's hirsutism， as prolactin stimulates androgen production， and androgen excess is the cause of excess dark hair. Other common features are amenorrhea and galactorrhea. Hyperprolactinemia often appears accompanying PCOS.\n\n【16】What is your plan of treatment?\n\n【17】The protocol for eradicating H. pylori includes antibiotics and acid suppression. Antibiotic therapy works to promote ulcer healing， prevent relapse， and decrease the need for long-term acid suppres-sion. In all cases， combination antibiotic therapy is needed due to the high rates of resistance. To suppress acid， proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are most often used. An appropriate treatment for Annette would be lansoprazole (30mg twice daily)， amoxicillin (500mg twice daily)， and clarithro-mycin (500mg twice daily) for 14 days. There are several different combination therapy suggestions ranging from 7-14 day treatments.\n\n【18】The treatment plan for Annette's PCOS should be based mostly on her symptoms. Three reasons for treatment can be considered in her case： 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> regulation of uterine bleeding and reduction in risk for endometrial hyperplasia， 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> the improvement of dermatological complaints including acne and increased dark hair growth， and 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> the correction and prevention of possible metabolic abnor-malities， including DM and cardiovascular disease. To address Annette’s irregular menstrual bleed ing， a hormonal contraceptive method should be considered based on her individual contraceptive needs and comfort level. A common starting place is the combined oral contraceptive pill (COC)， but the ring and progestin-only methods such as the implant or the hormonal IUD could also be considered.\n\n【19】To address Annette's complaint of acne and dark hair growth， an androgen receptor blocker could be considered as pharmacotherapy in an extreme circumstance. However， if looking for a more conservative treatment， choosing a combined contraceptive option would improve acne； and a cosmetic route could be chosen for the hair growth (such as bleaching， electrolysis， or laser removal).\n\n【20】The correction of any metabolic abnormalities is also of great concern， and the treatment should begin with a discussion of diet and lifestyle modifications. Many studies have shown that weight loss can lower the level of circulating androgens， thus causing the resumption of normal menstrual patterns and the reduction in insulin resistance. Since Annette's lab studies show a high hemoglobin A1c level， indicative of long-term insulin resistance， starting a hypoglycemic agent would be an acceptable adjunct therapy to lifestyle changes.\n\n【21】To address preventive health practices for Annette， starting her on daily calcium， vitamin D， and fish oil supplementation would also be appropriate.\n\n【22】It would be important to follow up with Annette after her treatment course to see if the H. pylori infection was in fact eradicated. If the infection persists， it would be appropriate to continue therapy， most likely changing antibiotics due to suspicion of resistance. If the infection was eradicated but symptoms persist for more than 4 weeks， it would be recommended to refer for a gastrointestinal specialist for endoscopic evaluation.\n\n【23】PCOS is a common condition that can be managed within the realm of primary care， so it would not be recommended that Annette be followed by a specialist. However， to evaluate progress on the treatment options discussed today， the time frame for acceptable follow-up visits would be monthlor the first 3 months and then quarterly unt yy fil specific treatment goals are reached. At the follow-upD visits， diet and exercise journals should be reviewed； and blood tests should be done to evaluate insulin resistance (hemoglobin A1c) and androgen levels (FHS， LH， testosterone). Since this is also Annette's establishment of primary care， it is important to encourage followups for routine gynecol-ogy care and other routine health maintenance.\n\n【24】What if the patient had a positive pregnancy test?\n\n【25】If Annette had a positive pregnancy te VEst， the first step would be to establish if this was a planned PIEand/or desired pregnancy. If the pregnancy is either unplanned or undesired， options counseling should be included to discuss keeping the pregnancy， adoption， and termination of the pregnancy. If Annette wanted to continue the pregnancy， she should be offered or referred to prenatal care. Since a common side effect of PCOS is the inability to conceive due to irregular cycles， she has already overcome a hurdle of the condition. The treatment for irregular menstrual bleeding would be a topic to address postpartum. Metformin is category B in pregnancy， so it would be acceptable to treat the insulin resistance concomitantly with the pregnancy.

She has tried  删除换行1 mouthwash and sucking on peppermints to relieve the symptoms. Yesterday, her husband  删除换行1 had returned home after a 9-month stint in the merchant navy. He has complained that she  删除换行1 has bad breath and is disgusted by her discoloured tongue and the patient bemoans that ‘now  删除换行1 he won’t even kiss me anymore’.\n\n【3】The patient is well-known to the surgery. She has a medical history of depression and attends  删除换行1 regularly with chest infections. She suffers from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  删除换行1 (COPD) after 40 pack-years of smoking. Her last infective COPD exacerbation was protracted, needing a second course of antibiotic treatment 2 weeks ago.\n\n【4】Examination\n\n【5】Examination of her mouth shows brown discoloration of her tongue mainly at the base, sparing the tip and the underside of the tongue 删除33：<u></u>. The tongue appears furred and  删除换行1 it seems as if there are small hairs protruding from the brown discoloured areas. Her dental  删除换行1 status is poor with one-third of her teeth missing and widespread and advanced caries in the  删除换行1 remaining teeth.\n\n【6】After the examination, the woman breaks into tears ‘I can’t go on like this. I hardly see my  删除换行1 husband and now he is rejecting me. I am afraid he might be having an affair’.\n\n【7】Questions\n\n【8】• What is the list of problems?\n\n【9】• How would you treat the brown tongue?\n\n【10】• How would you advise this woman?\n\n【11】删除3：<u>Figure 15.1 Brown tongue. (Courtesy of Jutta Warbruck, Illustrator.)</u>\n\n【12】ANSWER 15\n\n【13】Black hairy tongue (lingua villosa) is a harmless condition caused by defective desquamation of filiform papillae of unknown aetiology. Elderly and infirm patients, smokers, tea and  删除换行1 coffee drinkers, patients with a poor diet or poor dental hygiene and patients on antibiotic  删除换行1 treatment are more likely to become affected. Addressing the underlying cause often brings  删除换行1 improvement. Stopping antibiotics frequently leads to a spontaneous resolution. Increasing  删除换行1 the amount of roughage in the diet helps to prevent a recurrence of the condition. One suggested treatment for hairy tongue is to slice pineapples thinly and suck the slices for 40 seconds followed by chewing and swallowing them and to do this for 8 minutes twice daily.\nAfter 7–10 days the tongue usually returns to normal.\n\n【14】It is common for seamen to find it difficult to adjust to ‘normal’ life when returning to their  删除换行1 family after long spells at sea and this can result in relationship problems. If problems persist,  删除换行1 relationship counselling can be helpful. Some husbands prefer to escape back to work at sea  删除换行1 rather than engage in talking therapies.\n\n【15】This patient already suffers from low self-esteem and recurrent depression. In her anxiety, she  删除换行1 creates new problems by suspecting her husband of having an affair. Smoking-induced lung  删除换行1 disease and her tooth decay are strong indicators of a long history of physical self-neglect. Her  删除换行1 low self-esteem makes her an unlikely candidate to respond positively to health-promotion  删除换行1 messages. Health professionals will have urged her to stop smoking on several occasions and  删除换行1 her repeated failure to succeed will have produced a feeling that she has let herself and others  删除换行1 down. In this situation, it is important to start with easy wins. A trip to the dentist might be  删除换行1 more easily achieved than the cessation of smoking. Counselling and cognitive therapy can  删除换行1 be helpful to address her negative thoughts.\n\n【16】The episode of hairy black tongue and its probable relationship to antibiotic use is likely to  删除换行1 have a permanent shift of attitude toward the use of antibiotics for this woman. While up to  删除换行1 now antibiotic treatment might have been an easy fix for her smoking-related disease, she  删除换行1 will be more reluctant to use this medication in the future, increasing her motivation to stop  删除换行1 smoking.\n\n【17】The woman needs strong reassurance and she can be told that her brown tongue is a harmless  删除换行1 condition. In her case, there is a good chance that her hairy tongue will improve spontaneously as her antibiotic treatment finishes. The GP can suggest that the patient talk with her  删除换行1 husband and address the problems that they experience while readjusting to ‘normal’ life.\nThe patient can be offered review in a week or two to see if the tongue has returned to normal,  删除换行1 whether the relationship problems have eased and whether her mood has stabilized.\n\n【18】• At times, minor acute conditions upset patients much more than more serious  删除换行1 chronic conditions with insidious onset.\n\n【19】• It is important to consider a patient’s emotional ability to respond positively to  删除换行1 lifestyle advice.\n删除12：<u>Key Points31\n\n【20】删除29：<u>Case 16: Capacity</u>\n\n【21】</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Birthweight was 3.5 kg. Immunizations are up to date for age. Formula fed and on multivitamins every day.Past Surgical History\n---------------------\n\n【6】No prior surgeries.Family History\n--------------\n\n【7】The parents have no significant medical history. The 5‐year‐old sibling is healthy. No one is sick at home.Current Status\n--------------\n\n【8】On arrival at the ED, axillary temperature is 36.8°C (98.2°F), respiratory rate 65 breaths per minute, heart rate 165 bpm in normal sinus rhythm, blood pressure 92/68 mmHg, and pulse oximeter 99% on room air. Weight is 4.3 kg. The baby is mildly thin, pale, lethargic, and tachypneic, with mild retractions. Her skin is clear with no rashes or other significant skin lesions. Sinus tachycardia is noted on the monitor. On auscultation, a grade II/VI holosystolic murmur at the mid lower left sternal border with radiation to the cardiac apex is noted. An S4 gallop is noted at the cardiac apex. There are no rubs or clicks. The abdomen is soft, non‐distended, and non‐tender. Liver edge is palpable 3–4 cm below the right costal margin.

Based on the case presentation, what is your differential diagnosis?\n2.  Which diagnostic studies are indicated?\n\n【11】Continuation of case : Initial diagnostic studies show the following results. The complete metabolic profile is unremarkable. The complete blood count demonstrates a white blood cell count of 9000/mm <sup>3 </sup> and hemoglobin of 12.4 g/dL. The chest radiograph shows moderate cardiomegaly with mild pulmonary edema. The 12‐lead electrocardiogram (EKG) shows sinus tachycardia, and normal PR and QTc intervals with left axis deviation. Voltage evidence of biventricular hypertrophy is present. No significant Q waves or ST‐segment changes are noted.\n\n【12】1.  What additional studies are needed?\n2.  Which therapies and medications are appropriate in the management of this child?Rationale and Evidence‐based Practice Explanation\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【13】### Based on the case presentation, what is your differential diagnosis?\n\n【14】This patient has signs of cardiac failure: tachycardia, poor capillary refill, hepatomegaly, poor weight gain, and lethargy. Differential diagnosis for this child includes congestive heart failure secondary to structural heart disease, cardiomyopathy, myocarditis, arrhythmia, and anemia. The initial differential diagnosis also includes an intercurrent respiratory illness (e.g. respiratory syncytial virus).\n\n【15】### Which diagnostic studies are indicated?\n\n【16】The initial diagnostic studies will focus on evaluation of cardiac function and of infection. A complete blood count and respiratory viral panel will help determine if an infectious etiology is present; hemoglobin status is also evaluated. Blood and urine cultures may also be ordered to evaluate for infection. A complete metabolic panel can be obtained to evaluate hydration status and renal and hepatic function. A chest radiograph is needed to evaluate lung fields and heart size and an EKG is required to evaluate rhythm and voltages.\n\n【17】### What additional studies are needed?\n\n【18】An echocardiogram is necessary to evaluate underlying structural disease due to physical examination findings and cardiomegaly on chest radiograph. The echocardiogram demonstrates a large perimembranous ventricular septal defect (VSD) with non‐restrictive left‐to‐right shunting. All cardiac chambers are dilated. Left ventricular contractility is at the lower range of normal. There is no pericardial effusion. This acyanotic cardiac lesion is associated with increased pulmonary blood flow and left‐to‐right shunting, resulting in pulmonary edema and increased work of breathing (congestive heart failure).\n\n【19】### Which therapies and medications are appropriate in the management of this child?\n\n【20】Therapy is targeted at improving congestive heart failure. Pharmacologic strategies may include diuretics (e.g. furosemide), afterload‐reducing agents, and digoxin. Diuretics are often indicated to reduce total body water, alleviating cardiac workload and reducing pulmonary edema. Afterload reduction may be considered to decrease systemic vascular resistance and augment cardiac output. Most often, an angiotensin‐converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor is used to decrease systemic vascular resistance and decrease the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system which is continuously activated with CHF. Spironolactone, a weak diuretic, is often added to the regimen for potassium‐sparing effect and to augment lowering of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system. Milrinone is often used in the intensive care setting in acute new‐onset systemic ventricular dysfunction to improve cardiac output and reduce left ventricular afterload. Care must be taken to avoid hypotension as milrinone results in systemic vasodilation and may also result in some pulmonary vasodilation given its general vascular dilation effect. Digoxin may be used to treat cardiac failure in place of or to augment ACE inhibitor use. The action of digoxin is mediated through inhibition of Na <sup>+ </sup> /K <sup>+ </sup> ‐ATPase pumps, which leads to a slight increase in the force of contraction (inotropy).\n\n【21】Oxygen is not necessary for this infant; however, if respiratory support is needed, consider non‐invasive respiratory support such as continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or HFNC at the lowest oxygen concentration to maintain normal saturations. Oxygen can result in an increase in left‐to‐right shunting as it causes lowering of pulmonary vascular resistance, which can result in worsening of pulmonary edema; thus, oxygen is used cautiously in this presentation.\n\n【22】To promote growth, frequent high‐calorie feedings delivered either orally or by nasogastric tube are initiated in patients awaiting surgical management. Support from a dietitian is often needed for these children.\n\n【23】Infants with a large VSD defect and congestive heart failure are candidates for surgical repair. Medical management with diuretics, ACE inhibitors, and/or digoxin are often needed to promote growth prior to VSD repair, typically performed between 3 and 6 months of age. Over time, unrepaired, large left‐to‐right shunts (e.g. VSD) result in pulmonary artery hypertension, increased pulmonary vascular resistance, and right ventricular overload, ultimately resulting in reversal of shunt direction and Eisenmenger syndrome. Traditionally, VSDs have been closed surgically, but advances in catheter intervention procedures have expanded candidacy for transcatheter closure of perimembranous VSDs. In infants failing to achieve adequate growth/weight gain on optimized medical management and tube feedings who are not yet surgical candidates, a pulmonary artery band may be placed to restrict pulmonary blood flow and augment systemic blood flow until the child is ready for VSD closure.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

This results from damage to the glomerular capillary wall. In particular, the glomerular basement membrane is essential for maintaining serum oncotic pressure. In non-pathologic states, which of the following properties of the glomerular basement membrane prevent albumin from being freely filtered into the urine?\n\n【1】> (A) A combination of small pore size and negatively charged pore-forming molecules prevents albumin filtration\n\n【2】> (B) A combination of small pore size and positively charged pore-forming molecules prevents albumin filtration\n\n【3】> (C) Albumin is freely filtered across the basement membrane but is readily reabsorbed along the nephron\n\n【4】> (D) The positive charge of proteoglycans in the basement membrane repels albumin\n\n【5】> (E) The small size of the glomerular basement membrane pores excludes albumin molecules\n\n【6】 Answer: The correct answer is A . The glomerular basement membrane is composed of endothelial fenestrae with filtration slits lined with anionic glycoproteins on the lamina rara interna and externa. The small diameter of the filtration slits partially blocks albumin filtration physically, but the anionic charge of the barrier provides the largest obstacle to filtration by electrostatically repelling the negatively charged albumin molecules.  \nAnswer B is incorrect . This choice is incorrect because the filtration slits are lined with negatively charged anionic glycoproteins and are not positively charged. Positive charges would attract albumin and conglomerate, thereby impeding further filtration.  \nAnswer C is incorrect . Albumin is neither freely filtered by the glomerulus nor reabsorbed along the nephron.\n\n【7】Answer D is incorrect. Basement membrane proteoglycans are negatively charged, as is albumin.  \nAnswer E is incorrect . The size selectivity of the endothelial filtration slits provides an obstacle to albumin filtration, but size selectivity alone does not account for the complete absence of albumin filtration in non-pathologic states.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Congenital lymphangiomas form due to the blockage of the lymphatic system during fetal development, though the cause remains unknown. The lesions typically appear before the age of five years. Acquired lymphangiomas occur in association with chronic lymphedema that leads to disruption of previously normal lymphatic channels 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. They usually appear in adults after surgery, trauma, infection, malignancy, or radiation therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. A spontaneous occurrence has been also described. Clinically, lymphangioma is characterized by clusters of translucent or hemorrhagic vesicles resembling frog spawn located on the dull pink to violaceous skin. It ranges from small and well-demarcated malformations to large, diffuse ones with unclear borders 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. The lesions occur on any cutaneous surface or mucous membrane. The head and neck, proximal extremities, buttocks, and trunk are most commonly affected. The intestines, pancreas, and mesentery may also be involved. Lymphangioma may be associated with pruritus, pain, burning, and lymphatic drainage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Rare cases of squamous cell carcinoma, verruciform xanthoma, and lymphangiosarcoma arising within lymphangioma have been reported in the literature. In most cases, a clinical diagnosis can be made based on the history and clinical findings. Dermoscopy and histopathological examination can be used to confirm the diagnosis. Imaging may be warranted to assess the depth and extent of a lesion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. In dermoscopy, lymphangioma is characterized by the two patterns: yellow lacunae surrounded by pale septa without inclusion of blood and yellow to pink lacunae alternating with dark-red or bluish lacunae, representing the inclusion of blood 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>. Histopathology shows dilated lymphatic channels usually located in the superficial dermis, although they may extend to the reticular dermis or subcutaneous tissue. The treatment of choice for any type of lymphangioma is a surgical excision. Destructive treatments with carbon dioxide laser, long-pulsed Nd-YAG laser, and electrosurgery have been reported to be effective. Other therapeutic options include cryotherapy, superficial radiotherapy, and sclerotherapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 – 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【32】Differential diagnoses for the presented patient were basal cell carcinoma, bullous pemphigoid and linear IgA dermatosis.\n\n【33】Basal cell carcinoma is the most common skin malignancy. The incidence rate of the disease increases with age. Basal cell carcinoma presents as a tiny, hardly visible papule, growing into a nodule or a plaque that is sometimes ulcerated. The lesion is most commonly observed on the face, scalp or neck 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【34】Bullous pemphigoid is an autoimmune bullous disease that mainly affects elderly individuals, usually above 70 years. It presents as itchy, tense blisters over normal skin or over erythematous and edematous background 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【35】Linear IgA bullous dermatosis is a relatively rare subepidermal vesiculobullous disease that occurs in both adults and children. In children, annular or polycyclic plaques and papules with blistering around the edges, primarily around the mouth and eyes, on the lower abdomen, thighs, buttocks, genitals, wrists and ankles are observed. In contrast, the adult-onset form presents as lesions on the trunk, head and extremities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【36】Based on the patient’s presentation, dermoscopic and histopathological examination, the diagnosis of acquired lymphangioma with coexisted basal cell carcinoma was established. A surgical excision was recommended for basal cell carcinoma. A superficial radiotherapy for lymphangioma treatment was planned after the surgery.\n\n【37】Key Points\n\n【38】   Lymphangioma is an uncommon, benign malformation of the lymphatic system that may affect the scalp area.\n   It presents as clusters of translucent or hemorrhagic vesicles resembling frog spawn located on the dull pink to violaceous skin.\n   Basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, verruciform xanthoma, and lymphangiosarcoma may arise within lymphangioma.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

This 78-year-old man presents with GI bleeding and initial hemodynamic instability that responds only transiently to resuscitation. At this point， we are uncertain whether his bleeding is from the upper or lower GI tract. Placement of an NG tube can help us identify clearly whether the bleeding is upper GI tract in origin. CT angiography is helpful at this time because it could help us identify a site of active contrast extravasation either in the upper or lower GI tract， and once a site of contrast extravasation is seen， angi-ographic catheter-directed treatment can be carried out to stop the bleeding. Proctosigmoidoscopy and total abdominal colectomy is not a good choice for this patient because we are not certain that this bleeding is not an upper GI source， and emergency “blind\"total abdominal colectomy is a strategy that is associated with potentially significant morbidity and mortality. EGD and 删除换行1 colonoscopy are good diagnostic strategies for a stable patient with GI bleed-ing， but for this patient who is actively bleeding and unstable，endoscopy with sedation may not be well-tolerated by the patient. NG tube and mesenteric angiography is a reasonable strategy； however， given the intermittent pattern of most GI bleeding patients， angiography without knowing an anatomic site of contrast extravasation and active bleeding， the angiography often will need to perform 3-vessel angiography (celiac， superior mesenteric， and inferior mesenteric arteries) that is more time consuming and involving significantly greater amount of intravenous contrast injection. Capsular endoscopy is a time-consuming process and is not appropriate in a patient with active overt bleeding and unstable.\n\n【38】23.2 B. Aorto-enteric fistula 3 years after abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. The cause of bleeding in this case is related to the close proximity between the aor-tic graft and the overlying 3rd or 4th portion of the duodenum and erosion of the graft into the duodenum followed by chemical/ bacterial involvement causing a leak from the aorta. Bleeding associated with this process is painless and often intermittent before exsanguination occurs. The intermittent nature of the bleeding is described as\"herald bleeding.Ulcerative colitis， duodenal ulcer， and ischemic colitis are often associated with pain. Superior mesenteric artery embolus causes the sudden-onset of ischemic pain， and bleeding is generally a secondary complaint that sets in after ischemic necrosis occurs.\n\n【39】23.3A. Mesenteric angiography is the most specific modality in identifying the site of lower GI bleeding. This modality is less sensitive for bleeding identi-fication because in order to visualize contrast extravasation， the patient has to be actively bleeding at a rate greater than 0.5 to 1.0 mL/min during the angiographic study. Tagged RBC scan is highly sensitive in visualizing bleed-ing (rate> 0.1 mL/min)； however， this study is not very specific in identify-ing the anatomic site of bleeding. Surgical exploration is frequently unable to identify the bleeding site， because the bleeding sites are often not associated with gross findings that can be seen during an operation. Barium enema is not useful at all for identification of bleeding because most lower GI bleed-ing etiologies are not associated with specific mucosal contour abnormali-ties. CT scan with oral and intravenous contrast is not helpful for lower GI bleeding identification， because intraluminal contrast interferes with visual-ization of contrast extravasation into the lumen.\n\n【40】23.4E. This 62-year-old man has lower GI bleeding of unknown source. His bleeding at this point does not appear life-threatening. Upper GI endoscopy is negative， and the colonoscopy reveals only diverticulosis and no bleeding source. Observation is the most appropriate choice for this patient. If his bleeding remains resolved， he should probably have a capsular endoscopy performed as an outpatient to rule out possible small bowel bleeding sources such as small bowel gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST).\n\n【41】23.5 D. This 63-year-old man with prior history of abdominal aneurysm repair comes in with GI bleeding. Even though the probability is low that an aorto-duodenal fistula is the source of bleeding， unrecognized and untreated bleed-ing from aorto-enteric fistula is uniformly lethal. The location of the fistula in the GI tract is most commonly in the 3rd or 4th portion of the duode-num. An upper endoscopy to evaluate this area is the best choice listed. Some groups have advocated doing a CT scan to try to identify inflammation or air near or around the aortic graft. Angiography is not as useful because it only visualizes intra-arterial anatomic abnormalities and contrast extravasation that may not be active during the angiography.\n\n【42】23.6 C. A 73-year-old woman presents with fever， abdominal pain， and passage of bloody stools. Her physical examination reveals nonfocal tenderness of the left side of the abdomen. There is no evidence of peritonitis. This patient most likely has ischemic colitis， which is the most common form of intestinal ischemia. The process is most common in patients over the age of 65. The disease can range from mild， self-limiting mucosal ischemia， to severe trans-mural infarction that requires surgical resection. Fortunately， only about 20%of the patients with ischemic colitis require surgical resection. This patients clinical presentation does not suggest that surgical inter vention is needed at this point. A colonoscopy to assess the severity of ischemic changes in the colon is appropriate at this time. If pale mucosa with superficial ulcerations is visualized during colonoscopy， the patient can then be treated with non-operative treatment that includes bowel rest， intravenous antibiotics， and intravenous fluids. However， if colonoscopy reveals transmural necrosis， the patient will need exploratory laparotomy with colectomy. A CT scan can be performed to look for signs of perforation， such as free air and pneumato-sis， but this study is most useful with the administration of intravenous and intraluminal contrast.\n\n【43】23.7 C. A 58-year-old woman with history of hypertension， osteoarthritis and NSAID usage presents with melena (or passage of tarry stools)， which is most suggestive of relatively slow upper GI bleeding as melena represents degradation of hemoglobin by bacteria in the GI tract. NSAID use in women is associated with a significant increase in risk of gastritis and gastric ulcer-ations； therefore， EGD followed by colonoscopy is the most appropriate choice in this situation.\n\n【44】CLINICALPEARLS\n\n【45】》The primary goals in the treatment ofa patient with acute and continued lower bleeding are maintaining hemodynamic stability with resuscita-tion and then localizing the bleeding site.\n\n【46】》The ability to localize the bleeding site during an abdominal exploration is greatly compromised. Exploration ofthe abdomen should be avoided prior to precise localization ofthe bleeding site.\n\n【47】》(CT angiography and colonoscopy are the two most commonly used ini-tial diagnostic studies in patients with overt lower GIbleeding. Visceral angiography and selective embolization techniques have evolved greatly during the past decade， and this has become the pre-ferred treatment modality in some institutions.》Surgery is rarely needed for patients with acute lower GIbleeding，and it is most useful after a bleeding site has been localized. It remains unclear 删除换行1 whether surgical resection or angiographic embolization is the better 删除换行1 treatment option for patients with localized lower GIbleeding.\n\n【48】Whenever a patient with a history of prior abdominal aortic reconstruc-tion presents with GIbleeding， the priority is to rule out an aortic-enteric fistula as the source ofbleeding.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Causes of lymphocytosis  删除换行1 include: \n\n【19】•\t Infection, both acute (e.g. infectious mononucleosis, mumps, herpes simplex/zoster,  删除换行1 and HIV) and chronic (tuberculosis and syphilis)\n•\t Inflammation \n\n【20】•\t Chronic lymphoid leukaemias, most commonly chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL)\n•\t Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL)\n• Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma \n\n【21】In the absence of symptoms (such as features of infection) and signs (such as lymphadenopathy and organomegaly), and with normal thyroid function, the most likely diagnosis in this  删除换行1 case is CLL. This is corroborated by the blood film shown in Figure 60.1, which shows  删除换行1 increased numbers of small, mature lymphocytes with scant cytoplasm. As these cells are  删除换行1 fragile, they may be disrupted in the process of making smears, giving rise to ‘smudge cells’  删除换行1 that are seen in film. Immunophenotyping is required to confirm the diagnosis of CLL, and  删除换行1 the phenotype of CD5, CD20 and CD23 positivity is characteristic of CLL.\nCLL is the most common leukaemia in the Western world. Typically, it is picked up via  删除换行1 an incidental lymphocytosis in an asymptomatic individual. Diagnosis requires an absolute  删除换行1 lymphocytosis of at least 5 × 109/L and an appropriate lymphocyte immunophenotype.\nCommon cytogenetic abnormalities in CLL include deletions of chromosomes 11, 13 and 17  删除换行1 (del 11q, del 13q, del 17p), as well as trisomy 12. About 50% of cases also show evidence of  删除换行1 somatic hypermutation of the immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene (IGVH).\n删除3：<u>Figure 60.1 Blood film showing increased numbers of small, mature lymphocytes with scant  删除换行1 cytoplasm.

Case 60: Raised White Cell Count in an Asymptomatic Individual 163 </u>\n\n【22】The disease is staged according to the Binet classification. Typically, patients with Binet stage \n\n【23】A disease require no immediate treatment. Symptomatic stage B and all stage C patients  删除换行1 receive chemotherapy. Options for treatment include conventional chemotherapy combined  删除换行1 with immunotherapy, e.g. fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and rituximab (FCR) or more  删除换行1 targeted treatments, e.g. ibrutinib (inhibitor of BTK enzyme) or venetoclax (inhibitor of  删除换行3 BCL2). The aim of the treatment is generally disease control rather than cure. Younger  删除换行1 patients with refractory disease may be considered for allogeneic stem cell transplantation,  删除换行1 which is potentially curative but has a significant morbidity and mortality rate.\nThe patient’s blood results at 3 years highlight an important complication of CLL. They show  删除换行1 a normocytic anaemia (as well as a marked lymphocytosis). The latter represents progression  删除换行1 of CLL, but the absence of neutropenia and thrombocytopenia suggests that marrow infiltration is not severe. However, taken together with the positive direct antiglobulin test (DAT),  删除换行1 the most likely explanation for the anaemia is haemolytic (immune mediated). Autoimmune  删除换行1 haemolytic anaemia is sometimes seen in CLL as a result of autoantibody generation by  删除换行1 lymphocytes against red blood cells. This produces pallor (due to anaemia) and icterus (as a  删除换行1 result of increased destruction of red cells, leading to an unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia).\nNot all patients require treatment. Adverse prognostic features include stage B or C disease  删除换行1 at diagnosis, male gender, rapid lymphocyte doubling time (<1 year), presence of del 11q and  删除换行1 del 17p, TP53 mutation, trisomy 12, positivity for CD38 expression and high ZAP-70 expression.

After his missed appointments, the clinic nurse contacted Mr. Hall and provided information to him on how to arrange transportation to and from his office visits through the Medicaid transportation services, which he used today. He brought all of his medication bottles to the clinic visit. Upon medication review, it is noted that several pill bottles are empty. Mr. Hall noted he was not able to pick up his medications from the pharmacy and has been out of Furosemide and Carvedilol for three days. He was receiving sacubitril/valsartan (Entresto) though patient assistance before he qualified for disability and has a few more months of this service.

She is 10 days  删除换行1 postpartum following a normal vaginal delivery and is complaining of a 2-day history  删除换行1 of palpitations. She is not experiencing any chest pain, shortness of breath or cough. Her  删除换行1 husband is worried as he says that she is behaving differently. He tells you that she has been  删除换行1 quite withdrawn at home and tearful at times. Recently she has also been expressing worries  删除换行1 that someone might come to take her baby away. She says she feels constantly anxious and has  删除换行1 been unable to sleep for a week. She is fearful that something may happen to her baby. It was  删除换行1 an unplanned pregnancy and the baby is being bottle-fed. She is normally fit and well and has  删除换行1 no past medical history. Her brother is on treatment for schizophrenia.\n\n【3】Examination\n\n【4】She is afebrile with a regular heart rate of 75 bpm and blood pressure of 127/75 mmHg. She  删除换行1 is saturating at 99% on room air. She appears thin and fatigued. She does not maintain eye  删除换行1 contact and appears restless. The baby starts crying during the consultation and the mother  删除换行1 is not responsive. She does not make any contact with the baby or make any attempt to calm  删除换行1 him down.\n\n【5】Questions\n\n【6】1. What is the most likely diagnosis?\n\n【7】2. How should she be investigated?\n\n【8】3. How should she be managed and who should be involved in her care?\n\n【9】DISCUSSION\nThis woman is most likely suffering from postpartum psychosis. This is a severe episode of  删除换行1 mental illness that begins in the days or weeks following delivery and is considered a psychiatric emergency. It is rare and affects 1–2 in 1000 women who have a baby. According to the  删除换行5 Confidential Enquiries into Maternal Deaths, suicide in pregnancy and up to 1 year postpartum is the leading cause of maternal death in the United Kingdom. Contributing to this is  删除换行1 the lack of recognition of high-risk patients, delayed diagnosis and failure to manage these  删除换行1 patients appropriately. Many women may not have any risk factors; however, some may have a  删除换行1 previous history of postpartum psychosis, a pre-existing psychotic illness or a family history  删除换行1 of mental illness. Women with bipolar disorder are particularly at risk.\n\n【10】Symptoms may be very varied and can change and evolve rapidly. Women often have symptoms of depression or mania. Some may be anxious, agitated and irritable, and some may have  删除换行1 difficulty sleeping. Women may be withdrawn or more talkative with loss of inhibitions and  删除换行1 flight of ideas. There may be symptoms and signs of paranoia, delusions or hallucinations.\n\n【11】Postpartum psychosis should not be confused with postnatal blues (also known as ‘baby  删除换行1 blues’). This is characterised by mild mood changes, including fatigue, anxiety, depression,  删除换行1 irritability and tearfulness, which often peaks around day 4 or 5 postnatally. It is usually selflimiting and is very common, occurring in around 50% of new mothers.\n\n【12】Postpartum depression occurs in around 10% of postnatal women and involves the normal  删除换行1 symptoms of depression such as low mood, loss of interest, loss of appetite, insomnia and  删除换行1 feelings of worthlessness or guilt. The symptoms of depression must be present daily for at  删除换行1 least 2 weeks to make this diagnosis.\n\n【13】Anaemia and hypothyroidism are other causes of fatigue and low mood. Causes of palpitations must also be considered in this patient including cardiac arrhythmias, hyperthyroidism  删除换行1 and panic disorder.\n\n【14】Blood tests including full blood count, electrolytes, thyroid function and magnesium should  删除换行1 be performed to investigate for anaemia, thyroid dysfunction and electrolyte imbalance as a  删除换行1 cause of palpitations. An electrocardiogram should also be performed in anyone complaining of palpitations.\nThis patient needs admission and immediate referral to the on-call psychiatrist for stabilisation with psychotropic medications or in some cases even sedation. The perinatal mental health midwife should also be informed of this patient’s admission and will need to be  删除换行1 involved her care. She will also need an urgent referral to the Mother and Baby Psychiatric  删除换行5 Unit for further specialist assessment and management. The Obstetric Consultant in charge  删除换行1 of this patient’s care must be made aware of the case.\nThis is a psychiatric emergency. Accurate and timely diagnosis and management are essential to avoid harm to both the mother and the baby. For those with thoughts of harm to self  删除换行1 or others who do not consent to treatment, involuntary admission and treatment under the  删除换行5 Mental Health Act or Mental Capacity Act may be required. Urgent transfer to a Mother and \n\n【15】Baby Unit will help provide the supervision and support that is required in such cases.\nCase 97: Postpartum palpitations\n\n【16】Key Points\n\n【17】• Postpartum psychosis is a psychiatric emergency.\n\n【18】• Assessment should be a thorough clinical examination and investigations to rule  删除换行1 out organic causes.\n\n【19】• The patient may need admission and treatment under the Mental Health Act or \n\n【20】Mental Capacity Act.\n\n【21】• Multidisciplinary assessment and treatment with obstetricians, midwives and mental health team are essential.删除9：<u>http://taylorandfrancis.com341</u>\n\n【22】MEDICOLEGAL", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Which of the following would confirm the most likely diagnosis?\n\n【1】> (A) Large lysosome vesicles in neutrophils on light microscopy\n\n【2】> (B) Low levels of IgM but elevated levels of IgE and IgA\n\n【3】> (C) Low levels of IgM, IgE, and IgA\n\n【4】> (D) Negative nitroblue tetrazolium dye reduction test\n\n【5】> (E) Positive nitroblue tetrazolium dye reduction test\n\n【6】 Answer: The correct answer is D . This patient has chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), which usually presents with an increased susceptibility to opportunistic bacterial and fungal infections. It results from defective neutrophil phagocytosis due to a lack of NADPH oxidase (or similar enzyme) activity. A decrease in free radical production because of this enzyme deficiency renders host neutrophils sensitive to catalase-producing organisms (notably Staphylococcus aureus, Candida albicans, Aspergillus flavus, Escherichia coli , and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) , because catalase breaks down free radicals. To confirm the diagnosis, nitroblue tetrazolium (a yellow liquid) is added to a sample of the patient’s blood. In patients with normal levels of NADPH oxidase, there is a positive result as the neutrophils reduce the nitroblue tetrazolium and a dark blue granular substance precipitates in their cytoplasm. Patients with CGD have a negative result: the cytoplasm of their neutrophils remains colorless despite the addition of nitroblue tetrazolium.  \nAnswer A is incorrect . Large lysosome vesicles in neutrophils are characteristic of Chédiak-Higashi disease, an autosomal recessive condition that presents with recurrent streptococcal and staphylococcal infections. A defect in lysosomal emptying of phagocytic cells due to microtubular dysfunction is the underlying cause of the disease.  \nAnswer B is incorrect . Low IgM levels with elevated IgE and IgA levels are characteristic of Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, an X-linked disorder resulting in a cytoskeletal defect that affects immune cells and reduces the body’s ability to mount an IgM response to bacteria. Recurrent pyogenic infections, eczema, and thrombocytopenia are the typical triad of symptoms. Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome does not present with any specific enzyme abnormality.  \nAnswer C is incorrect . Low levels of IgM, IgE, and IgA are characteristic of Bruton agammaglobulinemia and of the severe combined immunodeficiency syndromes. In both instances, levels of all immunoglobulin isotypes are decreased. Bruton agammaglobulinemia is an X-linked defect in a tyrosine kinase involved in B lymphocyte development. Patients have normal T lymphocytes and a low number of B lymphocytes. Severe combined immunodeficiency is a defect in early differentiation of immune cells. Patients usually have a low number of T lymphocytes and a normal number of B lymphocytes.  \nAnswer E is incorrect . A positive nitroblue tetrazolium dye reduction test is present in patients with normal neutrophils, which are able to reduce the nitroblue tetrazolium. This causes a dark blue precipitate in their cytoplasm.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Following a lengthy hospital stay and recovery period， he discovers that he is no longer able to play the piano with the same ease and grace that he did prior to the accident. Even after extensive practice and retraining， he is still unable to play at the same level as before. Which of the following inputs to the cerebellum is thought to play a key role in motor learning!\n\n【13】AExcitatory input from mossy fibersB\n\n【14】Inhibitory input from mossy fibers\n\n【15】C.Excitatory input from climbing fibers\n\n【16】D. Inhibitory input from climbing fibers\n\n【17】26.4A 25-year-old woman with a 12-month history of headaches and a 3-month history of “clumsiness walking”is being evaluated.

Brain tumor\n\n【23】Vascular disorder\n\n【24】26.1B. This patient has right-sided cerebellar symptoms： difficulty with fine movements and past pointing on finger-to-nose testing. Since the cerebellar hemispheres affect movement in the limbs， and the cerebellum acts ipsilater-ally， the defect must be in the right cerebellar hemisphere. A left-side lesion would cause left-sided symptoms， and a lesion in the midline would cause truncal and gait ataxia. The rest of this girl’s symptoms are explained by mass effect from the tumor causing increased intracranial pressure (ICP)， which causes headaches， vomiting， lethargy， and papilledema.\n\n【25】26.2 A. The primary outflow from the cerebellum is through the deep nuclei(dentate， emboliform， globose， and fastigial). The lateral cerebellar hemispheres project to the dentate nucleus； the intermediate zone of the cerebellar cortex projects to the globose and emboliform nuclei， which are also known as the interposed nuclei； and the cerebellar vermis projects to the fastigial nucleus. From the dentate nucleus， cerebellar outflow projects through the superior cerebellar peduncle to the red nucleus and the ventral anterior and ventrolateral11nuclei of the thalamus.\n\n【26】26.3(C. It is thought that the firing of excitatory climbing fibers represents some sort of error signal to the cerebellum， and is integral in the process of motor learning. The two types of input to the cerebellum are mossy fibers and climbing fibers， both of which are excitatory. Climbing fibers originate in the inferior olivary nucleus， enter the cerebellum via the inferior cerebellar peduncle， and synapse directly with Purkinje cells with a rather strong excitatory effect. Mossy fibers affect Purkinje cells less directly and， therefore have a relatively weak effect. Mossy fibers synapse with granule cells， which send out parallel fibers that interact with Purkinje cells.\n\n【27】26.4A. This cerebellar description is likely the Chiari malformation， which is a congenital underdevelopment of the posterior fossa. The underdeveloped fossa then causes the cerebellum to herniated through the foramen magnum. Chiari type I can be asymptomatic in childhood and manifests as headaches and ataxia in the adult. Chiari type II is more severe and symptomatic at birth and is associated with other CNS anomalies such as hydrocephalus and lumbosacral meningomyelocele.\n\n【28】NEUROSCIENCE PEARLS\n\n【29】▶Alcoholic cerebellar degeneration is caused by toxic degeneration of Pur-kinje cells and is clinically characterized by impaired gait， tremor， and truncal ataxia.\n\n【30】In a patient with chronic thiamine deficiency due to alcoholism， thia-mine should be given BEFORE glucose to avoid precipitation of Wernicke encephalopathy.\n\n【31】A child with ataxia-telangeictasia has ataxia， prominent vasculature on the skin (telangiectasia)， pulmonary infections， and increased risk of cancer.\n\n【32】The symptoms of cerebellar lesions manifest on the same side of the body as the lesion.\n\n【33】The Purkinje cells mediate all of the efferent projections from the cerebellum.\n\n【34】Afferent input to the cerebellum is provided by the mossy fibers from spinal cord and brainstem nuclei and from climbing fibers from the inferior olive.\n删除20：<u>Brodal P.

She has no history of migraine headaches. On further questioning she says that three years ago she experienced several weeks of tingling in her right lower extremity, and as recently as last year, she was unable to drive her car because of bilateral arm weakness. The physician proceeds with a full neurologic work-up, including MRI of the head . Given the patient’s likely diagnosis, what is the best long-term therapy?\n\n【1】> Courtesy of Dr. Per-Lennart Westesson, University of Rochester Medical Center.\n\n【2】> (A) Acetaminophen\n\n【3】> (B) Corticosteroids\n\n【4】> (C) Heparin\n\n【5】> (D) Interferon\n\n【6】> (E) Sumatriptan\n Answer: The correct answer is D. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory demyelinating disease of unknown etiology. It typically has a relapsing-remitting course and is most commonly seen in female patients with peak age of onset between 20 and 40 years. MS usually presents with weakness and/or numbness in one or more extremities. Another common presentation is visual loss secondary to optic neuritis and unilateral shooting facial pain secondary to trigeminal neuralgia. MRI is the most sensitive radiographic technique for imaging MS, with sensitivity of nearly 85%. Classic findings on MRI are periventricular white matter lesions known as “Dawson’s fingers/’ as seen in the image. These lesions appear as “finger like” projections around the ventricles and are easiest to see with a sagittal image. Commonly, foci identified on MRI imaging are clinically silent. A combination of history, physical examination, laboratory tests such as cerebrospinal fluid oligoclonal banding, and imaging findings is used to diagnose MS. Interferon beta-1a is indicated for the long-term treatment of patients with relapsing forms of the disease to slow the accumulation of physical disability and decrease the frequency of clinical exacerbations. Patients with MS in whom interferon’s efficacy has been demonstrated include patients who have experienced a first clinical episode and have MRI features consistent with MS.  \nAnswer A is incorrect. The patient presents with trigeminal neuralgia in the setting of several other past neurologic complaints. While trigeminal neuralgia is characterized by unilateral shooting facial pains, it is important to distinguish this pain from that of a headache (eg, migraine, cluster, or tension). Acetaminophen may be considered in the initial treatment of tension headache.  \nAnswer B is incorrect. Short courses of IV corticosteroids are commonly used to treat acute MS flares associated with neurologic deficits. However, interferon or glatiramer, not corticosteroids, are appropriate for the long-term treatment of MS.  \nAnswer C is incorrect. Heparin would be an appropriate therapeutic intervention in the case of an ischemic stroke. Given that the patient’s neurologic signs and symptoms are separated both by time and space, a stroke is not likely. Moreover, the patient is quite young and an ischemic stroke in such a young patient would be exceedingly rare.  \nAnswer E is incorrect. Unilateral facial pain is more characteristic of trigeminal neuralgia (a common feature of MS) than of migraine headache. Triptans are used as initial treatment in the case of cluster and migraine headache.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Most cases of hyperthyroidism will result in a suppressed level of TSH and elevated T <sub>4 </sub> /T <sub>3 </sub> levels. An exception to this would be a secondary hyperthyroid state, such as with a pituitary tumor that secretes TSH, resulting in both a high TSH level and high serum hormone levels (caused by overstimulation of the thyroid gland).\n\n【6】Question: 15.2 A 35-year-old woman presents with increasing fatigue for several months.

He is suffering from tinea capitis (scalp ‘ringworm’) which is a dermatophyte fungal  删除换行1 infection. The clinical appearances can be highly variable from marked scaling, crusting,  删除换行1 pustules and papules to a frank inflammatory boggy swelling (kerion) with alopecia, to subtle fine diffuse scale only. Children frequently have associated occipital lymphadenopathy.\nAfter starting oral antifungal medication the patient developed a classic pruritic papular  删除换行1 ‘id’ reaction which is an immunological reaction to the infection that can coincide with  删除换行1 the start of treatment. It is not an allergy to the antifungal treatment as is frequently  删除换行1 assumed. The ‘id’ reaction can be managed with mild topical steroids and emollients. The  删除换行1 oral antifungals should be continued.\nThe fungus is spread from child to child in schools and between family members at home.\nFrequently, parents’ scalps are spared, however they may develop cutaneous lesions (tinea  删除换行1 corporis), especially on their neck and upper trunk where the child’s head comes to rest  删除换行1 whilst sitting on the parent’s lap.\nTrichophyton tonsurans is an anthropophilic (human) species, which is most commonly  删除换行1 isolated from the mycological culture. The fungal hyphae of T. tonsurans penetrate into  删除换行1 the hair shaft (endothrix) rendering topical therapy ineffective. Therefore, systemic treatment is required to clear the scalp infection. Screening of family members by taking  删除换行1 scalp brushings is recommended as tinea capitis may be very subtle clinically. Mycology  删除换行1 cultures can take 6–8 weeks, as the fungus grows slowly; consequently, treatment may  删除换行1 need to be started in the first instance on clinical grounds.\n\n【15】Traditionally, children with tinea capitis were treated with oral griseofulvin, however to  删除换行1 eradicate T. tonsurans high doses are required for up to two months. Oral terbinafine is  删除换行1 therefore the treatment of choice in many paediatric dermatology clinics, as it is highly  删除换行1 effective and well tolerated. As yet, oral terbinafine is not licensed in children in the UK.\nOral terbinafine is given to children daily for 1 month according to their weight: < 20 kg, \n\n【16】62.5 mg; 20–40 kg, 125 mg; > 40 kg, 250 mg. It is good clinical practice to re-brush the  删除换行1 scalp after treatment to ensure that there is a mycological as well as clinical cure.\nIn this case the two children should be treated with oral antifungal medicine and their  删除换行1 mother given topical terbinafine 1% cream to treat her tinea corporis. It is a good idea  删除换行1 to ask all the family members to use an antifungal shampoo once/twice weekly to reduce  删除换行1 the spread of fungus during the treatment course.\n\n【17】Fortunately, the alopecia has a very high chance of complete recovery after treatment,  删除换行1 even after a highly inflammatory kerion.\n\n【18】 KEY POINTS\n\n【19】• Clinical features of tinea capitis are highly variable, from mild diffuse scale to pustules  删除换行1 and swelling.\n\n【20】• Affected children and their close contacts should be screened for tinea capitis by scalp  删除换行1 brushings.\n\n【21】• Systemic antifungals should be given, as the majority of cases are caused by endothrix  删除换行1 fungi.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

He is noted to have yellow eyes and tender hepatomegaly.\n\n【9】• Most likely diagnosis: Acute infection with hepatitis A.\n\n【10】• Most probable timing and source of infection: Ingestion of contaminated food or water while on his mission to Central America 5 weeks earlier.\n\n【11】• Test to confirm the diagnosis: Anti–hepatitis A immunoglobulin (Ig) M.\n\n【12】• Treatment of acute hepatitis A: Supportive care and symptomatic treatment for the patient; report infection to local health department; consider giving hepatitis A vaccine or Ig prophylaxis to close household or sexual contacts.\n\n【13】### ANALYSIS\n\n【14】#### Objectives\n\n【15】1\\. Develop a differential diagnosis for adults with jaundice.\n\n【16】2\\. Know the symptoms, management, complications, and modes of transmission of hepatitis A, B, and C.\n\n【17】3\\. Be able to interpret the results of hepatitis viral serology tests.\n\n【18】#### Considerations\n\n【19】This presentation of diarrhea along with nonspecific, crampy abdominal pain is most often caused by viral gastroenteritis. However, this patient has several symptoms and signs that serve as clues to point to other potential diagnoses. Of particular importance, the complaint of yellow eyes should prompt an evaluation for jaundice.\n\n【20】Bilirubin is a breakdown product of red blood cells. During the breakdown of hemoglobin, bilirubin is formed and bound to albumin, which carries it to the liver. In the liver, a portion of the bilirubin is made water soluble by conjugation to a glucuronide. This “conjugated bilirubin” is excreted in the bile and then largely excreted in the stool. Bilirubin that is not conjugated (“unconjugated bilirubin”) in the liver remains mostly bound to albumin and to a lesser degree high-density lipoproteins.\n\n【21】Most cases of jaundice can be characterized as having prehepatic, hepatic, or posthepatic causes . Prehepatic jaundice is most often from hemolysis of red blood cells, which overwhelms the liver’s ability to conjugate and clear the bilirubin through its normal pathways. This produces a hyperbilirubinemia that is primarily unconjugated.\n\n【22】Hepatic causes of jaundice can lead to either unconjugated or conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Viruses, such as hepatitis, and alcohol reduce the liver’s ability to transport bilirubin after it has been conjugated, resulting in a conjugated hyperbilirubinemia.\n\n【23】Posthepatic jaundice is usually caused by obstruction to the flow of bile through the bile ducts. This can be caused by bile duct stones, strictures, or tumors that narrow or block the ducts. Posthepatic jaundice is, therefore, a conjugated hyperbilirubinemia.\n\n【24】### APPROACH TO:  \nJaundice\n\n【25】### DEFINITIONS\n\n【26】CAPUT MEDUSA: Dilated superficial periumbilical veins that usually result from shunting associated with severe portal hypertension\n\n【27】SPIDER VEINS: Dilated, small, superficial veins that appear as red, blue, or purple web-like formations, most often seen on the legs and face\n\n【28】### CLINICAL APPROACH\n\n【29】#### History and Examination\n\n【30】The most important information in the diagnostic evaluation usually comes from the history. In patients presenting with jaundice, the history should be thorough and should include questions focused on identifying the common causes of jaundice. Specific information should include when the jaundice commenced and whether it is of acute or gradual onset. The presence of gastrointestinal symptoms, such as abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or changes in stool or urine color can be significant. Itching is common in jaundice and this symptom may, in fact, precede the onset of jaundice.\n\n【31】Associated symptoms, such as unintended weight loss or the development of adenopathy may lead to the consideration of certain diagnoses, including malignancies. Fever, shaking chills, and right upper quadrant pain can be signs of acute cholangitis or choledocholithiasis. Anorexia, fatigue, and myalgias may indicate viral hepatitis. Bruising or bleeding disorders may suggest severe hepatic dysfunction that is interfering with the production of clotting factors. Increasing abdominal girth may be caused by ascites and peripheral edema by obstruction of venous return from the lower extremities or hypoalbuminemia.\n\n【32】A complete review of the past medical history is necessary. Any medications, whether prescription, nonprescription, or herbal supplements, should be reviewed . Acetaminophen is a widely used over-the-counter agent that, in toxic amounts, can cause hepatocellular damage. Numerous herbal agents (eg, Jamaican bush tea, Kava Kava, and Ma Huang) have been associated with liver damage as well.\n\n【33】The social history is of critical importance in a patient with jaundice . The abuse of alcohol is the most common cause of cirrhosis. IV drug use, transfusions of blood or blood products, or unsafe sexual practices can lead to infection with hepatitis B or C. Hepatitis is also associated with getting tattoos if unsterilized equipment is used. Travel history, especially the location and timing of any international travel, and recent exposure to persons with jaundice or contaminated foods (raw oysters are a common source) can lead to the consideration of hepatitis A.\n\n【34】A comprehensive physical examination is also important in the workup of someone with jaundice. Along with a general physical examination, certain areas should be emphasized. Jaundice typically remains undetected on examination until the serum bilirubin level is greater than twice the normal upper limit, or 2 mg/dL. The yellow pigmentation may first be noticed as a yellowing of the sclera, especially in persons with darker skin types. Yellow discoloration can also commonly be seen in oral mucosal membranes such as under the tongue and hard palate.\n\n【35】Examination of the skin should document the jaundice and also look for clues to its cause. The stigmata of alcohol abuse (caput medusa, spider veins) or IV drug use (needle track marks) should be noted. Large hematomas, by themselves, could be a cause of jaundice as the blood resorbs. Signs of easy bruising or bleeding should also be documented.\n\n【36】Abdominal examination must include, among other things, evaluation of the general contour of the abdomen, the presence of any ascites, the presence of organomegaly, and any tenderness. A grossly enlarged liver with nodular contour may suggest malignancy or hepatitis. Hepatomegaly may occur as a part of liver disease or hepatic congestion due to right-sided heart failure. Right upper quadrant tenderness can be associated with acute hepatitis but also with gallstone disease. Splenomegaly could suggest portal hypertension from cirrhosis, could be caused by malignancy, or by splenic sequestration of damaged RBCs.\n\n【37】#### Laboratory Testing\n\n【38】The most important initial laboratory evaluation of jaundice is the bilirubin level, which is usually reported as both a total bilirubin and direct bilirubin. The degree of jaundice generally correlates with the level of serum bilirubin concentration. The reported direct bilirubin is a measurement of the conjugated bilirubin level . Unconjugated bilirubin can be determined by subtracting the directed bilirubin from the total bilirubin.\n\n【39】The relative relationship of conjugated and unconjugated bilirubin in a jaundiced person can be indirectly evaluated by performing a urinalysis. Conjugated bilirubin is excreted in the urine, whereas unconjugated bilirubin is bound to albumin and exempted from glomerular filtration . A urinalysis on a jaundice patient who has a high level of bilirubin suggests that the patient has a conjugated hyperbilirubinemia; absence of bilirubin on the urinalysis suggests that it is an unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. An overproduction or impaired conjugation or uptake of bilirubin generally results in unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Conversely, a decreased excretion or biliary obstruction typically leads to conjugated hyperbilirubinemia.\n\n【40】### UNCONJUGATED HYPERBILIRUBINEMIA\n\n【41】A mild unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, usually identified as an incidental finding when liver enzymes are tested for some other reason, is often caused by Gilbert syndrome . Gilbert syndrome is a congenital reduction of conjugation of bilirubin in the liver due to autosomal recessive gene involved in glucuronidation. It occurs in approximately 5% of the population and is of no health significance. Patients generally present with normal physical examination and routine laboratory tests, except for icterus and mild unconjugated (2-4 mg/dL) hyperbilirubinemia. It is also more commonly diagnosed in males due to higher daily bilirubin production. Occasionally, the bilirubin level will increase during times of stress, illness, fasting and then recover to its baseline, slightly elevated level (usually less than 3 mg/mL), after the illness resolves. In a patient with mildly elevated unconjugated bilirubinemia, otherwise normal liver enzymes, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), and complete blood count (CBC), and who is otherwise well, no further workup is indicated.\n\n【42】Hemolysis can cause an unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia in proportion to the amount of hemolysis that occurs. It is most often diagnosed by identification of anemia along with the presence of red cell fragments or abnormalities. The serum bilirubin level typically remains below 5 mg/dL in hemolytic conditions such as spherocytosis, thalassemias, sickle cell disease, malaria, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). The management is to treat the cause of the hemolysis.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

He receives rTPA therapy， and then develops marked left-sided weakness. A CT scan is performed.\n\n【8】●Most likely diagnosis： Initially TIA versus stroke， then hemorrhagic complica-tion of rTPA.\n\n【9】Next step： All anticoagulation therapy should be stopped， hypertension should be controlled， and any coagulopathy should be corrected.\n\n【10】ANALYSIS\n\n【11】Objectives\n\n【12】1\\. To understand the causes of cerebral vascular atherosclerosis and disease.\n\n【13】2\\. To understand the treatment of ongoing stroke.\n\n【14】3\\. To understand the common complications of stroke therapies.\n\n【15】4\\. To understand the medications for the prophylaxis of stroke.\n\n【16】Considerations\n\n【17】The patient has suffered the most feared complication of rTPA treatment， which isan intracranial bleed. The internal capsule is the most common area for strokes in hyper-tensive patients. Once intracranial bleeding is identified， all anticoagulation therapies are discontinued. Controlling the BP and reversing any clotting abnormalities is essen-tial. The initial workup should include CT or MRI scans of the brain for determination of ischemic versus hemorrhagic stroke， while maintaining control of the BP. I think an extra space needs to be here? Initially， the patient has an acute nonhemorrhagic CVA. CVA is the second most common cause of death of adults in the United States. After rTPA therapy for his stroke， despite meeting all the criteria for administration ofa clot-dissolving drug rTPA， the patient succumbed to a well-identified side effect of this class of drugs and developed a hemorrhagic bleed in the area of the right internal capsule.\n\n【18】APPROACH TO：\n\n【19】Stroke and CVA rank second after ischemic heart disease (CAD) as a cause of life years lost to disability and death worldwide. The incidence of stroke varies among countries and increases exponentially with age. In Western societies， 80% of strokes are caused by focal cerebral ischemia due to arterial occlusion， and 20% are caused by hemorrhage. Ischemic brain injury culminates in anoxic cell death. Initially after 删除换行1 arterial occlusion， an area of edema with structural integrity surrounds a central core of tissue death. This is the area that can recover from the first minutes to hours of the insult. No clinical deficits and findings necessarily reflect irreversible damage. Depending on the duration and severity of the ischemia， the edematous area may be incorporated into the infarct or normal tissue.\n\n【20】Thirty-day mortality rates are in the range of 10% to 17%. Older patients do worse after stroke； poor prognosis is also noted with the coexistence of ischemic heart disease and diabetes mellitus (DM). Mortality is related to the size of the infarct； the risk of death is as low as 2.5% with lacunar infarcts and as high as 78%with space-occupying hemispheric infarcts.\n\n【21】The dictum is “time is brain tissue.\" Hence， as soon as a patient is diagnosed with possible stroke， acute imaging should be performed to rule out a hemorrhagic pro-cess and the patient screened for possible thrombolytic therapy. The treatment with intravenous rTPA (alteplase) or IV thrombolytics when started within 3 hours after the onset of symptoms are effective in limiting the severity of stroke. The recom-mended rTPA dose is 0.9 mg/kg with a maximum of 90 mg， with the first 10% being given IV over a period of 1 minute， and the remaining 90% given within 1 hour. Treatment leads to a 31% to 50% favorable neurologic or functional outcome at3 months. Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage occurred in 6.4% of the rTPA group versus 0.6% in controls. Trials of Ⅳ rTPA therapy failed to find a benefit when thrombolytics were given within 6 hours after the onset of symptoms. The benefit of rTPA is greater the sooner the treatment is started.\n\n【22】Intracranial hemorrhage after thrombolysis is higher in patients with more severe， larger strokes and with older patients. Concerns of hemorrhage， the efficacy and safety of rTPA in patients with early ischemic changes on CT still exist. In the first 3 hours after the onset of symptoms， the appearance of ischemic changes on CT was not associated with increased risk of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage or other bleeding outcomes after rTPA treatment. IV thrombolysis with rTPA can be used in the community setting with efficacy and safety.\n\n【23】Anticoagulation\n\n【24】Ischemic stroke occurs because of a thrombus or narrowing of the arteries. ASA dosing(160 or 300 mg/d) initiated within 48 hours after the onset of stroke and contin-ued for 2 weeks leads to better survival and function by reducing risk of recurrent ischemic stroke. Routine use of ASA is recommended for secondary prevention of stroke after the first few weeks. ASA is inexpensive， has a good safety profile， and is effective in patients with ischemic stroke； however， it should be withheld for24 hours in patients treated with the use of Ⅳ thrombolytics to decrease the risk of bleeding. Dipyridamole or clopidogrel therapy in the acute phase of ischemic stroke has not been tested in randomized trials. The incidence of ischemic stroke has declined in the middle and elderly age groups but has increased in younger patients， likely due to obesity and hypertension being the contributing factors. Providers should be aware of the rising risk of stroke in younger people. The incidence of acute ischemic stroke has dramatically increased in people under age 35 in both sexes， 删除换行1 but is still greater in males. Better detection of ischemic stroke with MRI may expose obesity and hypertension as the underlying cause. The use of unfractionated heparin， low-molecular-weight heparins， heparinoids， thrombin inhibitors， or oral antico agulants in the acute phase of stroke improves functional outcomes.\n\n【25】Management of Cardiovascular Risk Factors\n\n【26】Aspirin (ASA) should be started after 24 hours (300 mg daily for the first 2 weeks) and extended release dipyridamole for secondary prevention. Aggressive management of cardiovascular risk factors including smoking cessation， treatment of hypertension， and initiating statin therapy is also recommended. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a com-mon arrhythmia that increases the risk of stroke. Warfarin (Coumadin) therapy(and now oral apixaban in nonvalvular AF) to keep the international normalized ratio (INR) between 2 and 3 is the accepted therapy. Apixaban， a direct antithrombin inhibitor， does not require monitoring of the INR. These agents have been more effec-tive than ASA for the prevention of stroke in patients with AF A narrow therapeutic window and the need for lifelong coagulation monitoring limits the use of warfarin(Coumadin). When warfarin (Coumadin) is used， maintenance of the INR in the therapeutic range is challenging and is achieved less than 60% of the time； subopti-mal anticoagulation can lead to recurrent stoke. At least a third of patients .1. with AF who are at risk for stroke are either not started on oral anticoagulant therapy or are not compliant with therapy. ASA reduces the risk of stroke in patients with AF by about 20% and is used to treat patients with atrial fibrillation for whom vitamin K antagonist therapy is contraindicated. Addition of clopidogrel to an ASA regimen in patients for whom vitamin K antagonist therapy is contraindicated further reduces the risk of stroke by 28%， but the combination increases the risk of major hemorrhage. A number of small molecular weight inhibitors of Factor Xa are currently available and can be delivered orally. Among these are rivaroxaban， apixaban， betrixaban， YM150， and DU-176b. Apixaban is a direct and competitive inhibitor of Factor Xa.\n\n【27】Prevention and Management of Complications\n\n【28】Patients with an acute stroke are at an increased risk for deep venous thrombosis(DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). This risk for DVT and PE increases with increasing age and stroke severity scores. Anticoagulant therapy does not improve the overall functional outcome， but subcutaneously administered low-dose unfrac tionated heparin (UFH) or low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) are recom mended for patients at high risk for DVT and PE， and for those with immobility. Large supratentorial infarcts and space-occupying edema of the brain may lead to transtentorial or uncal herniation， usually between the second and fifth day after the onset of stroke. Intensive care units with these cases have reported early fatality rates of up to 78%. Medical therapy has proved ineffective in these cases of large space-occupying lesions. Compared to medical therapy， surgery (hemicraniectomy， dura-plasty， a dural patch to enlarge the intradural space) in the first 48 hours of the onset of stroke reduced the case fatality rate (22% vs 71%). Surgery appeared to be less beneficial for patients with aphasia， patients older than 50 years of age， and patients in whom surgery was performed on the second day versus the first day after stroke onset. Patients who received care in a stroke unit were more likely to survive， regain independence， and return home than those who do not receive such specialized care.\n\n【29】Hypercoagulable States\n\n【30】Hypercoagulable conditions can lead to strokes. The most common conditions in this group include oral contraceptive use， pregnancy， Factor V Leiden deficiency， protein C and S deficiencies， antithrombin III deficiency， and lupus anticoagulant. Patients with these conditions usually present with some form of deep venous throm-bosis. Procoagulant states should be suspected especially when recurrent episodes of deep venous thrombosis are diagnosed. Arterial thrombosis should definitely increase awareness of the presence of one of these conditions. Clots can travel from the venous circulation through the heart via an atrial or ventricular septal defect to the left side of the heart and to the arterial circulation leading to the brain (paradoxical emboli). Lupus anticoagulant is a specific immunoglobulin against phospholipids that prolongs the clotting time； it does not produce bleeding but instead a paradoxical procoagulant condition. It is seen in 25% of people with SLE， but is also seen in otherwise normal healthy subjects. In some people it is associated with an increased risk of blood clots and may be the cause of recurrent spontaneous abortions. Risk factors are SLE and a recent use of phenothiazine medication. Specialized clotting studies and levels of the factors involved are required to make an accurate diagnosis.\n\n【31】Prevention of Stroke\n\n【32】Secondary prevention of stroke and other cardiovascular complications is impor-tant. Prevention consists primarily of low-dose ASA and dipyridamole in patients with ischemic stroke， oral anticoagulation in patients with cardiac embolism， treat-ment of hypertension， statin therapy， and glucose control in patients with diabetes. Cessation of smoking and carotid endarterectomy in patients with ipsilateral carotid stenosis has been shown to be effective.\n\n【33】Even in the United States， only a minority of patients with acute ischemic stroke receive intravenous rTPA. The use of intravenous rTPA is currently restricted to a3-hour time window after the onset of symptoms with a potential benefit when used up to 6 hours after the onset of a stroke. Later use was improved by quantification of the ischemic penumbra with perfusion MRI/CT. The intent of thrombolysis is to recan-alize occluded arteries. Complete recanalization of an occluded middle cerebral artery2 hours after the start of thrombolysis was achieved in one-third of patients. In some cases， continuous 2-MHz transcranial Doppler ultrasonography applied for 2 hours simultaneous with rTPA augmented the rate of arterial recanalization. The addition of intravenous galactose-based micro bubbles may also increase rates of recanalization along with Doppler therapy. Compared with intravenous thrombolysis， intra-arterial thrombolysis may increase the likelihood of recanalization. The administration of both intra-arterial recombinant pro-urokinase and intravenous heparin， compared with intravenous heparin alone， within 6 hours after the onset of stroke resulted in a higher rate of recanalization of the middle cerebral artery (66% vs18%) and a higher rate of a favorable functional outcome at 3 months (40% vs 25%，P=0.04).\n\n【34】Procedures required to deliver intra-arterial thrombolytic agents to 1the site ofvascular occlusion involve more time than intravenous therapy. Thrombolytic ther-apy in which intravenous thrombolysis is followed by intra-arterial thrombolysis， may permit more rapid treatment and improved rates of recanalization. Mechanical thrombectomy in patients with acute intracranial occlusion of the intracranial carotid artery has resulted in a higher rate of recanalization.\n\n【35】Elevated blood pressure， hyperglycemia， and fever in the first hours to days after ischemic stroke have all been associated with poor long-term outcomes. Antihypertensive therapy during the acute phase of stroke is held unless the diastolic blood pressure exceeds 120 mm Hg or the systolic blood pressure exceeds220 mm Hg in patients who do not receive rTPA. Monitoring blood pressure is recommended before， during， and after rTPA therapy. Intravenous antihyperten-sive therapy to maintain the systolic blood pressure <185 mm Hg and the diastolic blood pressure below 110 mm Hg is recommended. Hypothermia has also improved functional outcomes in trials involving patients with global cerebral ischemia after cardiac arrest and traumatic spinal cord injury， but the improvement was not consis-tent among those with traumatic brain injury.\n\n【36】Conclusions\n\n【37】Patients with signs and symptoms of CVA strongly suggestive of stroke should undergo prompt brain imaging (CT or MRI). MRI is more sensitive for early ischemic changes， but either method can fully rule out hemorrhage. In the absence of bleeding or other contraindications to thrombolysis such as spontaneous， complete clearing of the deficits， increase in BP to or>185/110 mm Hg， or presentation >3 hours (possibly6 hours) after the onset of symptoms， the patient should receive therapy with intra-venous rTPA. Cardiovascular risk factors should be addressed， and anticoagulation should be initiated when atrial fibrillation is present.\n\n【38】Compared to ASA， apixaban had superior efficacy in reducing the risk for embolic events in patients with AF It has a 50% level of bioavailability， and is partially excreted by the kidneys. Apixaban， at a dose of 2.5 mg twice daily is effective and safe for the prevention of DVT after elective orthopedic surgery. The direct throm-bin inhibitor dabigatran gained a Class I recommendation as a useful alternative to warfarin (Coumadin) for the prevention of stroke and systemic thromboem-bolism in patients with paroxysmal to permanent AF. Risk factors fo OXyr stroke or systemic embolization are increased in patients with prosthetic heart valves， hemo-dynamically significant valvular disease， renal failure (creatinine clearance <15 mL/min)， and advanced liver disease (impaired baseline clotting function).\n\n【39】Routinely switching patients to dabigatran who are already successfully taking war-farin is not recommended and remains an individual decision. Dabigatran requires a twice daily dosing and greater risk of nonhemorrhagic side effects； thus， patients already taking warfarin with excellent INR control have little to gain by changing to dabigatran. The patient's compliance with a twice-daily dosing is a real issue. Management to sustain monitoring of INR is needed with warfarin also adds to cost and compliance. Most studies demonstrate a benefit to routine blood-pressure low-ering treatment in the acute phase of stroke.\n\n【40】Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) are effective after ischemic stroke. Some SSRIs improved motor recovery after stroke but this has not been universally confirmed. Fewer fluoxetine recipients than placebo recipients had depression and treatment with thrombolytic agents did not alter the findings. The SSRIs are therapeutic treatment of stroke and should be considered as an adjunct to 删除换行1 physiotherapy in the rehabilitation of motor deficits in moderate-to-severe stroke. Reports of a decreased effect of clopidrogel in patients taking proton pump inhibi tors (PPI) did not conclude that there was an increase in the risk for a recurrence of stroke in clopidogrel/PPI users. Vitamin supplementation did not prevent major CV events in patients with previous myocardial infarction， unstable angina， or stroke.\n删除16：<u>CLINICAL CASE CORRELATION\n删除25：<u>See also Case 3 (Scoring Systems and Patient Prognosis)， Case 27(Traumatic Brain Injury)， Case 30 (Altered Mental Status)， and Case 31(Status Epilepticus).</u>\n</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

She is not currently sexually active and does not use contraception. She experienced vaginal penetrated penile intercourse by an unknown male assailant， and was threatened with a knife.

Be aware of domestic abuse， recognize the signs， and the interventions.This is a case of a 24-year-old nulliparous woman brought into the emergency cen-ter by police due to a sexual assault. She reports to have been raped at knifepoint by an unknown male assailant at a nearby park. The patient appears anxious and tearful. Sexual assault is a crime of violence， and can result in significant physical and emotional trauma and injury. A coordinated and multidisciplinary approach is optimal to minimize trauma and connect the patient to community resources. The exam should be victim-centered，meaning that the order of the exam may need to be modified depending on the patient's cultural or emotional needs. Informed consent is crucial， and should be gained through the process including medical care， 删除换行1 pregnancy testing， testing and prophylaxis for STI， human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prophylaxis， photographs， and permission to contact the patient for follow-up on test results. The first priority is to identify and treat any life threat-ening injury. As much as possible， the examination should be coordinated with evidence collection to minimize discomfort to the patient. Many emergency cen-ters have Sexual Assault Forensic Examiners， who have special training， expertise， and knowledge of how to collect evidence to meet legal requirements. The patient should be counseled in a language that is most comfortable. Confidentiality is com-plex in these settings， and should be carefully discussed with the patient， so that the patient may be aware of what information may be part of the criminal justice record (information shared with law enforcement， justice system advocates， etc)， and what evidence and lab results may become legal evidence and not privileged. Testing for sexually transmitted infections should be individualized. A pregnancy test should be performed. The most common infections identified after a sexual assault are trichomonas， gonorrhea， chlamydia and hepatitis B. Thus， the patient should be encouraged to accept STI prophylaxis. A common regimen is ceftriaxone250 mg IM， metronidazole 2 g orally， and azithromycin 1 g orally. If the patient has not been vaccinated for hepatitis B， then HBIG as well as the full hepatitis B vaccine is recommended. HIV postexposure prophylaxis should be discussed with the patient， taking into account the risk factors for exposure. Pregnancy prevention should be discussed and emergency contraception should be offered. Finally， sup-port to community resources， arrangements for follow-up， and referral for report-ing to the legal authorities should be undertaken if not already done.STATUTORYRAPE： Sexual intercourse with a person under an age specified by state law， in many states it is 16 to 18 years old.ELDERLY ABUSE： A single or repeated act， or lack of appropriate actions， which causes injury or distress to an individual 60 years older and occurs within a rela-tionship where there is an assumption of trust， or when the act is directed toward an elder person due to their age or impairments. It can be physical， psychological， emotional， or sexual abuse， neglect， abandonment， or financial exploitation.Sexual assault is a term that encompasses rape， unwanted genital touching， and sex-ual coercion. It is a complex problem with many medical， psychological， and legal aspects. The lifetime prevalence of sexual assault is reported as approximately20% but this is likely an underestimation due to reporting bias. The majority of reported assailants are known to the victim-either a current or former intimate partner， acquaintance， or family member. Fourteen percent of reported assailants are strangers. Those at increased risk for sexual assault include the physically or mentally disabled， homeless， and persons who are gay， lesbian， bisexual， or trans-gendered. Other populations at risk are college students， alcohol and drug users， and persons under age 25 years.The initial role of the healthcare provider is to rule out any life-threatening injuries as with any patient triaged through a medical facility. Although most physical inju-ries are reported as minor， about 1% report major injuries needing hospitalization or operative repair， and 0.1% suffer fatality. After life-threatening injuries have been ruled out， the patient must be moved to a quiet， private room for the remainder of the exam and informed consent must be obtained 删除33：<u></u>. A thorough his-tory and physical examination must be taken that includes： details of the event withVaginal swabs should be taken on speculum exam， which can be used to perform deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) evaluation， noting the presence of motile sperm on microscopy， as well as cultures for Neisseria gonorrhea， Chlamydia trachomatis， and Trichomonas vaginalis. Pubic hair combings， fingernail scrapings， and skin wash-ings need to be collected as well. A Woods lamp can be used to assess clothing for semen. Colposcopic evaluation with toluidine blue can assess microscopic abra-sions that may be missed on gross examination. Serologic tests for hepatitis B virus， HIV， and Syphilis should also be performed. Collection of these samples and thor-ough documentation play a pivotal role from a legal and medical perspective， and any healthcare provider that does not feel comfortable proceeding with the neces-sary steps， must seek assistance from experienced personnel 删除33：<u></u>.\n\n【11】The risk of pregnancy after sexual assault is estimated to be between 2%and 4%Emergency contraceptives should be given within 72 hours of the assault， but may be effective if given within 120 hours. A serum pregnancy test must be documented in the chart prior to administering any method of contraception to rule out a pre-existing pregnancy. The most effective form of emergency contraception is the copper intrauterine device if inserted within 120 hours postcoital and patients may benefit from the long-term retention.\n\n【12】There are three main regimens for oral emergency contraception： progestin-only pills， combined oral contraceptives， and antiprogesterone pills . See also case 44 (contraception) for more details.\n\n【13】Prophylactic antibiotics for sexually transmitted infections are indicated for chlamydial， gonococcal， and trichomonal infections. Administering ceftriaxone250mg intramuscularly in a single dose， metronidazole 2g orally in a single dose， as well as azithromycin 1g orally in a single dose or doxycycline 100mg twice daily orally for 7 days are the recommended treatment for these infections 删除25：<u></u>.\n\n【14】Post exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is also recommended for hepatitis B virus and risk individualization for HIV. The regimen according to the 2015 CDC guidelines\n\n| Table 31-1·EMERGENCY CONTRACEPTION  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Medication  | Regimen  |\n| Combined OCPs (Yuzpe method)  | Two doses (100mcg EE+0.5mg P)， 12 hours apart  |\n| Single-dose progestin only  | Levonorgestrel1.5mg  |\n| Two-dose progestin only  | Levonorgestre10.75mg， 12-24 hours apart  |\n| Copperintrauterine device  | Nonhormonal，<120 hours after coitus  |\n| Ulipristal acetate  | One 30mg pill  || Table 31-2·POST-EXPOSURE PROPHYLAXIS  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Infection  | Regimen  |\n| Chlamydia trachomatis  | Azithromycin or doxycycline  |\n| Neisseria gonorrhea  | Ce ftriaxone IM  |\n| Trichomonas vag inalis  | Metronidazole  |\n| He patitis B  | Hepatitis Bvaccine， hepatitis Bimmune globulin  |\n| HIV\\\\  | Zidovudine  |\n| HPV\\  | HPVvaccine  |include receiving both hepatitis B immunoglobulin in addition to hepatitis B vaccine if the assailant is hepatitis B positive and the victim unvaccinated.HIV PEP is risk depen-dent； however， the CDC recommends administering 28 days of zidovudine within72 hours of assault， to higher risk patients outlined in the algorithm 删除33：<u></u>. Additionally， Human Papilloma Virus vaccine is recommended for female victims aged9 to 26 years， and may be offered to the victim of sexual assault.Elder abuse is a widespread issue that impacts the well-being of approximately1 in 10 adults over age 60， with an estimated 4 million older affected per year inIntimate partner violence occurs in every culture， country， and age group， and affects individuals in all socioeconomic and religious backgrounds. It takes place in same sex as well as heterosexual relationships. According to a 2007 CDC report，22% of women are physically assaulted by a partner or date during their lifetime， and nearly 25% of women have been raped and/ or physically assaulted by an inti-mate partner at some time. Between 4% and 8% of pregnant women experience physical assault； thus， the CDC and ACOG recommend universal screening each trimester and postpartum. Lifelong consequences exist including physical impair-ment， emotional trauma， chronic health problems， and even fatality. Alcohol and/or substance abuse is much more prevalent in women who are victims as well as men who commit violent acts.It must be reinforced to a victim of domestic abuse that they are not responsible for the abuse， and should be empowered to learn about the resources and support services， needs to make their own decisions， and discussions held in confidentiality(to the limits of the law). A safety plan may be discussed including packing a bag in advance， having personal documents ready， having an extra set of car/ house keys， establishing a code with friends/ family， and having a plan of where to go. They may agree to speak to a social worker or someone at the National Domestic Violence Hotline (1-800-799-SAFE 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7233\\]</u>). Nevertheless， even if the patient denies inti-mate partner violence， it is beneficial to discuss the issues in a caring manner and offer educational material.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

She is given a synthetic version of a hormone to help dilate her cervix. Where is the endogenous version of this hormone stored within the body?\n\n【1】> (A) Adrenal cortex\n\n【2】> (B) Anterior pituitary gland\n\n【3】> (C) Hypothalamus\n\n【4】> (D) Mammary glands\n\n【5】> (E) Posterior pituitary gland\n\n【6】 Answer: The correct answer is E. Oxytocin is a polypeptide hormone that is responsible for the dilation of the cervix and contraction of the uterus during labor, as well as the let down of milk during breastfeeding. When labor is arrested, a synthetic analog may be applied topically onto the cervix to facilitate dilation. Endogenously, oxytocin is produced in the cell bodies of hypothalamic neurons in the paraventricular nucleus. After synthesis, it is stored in terminal swellings of these neurons in the posterior pituitary, known as herring bodies.  \nAnswer A is incorrect. The adrenal cortex mediates the production and release of hormones related to the stress response as well as sexual development. It is divided into three layers: (from superficial to deep) zona glomerulosa, which produces mineralocorticoids such as aldosterone; zona fasciculata, which produces glucocorticoids such as cortisol; and zona reticularis, which produces androgens. The adrenal cortex is not responsible for the storage of oxytocin.  \nAnswer B is incorrect. Whereas secretion of hormones from the posterior pituitary is controlled by neurons in the hypothalamus, the anterior pituitary is a glandular secretory organ that receives releasing/inhibiting factors via a capillary plexus that connects it with the hypothalamus. Hormones released by the anterior pituitary include ACTH, thyroid-stimulating hormone, FSH, LH, growth hormone, and prolactin.  \nAnswer C is incorrect. Oxytocin is produced, not stored, in the cell bodies in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus.  \nAnswer D is incorrect. Oxytocin acts at receptors in the mammary glands to induce milk let down in breastfeeding mothers. Stimulation of the nipple will trigger the release of oxytocin from the posterior pituitary. Oxytocin is not stored in the mammary glands themselves.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

She reported that these sunspots had been increasing in number and causing her significant psychological distress, as she felt compelled to check on them constantly (i.e. spending hours in the bathroom inspecting these spots). She had no other medical problems. She was not on any medications and denied any recreational drug use. Physical examination revealed nearly perfect skin with no grossly visible lesions. Yet, she reported having seen several dermatologists and plastic surgeons because she felt depressed about her sunspots.\n\n【12】Even though delusional ideation was a possible diagnosis, none of the above practitioners confronted Ms. Rose directly with the fact that her skin was clear. She was started on paroxetine (Paxil®) at 20 mg/day for several months with neither side effects nor benefits. In view of the fact that she was still depressed and preoccupied with the compulsion to check her skin, you decided to increase the dose of her paroxetine by 10 mg every 3 weeks. Eventually, the maximal U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved dosage of 60 mg per day for OCD was reached, and after several weeks of being on this dose, the patient showed much improvement with regard to both her depression and her compulsion. As such, she has been more able to function at work and to enjoy life.\n\n【13】Reflections on the Case\n-----------------------\n\n【14】Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), similar to delusions of parasitosis, is a spectrum composed of different degrees of mental preoccupation, ranging from slightly abnormal perception to complete delusion regarding body dysmorphia. In fact, if the patient is completely delusional, a more specific terminology is “delusion of dysmorphosis.” The challenge is to distinguish between extreme OCD from delusional disorder. This distinction cannot always be made. However, a totally delusional patient tends to have a more elaborate ideation and shows no hint of apology or embarrassment, whereas a patient with extreme OCD might demonstrate partially preserved insight.\n\n【15】Teaching Points\n---------------\n\n【16】Ms. Rose did not have elaborate ideation beyond her perception of sun spots, and she did show some insight into her psychological condition. Therefore, the authors recommend giving her the diagnosis of obsessive-compulsive disorder rather than delusion of dysmorphosis. The first choice of intervention is to gradually increase her paroxetine dose rather than to add another agent such as an anti-psychotic. Even though the maximal FDA-indicated dosage of paroxetine for depression is 50 mg/day and that for OCD is 60 mg/day, the dosages used by some practitioners to improve OCD spectrum disorders can sometimes be too low to be therapeutic. This is perhaps due to the misunderstanding that the same anti-depressant dose will have the same effect for OCD; however, it is a well-known fact in psychiatry that the dosages of anti-depressants used to treat OCD tend to be much higher than the dosages of the same agents used to treat depression. As our case illustrates, Ms. Rose had only been given 20 mg/day of paroxetine; therefore, we simply titrated up the dosage to achieve its therapeutic effects.\n\n【17】Once the patient is neither obsessed with her sunspots nor feels the compelled to constantly check her skin, the problem is solved! This does not mean that she will automatically reverse the belief that these lesions actually existed in the first place. For practical purposes, whether or not she believes in their existence becomes irrelevant to you. As such, the authors advise against confronting and challenging her with the fact that her skin has always been clear. Doing this might jeopardize your future therapeutic rapport with Ms. Ros", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

The  删除换行1 sores developed after sexual intercourse with his ex-wife when his foreskin ripped and bled.He noticed redness and itching on his penis and on the next day, the skin on these areas  删除换行1 became wet. He then started to develop headaches, muscle pains, general malaise and feeling  删除换行1 hot with intermittent shivers. The patient also reports irritation in the urethra on and after  删除换行1 micturition. He has not noticed any penile discharge. When the pain increased, he attended  删除换行1 the Accident and Emergency Department of his local hospital where the doctor prescribed  删除换行5 Flucloxacillin. A small abscess on his shoulder had improved on the antibiotics but the penile  删除换行1 sores persisted.\n\n【3】The patient and his ex-wife had divorced 3 years previously and since their split had formed  删除换行1 a common household with their daughter. The mother had been living with another man  删除换行1 for 2 years, while the patient had been sexually abstinent. They had got back together only  删除换行1 recently and had not used condoms or any contraception as a child would be a welcome outcome. The couple engaged in oral and penetrative vaginal sex but since the development of  删除换行1 symptoms, the couple had not engaged in sexual intercourse. The patient told the GP that he  删除换行1 had not had any sexually transmitted infection diagnosed or treated in the past. His ex-wife  删除换行1 denied any symptoms of infection. His past medical history reveals a road traffic accident  删除换行1 1 year ago, herpes labialis (cold sore) 3 years ago, epididymitis 4 years ago, cellulitis of his leg  删除换行1 10 years ago and a perforated eardrum 14 years ago.\n\n【4】Examination\n\n【5】On examination, he has swollen inguinal lymph nodes bilaterally. Over the tip, in the sulcus  删除换行1 and along the shaft of the penis he has groups of small ulcers. His temperature is 37.1°C.\n\n【6】Investigations\n\n【7】Swabs from the base of the genital lesion are desirable for proper diagnosis, counselling and  删除换行1 management. However, in the area in which this GP worked, the facilities were not available  删除换行1 for investigation and so diagnosis had to be made based on clinical signs only.\n\n【8】Questions\n\n【9】• What is the diagnosis?\n\n【10】• He is very worried and cannot understand why his ex-wife denies having any symptoms. Can you explain this to him?\n\n【11】• What complications might arise?\n\n【12】• What do you advise him?\n\n【13】ANSWER 69\n\n【14】The patient has genital herpes. Herpes simplex virus type 1 is the usual cause of cold sores  删除换行1 around the mouth and causes up to half the cases of genital herpes. Herpes simplex virus 删除换行1 type 2 causes genital herpes and sometimes cold sores. At least half of those who develop  删除换行1 genital herpes caught the virus from a sexual partner who was asymptomatic so the patient’s  删除换行1 ex-wife is likely to be telling the truth. There may be a connection between his history of cold  删除换行1 sores and this present outbreak.\n\n【15】Complications include: Local spread; extra genital spread to the buttocks, fingers or eye (in  删除换行1 about 20% of cases); aseptic meningitis in up to 20% of patients with a first herpes simplex  删除换行1 infection, with around 5% of these patients needing hospitalization; hyperaesthesia; difficulties in micturition or defaecation; erythema multiforme; monoarthritis; hepatitis; thrombocytopenia; and superinfection with bacteria or Candida.\n\n【16】Because the herpes lesions developed more than 5 days previously, and there are now no new  删除换行1 lesions developing, oral antiviral medication (which stops the virus from replicating rather  删除换行1 than clearing the virus from the body) will not be successful in limiting severity and duration  删除换行1 of symptoms. The GP needs to explain this to the patient. The GP can recommend regular  删除换行1 painkillers, salt baths if the patient has a bath (half-a-cup of salt in the bathwater), ice packs  删除换行1 and plenty of fluids.

The clinical manifestation of HI consists of thick and rigid skin, skin fissure, and yellow-brown armor like plate that covers every part of the body’s surface. Nose and lips appear flattened and rudiment, there are constrictive scales on extremities that may lead to autoamputation. Because of the high mortality rate, HI patients have to be treated intensively and as soon as possible. HI patients that have survived this condition can develop exfoliative ichthyosiform erythroderma, palmoplantar keratoderma and nail dystrophy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 – 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【25】Oral retinoid can improve HI prognosis significantly. In general, oral retinoid regulates skin growth and differentiation. Oral retinoids have a keratolytic/shedding effect that is used to treat HI. 4-oxo-metabolite is the end product of oral retinoid on skin that is known to affect transcription regulation activity of Normal Human Epidermal Keratocytes (differentiation and hyperproliferation) and dermal fibroblast.\n\n【26】Initial dose of isotretinoin is 0.5 mg–1 mg/kg body weight/day, it is advised to use an isotretinoin dose as small and effective as possible for long term use. It is advised to give a retinoid-free period 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 6 , 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【27】In this case, the patient was given 1 mg/kg body weight/day and it was proven effective as the patient clinical manifestation improved after 2 weeks of treatment. The thick, rigid, armor like plates, and skin fissures became less. After 9 months, the patient was given oral isotretinoin 3 times a week for 10 months. The dose was reduced to 2 times a week for 3 months, but it has now been increased to 3 times a week because the patient has started to show thick scales and taking into consideration that the patient’s liver function test is within normal limits. At the moment the patient is 22 months old and is still alive.\n\n【28】Key Points\n\n【29】   Harlequin Ichthyosis lesion consists of thick and rigid skin, skin fissure, and yellow-brown armor like plate that covers every part of the body’s surface.\n   Harlequin ichthyosis can be treated with oral isotretinoin which has a keratolytic effect in controlling the thickness of the skin.\n   Oral isotretinoin dose given to the patient is 1 mg/kg body weight/day showed good results and the patient is still alive", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Psychiatric evaluation\n\n【4】D. Video-EEG monitoring\n\n【5】Answer: 17.1 D . Up to 1% to 3% of patients with pseudoseizures have true, organic epilepsy. This is why patients often require invasive and/or noninvasive video-EEG monitoring to determine whether true epileptic events are present. For the vast majority of patients with pseudoseizures, termination of antiepileptic therapy is recommended.\n\n【6】Question: 17.2 A 23-year-old man is noted to have tonic–clonic activity while yelling and screaming for a fire extinguisher.

However, she has become much worse  删除换行1 over 1 week, with episodes of bloody diarrhoea 10 times a day. She has had some crampy  删除换行1 lower abdominal pain, which lasts for 1–2 h and is partially relieved by defaecation. Over  删除换行1 the last 2–3 days she has become weak with the persistent diarrhoea, and her abdomen has  删除换行1 become more painful and bloated over the last 24h.\n\n【3】She has no relevant previous medical history. Up to 1 year ago, her bowels were regular.\nThere is no disturbance of micturition or menstruation. In her family history, she thinks  删除换行1 one of her maternal aunts may have had bowel problems. She has two children, aged 3 and  删除换行1 8 years, who are both well. She travelled to Spain on holiday 6 months ago but has not travelled elsewhere.\n\n【4】She smokes 10 cigarettes a day and drinks rarely. She took 2 days of amoxicillin after the diarrhoea began with no improvement or worsening of her bowels.\n\n【5】Examination\n\n【6】Her blood pressure is 108/66mmHg. Her pulse rate is 110/min; respiratory rate is 18/min. Her  删除换行1 abdomen is rather distended and tender generally, particularly in the left iliac fossa. Faint  删除换行1 bowel sounds are audible. The abdominal X-ray shows a dilated colon with no faeces.\n\n【7】INVESTIGATIONS\n\n【8】Normal\n\n【9】Haemoglobin 11.1g/dL 11.7–15.7g/dL\n\n【10】Mean corpuscular volume (MCV) 79fL 80–99fL\n\n【11】White cell count 8.8 × 109/L 3.5–11.0 × 109/L\n\n【12】Platelets 280 × 109/L 150–440 × 109/L\n\n【13】Sodium 139mmol/L 135–145mmol/L\n\n【14】Potassium 3.3mmol/L 3.5–5.0mmol/L\n\n【15】Urea 7.6mmol/L 2.5–6.7mmol/L\n\n【16】Creatinine 89μmol/L 70–120μmol/L\n\n【17】Questions\n\n【18】•\t What is your interpretation of these results?\n\n【19】•\t What is the likely diagnosis, and what should be the management?\n\n【20】ANSWER 63\n\n【21】Bloody diarrhoea 10 times a day suggests serious active colitis. In the absence of any recent  删除换行1 foreign travel, it is most likely that this is an acute episode of ulcerative colitis on top of  删除换行1 chronic involvement. The dilated colon suggests a diagnosis of toxic megacolon, which can  删除换行1 rupture with potentially fatal consequences. Investigations such as sigmoidoscopy and colonoscopy may be dangerous in this acute situation and should be deferred until there has  删除换行1 been reasonable improvement. The blood results show mild microcytic anaemia, suggesting  删除换行1 chronic blood loss, low potassium from diarrhoea (explaining in part her weakness) and  删除换行1 raised urea, but normal creatinine, from loss of water and electrolytes.\n\n【22】If the history was just the acute symptoms, then infective causes of diarrhoea would be  删除换行1 higher in the differential diagnosis. Nevertheless, stool should be examined for ova, parasites and culture. Inflammatory bowel disorders have a familial incidence, but the patient’s  删除换行1 aunt has an unknown condition, and the relationship is not close enough to be helpful in  删除换行1 diagnosis. Smoking is associated with Crohn’s disease, but ulcerative colitis is more common  删除换行1 in non-smokers.\n\n【23】Although amoxicillin treatment can be associated with bowel disturbance or even Clostridium  删除换行1 difficile infection but it is not relevant here since the diarrhoea was present before taking  删除换行1 amoxicillin and did not change afterwards.\n\n【24】She should be treated immediately with corticosteroids and intravenous fluid replacement,  删除换行1 including potassium. If the colon is increasing in size or is initially larger than 5.5 cm in  删除换行1 diameter, then a laparotomy should be considered to remove the colon to prevent perforation.\nIf not, the steroids should be continued until the symptoms resolve, and diagnostic procedures such as colonoscopy and biopsy can be carried out safely. Sulphasalazine or mesalazine  删除换行1 are used in the chronic maintenance treatment of ulcerative colitis after resolution of the  删除换行1 acute attack.\n\n【25】In this case, the colon steadily enlarged despite fluid replacement and other appropriate treatment. She required surgery with a total colectomy and ileorectal anastomosis. The histology  删除换行1 confirmed ulcerative colitis. The ileorectal anastomosis will be reviewed regularly; there is an  删除换行1 increased risk of rectal carcinoma.\n\n【26】KEY POINTS\n\n【27】•\t Bloody diarrhoea implies serious colonic pathology.\n\n【28】•\t It is important to monitor colonic dilatation carefully in colitis, and vital to operate  删除换行1 before rupture.\n\n【29】•\t Both Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis can cause a similar picture of active  删除换行1 colitis.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

The rash has been present for about 1 year, but has progressively worsened and spread from involving the axillae to the groin folds and lower back. It is worse during the summer, especially with sweating and friction. She also notes malodorous drainage from these areas that require her to change her clothes twice a day. She has been evaluated by her primary care physician and treated with topical nystatin cream and powder for intertrigo, without improvement. On examination, there are arcuate and polycyclic well-demarcated plaques with central areas of erosion and an erythematous, scaly border ( 92a , b ).\n\n【4】i. What is the diagnosis and aetiology of this condition?\n\n【5】ii. What are the characteristic histological findings?\n\n【6】iii. What treatments are available for this disease?\n\n【7】Answer 92\n\n【8】i. The patient presents with Hailey–Hailey disease, also known as familial benign chronic pemphigus. This is an autosomal dominant disease caused by a mutation in the ATP2C1 gene. Hailey–Hailey disease usually presents in adulthood and is characterized by the formation of flaccid vesicles that evolve into erosions, distributed in the intertriginous areas such as the axillae, groin, perianal region and inframammary region in women. Lesions can become crusted and vegetative and develop painful fissures.\n\n【9】ii. Histologically, Hailey–Hailey disease demonstrates acantholysis in the epidermis, often referred to as a ‘dilapidated brick wall’ in appearance. Although some features may overlap with Darier disease, which is also characterized by acantholysis, the presence of necrotic keratinocytes is not a prominent feature in Hailey–Hailey disease as it is in Darier disease, and the discohesion within the epidermis is more widespread in Hailey–Hailey disease.\n\n【10】iii. Wearing light, loose-fitting clothes can decrease sweating and friction, both of which can exacerbate Hailey–Hailey disease. Topical antimicrobial agents and bleach baths are often recommended to prevent secondary bacterial infection of chronic lesions. For topical treatment, corticosteroids are used often, however, they should be used at the lowest concentration necessary to avoid potential side effects of topical corticosteroids within intertriginous areas. There are also reports of the successful treatment with injection of botulinum toxin. There is no systemic medication that has demonstrated efficacy in large studies to date. There are anecdotal reports on the use of immunomodulatory medications such as prednisone, methotrexate and cyclosporine for patients with severe and refractory Hailey–Hailey disease.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Colectomies performed for patients with diverticulitis complications should target the removal of all diverticula within the colon\n\n【36】28.11 A. Hospitalization for hydration， antibiotics therapy， and monitoring is the most appropriate choice given this patient is not able to tolerate oral intake at home. Surgical resection may be indicated if the patient develops further complications related to his diverticulitis， however the operation will not be done to prevent further episodes of diverticulitis.\n\n【37】28.2 E. This patient has signs and symptoms of large bowel obstruction and evi-dence of ongoing infectious process in the abdomen. Given these findings， surgical exploration is the most appropriate approach listed. CT scan would be helpful to obtain prior to abdominal exploration， however that is not a given option here.\n\n【38】28.33 A. A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis is the best choice given here for identifying the colovesicular fistula. Most of these fistulas related to diver-ticulitis will involve the dome of the bladder. CT scan will demonstrate the bladder proximity to the colon and often demonstrate air within the bladder and associated bladder thickening at the location. Surprisingly， colonoscopies often do not help identify the location of the fistula.\n\n【39】28.44D. All of the choices listed can be associated with the formation of fistulous tracts from the GI tract to an adjacent organ， with diverticulitis being the most common cause of fistula formation.\n\n【40】28.5 C. The main reason for performing colectomies in patients with diverticulitis is to relieve symptoms related to the process or help control a source of sepsis or obstruction. The patient in choice C has ongoing pain related to his diver-ticulitis， and colectomy may help improve his symptoms. All of the patients presented in the other choices have had significant history of diverticulitis but have become free of symptoms following nonoperative management； therefore， they are not likely to benefit from colon resections.\n\n【41】28.6 D.

In hospital, a nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) may be sent for viral immunofluorescence or polymerase chain reaction  删除换行1 (PCR) to test for RSV and other respiratory viruses (e.g. rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus and influenza). This is largely for infection control and epidemiological purposes and  删除换行1 does not affect acute management.\n\n【13】Around 2 to 3  per cent of all infants are admitted each year with RSV bronchiolitis, but  删除换行1 many more are managed at home.

Hence, there is a low threshold for  删除换行1 admitting any baby <2 months of age on day 1 to 2 of their illness as they may deteriorate  删除换行1 and become exhausted and apnoeic.\nManagement is supportive. Investigations are rarely indicated apart from an NPA. A chest  删除换行5 X-ray is needed only if the clinical course is unusual and often leads to unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions. Blood tests are only required if there is diagnostic uncertainty, e.g. if  删除换行1 the infant has a temperature >39°C and a superadded bacterial respiratory infection is suspected. Oxygen saturations should be kept at >92 per cent and the infant should be nasogastrically fed if they cannot maintain >50 per cent of normal intake. Intravenous fluids are  删除换行1 used in severe cases. All fluids are restricted to two-thirds of maintenance. Nasal and oral  删除换行1 suction is helpful. There is no evidence that inhaled bronchodilators, inhaled adrenaline, oral  删除换行1 or inhaled steroids, inhaled hypertonic saline or leukotriene receptor antagonists modify the  删除换行1 clinical course or any important outcomes such as the need for mechanical ventilation or the  删除换行1 length of hospital stay. A capillary blood gas should be checked if the infant is deteriorating.\nEvery season a small proportion of infants need high-dependency or intensive care – most  删除换行1 respond well to continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), avoiding the need for intubation and mechanical ventilation.\nCase 3: A chesty infant\n\n【23】Infants are discharged when they are well enough to continue recovering at home but  删除换行1 many continue to cough and wheeze for weeks afterwards and get similar symptoms with  删除换行1 subsequent upper respiratory tract infections.

The area is asymptomatic, but the patient’s mother is concerned about the hair loss. On examination, there is a patch of scarring alopecia on the vertex of the scalp with a slightly atrophic centre 通用删除7(英):<u>( 86 )</u>.\n\n【4】i. What is the diagnosis?\n\n【5】ii. What other syndromes can be seen with this lesion?\n\n【6】Answer 86\n\n【7】i. This patient has aplasia cutis congenita (ACC), also known as cutis aplasia or congenital scars. This is a skin condition present at birth characterized by absent or scarred areas of the skin. It is caused by abnormal intrauterine skin development, which may be the consequence of a variety of factors including genetic factors, vascular factors, trauma, teratogens or intrauterine infection. ACC is one of the skin lesions of the spinal axis associated with dysraphism. When seen in combination with other skin lesions of the spinal axis, such as an infantile hemangioma, connective tissue nevus, congenital melanocytic nevus or dimples, there is an increased risk of an underlying spinal anomaly and further work-up should be performed.\n\n【8】ACC can demonstrate a wide range of clinical presentations. The patient in this case presents with the most common form, known as membranous aplasia cutis. Membranous lesions typically occur on the midline scalp and present initially at birth as a sharply demarcated round defect with a surrounding collarette of hair, covered by a translucent shiny epithelial membrane. Over time, the lesion flattens to form an atrophic scar. Another major type of ACC is characterized by the presence of stellate lesions that often demonstrate ulceration with a raw hemorrhagic or granulating base.\n\n【9】The scalp accounts for >85% of lesions of ACC. Scalp ACC without other anomalies is usually present at the vertex near the parietal hair whorl. Patients can also present with multiple membranous lesions in a linear arrangement.\n\n【10】ii. There are several syndromes associated with scalp ACC. One notable syndrome is Adams–Oliver syndrome, which usually follows an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. The associated ACC lesions can be large and irregular, and are usually located on the midline scalp along with skull defects and dilated scalp veins. In addition, terminal transverse limb defects, cutis marmorata telangiectatica congenita, cardiac malformations and central nervous system abnormalities are observed. ACC can also be seen in patients with Goltz syndrome and several types of ectodermal dysplasias.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Be familiar with the role of rate and rhythm control strategies in the manage-ment of atrial fibrillation.\n\n【15】Considerations\n\n【16】This 54-year-old patient has several risk factors for the development of atrial fibril-lation. Hypertension， obesity， sleep apnea， and heavy alcohol consumption-espe-cially binge drinking-are all associated with a greater risk for atrial fibrillation. Thus， while other supraventricular tachycardias are possible， atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter is the most likely diagnosis. The irregularly irregular pulse is also very suggestive. An ECG should confirm the diagnosis and differentiate between atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter 删除33：<u></u>. The first priority should be pre-vention ofthromboembolic stroke， which is perhaps the direct consequence ofatrial fibrillation or flutter. For most patients and for patients in whom an early rhythm control strategy is planned， stroke prevention requires systemic anticoagulation with warfarin or a novel oral anticoagulant (NOAC). Control of the ventricular rate is also important to limit symptoms and to avoid the deleterious effects of per-sistent tachycardia on left ventricular function. Rate control is generally achieved with negatively chronotropic drugs such as beta-blockers and nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers such as diltiazem. Acute cardioversion ofatrial fibrillation 删除换行1 or atrial flutter episodes with a definite onset within the last 48 hours can be con-sidered， although in this case the onset of symptoms is outside this timeframe. If spontaneous conversion to sinus rhythm does not occur， cardioversion can be under-taken after either at least 3 weeks of therapeutic anticoagulation or a transesopha-geal echocardiogram demonstrating the absence of left atrial appendage thrombus. Underlying potentially reversible causes of atrial fibrillation such as hyperthyroid-ism should be excluded， and an echocardiogram to assess for structural heart disease-especially mitral valve disease and left ventricular dysfunction-should be ordered. Patients with symptoms or signs suggestive of coronary artery disease may require noninvasive testing to exclude active ischemia.\n\n【17】APPr OACH TO：\n\n【18】Atrial Fibrillation and Atrial Flutter\n\n【19】DEFINITIONS\n\n【20】ATRIAL FIBRILLATION： A chaotic atrial rhythm characterized by very rapid and uncoordinated depolarization (fibrillation) of the atria with resultant loss of atrial mechanical contraction and an irregular， often rapid， ventricular rate.\n\n【21】ATRIAL FLUTTER： A macroreentrant atrial tachycardia around structural or functional barriers in the atria and characterized by rapid atrial contraction at250-300 bpm with ventricular response that is often fast and regular because of2：1 conduction over the AV node.\n\n【22】PAROXYSMAL： Episodes of atrial fibrillation lasting <7 days (typically hours) before spontaneously terminating.\n\n【23】PERSISTENT： Episodes ofatrial fibrillation lasting>7 days， typically until electri-cal or pharmacologic cardioversion.\n\n【24】PERMANENT： Continuous atrial fibrillation present for>1 year， or when a deci-sion has been made not to attempt rhythm control.\n\n【25】LONE ATRIAL FIBRILLATION： Atrial fibrillation in patients younger than60 years and without cardiopulmonary disease.\n\n【26】RATE CONTROL： A strategy to alleviate the symptoms of atrial fibrillation by controlling the ventricular rate with medications and occasionally ablation of the AV node along with pacemaker implant， without attempts to convert the rhythm to sinus rhythm.\n\n【27】RHYTHM CONTROL： A strategy to reestablish and maintain sinus rhythm through the use of antiarrhythmic drugs， cardioversion， and catheter or surgical ablation.\n\n【28】CLINICAL APPROACH\n\n【29】Etiologies\n\n【30】Atrial fibrillation and flutter do not have a single unifying cause. Instead， a number of predisposing conditions are described， especially for atrial fibrilla-tion . Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation is assumed to arise from rapid repetitive atrial depolarizations originating near the pulmonary vein ostia， while persistent atrial fibrillation requires additional abnormalities， especially in the left atrium， for its maintenance. Atrial flutter is less common but also occurs in conditions that cause atrial dilatation， such as pulmonary embolus， mitral or tricuspid valve disease， and congestive heart failure. Typical atrial flutter results from macroreentry around the tricuspid valve and variable amounts of the right atrium. Atypical atrial flutter occurs usually after cardiac surgery or ablation， and is due to reentry around atrial incisions or scars.\n\n| Table 11-1·CONDITIONS ASSOCIATED WITH AN INCREASED RISKOF  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ATRIAL FIBRILLATION  |  |\n| CONg ENITAL  | Familial  |\n|  | Congenital heart disease  |\n|  | Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome  |\n| DEg ENERATIvE  | Advancing age  |\n|  | s ick sinus syndrome  |\n| INCREASED ATRIAL  | Hypertension  |\n| STRETCH  | Hypertension  |\n|  | Pulmonary embolus  |\n|  | Congestive heart failure  |\n|  | Valvular heart disease (especially mitral and tricuspid)  |\n| ISCHEmIA AND HYPOxIA  | Myocardial infarction  |\n|  | Coronary artery disease  |\n|  | Pulmonary disease  |\n| INFLAmmATORY  | Pericarditis  |\n|  | Postoperative (especially cardiac and thoracic surgery)  |\n|  | Infection  |\n| ENDOCRINE  | Hyperthyroidism  |\n|  | d iabetes mellitus  |\n|  | Pheochromocytoma  |\n|  | Obesity  |\n| NEu ROLOg IC  | subarachnoid hemorrhage  |\n|  | stroke  |\n| DRug S  | Alcohol  |\n|  | Theophylline  |\n\n【32】Clinical Presentation\n\n【33】The most common symptoms of atrial fibrillation are fatigue， reduced exercise tolerance， and palpitations. For younger patients in whom ventricular rates are gen-erally higher， palpitations predominate. In older patients and in those in whom rates are better， controlled fatigue and exercise intolerance， which can be insidious， are more prominent. Patients with coronary artery disease may present with angina due to rate-related ischemia. Those with heart failure often present with acute decom-pensation due to loss of atrioventricular synchrony and tachycardia. Most patients have some symptoms that may be manifest as an improvement in exercise capacity after restoration of sinus rhythm， but some are truly asymptomatic. Some patients present with stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA)， or with heart failure due to prolonged tachycardia.\n\n【34】Treatm ent\n\n【35】The first line of treatment of atrial fibrillation is anticoagulation to reduce the risk of stroke or systemic embolism. The risk for stroke is approximately 5 times higher in patients with atrial fibrillation than in the general population， but that risk can be reduced by nearly two-thirds with appropriate anticoagulation. Heparin or low-molecular-weight heparin are used in recent-onset atrial fibrillation in hospitalized patients. The decision to prescribe long-term anticoagulation is based on risk strati-fication using clinical risk assessment tools such as the CHADS2 (where CHADS is Congestive heart failure， Hypertension， Age≥75 years， Diabetes mellitus， Stroke) or CHA2DS2-VASc (vascular disease history) score  and should be weighed against the risk for major bleeding due to anticoagulation using similar risk assessment tools such as HAS-BLED \\[Hypertension， abnormal kidney or liver func-tion， stroke history， bleeding predisposition， Labile INR， Elderly (age 65 or older)，\n\n| Table 11-2·CHADS2 AND CHA2DS2-VASc SCORES  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| CHADS2  | CHA2DS2-VASc  |\n| Congestive heart failure  | Congestive heart failure  |\n| Hypertension  | Hypertension  |\n| Age≥75  | Age ≥75  |\n| diabetes  | d iabetes  |\n| stroke/TIA peripheral embolism  | stroke/TIA/peripheral embolism  |\n|  | Vascular disease (prior myocardial infarction， peripheralartery disease， aortic plaque)  |\n|  | Age 65-74  |\n|  | s ex category (female gender)  |\n\n【37】Note： Each risk factor is given 1 point except stroke/TIA/ peripheral embolism， which is given 2 in both system s， and age ≥75 in the CHA2DS2-VASc score. A score of≥2 is considered an indication for antico-agulation， whereas either aspirin or anticoagulation is recommended for a score of≥1， and aspirin for a score of0.\n\n【38】drug or alcohol abuse\\]. In patients with one or more CHADS2 risk factors， anti-coagulation with warfarin (with an INR of 2.0-3.0)， dabigatran， rivaroxaban， or apixaban is preferred. Aspirin is used for low-risk patients， although its role is less clear. The risk of stroke and the benefit ofanticoagulation is similar in patients who have paroxysmal and persistent atrial fibrillation. The role of anticoagulation is less well studied in patients with atrial flutter， but as this arrhythmia frequently coexists with atrial fibrillation， the same guidelines are used.\n\n【39】Two strategies can be used to control the arrhythmia itself： 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> rhythm control， where attempts are made to restore and maintain sinus rhythm through the use of antiarrhythmic drugs， cardioversion， and catheter-based or surgical ablation； and通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> rate control， where atrial fibrillation is accepted as the rhythm but the ven-tricular rate is controlled with drugs， or occasionally pacemaker implantation with ablation ofthe AV node in patients with refractory tachycardia. Mortality rates are equivalent between these two approaches， and as most strokes occur when anticoag-ulation is stopped， this should be continued in patients with risk factors even when sinus rhythm is restored， because of the possibility of asymptomatic recurrences. Studies of drug-treated patients using long-term ambulatory monitoring have dem-onstrated that asymptomatic paroxysms ofatrial fibrillation are common even when office ECGs consistently reveal sinus rhythm during follow-up.\n\n【40】Quality oflife and functional status is consistently better in patients who success-fully maintain sinus rhythm； however， current antiarrhythmic drug therapy is char-acterized by limited efficacy and toxicity. Nonetheless， this approach is favored in patients who have significant symptoms as a consequence of their atrial fibrillation.\n\n【41】Rate control is achieved primarily with beta-blockers and nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (eg， diltiazem or verapamil). Digoxin has a limited role as its vagotonic effect is quickly overcome by adrenergic states such as exercise and should rarely be used as the sole rate control agent. Atrial flutter is often more symptomatic and is generally more difficult to rate-control than atrial fibrillation， due to the rapid organized atrial depolarizations. In cases of refractory symptoms or hemodynamic compromise due to rapidly conducted atrial fibrillation， ablation of the AV node with implantation of a pacemaker is a useful strategy. The disadvantage ofthis approach is that it renders the patient permanently pacemaker-dependent. In patients with left ventricular dysfunction， biventricular pacing should be considered.\n\n【42】Class 1C or class 3 antiarrhythmic drugs are used to establish and maintain sinus rhythm in the rhythm control strategy. Class 1C drugs (flecainide or propafenone) are used in patients without structural heart disease. The class 3 drugs sotalol and dofetilide are options in patients with coronary artery disease， but are contraindi-cated in those with significant renal impairment. Dofetilide and another class 3drug amiodarone are the only reasonable antiarrhythmic options for patients with left ventricular dysfunction as the 1C agents are associated with an increased risk for dangerous arrhythmia in patients with reduced pump function， and sotalol has significant negative inotropic properties. Amiodarone is perhaps the most effective antiarrhythmic for the treatment of atrial fibrillation but is limited by significant dose-dependent toxicities， especially thyroid and pulmonary. Dronedarone is an amiodarone analog that is contraindicated in patients with heart failure and those with permanent atrial fibrillation.\n\n【43】Cardioversion is used in patients with persistent atrial fibrillation. Therapeutic anticoagulation for at least 3 weeks prior to this is needed to ensure the absence of thrombus in the left atrial appendage， and for 4 weeks after， regardless ofthe baseline risk of thromboembolism. With the return ofleft atrial contractile function in sinus rhythm， the postcardioversion period presents a higher risk as any such thrombi may be dislodged. In patients who have not been anticoagulated. a transesophageal echo can be performed to exclude the presence of left atrial appendage thrombi； however， therapeutic anticoagulation after cardioversion is still required. Pharma-cologic cardioversion can be achieved with oral flecainide or propafenone， or with intravenous ibutilide or amiodarone. Electrical cardioversion is performed by a car-diologist under anesthesia via an external defibrillator. A biphasic shock is delivered through the chest that alters transmembrane gradients via an incompletely under-stood mechanism， leading to the cessation ofatrial fibrillation and the resumption of sinus rhythm. The use of antiarrhythmic drugs after cardioversion delays recurrence of atrial fibrillation and should be strongly considered.\n\n【44】Catheter-based ablation uses radiofrequency energy to isolate the pulmonary veins from the left atrium， thereby preventing the rapid discharges that form the electrophysiologic basis of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation from reaching the atrium. Catheter-based ablation is superior to antiarrhythmic drug therapy in the mainte-nance of sinus rhythm. Success rates are highest in patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation， normal or mildly dilated left atria， and without structural heart disease. The procedure is time-consuming and technically challenging， and effects on long-term stroke and mortality rates remain under investigation. Surgical ablation of atrial fibrillation is often combined with concomitant heart surgery (valve surgery or coronary artery bypass)， although it can also be performed as a standalone proce-dure. Results may be comparable to catheter ablation， although recovery time and complication rates are higher， and standalone surgical ablation is generally reserved for those who have failed at or been turned down for catheter ablation.\n\n【45】Ablation of atrial flutter is technically more straightforward and associated with higher success rates (95%) and is superior to antiarrhythmic drugs， even as a first-line approach. Patients with symptomatic atrial flutter should be evaluated for cath-eter ablation rather than repeated cardioversions and extended antiarrhythmic drug therapy. The risk of developing atrial fibrillation in a patient with atrial flutter is approximately 10% per year， so continuation ofanticoagulation in patients with risk factors for thromboembolism， even after successful ablation of atrial flutter， should be carefully considered.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Common associated infections include Campylobacter jejuni and herpesvirus. Althougha preceding event is present in most patients，approximately one third of patients with GBS report no suchevents during the preceding 1-4 weeks.  |\n| What is the etiology of this condition? GBS is thought to be an autoimmune reaction that develops in response to a previous infection or othermedical condition. This process results in aberrant demyelination of peripheral nerves and ventral motornerve roots. Cranial nerve roots can also be affected.  |\n| What laboratory finding is likely in this condition? Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) reveals a markedly elevated protein concentration with a normal cell count，commonly referred to as albuminocytologic dissociation. This contrasts the increased cell counts typicalof CNS infection. Increased CSF protein can lead to papilledema.  |\n| What is the appropriate treatment for this condition? The first element of GBS management is supportive care and treatment of the underlying condition witheither IVIG antibody or plasmapheresis. Pulmonary function should be monitored with peak flow studiesto assess for respiratory failure. Rehabilitation may be required to restore function.  |\n| If this patient's symptoms worsen over the next few months with no signs of improvement， whatalternative diagnosis should be considered?

She reports that she has been feeling gradually more tired and staying up late at night because she can’t sleep. She does not feel that she is doing as well in her occupation as a secretary and states that she has trouble remembering things. She does not go outdoors as much as she used to and cannot recall the last time she went out with friends or enjoyed a social gathering. She feels tired most of the week and states she feels that she wants to go to sleep and frequently does not want to get out of bed. She denies any recent medication, illicit drug, or alcohol use. She feels intense guilt regarding past failed relationships because she perceives them as faults. She states she has never thought of suicide, but has begun to feel increasingly worthless.\n\n【3】Her vital signs and general physical examination are normal, although she becomes tearful while talking. Her mental status examination is significant for depressed mood, psychomotor retardation, and difficulty attending to questions. Laboratory studies reveal a normal metabolic panel, normal complete blood count, and normal thyroid functions.\n\n【4】 What is the most likely diagnosis?\n\n【5】 What is your next step?\n\n【6】 What are important considerations and potential complications of management?\n\n【7】### ANSWERS TO CASE 25:  \nMajor Depression\n\n【8】Summary: This is a 38-year-old woman with depression. She meets at least five of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition ( DSM-IV ) diagnostic criteria during a 2-week period that represents a change from her previous level of functioning. At least one of the symptoms must be either depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure.\n\n【9】• Most likely diagnosis: Major depression.\n\n【10】• Next step: Evaluate the patient for suicidal risk; begin pharmacologic and psychotherapeutic management.\n\n【11】• Important considerations and potential complications: Rule out other medical diagnoses such as hypothyroidism, anemia, and infectious processes that could mimic some symptoms of depression; verify that no substance abuse or use is taking place; screen for bipolar disorder and inquire about a family history of mood disorders; investigate and address suicidal ideations; review any recent medication changes for agents that may contribute to these symptoms (eg, β-blockers, steroids, sedatives, chemotherapy agents).\n\n【12】### ANALYSIS\n\n【13】#### Objectives\n\n【14】1\\. Recognize the common presenting signs and symptoms of depression.\n\n【15】2\\. Understand the multifactorial pathogenesis of depression.\n\n【16】3\\. Learn about the treatment of depression and the sequelae of this condition.\n\n【17】4\\. Be familiar with the appropriate follow-up of this condition.\n\n【18】5\\. Recognize the importance of assessing for suicidal risk.\n\n【19】#### Considerations\n\n【20】The case presented represents a common presentation of depression. The patient often does not come in with a complaint of depression. However, the symptoms of fatigue, insomnia, and mood swings are frequently seen. It then becomes incumbent on the physician to address the topic of depression with the patient. As the symptoms of depression, such as memory disturbance or inability to concentrate, can limit your patient’s ability to provide a good history, it is helpful to speak to a close contact of the patient, such as the spouse, to gather information that will confirm the diagnosis.\n\n【21】Once the diagnosis of depression is suspected, it is critical to determine the most appropriate level of care for the patient. The clinician must specifically and directly address the patient’s risk of harming herself or others. If she is actively suicidal, such as describing the desire to hurt herself and having a plan to do so, then hospitalization may be necessary. Similarly, if the patient is unable to care for herself then hospitalization should be considered. If the patient does not have suicidal ideations, is not assessed as a risk to herself or others, and has support at home, then outpatient therapy with close follow-up is usually appropriate.\n\n【22】### APPROACH TO:  \nDepression\n\n【23】### DEFINITIONS\n\n【24】MAJOR DEPRESSION: One or more episodes of mood disorder each of which lasts at least 2 weeks. The most prominent symptoms of major depressive disorder are depressed mood and loss of interest or pleasure. Insomnia and weight loss often accompany major depression, but depressed patients may also have weight gain and hypersomnia.\n\n【25】DYSTHYMIC DISORDER: A chronic depression of mood which does not meet the criteria for major depression, in terms of either severity or duration of individual episodes, yet the patient still has loss of interest, lack of appetite or pleasure, and low energy.\n\n【26】### CLINICAL APPROACH\n\n【27】#### Background\n\n【28】Depression has a lifetime prevalence of 15% to 25%, with a greater incidence in women and the elderly. Symptoms for depression must include at least 5 of the 9 following symptoms, must occur during the same 2-week time period, must represent a change from previous functioning, and must include either depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure:\n\n【29】1\\. Depressed mood\n\n【30】2\\. Diminished interest or pleasure\n\n【31】3\\. Significant weight loss or weight gain\n\n【32】4\\. Insomnia or hypersomnia\n\n【33】5\\. Psychomotor agitation or retardation\n\n【34】6\\. Fatigue or loss of energy\n\n【35】7\\. Feelings of worthlessness\n\n【36】8\\. Diminished ability to think or concentrate; indecisiveness\n\n【37】9\\. Recurrent thoughts of death, suicidal ideation, suicide attempt, or specific plan Also,\n\n【38】• Symptoms do not meet criteria for a mixed episode (both mania and depressive episode).\n\n【39】• Symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment of functioning.\n\n【40】• Symptoms are not a result of the direct physiologic effects of a substance or a generalized medical condition.\n\n【41】• Symptoms are not accounted for by bereavement.\n\n【42】A patient with depression commonly presents to the physician with various somatic complaints and decreased energy level rather than a complaint of depression. Patients often complain of sadness, sometimes of irritability or mood swings. Difficulty concentrating or loss of energy and motivation are common. Their thinking is often negative, frequently with feelings of worthlessness, hopelessness, or helplessness. Poor memory or concentration may be a complaint in others. The elderly may present with confusion or a general decline in functioning. The diagnosis of depression needs to be considered in scenarios where a patient presents with multiple unrelated physical symptoms.\n\n【43】The differential diagnosis of depression includes many other psychiatric and medical disorders. The psychiatric disorders include dysthymic disorder, bereavement, and bipolar disorder. Numerous medical conditions can cause depressive symptoms. Common among these are hypothyroidism and anemia. The role of pharmacologic agents and substance use, abuse, or dependence also should be investigated, as these can cause significant mood changes. This is especially true of alcohol, sedatives, narcotics, and cocaine.\n\n【44】#### Pathophysiology\n\n【45】The etiology of depression is thought to be multifactorial, involving a complex interaction of genetic, psychosocial, and neurobiologic factors. Multiple neurotransmitter systems are implicated, including the serotoninergic, noradrenergic, and dopaminergic systems. Evidence of the effects of neurotransmitters on mood disorders is supported by the knowledge of the mechanism of action of antidepressant medications. All currently available antidepressant agents appear to work by increasing the amount of neurotransmitter available to the postsynaptic nerve. They accomplish this by 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> enhancing neurotransmitter release, 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> reducing neurotransmitter breakdown, or 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> inhibiting the reuptake of the neurotransmitter by the presynaptic neuron.\n\n【46】#### Morbidity and Mortality\n\n【47】Depression causes significant morbidity and mortality in numerous ways. Depression is frequently reported in persons with underlying medical conditions. It is a common occurrence following myocardial infarctions and cerebrovascular accidents. Persons with depression and preexisting cardiovascular disease have a three and half times greater risk of dying of a heart attack than do nondepressed patients. Studies also show that persons with depression have a greater chance of developing or dying from cardiovascular disease , even after controlling for traditional risk factors such as smoking, blood pressure, and lipid levels. Depression also contributes to the disruption of interpersonal relationships, the development of substance abuse, and absenteeism from work and school.\n\n【48】All depressed patients should be screened for suicidal and homicidal/violent ideations. A history of suicide attempts or violence is a significant risk factor for future attempts. Major depression plays a role in more than half of all suicide attempts. Women, especially those younger than age 30 years, attempt suicide more frequently than men, but men are more likely to complete suicide . Firearms are the most commonly used method in completed suicides. Table 25–1 lists the risk factors for suicide attempts and completed suicides.\n删除4：<u>Table 25–1 • RISK FACTORS FOR SUICIDE ATTEMPTS AND COMPLETED SUICIDES</u>\n\n【49】#### Physical Findings\n\n【50】Most patients with depression have no significant physical abnormalities on examination. Those who have more severe symptoms may reveal decline in grooming or hygiene along with significant weight changes. Speech may be normal, slow, monotonic, or lacking in content. Pressured speech is suggestive of mania, whereas disorganized speech suggests the need to evaluate for psychosis. The thought content of patients with depression includes feelings of inadequacy, helplessness, or hopelessness. Sometimes patients complain of being overwhelmed. Psychomotor retardation can manifest as slowing of movements or reactions, especially in the elderly.\n\n【51】### TREATMENT\n\n【52】Initial pharmacotherapy should be based on physician familiarity with medication, anticipated safety and tolerability, anticipation of adverse effects, and history of prior treatments. Pharmacotherapy with psychotherapy is more effective than either pharmacotherapy or psychotherapy alone. Treatment should be geared toward doing both to improve chances of successful therapy. Treatment failures typically result from medication noncompliance, inadequate duration of therapy, or inadequate dosing. No class of medication has been proven to be more effective than other classes. Patients treated for a first episode of major depression should be treated for at least 6 to 9 months; recurrent depression needs to be treated for longer periods of time. The need for lifelong therapy is higher with increasing number of episodes of depression. All antidepressants carry an FDA “black box” warning that they increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in children, adolescents, and young adults, especially in the first months of treatment .\n\n【53】### CLASSES OF MEDICATIONS\n删除4：<u>Table 25–2 lists the medications used in the treatment of depression.</u>\n删除4：<u>Table 25–2 • MEDICATIONS USED IN THE TREATMENT OF DEPRESSION</u>\n\n【54】#### Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors\n\n【55】Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) increase the amount of the neurotransmitter serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) available to the postsynaptic neuron by blocking the presynaptic neuron’s ability to reuptake serotonin. Because it can take 3 to 6 weeks of therapy before significant improvement in mood occurs, dosage adjustments of these medications should occur no more often than monthly. These agents have a low risk of toxicity if taken as an overdose (either accidentally or intentionally), making them very safe to use. Common side effects include sexual dysfunction, weight gain, gastrointestinal disturbance, fatigue, and agitation. Because of their efficacy and safety, SSRIs are frequently used as first-line agents for the treatment of depression.\n\n【56】#### Serotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors\n\n【57】Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) affect both the serotonergic and noradrenergic systems. They act primarily on the serotonergic system at lower dosages and on the noradrenergic system at higher dosages. Their side effects are similar to SSRIs. They can be used as first-line treatment for depression and, because of their effects on two neurotransmitter systems, may be used as second-line agents in SSRI failure.\n\n【58】#### Tricyclic Antidepressants\n\n【59】Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are older agents that affect, to varying degrees, the reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin. They are effective for the treatment of depression and, because they have been in use for many years, are inexpensive. However, they have numerous side effects, including sedation, dry mouth, dry eyes, urinary retention, weight gain, and sexual disturbance. They also carry the risk that they are highly toxic and potentially fatal in overdose. Because of the side effects and risks, TCAs have largely been replaced by SSRIs as the first-line treatment of depression.\n\n【60】#### Monamine Oxidase Inhibitors\n\n【61】Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) cause increased amounts of serotonin and norepinephrine to be released during nerve stimulation. Patients taking MAOIs must be on a tyramine-restricted diet to reduce the risk of severe, and sometimes fatal, hypertensive crisis. MAOIs also interact with numerous other medications, including SSRIs and meperidine (Demerol). These interactions can also be fatal. Because of the risks, MAOIs should only be used by experienced practitioners and only when the benefits outweigh the risks.\n\n【62】#### Atypical Agents\n\n【63】The different atypical agents may act similarly to SSRIs, TCAs, and MAOIs, in varying degrees. Their primary benefit is a lower incidence of sexual disturbance as a side effect. Bupropion is associated with a risk of seizure at higher doses and is contraindicated in patients with a history of seizure disorders. Trazodone carries the risk, although rare, of causing priapism. It is also highly sedating and is frequently used as a sleep aid.\n\n【64】### INPATIENT MANAGEMENT\n\n【65】Inpatient management is indicated when the patient presents a significant risk to self (suicide, inability to care for self) or others (risk of violence), or the symptoms are sufficiently severe to initiate treatment in controlled settings. Involvement of a psychiatrist is warranted in the care of patients in whom more severe symptoms require more intensive care (suicidal ideations, psychosis, mania, and severe decline in physical health).\n\n【66】### OTHER MOOD DISORDERS\n\n【67】#### Anxiety Disorders\n\n【68】Anxiety disorders is a classification of mood disorders that are common in the population such as panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), generalized anxiety disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and phobia. Patients with generalized anxiety disorder have excessive and difficult-to-control worry and anxiety that causes physical symptoms, including restlessness, irritability, sleep disturbance, and difficulty concentrating. Panic disorder is characterized by recurrent panic attacks, which are defined as periods of intense fear of abrupt onset. OCD manifests as either obsessions (recurrent, intrusive, and inappropriate thoughts) or compulsions (repetitive behaviors) that are unreasonable, excessive, and cause much distress to the patient. PTSD is a response to a severe traumatic event in which the patient suffers fear, helplessness, or horror. A phobia is an irrational fear that causes a conscious avoidance of a situation, subject, or activity. Patients with anxiety disorders are at high risk for developing comorbid depression.\n\n【69】#### Bereavement\n\n【70】Bereavement is defined as symptoms of a major depressive episode that occur after the loss of a loved one. If the symptoms last longer than 2 months and involve suicidal ideations, morbid preoccupations, or psychosis, then a diagnosis of major depression is made.\n\n【71】#### Bipolar Disorder (Manic Depression)\n\n【72】This mood disorder affects genders equally but often presents in young people. Symptoms include the abrupt onset of increased energy, decreased need for sleep, pressured speech, decreased attention span, hypersexuality, spending large amounts of money, and engaging in outrageous activities. Concomitant substance abuse should always be investigated. Episodes must last longer than 1 week and should be abrupt, not continuous. Continuous behavior of this type suggests personality disorders or schizophrenia. A single episode of mania is sufficient for the diagnosis of bipolar disorder. All patients diagnosed with depression should be questioned about mania , as the treatments are different. Bipolar disorder is typically treated with mood stabilizers, which include valproate, carbamazepine, and lithium. The use of antidepressant agents in bipolar disorder may precipitate acute manic behaviors.\n\n【73】#### Dysthymic Disorder\n\n【74】This mood disorder presents with continuous low mood as the primary symptom. Typically 2 years of low mood is used for diagnosis. Dysthymia is less acute but longer in duration than major depression. If a major depressive episode takes place during the 2 years of dysthymia, then, by definition, it is major depression rather than dysthymia.\n\n【75】###", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

You have been her primary care physician for several years. When reviewing her chart, you notice a radiology report from her visit to the emergency department (ED) where she had presented 10 months ago with fever and cough. Chest radiography was performed at that time to rule out pneumonia. The study was read as showing no parenchymal abnormalities, but there was a suggestion of a retrosternal mass.

Do you need to first speak with an oncologist so that you can answer the question as to what this mass might be and whether the delay in diagnosis will affect the patient’s prognosis?\n\n【5】 Is an apology appropriate at this time? If so, for what specifically?\n\n【6】### ANSWERS TO CASE 18:\n\n【7】#### Disclosure and Apology\n\n【8】Summary : A 45-year-old woman is scheduled to see you for an annual routine visit. You noted a radiology report from chest radiography performed 10 months ago at the ED. The study suggested a retrosternal mass, and a follow-up examination was recommended. You do not remember ever having seen this report.\n\n【9】 Amount of detail to disclose to the patient : Disclose only what is known to you; do not speculate.\n\n【10】 Should you postpone having this conversation until you have spoken to the ED physician? Do not delay speaking with the patient, despite the fact that you do not have all of the answers. Disclose the information that you have and reassure the patient that you will keep her informed as you gather more information.\n\n【11】 Do you need to first speak with an oncologist? No, not if there is not time to do so prior to seeing the patient. Provide the patient with the information that you do know. You can speak with the patient again after speaking with the oncologist or after referring the patient for follow-up with an oncologist.\n\n【12】 Is an apology appropriate at this time? If so, for what specifically? An expression of empathy is always appropriate and this often uses the language of apology (eg, “I am so sorry that you have to go through this”). In this case, you do know there was a delay in seeing the report, so there should be an apology for that, for example, “I am sorry that I did not see this report until now. I will make sure we get you in to see the appropriate specialist right away.”\n\n【13】### ANALYSIS\n\n【14】##### Objectives\n\n【15】1\\. Identify the principles of transparent and compassionate disclosure.\n\n【16】2\\. Understand that disclosure is a process, not a single conversation.\n\n【17】3\\. Recognize the emotional challenges faced by clinicians following an adverse event so that these do not prevent transparent and compassionate interactions with the patient and family.\n\n【18】##### Considerations\n\n【19】In the case described, a woman is noted to have a retrosternal mass on chest radiography and a follow-up visit recommended. The patient is scheduled for a routine physical examination. In general, always share with the patient the known facts as soon as possible and do not speculate. Do not delay the discussion until you have the answers.\n\n【20】The patient will undoubtedly have many important questions that you will be unable to answer at this time. Acknowledge the importance of these questions and reassure her that you will arrange for her to see an oncologist who will guide her through the next steps. You should not speculate as to why this happened, but do make clear that you will look into why the report did not come to your attention. Be sure to express empathy (eg, “I am so sorry you have to go through this uncertainty”). Acknowledge how difficult it must be to hear this and invite her to express concerns and ask questions. Close by reviewing precise next steps (eg, “I am going to set up an appointment for you with one of my colleagues for sometime this week”). Lastly, be sure to remind her that you will be there for her.\n\n【21】### APPROACH TO:\n\n【22】#### Disclosure and Apology\n\n【23】### DEFINITIONS\n\n【24】ADVERSE EVENT : An undesired harmful effect that is not due to the patient’s underlying disease process; it may or may not be related to an error.\n\n【25】APOLOGY : A specific acknowledgment and expression of regret for having done something wrong or contributed to an error.\n\n【26】DISCLOSURE : A transparent process in which the known facts of a case are discussed with a patient, family members, or both.\n\n【27】### CLINICAL APPROACH\n\n【28】We have a professional ethical obligation to inform our patients regarding their care. This is especially important when there has been an error. However, several research studies have shown that clinicians are not skilled in having discussions with patients and families after medical errors. It seems reasonable to assume that some of the barriers to meeting patient needs after errors might include the clinician’s sense of vulnerability and emotional distress.\n\n【29】Grappling with a medical error that caused harm to a patient is one of the most challenging moments of any clinician’s career. Many studies have documented the negative emotional impact on clinicians who have made errors. In addition to the sadness at seeing a patient experience suffering, there are professional, personal, and societal expectations of perfection that, although we may know intellectually are unrealistic, we feel deeply on an emotional level. Making an error shatters any illusions of perfection and can result in clinicians feeling ashamed, incompetent, guilty, and sad. The feelings of shame may be particularly strong because of a culture that expects perfection. These emotions may be accompanied by fear of loss of the patient’s trust, damaged reputation amongst colleagues, and possible litigation.\n\n【30】The event often involves a series of errors or perhaps someone else’s error. Clinicians may be in a position, then, of having to disclose and apologize for a colleague’s error. In addition, most clinicians do not have a great deal of experience in this arena, because the incidence of an individual clinician making a clinically significant error is not likely to be high, even over many years of practice. Therefore, it is important for all clinicians to understand some basic principles underlying effective disclosure conversations:\n\n【31】 The most important principle is to do what is best for the patient and family. The question is not “What would I want my physician to do or say in this instance?” Rather, it is trying to understand the needs of the patient and family in the moment and as they evolve.\n\n【32】 The attending physician taking care of the patient when the error is discovered should lead the conversation. If another attending made the error, that physician should ideally be the one to apologize and disclose, but this may be impractical in the immediate aftermath. When appropriate, other team members such as a nurse, social worker or trainee, could be present if this would be helpful to the patient and family.\n\n【33】 Always share with the patient the known facts as soon as possible. It is inadvisable to wait until there has been a root cause analysis or any process that will flesh out all the details.\n\n【34】 Do not speculate. If you know what happened but not why, then all you can share is what you do know. Speculation can inadvertently implicate others or mislead the patient. Because disclosure is a process, not an event, you should explain that you will continue to keep the patient informed if and when more information becomes available.\n\n【35】 Express empathy. One of the most direct ways to do so is to say, “I am sorry this happened. It is not what you or we expected.”\n\n【36】 If there has clearly been an error, then apologize. For example, you might say, “I am so sorry we gave you the wrong dose of medication.”\n\n【37】 Directly outline the next steps regarding the patient’s clinical care, and then pause and solicit the patient’s questions or concerns.\n\n【38】 If appropriate, explain that you or your institution is looking into why the event occurred and that you will get back to the patient when you have further information. If there has been an error, then it is important to say that you and your institution are committed to learning from this and working to improve processes to prevent a similar event from happening again.\n\n【39】 Be aware of your emotions so that they do not interfere with your ability to be transparent and compassionate.\n\n【40】Because this process can be emotionally challenging for physicians, it is important for health care institutions to provide both disclosure coaching as well as clinician peer support. Disclosure coaching is needed because few clinicians have vast experience in disclosing errors, and sometimes the circumstances of the adverse event are complicated enough that it is difficult to know what to say and how to say it. In addition, because of the emotions noted above, peer support is essential in helping the clinician be fully present for the patient and his or her family as well as to learn and grow from the experience.\n\n【41】### ANALYSIS AND DISCUSSION\n\n【42】Applying these principles to the case above, the following would be a reasonable approach to consider. If the patient has a scheduled appointment the same day you first notice the radiology report, then you would need to tell her about this at that appointment. Delaying the discussion until you have the answers to these questions would likely generate a sense of mistrust. The patient is likely to have several important questions that you will not be able to answer, such as:\n\n【43】 What exactly could this mass be?\n\n【44】 What is going to happen to her?\n\n【45】 If this turns out to be cancer, then will the delay in following-up on the radiograph have harmed her?\n\n【46】All you can say is that these questions are important and that you do not have the answers right now. You are going to arrange for her to see a specialist who will guide her through the process, and you will make sure she gets the best advice and treatment.\n\n【47】Because you know there was an error in not having followed up on the abnormal results on the radiographs, you need to apologize for this. You should not speculate as to why this happened. However, you can say that you are going to look into why the report did not come to your attention.\n\n【48】After pausing and waiting for her to absorb the information, acknowledge how difficult it must be to hear this. Ask how she is feeling and invite her to express any concerns and to ask any questions.\n\n【49】Close by discussing the next steps that you will take, for example, “I am going to set up an appointment with one of my colleagues for sometime this week.” Express empathy by saying, “I am so sorry you have to go through this uncertainty.” Ask whether she or her family has any other questions right now and remind her that you will be there for her.\n\n【50】Every disclosure situation is unique and challenging. There is no perfect way to have these difficult conversations, but an understanding of some basic principles can be helpful. In addition, it is important that clinicians understand their own emotions so they can manage them and focus on the needs of the patient. Institutional programs that provide disclosure coaching and peer support are invaluable in helping physicians be honest and empathic with their patients.\n\n【51】###", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

This twisting movement allows the gut to pass under  删除换行1 the primitive superior mesenteric vessels as they form, before re-entering the abdomen.The DJ flexure is then fixed to the base of the left hemidiaphragm by the ligament of  删除换行5 Treitz, and the caecal pole is secured in the right lower quadrant.\n\n【15】If the primitive gut is secured to a mesentry that is shorter than usual, the gut cannot  删除换行1 complete its full rotation, leaving the caceal pole and DJ junction in anatomically abnormal positions. This is termed ‘malrotation’, and is best diagnosed with a barium follow-259 删除换行1 through study, to identify the abnormal peritoneal fixation from the position of the bowel  删除换行1 loops. On a CT scan, the position of the superior mesenteric vessels is reversed, with the  删除换行1 superior mesenteric artery (SMA) positioned to the right of the superior mesenteric vein  删除换行1 (SMV). Imaging studies demonstrate a variety of appearances depending on how much  删除换行1 of the 270 degrees the bowel rotated before fixation, with a right-sided duodenum and  删除换行1 jejunum being the commonest finding.

The patient denies a history of recent trauma， prior knee surgery， sick contacts， or similar symptoms in the past. The patient states he has had fevers and chills over this time. His past medical history is notable for poorly controlled non-insulin-dependent diabetes and alcohol abuse. He is febrile with a temperature of102.7°F and has an elevated heart rate of 110 beats/minute. His blood pressure is160/95 mmHg， respiratory rate is 16 breaths/min， and oxygen saturation is 100%on room air. Examination of the knee demonstrates a swollen， erythematous，and diffusely tender right knee that is warm to palpation with painful and limited pas-sive range of motion. Radiographs of the knee are negative for an acute fracture or dislocation but do show an effusion. The patient's laboratory values include a white blood cell (WBC) count of 19，100 cells/u.L， erythrocyte sedimentation rate(ESR) of 48 mm/hr， and C-reactive protein (CRP) of 20 mg/L.

He denies any trauma or previous right knee surgery. Radiographs show an effusion but no fracture or dislocation of his right knee. Additionally， his WBC， ESR， and CRP are all elevated. Blood cultures are pending.\n\n【6】Most likely diagnosis： Septic arthritis. However， the differential diagnosis also includes crystalline arthropathies (ie， gout， pseudogout) inflammatory arthri-dites (ie， rheumatoid， psoriatic， and reactive arthritis)， tumor， occult fracture， Lyme disease， and osteoarthritis.\n\n【7】Next diagnostic step： Obtaining joint fluid aspirate for analysis， including a cell count with differential， Gram stain， glucose level， and crystal analysis.\n\n【8】Initial treatment： Intravenous antibiotic therapy (after obtaining blood cul-tures and joint fluid aspirate) and operative irrigation and drainage.\n\n【9】Objectives\n\n【10】1\\.

He is also febrile to102.7°F and tachycardic. His laboratory values are abnormal and are representative of an acute infectious or inflammatory process. Furthermore， the patient's history of poorly controlled diabetes makes him vulnerable to systemic infection. The suspi-cion for a septic right knee in this patient must be high. Given the history of alcohol abuse， gout is a possibility. However， his fevers and chills again favor an infectious cause of his knee pain and swelling. The patient has no history of inflammatory ar-thridities， such as rheumatoid arthritis， and this diagnosis is unlikely. A diagnosis of Lyme disease should always be considered in the differential for septic arthritis， but is more likely in the setting of a positive tick exposure history where the disease is endemic. Synovial fluid aspirate from this patient's right knee will likely be consis-tent with septic arthritis ， at which time intravenous antibiotics must be started and operative irrigation and drainage performed.\n\n| Table 19-1·CLASSIFICATION OF SYNOVIAL FLUID IN AN ADULT KNEE JOINT  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Normal  | Septic  | Noninflammatory(ie， osteoarthritis)  | Inflammatory(ie， rheumatoidarthritis)  | CrystallineArthropathy(ie， gout)  |\n| Volume (<3.5mL)  | <3.5  | ≥3.5  | \\>3.5  | ≥3.5  | \\>3.5  |\n| Viscosity  | High  | Mixed  | High  | LOW  | LOW  |\n| Clarity  | Clear  | Opaque  | Clear  | Cloudy  | Cloudy  |\n| Color  | Colorless/straw  | Mixed  | Straw /yellow  | Yellow  | Yellow  |\n| WBC/mm²  | <200  | \\>50，000  | <2000  | 5000-75，000  | 5000-75，000  |\n| Polys (%)  | <25  | \\>70  | <25  | 50-70  | 50-70  |\n| Gram stain  | Negative  | Often positive  | Negative  | Negative  | Negative， butcrystal analysiswill be positive  |\n\n【16】APPROACH TO：\n\n【17】DEFINITIONS\n\n【18】SEPTIC ARTHRITIS： An orthopaedic surgical emergency most commonly caused by bacterial seeding of a joint.\n\n【19】OSTEOMYELITIS： An infection of bone that can cause a septic arthritis or occur as a sequela of it.\n\n【20】ARTHROCENTESIS： Term describing the process by which synovial fluid is obtained； also referred to as joint aspiration.\n\n【21】CLINICAL APPROACH\n\n【22】Pathophysiology\n\n【23】Septic arthritis most commonly occurs in the knee， followed in frequency by the hip， elbow， ankle， and， least commonly， the sternoclavicular joint. It typically occurs after bacterial seeding of the joint， but can also be caused by fungi and viruses. The 3predominant ways by which this occurs are through direct inoculation from trauma or surgery， contiguous spread from an adjacent osteomyelitis， or in the setting of bacteremia， which is more likely to arise in immunocompromised and hospitalized individuals who have recently undergone invasive procedures.\n\n【24】Septic arthritis causes rapid and irreversible articular hyaline cartilage destruc-tion in the involved joint due to the release of proteolytic enzymes from the\n\n| Table 19-2·COMMON ORGANISMS ASSOCIATED WITH SEPTIC ARTHRITIS  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Organism  |  |\n| Staphylococcus species  | Staphylococcus aureus most common， seen in > 50% cases  |\n| Neisseria gonorrhea  | Most common bacteria in otherwise healthy sexually active youngadults  |\n| Salmonella  | Seen in patients with sickle cell disease  |\n| Pseudomonas aeruginosa  | Seen in patients with history of IV drug abuse  |\n| Eikenella corrodens  | Seen in patients after human bite  |\n| Pasteurella multocida  | Seen in patients after dog or cat bite  |\n| Streptococcus  | More common in children than adults  |\n| Fungi， tuberculosis  | Seen in immunocompromised patients  |\n\n【26】bacteria as well as host synovial cells， chondrocytes， and inflammatory cells. Cartilage damage occurs within 8 hours of bacterial inoculation of the joint. Certain bacteria produce proteolytic enzymes such as collagenase， elastase， hyal-uronidase， lipase， and lipoproteinase， which lead to cartilage destruction. Bac-terial virulence factors also contribute to cartilage destruction. An example is the coagulase produced by Staphylococcus aureus， the most common pathogen responsible for bacterial septic arthritis . It is believed that the coag-ulase impairs intracapsular vascular supply due to small vessel thrombosis. The subsequent increased intracapsular pressure impedes an effective host immune response.\n\n【27】Clinical Presentation and Workup\n\n【28】Most patient’s with septic arthritis present with a relatively acute onset of a hot， swollen， and tender joint with restricted and limited range of motion and weight-bearing. Systemic signs， such as fevers and chills， may also be present. In patients with concurrent bacteremia， they may appear toxic.\n\n【29】Radiographs are useful for ruling out other acute processes that can cause joint effusions， such as fractures and dislocation. Ultrasound is useful for confirming effusions in large joints such as the hip and for guiding aspirations. Magnetic resonance imaging will also show joint effusions and can also detect adjacent osteomyelitis.\n\n【30】Laboratory findings consistent with a septic joint include an elevated WBC with a left shift， ESR >30 mm/hr， and a CRP >5 mg/L. Although an elevated peripheral WBC count with increased number and percentage of polymorphonuclear leuko-cytes is indicative of infection， the absence of an elevated WBC does not rule out infection. Both ESR and CRP are acute-phase response markers that are elevated in the presence of infection and/or inflammation. CRP rises within a few hours of infection， reaching values up to 400 mg/L within 36 to 50 hours. It normalizes within 1 week after initiation of appropriate treatment. ESR rises within 2 days of the onset of infection and continues to rise for 3 to 5 days after appropriate antibiotic 删除换行1 treatment is instituted. It normalizes after 3 to 4 weeks. Blood cultures should also be obtained， as bacteremia can cause septic arthritis.\n\n【31】Joint fluid aspiration is the gold standard for diagnosing a septic joint and helps guide antibiotic treatment and determine the need for operative intervention. It should be analyzed for cell count with a differential， Gram stain， culture， glucose level， and crystal analysis .\n\n【32】TREATMENT AND OTHER CONSIDERATIONS\n\n【33】Only after obtaining blood cultures and a joint aspirate should broad-spectrum， empiric antibiotic therapy commence. With organism speciation and antibiotic sensitivities， more focused antibiotic treatment and duration can be determined. Depending on institutional availability， consultation with infectious disease spe-cialists often proves invaluable in assisting with the management of these often-times complicated clinical cases. Because of the rapid and irreversible cartilage damage， the diagnosis of septic arthritis requires emergent operative irrigation and drainage.\n\n【34】A septic joint can quickly lead to bacteremia or a systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS)， particularly in the immunocompromised patient. Thus， beyond orthopaedic evaluation and intervention， it is essential as a practitioner to recog-nize the signs of systemic compromise (ie，tachycardia， tachypnea，hypotension， end organ damage) when evaluating a patient for a septic joint.\n\n【35】Bacterial septic arthritis has a reported mortality of approximately 10%. Patient outcome depends not only on the type of organism involved and the general health of the individual， but also on the speed and decisiveness with which the diagnosis is made.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Parents report that she pulled out her nasogastric feeding tube 2 days prior to admission. The tube was not replaced by the family, and instead the child was fed orally until she was brought into the hospital.Past Medical History\n--------------------\n\n【5】This child was diagnosed with SMA type 1 during infancy. At 10 months of age, a bedside feeding evaluation by a speech language pathologist indicated that the infant had discoordination with suck and swallow. A modified barium swallow study indicated that the patient had evidence of aspiration, and nil by mouth status was recommended. As a result, a nasogastric tube was placed and the patient was sent home with tube feedings to meet 100% of her nutritional requirements. This child also has a night‐time bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) requirement. Between the two admissions, she was lost to follow‐up and there is concern for medical neglect.Current Status\n--------------\n\n【6】She is hypoglycemic on admission and requires Vapotherm <sup>® </sup> (high‐flow nasal cannula therapy), progressing to BiPAP due to respiratory distress. She is treated with Unasyn (ampicillin sulbactam) due to a left‐sided pneumonia, seen as a white‐out on X‐ray. Her admission weight (6.4 kg, z ‐score –3.78) is noted as a 17% reduction in body weight since last seen in the hospital 6 months prior. Her admission length (71 cm) is below the 1st percentile ( z ‐score –5).

SMA is due to a defect in the survival motor neuron 1 ( SMN1 ) gene and is present in types 1 to 4. SMA is characterized by degeneration of the motor neurons in the spinal cord, resulting in progressive muscle atrophy, weakness, and paralysis. Typically, infants with SMA type 1 present with hypotonia early in life along with weakness of the legs as compared to the arms, and weakness of the intercostal muscles resulting in ineffective or paradoxical breathing patterns. SMA type 1 is typically diagnosed within the first 6 months of life and is the most severe form, often resulting in death at a very early age. Diagnosis is accomplished by clinical findings, genetic testing, electromyography, and creatine kinase levels, which may be normal, mildly elevated, or significantly elevated. Any physiologic function that requires neuromotor control can be affected, including feeding and breathing. Children with SMA can have feeding problems, dysphagia or gastrointestinal dysfunction, and because of muscle laxity and overall neuromuscular weakness, it is not uncommon for these children to gain unnecessary weight. Consequently, they need to be monitored very carefully and nutrition needs to include vitamin D, calcium and phosphorus for bone health.\n\n【17】This child has a history of poor feeding abilities and aspiration on modified barium swallow. She presents to the hospital after having been without her nasogastric feeding tube for 2 days (by parent report). Her elevated sodium, chloride, and blood urea nitrogen indicate she is dehydrated, which is likely due to inability to consume adequate fluids by mouth. The significant decrease in weight on admission and the stunted length indicate that this child is chronically malnourished and she has likely not received adequate nutrition in at least 3 months.\n\n【18】Because this 16‐month‐old child with type 1 SMA is suspected to have been without adequate nutrition for several months, she is at risk for refeeding syndrome. Refeeding syndrome presents as metabolic derangements that occur as a result of the rapid shift from fat and protein catabolism (which occur with starvation) to carbohydrate metabolism, resulting in an increase in circulating insulin levels. When insulin levels increase in the body, there is rapid uptake of glucose, potassium, phosphorus and magnesium into the cells, resulting in decreased serum concentrations. Fluid retention is common with these shifts and can result in acute heart failure as a result of increased cardiac demand with accompanying acute respiratory distress.\n\n【19】### How should enteral nutrition be resumed in this patient and what parameters will be monitored?\n\n【20】In order to avoid refeeding syndrome, electrolytes should be normalized prior to starting enteral feeds, which should then be initiated at 50–75% of intended goal and advanced by only 10–20% daily. Electrolytes should continue to be monitored two to four times daily, and repleted as needed. Phosphorus (250 mg daily) and thiamine supplementation (100 mg three times daily) is indicated when initiating feeds in order to aid carbohydrate metabolism. Strict monitoring of fluid status is required and fluid restriction may be necessary if edema is noted. Refeeding syndrome can occur up to 2 weeks after initiation of enteral feeds.\n\n【21】### What are the calorie and protein goals for this patient?\n\n【22】On admission, the patient has a post‐pyloric nasoduodenal tube placed. The team would like feeding recommendations. Prior to determining calorie goals for the patient, an assessment of the diet followed prior to admission is indicated. In this situation, the parent reports a tube feeding regimen that mimics what the patient received in the hospital 6 months prior, in addition to taking bottles by mouth. If the patient had been receiving the reported regimen, she would have been receiving 135 cal/kg per day. A typical 16‐month‐old child would require 100 cal/kg daily. A malnourished child requires more for catch‐up growth (100–120 cal/kg daily). In order to avoid refeeding syndrome, the following recommendation is given for starting continuous feedings.\n\n【23】   On initiating enteral feeds, use Nutren Junior started at 15 mL/hour (50% goal). Advance by 5 mL/hour every day until goal of 30 mL/hour is reached (will take 3 days).\n   Using weight of 6.4 kg, regimen at goal will provide 720 mL (112 mL/kg), 720 cal (112 cal/kg), 22 g protein (3.3 g/kg).\n\n【24】### How will you determine if the nutrition being provided is adequate and what feeding protocol should be recommended for discharge and home care?\n\n【25】It is most important to include the interprofessional team to assist in making sure that this child comes back for follow‐up. Engaging the social worker, case manager, and neurology service can assist in beginning this process. The registered dietitian is also extremely important in evaluating nutritional status through monitoring weekly weight trends and mid‐upper arm circumferences. Normal weight gain for a 16‐month‐old child ranges from 5 to 9 g/day. When catch‐up growth is indicated, daily weight gain goals should be two to three times this amount. Increases in the percentile and z ‐score of patient length should also be seen over time.\n\n【26】Ideally, this patient will have a surgically placed gastric feeding tube. If this is not possible, the nasoduodenal tube should be moved to become a nasogastric tube so that the patient can be given bolus feeds. This will mimic normal physiologic eating. Gastroenterology service can assist in supporting the patient and insuring that the gastric tube is placed in a good position, along with education for the family on how to manage, maintain and use for feeding. Frequent follow‐up with an outpatient dietitian is recommended so that adjustments can be made as the patient continues to grow.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Here we pres-ent a case of classic salt-losing CAH to illustrate the basic principles of CAH management.\n\n【3】Case Report\n\n【4】The patient was a 24-year-old man with history of 21-hydroxylase deficiency who was referred to establish follow-up in the adult endocrine clinic.\n\n【5】PREVIOUS HISTORY\n\n【6】He was diagnosed with 21-hydroxylase deficiency at 10 days of age. At that time， he was hospital-ized due to vomiting and weight loss. On admis-sion， he was noted to be hyponatremic (serum sodium concentration， 121 mEq/L) and hyperkale-mic (serum potassium concentration， 7.1 mEq/L). Adrenal crisis from primary adrenal insufficiency caused by 21-hydroxylase deficiency was suspected and confirmed with significantly elevated serum17-hydroxyprogesterone concentrations. Glucocor-ticoid and mineralocorticoid replacement therapy was initiated (exact doses unknown). He had good follow-up for CAH during childhood. His height was maintained at the 25th-50th percentiles. Ini-tially he was treated with hydrocortisone three times a day， later on with prednisone， and then with dexa-methasone to ensure a better control. In addition. he was taking fludrocortisone 150 mcg per day.\n\n【7】CURRENT EVALUATION\n\n【8】The patient reported fatigue and muscle weakness， weight gain， and striae over his abdomen and hip area. He noticed occasional edema in lower extremi-ties. Medications included dexamethasone 0.75 mg at night and fludrocortisone 150 mcg daily. Com-pliance was excellent. On physical examination， his body mass index was 32.38 kg/m2， blood pressure145/102 mmHg， and heart rate 79 beats per minute. He had abdominal obesity， mild dorsocervical pad， mild supraclavicular pads， and bright purple striae over his abdomen and hips. His skin was not thin， and there were no visible bruises. He had mild bilat-eral lower extremity edema.\n\n【9】INVESTIGATIONS\n\n【10】Laboratory test results are shown in Table 87.1. The serum androstenedione concentration was low and the serum concentration of 17-hydroxyprogesterone was normal. Bone mineral density revealed low bone mass with a T score of -2.8 at the level of spine and T score of -1.7 at the level of hips. Ultrasound of testes was performed to evaluate for presence of testicular adre-nal rest tumors (TARTs) and was normal. Biochemical workup demonstrated a normal fasting glucose but abnormal lipid profile (total cholesterol of 220 mg/dL， normal range， <200).\n\n【11】TREATMENT AND FOLLOW-UP\n\n【12】Dexamethasone was replaced by hydrocortisone at a total daily dose of 30 mg， 15 mg in the morning， 10mg in afternoon， and 5 mg in the evening.

Glucocorticoid therapy has a dual role： 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> to provide a physiologic replace-ment therapy to treat adrenal insufficiency and 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> to control androgen excess and its consequences. Mea-surement of 17-hydroxyprogesterone is not helpful to guide glucocorticoid therapy； 17-hydroxyprogester-one in the normal ranges indicates over treatment with glucocorticoids. Hydrocortisone should be tried first， either twice a day or more commonly three times a day， with each meal. Using hydrocortisone minimizes the risk of iatrogenic Cushing syndrome and meta-bolic consequences related to glucocorticoid excess.\n\n【18】However， the short half-life of hydrocortisone does not always provide an optimal suppression of corti-cotropin (ACTH) when administered in the evening. In these cases， adding a small dose of prednisone in the evening could be tried. Dexamethasone treatment should be the last resort， and only after other interven-tions failed. Dexamethasone has a long half-life and a high potency， frequently leading to iatrogenic Cushing syndrome even when used at doses <0.5 mg/day.\nFludrocortisone therapy is typically used at dose of50 mcg to 200 mcg daily， and adjusted based on clini-cal examination (blood pressure， absence of orthosta-sis) and biochemical workup (normal potassium and renin plasma activity).\n\n【19】Key Points\n\n【20】Key Points\n\n【21】●Management of CAH in an adult targets optimiza-tion of overall health and quality of life.\n\n【22】●Glucocorticoid therapy in CAH has dual role： 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> to provide a physiological replacement for adre-nal insufficiency and 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> to control androgen ex-cess and its consequences.\n\n【23】●Adults with CAH should be evaluated for glu-cocorticoid excess clinically (physical examina-tion)， imaging (bone density)， and biochemically(androgens， glycosylated hemoglobin， and lipid panel).\n\n【24】Serum 17-hydroxyprogesterone concentrations in the normal range indicates overtreatment with glucocorticoids.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

She has no other medical problems and says that at her last ophthalmologic appointment she was told that the diabetes had started to affect her eyes. She takes glyburide daily for her diabetes. Physical examination is normal except for hard exudates and dot hemorrhages on funduscopic examination, and diminished sensation up to the mid-shin bilaterally. Her blood pressure is normal. Urine analysis shows 2+ protein and 2+ glucose (otherwise negative). Which of the following is the best treatment for this patient?\n\n【1】A. Have the patient return in 6 weeks and check a repeat urine analysis at that time.\n\n【2】B. Start metoprolol.\n\n【3】C. Change the glyburide to glipizide and have the patient return for follow-up in 6 weeks.\n\n【4】D. Start lisinopril.\n\n【5】E. Refer the patient to a cardiologist.\n\n【6】Answer: 20.1 D. Beta-blockers are a good first-choice agent for a patient with hypertension and no comorbidities. However, for the patient with diabetes and nephropathy described in the clinical vignette, the benefit of an ACE inhibitor for decreasing proteinuria makes this the best choice for initial treatment. Changing from one sulfonylurea to another is of no benefit because all are equally efficacious. There is no indication for referral to a cardiologist based on the information provided in the vignette.\n\n【7】Question: 20.2 A 19-year-old man was seen at the university student health clinic a week ago complaining of pharyngitis, and now returns because he has noted discoloration of his urine. He is noted to have elevated blood pressure (178/110 mm Hg), and urinalysis reveals RBC casts, dysmorphic RBCs, and 1+ proteinuria. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\n\n【8】A. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)\n\n【9】B. Amyloidosis\n\n【10】C. Poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis\n\n【11】D. HIV nephropathy\n\n【12】E. Diabetic nephropathy\n\n【13】Answer: 20.2 C. The patient has hypertension, and urinary sediment consistent with a nephritic rather than nephrotic syndrome (RBC casts, mild degree of proteinuria). Given his recent episode of pharyngitis, the most likely cause would be postinfectious, probably due to streptococcal infection. SLE can produce a variety of renal diseases, including both nephritic and nephrotic manifestions, but it would be unlikely in a male patient, especially without other clinical manifestations of lupus such as arthritis. Amyloidosis, diabetes, and HIV all cause renal disease, but usually produce the nephrotic syndrome (heavy proteinuria >3 g/d, edema, hypoalbuminemia).\n\n【14】Question: 20.3 Which of the following is the best screening test for early diabetic nephropathy?\n\n【15】A. Urine microalbuminuria\n\n【16】B. Dipstick urinalysis\n\n【17】C. Renal biopsy\n\n【18】D. Fasting blood glucose\n\n【19】E. Twenty-four-hour urine collection for creatinine clearance\n\n【20】Answer: 20.3 A. Although a 24-hour urine collection for creatinine may be useful in assessing declining GFR, it is not the best screening test for the diagnosis of early diabetic nephropathy. In the outpatient setting, a dipstick urinalysis is readily available but will detect only patients with overt nephropathy (proteinuria >300 mg/d). Thus, a random urinary albumin/creatinine ratio of 30/300 is the best test to screen for early diabetic nephropathy. A fasting blood glucose may aid in the diagnosis of diabetes but not nephropathy. Finally, although most patients with nephrotic syndrome require a renal biopsy for diagnosis, a patient with worsening renal function who has had long-standing diabetes is assumed to have renal disease secondary to diabetic nephropathy, and the majority of these patients do not undergo a renal biopsy.\n\n【21】Question: 20.4 A 58-year-old man with type 2 diabetes is normotensive, has no known heart disease, and has a baseline creatinine of 1.8 mg/dL. His fasting lipid profile shows triglycerides 205 mg/dL, total cholesterol 220 mg/dL, HDL 35 mg/dL, and LDL 148 mg/dL. What is the most appropriate treatment?\n\n【22】A. Niacin\n\n【23】B. Low-protein diet\n\n【24】C. Gemfibrozil\n\n【25】D. Simvastatin\nAnswer: 20.4 D. Patients with diabetes are considered at high risk for the development of coronary artery disease, and should be treated with lipid-lowering agents such as statins to achieve an LDL less than 100 mg/dL.\n\n【26】CLINICAL PEARLS\n\n【27】 Nephrotic syndrome is characterized by more than 3.5 g proteinuria over 24 hours, hypoalbuminemia, and edema. Often, hypercoagulability and hyperlipidemia are present.\n\n【28】 Nephrotic syndrome can be a result of a primary renal disease but is often a manifestation of a systemic disease such as diabetes, HIV infection, an autoimmune disease, or a malignancy.\n\n【29】 Patients with diabetes should be screened for microalbuminuria (albumin excretion 30-300 mg/d); if present, treatment should be initiated with an ACE inhibitor or ARB even if the patient is normotensive.\n\n【30】 Patients with diabetic nephropathy are at very high risk for cardiovascular disease, so aggressive risk factor reduction, such as use of statins, is important, with a goal LDL less than 100 mg/dL.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Subsequently，two other tumors， adrenal cortical adenoma and esoph-ageal leiomyoma， were added as components thus Carney triad is actually a “pentad.\"Although it is rare， it is important for endocrinologists to be aware of this disorder because of the links to paraganglioma and adrenocorticalltumors.The adrenocortical tumors are usually nonfunction-ing adenomas. However， as highlighted in the case described herein， the adrenocortical tumor can secrete cortisol autonomously and lead to a periop-erative catastrophe if not recognized before surgery.\n\n【3】GIST and a left adrenal mass. Esophageal leiomyomas and adrenocortical adenomas had recently been recog-nized to also be linked to Carney triad.3.4\n\n【4】INVESTIGATIONS\n\n【5】A recent abdominal1magnetic resonance iimaging(MRI) scan showed two masses in the upper stomach(4 cm and 2.7 cm) and a 2x3-cm inhomogeneous left adrenal mass 删除33：<u></u>. She was asymptomatic. Her weight was stable (body mass index， 18.9 kg/m-) and she had regular menses. Her blood pressure was normal and she had no symptoms of catecholamine or glucocorticoid excess. The 24-hour urine for fraction-ated catecholamines and metanephrines was normal. Plasma fractionated metanephrines were normal. The24-hour urinary free cortisol excretion was normal at28.2 mcg (normal <45 mcg).\n\n【6】TREATMENT\n\n【7】The patient underwent an open abdominal explora-tion for completion gastrectomy to treat multifocal GISTs. In addition， hepatic GIST metastases and the left adrenal gland were resected. The left adrenal con-tained two cortical adenomas (2.0 cm and 1.7 cm)and there was marked cortical atrophy 删除33：<u></u>.\n\n【8】OUTCOME AND FOLLOW-UP\n\n【9】Because of the marked adrenocortical atrophy noted by Dr. Carney who was in the operating room， the patient received 100 mg of intravenously administered hydrocortisone intraoperatively. Six days after surgery and 24 hours after her previous dose of hydrocorti-sone， the serum cortisol concentration was low at4.8 mcg/dL (normal， 7-25 mcg/dL) and consistent with\n\n【10】删除3：<u>Fig. 22.1 Chest radiograph showing multiple calcified pulmonary chondromas in the left lung.</u>\n\n【11】T-1 T-2 删除换行4 a partially suppressed hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal(HPA) axis. She was discharged from the hospital on hydrocortisone replacement. One month later the HPA axis was recovering based on a morning serum cortisol concentration of 9 mcg/dL. Three months after sur-gery the serum cortisol was 14 mcg/dL， and the partial replacement with hydrocortisone was discontinued. It was an error to not screen this patient for glucocorti-coid secretory autonomy before surgery. All patients with adrenal tumors (unless an alternate pathology is obvious， e.g.， pheochromocytoma) should have case detection testing for subclinical Cushing syndrome(mild autonomous cortisol secretion) with baseline serum dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate and overnight dexamethasone suppression testing.\n删除3：<u>Fig. 22.3 Gross pathology image showing two juxtaposed adenomas measuring 2.0 and 1.7 cm in diameter. One nodule had a variegated pattern， predominantly yellow but with dark brown and black streaks and a tan area. The extratumoral cortex  showed marked atrophy with no zona reticularis visible.</u>\n\n【12】The adrenal surgery was performed in January1999. She died 15 years later due to progressive and metastatic GIST at 63 years of age， more than 50 years after recognition of her first tumor.5 At autopsy her right adrenal gland weighed 8.7 g (normal， 4-5g). There were two cortical nodules (1.5 cm and 1.1 cm) without associated cortical atrophy. In a series of 14patients with Carney triad and an adrenal neoplasm we found that the cortical neoplasm was uniformly asymptomatic.3 In addition， results of adrenocorti-cal function tests were usually normal. Unenhanced computed tomography attenuation typically showed low-density adrenal masses consistent with cortical adenomas.\nCarney triad is a rare multitumoral syndrome of uncertain etiology Approximately 150 cases have been identified.4 The disorder occurs almost exclusively in young women and is not familial. Only one patient has had tumors in all five organs 删除25：<u></u>. Most patients have two-organ involvement. Thus Carney triad is usually only partially expressed. The gastric tumors are malignant and metastasize to the liver， peritoneum， and lymph nodes. The lung， adrenal，and esophageal tumors are benign. The paragangliomas are usually benign. Long-term follow-up shows that the syndrome is a chronic， persistent， and generally indolent condition whose outcome is largely depen-dent on the behavior of the metastases from the GIST.\n\n【13】The findings from one study suggested that a DNA hypermethylation pattern was correlated to a reduced mRNA expression of SDHC and concurrent loss of the SDHC subunit on the protein level. These data suggested epigenetic inactivation of the SDHC gene locus with functional impairment of the succinate dehydrogenase complex as a plausible mechanism of tumorigenesis in Carney triad.\nKey Points\n\n【14】●Although rare， endocrinologists should be aware of the five components of Carney triad， which include paraganglioma， adrenal cortical adenoma， pulmonary chondromas， esophageal leiomyoma， and GIST.\n\n【15】When adrenalectomy is planned， all patients’ adre-nal adenomas >1-cm diameter should have case detection testing for subclinical glucocorticoid secretory autonomy preoperatively.\n\n【16】● When glucocorticoid secretory autonomy is doc-umented， the patient should have perioperative stress glucocorticoid coverage and on discharge prescribed a morning dose of hydrocortisone until the HPA axis recovers.\n删除26：<u>.</u>..m.mm\n删除20：<u>1\\.

A single base mutation from adenine to thymine results in substitution of valine for glutamine at the sixth residue of the β-globin chain. HbS polymerizes on deoxygenation and this results in the characteristic sickle appearance of haemoglobin. Sickling can 删除换行1 produce a shortened red cell survival and impaired passage of cells through the microcirculation， leading to obstruction of small vessels and tissue infarction.\n\n【22】What do you know about the genetics of this syndrome?\n\n【23】In the homozygous state (sickle cell anaemia)， both genes are abnormal(HbSS)， whereas in the heterozygous state (sickle cell trait)， only one chro-mosome carries the gene (HbAS). The disease does not manifest until the foetal form of haemoglobin (HbF) decreases to adult levels at about 6months of age.\n\n【24】Does the haemoglobin level fall during a sickle cell crisis?\n\n【25】The patient has 'steady-state anaemia and the haemoglobin level does not fall unless there is parvovirus-induced bone marrow aplasia， drug-induced haemolysis or sequestration of sickle cells in the liver and spleen.\n\n【26】Is the spleen enlarged in these patients?\n\n【27】The spleen may be enlarged in childhood as a result of haemolysis； in adult life， patients often undergo autosplenectomy (from infarcts)，which increases their susceptibility to infection by Streptococcus pneumoniae(pneumonia， meningitis) and salmonella osteomyelitis.\n\n【28】What are the other complications of this disease?\n\n【29】Chronic leg ulcers (from ischaemia)， pigmentary gallstones (from persist-ent haemolysis)， chronic renal failure， aseptic necrosis of femoral heads， chronic renal disease， acute chest syndrome and pulmonary hypertension(appears to be a complication of chronic haemolysis， is resistant to hydroxyurea therapy and confers a high risk of death).\n\n【30】How would you investigate these patients?\n\n【31】● FBC： haemoglobin 60-80 g/l， with raised reticulocyte count\n\n【32】●Blood smear shows signs of hyposplenism (Howell-Jolly bodies， target cells)\n\n【33】●Sickling of red cells can be introduced by sodium metabisulfite but does not differentiate HbSS from HbAS\n\n【34】●Haemoglobin electrophoresis： there is no HbA， 80-95% HbSS and2-20%HbF. High HbF levels are associated with a more benign progress. The parents of the patient will show features of sickle cell 删除换行1 trait (remember that sickle cell trait protectsagainst Plasmodium falciparum malaria).\n\n【35】How would you manage an acute sickle cell crisis?\n\n【36】Supportive therapy with intravenous fluids， oxygen， antibiotics and anal-gesia. Folic acid is given for those with severe haemolysis.\n\n【37】Is there any long-term treatment?\n\n【38】· Hydroxyurea and erythropoietin are given to increase synthesis of HbF.\n\n【39】·Allogenic bone marrow transplantation is beinginvestigated as a possible ‘cure’in severely affected individuals.\n\n【40】Experimental therapy： induction of HbF by short-chain fatty acids， membrane-active drugs and other experimental treatments.\n\n【41】What is the role of blood transfusion in these patients?\n\n【42】· Steady-state anaemia requires no treatment and regular blood transfu-sions are given only when the anaemia is severe or if the patient has frequent episodes of crisis， particularly during pregnancy (to suppress endogenous production of HbS).\n\n【43】●Exchange transfusion is used for intractable pain crises， priapism and stroke.\n\n【44】What is the prognosis of this condition?\n\n【45】It is variable， with some having a normal lifespan while others succumb in the first few years of life to infection or episodes of sequestration.

She seems  删除换行1 very tired and quiet and the GP notices that she does not seem overly enthusiastic about her  删除换行1 baby who is asleep. Her pregnancy was planned and was uneventful. She went into labour  删除换行1 early and the baby was born at 36 weeks. Her labour was long and arduous and she needed a  删除换行1 ventouse delivery as she was exhausted and the baby was distressed. The baby had a few days  删除换行1 in the Special Care Baby Unit (SCBU) and was discharged from there in good health. She tells  删除换行1 her GP that she tried to breastfeed but felt that the baby was not getting enough as he cried  删除换行1 a lot and so she is now bottle-feeding. She lives with her partner who she has been with for  删除换行1 the past 2 years and they have no other children. They live in a council flat and her partner  删除换行1 works as a builder.

There are a number of risk factors which include a difficult delivery, a  删除换行1 premature baby who needed care in the SCBU and the recent death of her father. The GP,  删除换行1 very early on in the consultation, realizes that this consultation is going to take time. As  删除换行1 her appointment is near the end of the surgery, the GP asks her to wait a little while so that  删除换行1 the other two patients can be seen and more time can be given to her appointment. The GP  删除换行5 explores how she is feeling. Mostly she just feels terribly guilty and sad that she is not enjoying  删除换行1 her baby as she thought she would. She knows that she is not well and feels too ashamed to tell  删除换行1 her family how she feels and worried that she will not cope and the baby will be taken away  删除换行1 from her. The GP notices that, although she is very down, she is in touch with reality, she is  删除换行1 aware that she is not well and she expresses herself clearly. Her GP asks her to complete the  删除换行5 Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). In particular, the GP is keen to know whether  删除换行1 the mother has had thoughts of harming herself. She scores 18 out of 30 but has not felt like  删除换行1 harming herself. The GP diagnoses PND.\n\n【8】The woman is very relieved that her distress has been recognized and that she has had the  删除换行1 courage to tell the GP how she has been feeling. Her GP explains that PND is common, with  删除换行1 about one in ten woman suffering from the condition and that it needs treatment or the  删除换行1 suffering can last for months and undermine her relationship with her baby as well as her  删除换行1 partner. They talk about the factors that might have contributed to this situation and what  删除换行1 can be done to help. She agrees to talk with her family and to come back the next day with  删除换行1 her partner to talk about the next steps. The GP makes contact with the health visitor (with  删除换行1 the patient’s permission). She also makes contact with the local mental health organization,  删除换行1 which has a specialist service for PND. The patient enters into counselling and is also put on  删除换行1 an antidepressant.\n\n【9】• For important consultations, such as this, give your patient and yourself time to  删除换行1 explore the issues.\n\n【10】• Over 50% of women with PND are missed by GPs and health visitors.\n\n【11】• Research is growing that untreated PND damages the psychological development  删除换行1 of the young child and that there is also an increase in depression in the partner,  删除换行1 thus compounding the problems.\n\n【12】• It is important to be aware of the possibility of severe mental health problems in  删除换行1 all new mothers, whether or not there are predisposing factors.\n\n【13】• Antenatal mental health review is important to prevent or effectively support  删除换行1 problems later.\n删除12：<u>Key Points109\n\n【14】删除29：<u>Case 54: Malaise</u>\n\n【15】</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

A Case of Too Many AUGs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>\n=============================================\n\n【2】Introduction\n------------\n\n【3】Information for the construction of proteins is stored within the DNA of a eukaryotic organism in units known as genes . Before a protein can be assembled, the genetic instructions or gene sequence must be copied or transcribed from the DNA into a molecule of messenger RNA (mRNA). Messenger RNAs travel from the nucleus into the cytoplasm where they interact with ribosomal subunits in preparation for the translation or synthesis of the protein. The sequence of the mRNA is “read” in units of three nucleotides called codons . Most of the 64 possible codons “code” for an amino acid; however, three of the codons, the stop codons, serve as signals for the termination of protein synthesis. One codon, the AUG start codon , signals the point where protein synthesis begins. The start codon is significant because it establishes the reading frame for the ribosome.\n\n【4】▪ Outline the steps involved in transcription of a gene.\n\n【5】▪ Research/review mRNA processing from the primary transcript to the mature mRNA.\n\n【6】▪ Outline the steps involved in translation of an mRNA.\n\n【7】▪ What amino acid does the AUG codon code for? What conclusion can you make about ALL proteins?\n\n【8】▪ Demonstrate the concept of a reading frame using a simple sentence.\n\n【9】Background\n----------\n\n【10】A cell requires a vast constellation of proteins in order to function. Many of these are enzymes, proteins that catalyze a reaction. One example of a critically important enzyme is DNA ligase . As its name implies, a DNA ligase functions to join two pieces of DNA. DNA ligase I specifically functions to ligate short strands of DNA, known as Okazaki fragments, which are formed during the process of DNA replication. In the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae , DNA ligase I is encoded by the gene CDC9 . The protein product of this gene, CDC9 <sub>p </sub> , is synthesized in the cytoplasm before entering the nucleus where it can interact with the cell’s DNA.\n\n【11】The nucleus is not the only place in a yeast cell where DNA can be found. Yeast have mitochondria and mitochondria have their own DNA. Mitochondrial DNA must replicate in order to maintain the genome of mitochondria as they undergo binary fission and are segregated into daughter cells following yeast mitotic cell division. Analysis of the genome of S. cerevisiae suggests that CDC9 is the only gene for DNA ligase I. How can a single gene produce two proteins that maintain the same function but are located in two very different organelles? Several mitochondrial proteins are encoded by genes located in the nucleus and are synthesized in the cell’s cytoplasm. Mitochondrial presequences direct these proteins to be imported into the mitochondria. Once the protein enters the mitochondria, a mitochondrial presequence peptidase (MPP), binds to the consensus amino acid sequence ARFFT and cleaves off the presequence.\n\n【12】▪ Brainstorm a list of other proteins and their functions in a cell.\n\n【13】▪ Research/review DNA replication. Identify the role of Okazaki fragments.\n\n【14】▪ Predict whether DNA replication could proceed in the absence of DNA ligase I.\n\n【15】▪ How can a protein move from the cytoplasm into the nucleus?\n\n【16】▪ Mitochondria possess a circular molecule of DNA that replicates in the same manner as the linear DNA found in the eukaryotic nucleus. Discuss the evolutionary significance of these two observations.\n\n【17】▪ Compare and contrast the process of binary fission and mitosis.\n\n【18】▪ Speculate on the consequences to the cell of the loss of mitochondrial DNA replication.\n\n【19】▪ Compare and contrast the import of proteins into mitochondria with the import of proteins into the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER).\n\n【20】Methods\n-------\n\n【21】### Yeast culture conditions\n\n【22】All yeast strains used in this study were derived from a single wild-type strain, W303. Yeast cultures were grown on YPD media (2% peptone, 1% yeast extract, 2% glucose) supplemented with appropriate amino acids. Mitochondrial function was assessed by plating cells on YPEG media (2% peptone, 1% yeast extract, 3% glycerol, 3% ethanol).\n\n【23】### CDC9–GFP fusions, CDC9 mutagenesis, and HA tagging\n\n【24】Plasmids containing various lengths of the amino terminus of the CDC9 gene were fused in-frame with the gene for green fluorescence protein (GFP). Site-directed mutagenesis was used to alter AUG sequences in the CDC9 gene. The first AUG site was converted to UAG and the second was changed to GCG. Changes to the DNA sequence were confirmed by sequencing. A human influenza hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag was added to the CDC9 gene using transposon mutagenesis. A triple HA tag was inserted at position 75 in the amino acid sequence of CDC9 (CDC9–HA). It was determined that the insert did not affect the growth rates of the cells.\n\n【25】### Subcellular fractionation and protease K digestion\n\n【26】Yeast were harvested by centrifugation (5 min at 3000 g ), washed in distilled water and resuspended in buffer and incubated at 30°C for 10 min. Zymolase 5000 (5 mg/g of cell, wet weight) was added to the suspension and incubated at 30°C with gentle shaking. Yeast spheroplasts were harvested by centrifugation (5 min at 3000 rpm). Spheroplasts were resuspended in buffer and disrupted using a Dounce homogenizer on ice. The cell homogenate was centrifuged (5 min at 3500 rpm) and the supernatant was saved. A crude mitochondrial fraction was collected by centrifugation of the supernatant at 9000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C. The mitochondrial pellet was washed twice and the postmitochondrial supernatant was saved.\n\n【27】Yeast nuclei were prepared from spheroplasts that were homogenized as described earlier. The cell homogenate was centrifuged at 1000 g for 10 min at 4°C to remove unbroken cells and cell debris. The supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube and the nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 12,000 g for 25 min at 4°C. The pellet was resuspended in a small amount of buffer and layered on top of a sucrose gradient. The sample was centrifuged using a swing bucket rotor at 25,000 rpm for 60 min at 4°C. Intact nuclei pelleted, leaving other cellular material in the overlying sucrose layers of the gradient.\n\n【28】Proteinase K treatment of isolated mitochondria or nuclei was carried out by adding an equal volume of 500 μg/mL proteinase K. Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 0.5%. After incubation at 0°C for 30 min, proteins were precipitated by incubation with TCA.\n\n【29】### Immunoblotting\n\n【30】Protein samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting. Antiserum directed against yeast Hsp60 was used at a 1:10,000 dilution, anti-NpI3 antiserum at 1:3,000 dilution, anti-GFP antiserum at 1:1,000 dilution, and anti-HA monoclonal antibody at 1:1,000 dilution. Secondary HRP-conjugated antirabbit and antimouse antibodies were used at 1:1000 dilution.\n\n【31】▪ What is a “wild-type” cell?\n\n【32】▪ Create a flow chart that summarizes the steps used in the subcellular fractionation of yeast cells.\n\n【33】▪ What was the final concentration of proteinase K used in the digestion assays?\n\n【34】Results\n-------\n\n【35】▪ Label the methionine amino acids representing the AUG codons in Figure 3.2.1 a AUG1, AUG2, AUG3, and AUG4.

The birthweight was 2.54 kg. The Apgar scores were 4 at 1 minute, 6 at 5 minutes, and 7 at 10 minutes. The infant was placed on nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) during line placement; however, the cyanosis continued and the infant was intubated and mechanically ventilated. A murmur was noted and the local pediatric cardiac intensive care unit was called. An echocardiogram was performed that demonstrated obstructed total anomalous pulmonary venous return to the hepatic veins. He was transported to the intensive care unit, prepared for surgery, and then urgently taken to the operating room where he underwent a complete repair with ligation of the vertical vein and a sutureless repair of the pulmonary veins to the left atrium. He returned intubated and sedated on dopamine and milrinone infusions as well as inhaled nitric oxide 20 ppm.Family History\n--------------\n\n【5】No history of heart disease, lung disease, blood diseases, reactions to anesthesia or unexpected deaths.

The infant returned from the operating room on a dopamine infusion that was weaned off 4 hours ago and a milrinone infusion that was weaned by 50% 2 hours ago. The plan for that day was to wean towards extubation. This has been a slow process due to the infant being “sleepy,” so the sedation infusions were also weaned. Since he has been awake, he has experienced intermittent desaturation episodes responsive to low‐dose morphine and temporarily increasing the F i O <sub>2 </sub> through the ventilator circuit.\n\n【7】You are called urgently to the bedside because the infant’s oxygen saturation has fallen to 60%. The infant is currently on an F i O <sub>2 </sub> of 0.5, ventilator rate of 15 breaths per minute, pressure control of 22 cmH <sub>2 </sub> O, positive end‐expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 3 cmH <sub>2 </sub> O, pressure support of 8 cmH <sub>2 </sub> O, and inhaled nitric oxide of 10 ppm.\n\n【8】The vital signs and hemodynamics reveal heart rate of 189 bpm, respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute, blood pressure 58/34 mmHg, right atrial pressure (RAP) 10 mmHg, oxygen saturation ( S pO <sub>2 </sub> ) 70%, cerebral near‐infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) 43%, and regional cerebral infrared spectroscopy (rSO2 NIRS) 65%.\n\n【9】On examination, the infant is pale and cool, with +1 peripheral pulses. He is agitated with nasal flaring and intercostal retractions. Breath sounds are heard throughout. During the exam, the infant suddenly stops moving.\n\n【10】Vital signs are as follows: heart rate 89 bpm, respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute, blood pressure 52/32 mmHg, RAP 12 mmHg, S pO <sub>2 </sub> 55%, cerebral NIRS 32%, rSO2 NIRS 45%.Questions\n---------\n\n【11】Answer the following questions using the details provided.\n\n【12】1.  Based on the data, what is your differential diagnosis?\n2.  What additional studies would be helpful?\n3.  What interventions should be implemented?\n4.  What is the pathophysiology of pulmonary hypertension crisis?Rationale and Evidence‐based Practice Explanation\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【13】### Based on the data, what is your differential diagnosis?\n\n【14】The differential diagnoses for this desaturation event include pulmonary hypertension crisis, obstructed pulmonary veins, pulmonary edema, mechanical issues with the ventilator, pulmonary parenchymal issue (e.g. pneumothorax, effusion), cardiac tamponade, and seizures.\n\n【15】Based on the findings during this scenario, the most likely diagnosis is pulmonary hypertension crisis.\n\n【16】### What additional studies would be helpful?\n\n【17】An arterial blood gas, hemoglobin/hematocrit and lactate is ordered and the results are shown in Tables 19.1 and 19.2 . A chest X‐ray can be considered if there is concern for lung disease, signs of intercurrent illness, or suspected malposition of endotracheal tube.\n\n【18】### What interventions should be implemented?\n\n【19】The primary goal should be to decrease PVR and support the hemodynamics. Bagging the patient with 100% oxygen may increase HR and oxygen saturation as well as simultaneously considering mechanical issues triggering the event. Additional interventions that should occur in rapid succession include optimizing mechanical ventilation (e.g. increase ventilatory rate or tidal volume), initiation of an epinephrine infusion, administration of a muscle relaxant agent, escalation of sedation and analgesia, increasing inhaled nitric oxide to 40 ppm, preparing code medications, and administration of sodium bicarbonate, calcium, and a fluid bolus.\n\n【20】Table 19.1 Arterial blood gas analysis.\n\n| pH | 7.16 |\n| --- | --- |\n| P CO 2 | 76 mmHg |\n| P a O 2 | 32 mmHg |\n| Bicarbonate | 14 mEq/L |\n| Base excess | –11 |\n| Lactate | 8 mmol/L |\n| Ionized calcium | 1 mmol/L |\n\n【22】Table 19.2 Hemoglobin/hematocrit.\n\n| Hemoglobin | 15.3 g/dL |\n| --- | --- |\n| Hematocrit | 45% |\n\n【24】### What is the pathophysiology of pulmonary hypertension crisis?\n\n【25】Pulmonary hypertension is defined as a mean pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) above 25 mmHg with a normal pulmonary capillary wedge pressure or a pulmonary artery pressure greater than half systemic. A pulmonary hypertensive crisis occurs when elevated PAP progresses to the point of causing significant ventricular dysfunction, leading to bradycardia and eventually pulseless electrical activity. There is an increase in left atrial pressure due to the interventricular septum shifting from right to left as a result of the elevated right ventricular pressure. This results in acute left ventricular diastolic dysfunction. There is decreased end‐tidal CO <sub>2 </sub> (found to be 18 mmHg in this scenario) due to poor gas exchange from limited pulmonary blood flow. The diagnosis is dependent on the past medical history, physical examination, and hemodynamic data.\n\n【26】Risk factors include the diagnosis and weight. Obstructed pulmonary veins cause pulmonary congestion due to the inability of the pulmonary blood flow to return to the left atrium. Initial signs of a pulmonary hypertensive event include tachycardia, an elevation in RAP due to an increase in right ventricular afterload, hypotension due to decreased cardiac output, and desaturation due to constriction of pulmonary vasculature. Triggers of a pulmonary hypertensive event include acidosis, agitation, pain, hypothermia, suctioning, and suboptimal ventilation. In this scenario, the infant awoke from sedation and developed agitation, which may have triggered the event.\n\n【27】While the infant is at risk for experiencing the other diagnoses, generally, obstructed pulmonary veins occurs later in the postoperative trajectory. Pulmonary edema may be present, but there is no evidence except for desaturation and an elevation in RAP. Mechanical issues with the ventilator and pulmonary parenchymal issues may be present but would generally be reflected in the ventilatory flow loops. Cardiac tamponade and seizures generally occur within the first 24–48 hours after surgery.\n\n【28】The treatment plan for a pulmonary hypertensive crisis is targeted at reducing pulmonary vascular resistance and supporting cardiac output. Management for pulmonary hypertension crisis should be immediate and aggressive to avoid further cardiac deterioration. The management of pulmonary hypertension includes the administration of pulmonary vasodilators such as oxygen and nitric oxide, which stimulates cyclic GMP. Sedation, analgesia, and neuromuscular blockade will assist in eradicating the trigger for the event. Cardiac output can be augmented with calcium chloride boluses, epinephrine for inotropy, fluid boluses to augment preload, and sedation/analgesia/muscle relaxation to decrease stress sympathetic stimulation. Vasoactive medications are used to avoid systemic hypotension and support coronary perfusion. Tachycardia should be avoided to allow for adequate fill and ejection of the right ventricle. The milrinone infusion should be increased once adequate preload and blood pressure is achieved. Morphine and nitric oxide are given for pulmonary vasodilation. Sodium bicarbonate is administered to correct acidosis. Ventilation goals should include maintaining the PEEP and mean airway pressures at lowest levels to provide functional residual capacity (FRC). If the patient continues to deteriorate, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support should be anticipated.Case Resolution\n---------------\n\n【29】Following your interventions, the infant eventually stabilizes following aggressive medical management.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

There are many maneuvers used to diagnose DDH， including the Ortolani and Barlow tests. However， they are rarely helpful after 3 months of age because of the development of soft-tissue contractures. Therefore， in older children one must rely on other exam findings. This includes asymmetric and limited hip abduction on the affected side.\n\n【17】18.2D. Polydactyly is not associated with DDH. However， being the firstborn， female， and/or breech at birth are.\n\n【18】18.3 B. A 6-month-old infant who has failed treatment of DDH with a Pavlik harness after 2 to 4 weeks should be treated with closed reduction of the hip and spica casting. Continued treatment with the harness may lead to posterior acetabular erosion， a severe and devastating consequence. Both femoral and pelvic osteotomies are unnecessary in this patient and are often reserved for those 2 years of age and older with untreated DDH.\n\n【19】CLINICAL PEARLS\n\n【20】DDH is considered a multifactorial trait and is more common in females(females comprise -80% of cases)， firstborn infants， and those born in the breech position.\n\n【21】The risk for DDH is increased 12-fold if a first-degree relative has it. Diagnosis involves severalexam maneuvers， including the Ortolani， Barlow， and Galeazzi tests. Plain radiographs cannot distinguish the cartilaginous components of the hip joint and should therefore only be performed when children are at least4 to 6 months old，which is when the ossific nucleus ofthe femoral head can be seen on radiographs (it appears on ultrasonographic images at 12 weeks). The goal of treatment for DDH is to reestablish a concentric relationship between the femoral head and acetabulum.

She denies trauma. Her blood pressure is 105/60 mm Hg, blood oxygen saturation is 97% on room air, and her heart rate is 110 bpm. Urinalysis shows no protein, leukocytes, or bacteria, with few RBCs.

In a patient with antepartum hemorrhage (hemorrhage after 20 weeks’ gestation), the two diagnoses that must be considered first are placental abruption (the cause in 30% of cases of antepartum hemorrhage) and placenta previa (the cause in 20% of cases). Abruptio placentae is premature separation of the placenta, most commonly during the third trimester after week 30 of gestation. It results in painful vaginal bleeding, uterine contractions, and possible fetal death secondary to uteroplacental insufficiency. Risk factors for placental abruption include hypertension, cocaine use, pelvic trauma, uteroplacental insufficiency, submucosal fibroids, cigarette smoking, and preterm premature rupture of membranes. Complications include premature delivery, hyrdrops fetalis, uterine tetany, and hypvolemic shock. In contrast to placenta previa, placental abruption is a clinical diagnosis, because ultrasound is not sensitive for abruption inasmuch as the clot has the same texture as the placenta and is easily missed. In any case, this patient is hemodynamically unstable and there is fetal distress, so an emergency cesarean section is indicated regardless of the underlying diagnosis.  \nAnswer A is incorrect. Pre-eclampsia usually presents during the third trimester of pregnancy with hypertension, proteinuria, and edema. It can also be associated with HELLP syndrome ( H emolysis, E levated L iver enzyme levels, and L ow P latelet count). Treatment would be administration of magnesium and delivery of the baby. This patient does not meet all the criteria for pre-eclampsia. A few RBCs in the urine would be normal in a patient with vaginal bleeding.  \nAnswer B is incorrect . Spontaneous delivery is preferable to cesarean section, as it has fewer sequelae for future pregnancies. However, in a setting where the life of both the mother and fetus are threatened, cesarean section’s benefits outweigh its risks and should be undertaken immediately.  \nAnswer C is incorrect. FAST assesses for free fluid in the pericardium and abdominal cavity. It is a tool used to look for internal bleeding as may be the case in a ruptured ectopic pregnancy. However, ectopic pregnancies usually become symptomatic within the first few weeks of pregnancy and are hence unlikely in this patient. FAST will most likely produce negative results in this patient, as the bleeding is intrauterine, not extrauterine.  \nAnswer E is incorrect. Amniotic fluid embolism is also referred to as anaphylactoid syndrome of pregnancy and is characterized by hypoxia, respiratory distress, cardiogenic shock, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. It occurs with tearing of maternal vessels and can result in maternal respiratory distress. Unless the clinician is quickly observant, it is usually diagnosed on autopsy. Amniotic fluid embolisms are very rare and occur in about 4/100,000 deliveries. Treatment is usually supportive, and includes emergent cesarean section to reduce maternal oxygen demand and prevent more amniotic fluid from entering maternal circulation", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

But pregnancy  删除换行1 has probably little influence in provoking malignant  删除换行1 change in a naevus.\n\n【8】(vii) Steroid hormones may have influence to  删除换行1 produce malignant melanomas.\n\n【9】(viii) The role of ultraviolet light as an aetiologic  删除换行1 factor remains unresolved. Melanoma is commonly seen  删除换行1 in sun-exposed areas of the body. Particularly lentigo  删除换行1 maligna and superficial spreading melanoma develop in  删除换行1 these areas.\n\n【10】PATHOLOGY.— Malignant melanoma is a malignant  删除换行1 neoplasm of melanocytes and accounts for 1 to 3% of all  删除换行1 cancers. Malignant melanoma is classified mainly into 3  删除换行1 types — Lentigo Maligna Melanoma (LMM), (ii)\nSuperficial Spreading Melanoma (SMM) and (iii) Nodular\nMelanoma (NM). Histologically melanomas exhibit two  删除换行1 patterns of growth — growth by lateral spread of the  删除换行1 tumour within the dermis (horizontal growth) and growth  删除换行1 by downward dermal invasion (vertical growth). LMM  删除换行5 and SMM exhibit more of lateral spread than vertical  删除换行1 growth; whereas NM shows more of vertical growth. The  删除换行1 cells of horizontal growth are known as 'surround cells'  删除换行1 and those with vertical growth are called nodules cells'.\nIn Lentigo Maligna Melanoma the surround cells are  删除换行1 irregularly shaped cells with hyperchromatic nuclei and 删除换行1 dermis is indicated by the presence of circular or  删除换行1 polyhedral cells with abundant spongiocytoplasm and fine  删除换行1 pigment granules.\n\n【11】The tumour cells may form small clusters in the  删除换行1 subepidermal lymphatics — a dreadful indication of early  删除换行1 stage of lymphatic spread.\n\n【12】Subepidermal zone is invaded by inflammatory cells  删除换行1 mostly lymphocytes. This is always suggestive of malignant  删除换行1 change.\n\n【13】In fully developed melanoma the large tumour cells 删除换行4 arranged along the dermoepidermal junction and are  删除换行1 aggregated in nests. These atypical cells frequently  删除换行1 conglomerate around the external root sheath of the hair  删除换行1 follicle. The nodule cells are spindle-shaped cells  删除换行1 (malignant melanocytes). The nuclei of these cells contain  删除换行1 coarsely clumped chromatin and prominent eosinophilic  删除换行1 nucleoli. Their cytoplasm is usually finely granular and  删除换行1 stains pink with haematoxylin and eosin. These nodule  删除换行1 cells are often mixed with epitheloid cells. One can  删除换行1 always see a dermal infiltrate of lymphocytes, histiocytes  删除换行1 and melanin-laden macrophages.\n删除3：<u>Fig. 1.23.— Four stages of Malignant Melanoma. Stage I — it is above the basement membrane. Stage II — tumour is invading the  删除换行1 papillary but not reticular dermis. Stage III — the tumour has invaded the dermis. Stage IV — the tumour is invading the subcutaneous 删除换行1 tissue with lymphatic permeation and embolism.</u>\n\n【14】In superficial spreading melanoma there is horizontal  删除换行1 growth within the dermis. The surround cells with  删除换行1 prominent finely granular cytoplasm and large nuclei and  删除换行1 nucleoli are uniformly more atypical than the surround  删除换行1 cells of lentigo maligna melanoma. Individual cells of  删除换行1 superficial spreading melanoma are predominantly  删除换行1 epitheloid and less often they are spindle shaped.\n\n【15】Nodular melanoma has the worst prognosis because  删除换行1 it grows rapidly and deeply invasive. Dermal invasion is  删除换行1 the predominant histologic feature, but lateral spread of  删除换行1 the tumour is absent. Although the tumour cells appear  删除换行1 highly malignant, they often exhibit uniformity. Individual  删除换行1 cells are either epitheloid or spindle cell in type.\n\n【16】With the development of malignant melanoma there  删除换行1 is increase in junctional activity and the cells increase in  删除换行1 size. The proportion of nucleus to cytoplasm is increased,  删除换行1 the nucleous is enlarged, hyperchromatism is present and  删除换行1 mitoses are observed. The cytoplasm is often vacuolated  删除换行1 with fine melanin granules to mimic Paget cell. In  删除换行1 determining whether a naevus has become malignant or  删除换行1 not the surface layers of the epidermis are examined for  删除换行1 invasion by cells which are vacuolated. Invasion of the 删除换行1 in the dermis often show alveolar arrangement, the  删除换行1 grooves being separated by a fine stroma.\n\n【17】PATHOLOGICALLY malignant melanoma can be \n\n【18】STAGED according to Clark's level of invasion. Level I \n(in situ) applies when all tumour cells are above the  删除换行1 basement membrane. Level II has tumour extension into  删除换行1 the papillary but not the reticular dermis. In level III  删除换行5 the tumour cells reach the interface between the papillary  删除换行1 and reticular dermis. Level IV refers to tumour cells  删除换行1 reaching the reticular dermis.

It is a reliable and important  删除换行1 determinant of the therapy and prognosis. A close  删除换行1 correlation exists between tumour thickness and prognosis.\nIn stage I the melanoma is of low risk and it has not  删除换行1 metastasised. In stage II the risk is intermediate with  删除换行1 25% incidence of metastasis. In stage III and IV the  删除换行1 tumour is of high risk with 60% incidence of metastasis.\nClark's level I corresponds with Breslow's stage I. Clark's  删除换行1 level II and III correspond with stage 11 of Breslow and \n\n【26】Clark's level IV and V correspond with Breslow's stages \n\n【27】III and IV respectively. There is good evidence that  删除换行1 tumour thickness is a better measure of prognosis than  删除换行1 the level of invasion.\n\n【28】CLINICO-PATHOLOGICAL CLASSIFICATION.— \n\n【29】Five clinico-pathological types of melanoma have been  删除换行1 recognised. It must be remembered that though majority  删除换行1 of the melanomas can be placed in one of these types,  删除换行1 a small percentage of cases may have features of 2 or  删除换行1 more types.\n\n【30】1. Superficial Spreading Melanoma (SSM).— This is  删除换行1 the most common variety and accounts for 64% of all  删除换行1 melanomas. The mean age of the patients is 55 years.\nThis occurs on any part of the body — both sun-exposed  删除换行1 and non-exposed areas; but common sites are the lower  删除换行1 legs of women and the chest and back of men. It is  删除换行1 called superficial as the depth of the lesion is not much,  删除换行1 but the diameter is rarely more than 2 to 3 cm. The  删除换行1 lesion is a slightly raised nodule or plaque with variegated 删除换行1 colour pattern — pink, brown, grey, blue and black  删除换行1 colours (differing pigmentation). It has an irregular border 删除换行1 which is characteristic. The lesion is palpable and small  删除换行1 nodules may develop within it.\n\n【31】2. Lentigo Maligna Melanoma (LMM).— It is called \n\n【32】Hutchinson's melanotic freckle. It is least common and  删除换行1 accounts for only 7 to 12%. It is the least malignant. The  删除换行1 individuals in their 6th, 7th or 8th decade of life are  删除换行1 usually involved by this type (mean age of patients is 70  删除换行1 years). It may occur anywhere in the body which is  删除换行1 exposed to the sun, though most frequently seen on the  删除换行1 face. It begins as a pigmented flat naevus. This neoplasm  删除换行1 presents as a large flat patch with focally raised areas.\nThese raised areas correspond to areas of dermal invasion.\nThese lesions often measure 6 cm or more. It grows  删除换行1 very slowly over a period of years. In few areas it is  删除换行1 advancing, whereas in other places it may regress. There  删除换行1 is also colour variation within the tumour from brown to  删除换行1 black. It is characterised by irregular margin. Malignant  删除换行1 change is recognised by increasing thickness of the lesion  删除换行1 and development of discrete nodule within the lesion.\n\n【33】3. Nodular Melanoma (NM).— It accounts for 13 删除换行1 to 25% of all melanomas. It affects younger individuals  删除换行1 (mean age of patients is 45 years). It may also occur  删除换行1 anywhere in the body. It appears as a raised lesion, blackbrown in colour, though other colour may be present. It  删除换行1 is characterised by uniform colour either grey or black  删除换行1 or even bluish black. The students must remember that  删除换行1 it is the most malignant of all varieties. It has a smooth  删除换行1 surface and its margin is quite sharp, though irregular.\nAbsence of lateral spread is evidenced by normal colour  删除换行1 of skin adjacent to the tumour. Being a very malignant  删除换行1 lesion, it ulcerates early and easily bleeds.\n\n【34】4. Acral-Lentiginous Melanoma (ALM).— This type  删除换行1 of lesion is seen on the palm, sole, subungual areas and  删除换行1 mucocutaneous junctions. This is the same aggressive  删除换行1 tumour as nodular melanoma. This is the commonest  删除换行1 type of lesion in coloured people.\n\n【35】5. Amelanotic Melanoma.— This type of melanoma  删除换行1 is characterised by its very little pigment and hence its  删除换行1 name. The lesion looks pink instead of black, though at  删除换行1 the base one may find some black pigmentation. The  删除换行1 cells which form this tumour lose the capacity to produce  删除换行1 melanin, though they contain the precursor of melanin  删除换行1 pigment. This is the most virulent of all varieties of  删除换行1 melanoma even the nodular melanoma. Regional lymph  删除换行1 node metastasis is almost always present.\n\n【36】This malignant tumour kills patients by  删除换行1 producing wide spread metastasis.\n\n【37】1. LOCAL EXTENSION.— Malignant melanoma  删除换行1 spreads initially by local extension by continuity and  删除换行1 contiguity.\n\n【38】From the original site of the tumour the tumour  删除换行1 cells grow peripherally in the juinctional layer and in  删除换行1 this way melanotic halo is produced. Malignant melanoma  删除换行1 has a tendency to form satellite nodules in the skin and  删除换行1 such nodules develop progressively at greater distance  删除换行1 from the original tumour. Such nodules develop from 2  删除换行1 types of spread — (i) local spread and (ii) lymphatic  删除换行1 spread — through lymphatic permeation the tumour cells  删除换行1 grow along the lymphatics and form nodules at greater  删除换行1 distances.\n\n【39】The deep fascia acts as a strong barrier and malignant 删除换行1 melanoma hardly infiltrates the deep fascia.\n\n【40】2. LYMPHATIC SPREAD.— This is the commonest  删除换行1 spread of malignant melanoma. The tumour cells reach  删除换行1 the regional lymph nodes by embolism and permeation.\nSatellite nodules are seen in the transit between the  删除换行1 primary growth and regional lymph nodes. Secondary  删除换行1 lymphoedema may occur due to early involvement of the  删除换行1 regional lymph nodes.\n\n【41】In malignant melanoma of the eye there is no lymph  删除换行1 spread.\n\n【42】3. BLOOD SPREAD.— Blood spread is a late  删除换行1 event and may be absent until nearly the end. The  删除换行1 skin is a common site of metastasis. Secondary growths  删除换行1 appear in the skin early. Liver, lungs, bones and brain  删除换行1 may be involved by blood borne metastasis. Some  删除换行1 unusual sites may be involved by blood spread e.g. the  删除换行1 small intestine, the heart and the breasts.\n\n【43】Sometimes liver has been metastasised even after  删除换行1 many years of removal of the eye due to malignant  删除换行1 melanoma.\n\n【44】CLINICAL FEATURES —\n\n【45】1. Increase in size.— The patient usually complains  删除换行1 that a long standing mole has suddenly shown rapid  删除换行1 growth within the last few days. Such increase in size  删除换行1 occurs in all directions. The moles become wider and  删除换行1 thicker.\n\n【46】2. Change in colour.— The benign mole becomes  删除换行1 darkar. Such colour change is often patchy. Some areas  删除换行1 may show increased vascularity. Sometimes malignant  删除换行1 melanoma does not show pigment and such lesion is  删除换行1 called amelanotic melanoma.\n\n【47】3. Bleeding.— The overlying epithelium becomes  删除换行1 ulcerated and often breaks down with minor injury. This  删除换行1 tends to bleed. These changes are particularly noticed  删除换行1 when the growth has become malignant.\n\n【48】4. Evidence of local spread.— Tumour cells gradually  删除换行1 invade the surrounding skin to produce a halo, which  删除换行1 indicates appearance of malignancy. Gradually the  删除换行1 malignant cells permeate through the intradermal  删除换行1 lymphatics and cause satellite nodules at a little distance  删除换行1 away from the primary tumour. Gradually more satellite  删除换行1 nodules develop at greater distances.\n\n【49】5. Enlarged regional lymph nodes.— This indicates  删除换行1 that the growth has turned malignant.\n\n【50】SYMPTOMS.— Malignant melanoma is extremely rare  删除换行1 before puberty. The commonest site in males is the front  删除换行1 or back of the trunk in the white; whereas the sole of  删除换行1 the foot, palm and external genitalia are common sites in  删除换行1 case of the coloured. In case of females lower leg is a  删除换行1 common site in the white. Rarely melanomas arise in  删除换行1 the eye, in the meninges and in the mucocutaneous  删除换行1 junctions e.g. mouth, anus etc. The incidence of melanoma  删除换行1 appears to be increasing in the true sense. Melanoma is  删除换行1 far more common in the white population than it is in  删除换行1 the black. The white : black ratio for melanoma is 20 \n\n【51】: 1. The pathologic type for blacks is most commonly  删除换行1 acral-lentigal melanoma and the sole of the foot is the  删除换行1 site of primary lesion in approximately 60% of patients.\n\n【52】When benign mole shows the cardinal symptoms of 删除换行1 malignant change, malignant melanoma is the most  删除换行1 probable diagnosis. Malignant melanoma is not painful.\n\n【53】It often itches. Sometimes the patient may complain of  删除换行1 lymph node enlargement, that means swelling in the  删除换行1 groin, axilla or neck according to the region of the  删除换行1 primary tumour.\n\n【54】Only in late cases one may complain of weight loss,  删除换行1 dyspnoea or jaundice (due to hepatic involvement).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

The delivery was uneventful, and the infant cried immediately after birth. He received no advanced resuscitation and was assigned Apgar scores of 8 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes of life, respectively. The newborn was noted to have intermittent grunting in the delivery room. Pulse oximetry was 90–92%, so he went to recovery with his mother where he continued to receive routine care and monitoring. However, at approximately 2 hours of life the pediatric team was called to evaluate for signs of increasing respiratory distress, including tachypnea (respiratory rate 84 breaths per minute), retractions, and supplemental oxygen requirement to maintain oxygen saturations ( S p O <sub>2 </sub> ) greater than 90%.

How would you respond?Rationale and Evidence‐based Practice Explanation\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【18】### Based on the data provided, what is the most likely diagnosis and differential diagnosis for this newborn? What are the perinatal risk factors for this diagnosis?\n\n【19】After ruling out all other pathologic causes of respiratory distress, transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN) would be the most likely diagnosis for this infant. Since confirmatory diagnosis of TTN comes after symptoms are no longer present, other conditions presenting with respiratory distress in a term newborn shortly after birth would include:\n\n【20】   respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) 删除换行1    early‐onset sepsis 删除换行1    congenital pneumonia 删除换行1    meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS) 删除换行1    congenital heart disease (CHD) 删除换行1    persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) 删除换行1    congenital metabolic acidosis 删除换行1    pneumothorax.\n\n【21】TTN is the result of residual fluid in a newborn’s lungs and is the most common cause of respiratory distress in the immediate newborn period. The maternal and birth history, clinical presentation, physical examination, and chest radiograph findings for the newborn support the diagnosis of TTN. Delivery by cesarean section, male sex, and family history of asthma are perinatal risk factors for TTN. The delivery was uncomplicated with no noted intrauterine distress or perinatal asphyxia, clear amniotic fluid, and blood gas analysis with no evidence of significant acidosis (which is more common in conditions such as MAS, RDS, and PPHN). Since the patient was delivered close to term, he was also at less risk for RDS and congenital metabolic disease.\n\n【22】Infants with TTN may have cyanosis with a supplemental oxygen requirement, but they usually do not require F i O <sub>2 </sub> greater than 0.4. They generally have blood gases that do not reflect carbon dioxide retention, and rarely require advanced respiratory support (i.e. intubation and mechanical ventilation); such intervention is more common with other causes of neonatal respiratory distress such as RDS, MAS, and PPHN.\n\n【23】While neonates with CHD can present with cyanosis and tachypnea, there is no family history of CHD and there were no other clinical symptoms (i.e. murmur, decreased or absent pulses, poor perfusion, active precordium, acidosis) to suggest a diagnosis of CHD. In addition, the baby’s oxygen saturation response to the administration of oxygen and the pre‐ductal and post‐ductal S p O <sub>2 </sub> values less than 10% decrease the likelihood of CHD or PPHN as a contributing diagnosis.\n\n【24】The infant’s chest radiograph showed the classic pathophysiologic findings of TTN, including normal to slightly hyperinflated lung volumes, mildly hazy diffuse alveolar appearance, and central radiating linear opacities demonstrating excess fluid being carried out via the pulmonary vasculature. The early radiographs in TTN can appear similar to other neonatal respiratory disorders, particularly congenital pneumonia, which typically takes longer to clear. Radiographically, RDS will typically show hypoinflation and a ground‐glass appearance, as opposed to the hyperinflation generally noted with TTN. The patient’s chest X‐ray also excluded pneumothorax as a diagnosis.\n\n【25】Despite an unknown maternal GBS status at birth, rupture of membranes was at the time of delivery and there were no other perinatal risk factors for infection, including prolonged rupture of membranes, complicated labor, and chorioamnionitis (e.g. maternal fever, elevated maternal white cell count, purulent amniotic fluid, uterine tenderness, and fetal tachycardia). Likewise, the infant’s CBC showed normal immature to total neutrophil, white cell and platelet counts. The baby had no symptoms such as lethargy, hypothermia, apnea, and respiratory failure that may accompany neonatal infection.\n\n【26】### What results would you expect from a hyper‐oxygen test with this disorder? Would you consider doing any other screening tests or diagnostics? If yes, what would you include?\n\n【27】Hyperoxia test is performed by measuring the arterial blood gases of the patient while he or she breathes room air, then remeasuring the blood gases after the patient has breathed 100% oxygen for 10 minutes. If the cause of the cyanosis is primarily pulmonary in nature, the P a O <sub>2 </sub> will increase to greater than 150 mmHg after 10 minutes on 100% oxygen. This will not occur in cardiac disease of a shunt physiology (right‐to‐left shunt).\n\n【28】Hyperoxia test could be useful for differentiating between pulmonary and cardiac causes of cyanosis, and in the case of TTN would show improvement in oxygen saturation with the administration of 100% oxygen.\n\n【29】A C‐reactive protein may be helpful if there is a concern for bacterial illness. An echocardiogram would confirm or exclude CHD or PPHN. Repeat chest X‐ray may be useful if clinical history suggests pneumonia, respiratory status worsens, or for questionable diagnoses.\n\n【30】### What would be your management goals for the care of this infant?\n\n【31】Since TTN is a self‐limited disorder, the goal of therapy is supportive and includes the following:\n\n【32】   Respiratory support, including supplemental oxygen via hood, nasal cannula, or continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), to provide adequate (>90%) arterial oxygen saturation.\n   Maintaining a neutral thermal environment (keeping patient normothermic).\n   Fluid and nutrition support with intravenous fluids and/or gavage feedings until the respiratory rate is low enough to allow oral feedings.\n   Family support.\n\n【33】It is important to monitor for signs of respiratory fatigue or clinical deterioration, which may suggest an alternative diagnosis. Infants with TTN independent of other comorbidities rarely have oxygen requirements greater than 40% and invasive mechanical ventilation is usually not required.\n\n【34】### Are antibiotics indicated for this patient?\n\n【35】TTN alone is not an indication for antibiotic therapy. However, owing to the difficulty of distinguishing TTN from congenital pneumonia at presentation, many newborns with TTN receive empiric antibiotics (i.e. ampicillin, which covers GBS and Listeria , in combination with gentamicin for Gram‐negative coverage) for a minimum of 48 hours pending blood culture results.\n\n【36】There is evidence to suggest that empiric antibiotics may be avoidable with the use of strict criteria for TTN and diligent patient monitoring 删除10：<u>(Salama et al . 2013 )</u>. However, these authors recommend further studies employing randomized controlled trials to confirm the feasibility and safety of this approach.\n\n【37】### Which of the following strategies, if any, have been shown to help in the management of the patient’s diagnosis: diuretic therapy, fluid restriction, and/or inhaled salbutamol therapy?\n\n【38】A Cochrane review finds no current evidence to support diuretic therapy in the management of TTN. There are limited data showing that infants with severe TTN might benefit from fluid restriction, and there is some support for the use of salbutamol therapy with TTN. However, current data remain inconclusive with a need for larger‐scale studies. Therefore, none of these therapies is currently recommended as standard therapy.\n\n【39】### While obtaining consent for NICU admission and updating the family on the newborn’s status and plan of care, the mother wants to know what “causes” the condition and how long you expect it to last. How would you respond?\n\n【40】TTN typically carries a good prognosis, and symptoms generally resolve within 24–48 hours and rarely go beyond 72 hours.Case Resolution\n---------------\n\n【41】Over the course of several hours, the neonate was weaned off oxygen and the nasal cannula discontinue by 12 hours of life. He became stable in room air, with oxygen saturations greater than 95%, and tachypnea resolved by 32 hours of life. The antibiotics (ampicillin and gentamicin) that had been started due to clinical symptoms and oxygen requirement were discontinued with the discovery of negative blood cultures at 48 hours.\n\n【42】Breastfeeding was initiated at 36 hours of life, when respiratory rate was less than 65 breaths per minute and intravenous fluids were weaned as he tolerated breastfeeding and was feeding adequately. His clinical state continued to remain stable, and he was transferred to couplet care with his mother at approximately 48 hours of life.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

These testifying doctors are paid by the respective parties based on a review of the medical records, patient examinations, and information from scientific studies or learned treatises.\n\n【6】Damages: Plaintiffs in cancer misdiagnosis cases must prove that they were actually harmed or injured by the failure to timely diagnose their cancer. In other words, the plaintiff needs to show that the misdiagnosis made their cancer less treatable or somehow changed their outlook to get compensation.

She  删除换行1 is complaining of severe pain affecting her left leg and groin, and has been unable to get up  删除换行1 since the fall. On further questioning, the patient has been treated with steroids for polymyalgia  删除换行1 rheumatica for the past 12 months and had sustained an injury to the right hip 5 years ago.\nHer only other medication is ramipril for essential hypertension. She lives independently in a  删除换行1 three-bedroom, two-storey house and was widowed 4 years ago. She has a supportive son who  删除换行1 normally visits her once a week.\n\n【3】Examination\n\n【4】The patient is now comfortable, having been given intravenous morphine sulphate. Her left leg  删除换行1 appears shorter than her right one and is externally rotated. She is unable to actively lift her leg,  删除换行1 and any attempt to passively move it results in pain. Her pedal foot pulses and sensation are  删除换行1 intact.\n\n【5】Questions\n\n【6】• What investigation is depicted in Figure 70.1, and what does it show?\n\n【7】• What are the relevant factors in the history?\n\n【8】• What would be the further management in this patient?\n\n【9】• Why is the social history particularly important in this patient?\n\n【10】删除3：<u>Figure 70.1 Plain x-ray of the pelvis.</u>\n\n【11】ANSWER 70\n\n【12】This woman has sustained a (intracapsular) sub-capital neck of femur fracture. The x-ray also demonstrates a hip prosthesis on the right side, after a previous similar injury 删除33：<u>通用删除1(英):<u>(arrow in Figure 70.2)</u></u>.\n\n【13】Fractured neck of the femur is a relatively common injury following a fall in the elderly population. The rate of hip fracture doubles every decade from the age of 50 years. There is a female  删除换行1 preponderance of three to one.\nThis woman is at particularly high risk because of her long-term steroid use. It is now a British  删除换行5 National Formulary (BNF) recommendation that patients on long-term steroids should have  删除换行1 concomitant treatment for the prevention of osteoporosis.\n\n【14】There are two different types of fractured neck of femur, intracapsular and extracapsular. Displaced fractures that are intracapsular disrupt the intra-osseous blood supply; the remaining  删除换行1 blood supply comes from the retinacular vessels and from the artery of the ligamentum teres. This  删除换行1 is usually not adequate to provide enough nutrition to allow fracture healing, leading to avascular  删除换行1 necrosis of the femoral head. In this situation, the fracture is not amenable to fixation; instead, the  删除换行1 head and proximal femoral neck are removed and replaced by a hemi-arthroplasty. Fractures that  删除换行1 are extracapsular do not compromise the blood supply to the femoral head, and so can be treated  删除换行1 by fixation, i.e. a dynamic hip screw.\n\n【15】Irrespective of the fracture type, the initial management remains the same. It involves providing  删除换行1 adequate analgesia, usually in the form of intravenous morphine. Intravenous fluid resuscitation is essential as these patients may well have been incapacitated for some time and will have  删除换行1 sustained blood loss secondary to the fracture. Because these patients are likely to require an  删除换行1 operation, they need a complete work-up for theatre. This will include blood tests (renal function, full blood count and group and save) and electrocardiogram and a chest x-ray if clinically  删除换行1 indicated.\n\n【16】As part of the initial assessment, it is important to take a comprehensive history, concentrating  删除换行1 on the mechanism of injury. It is incorrect to assume that all falls are mechanical; it is not uncommon to find that the cause of the fall is actually due to a urinary or chest infection or even  删除换行1 a silent myocardial infarction.\n\n【17】The patient’s social history is also very important. This woman lives alone and has stairs  删除换行1 to climb within her house. In order for her to be discharged, it is imperative that the discharge environment is safe. The input of physiotherapists and occupational therapists is \n\n【18】删除3：<u>Figure 70.2 Fractured neck of femur on  删除换行1 the left (anterior-posterior).</u>\nOrthopaedic 删除换行1 essential to this assessment. If required, items such as handrails, walk-in shower, stairlifts,  删除换行1 perching stools and toilet raises should be supplied. Similarly, other activities of daily  删除换行1 living should be catered for, such as meals on wheels; district nurse follow-up for dressing  删除换行1 changes; and healthcare assistants for help with shopping, cleaning and self-care.\n\n【19】KEY POINTS\n\n【20】•\tFemoral neck fractures are classified as either intracapsular or extracapsular.\n\n【21】•\tMethods of surgical treatment depend on which type of fracture has been sustained.删除6：<u>This page intentionally left blank165</u>\n删除个例：<u>Orthopaedic</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

The final activity in session 1 was to teach Nick to self-monitor his evening-out impulsion. The purpose of self-monitoring was to begin to increase Nick’s awareness of each time that impulsion occurred, to provide the therapist with an estimate of how many times per day the impulsion was occurring, and to identify additional triggers. During self-monitoring, Nick was asked to carry a small notebook and to record each time he performed his evening-out impulsion throughout the day. He was also asked to record how many times he repeated the behavior, what triggered the impulsion, and to rate the associated urge on a 0–10 SUDS. Finally, he was also asked to record any successful attempts to resist performing the impulsion. Nick’s mother was instructed to also monitor for this impulsion and prompt Nick to record his behavior in his notebook.\n\n【4】### Session 2\n\n【5】When Nick returned for his second session, the therapist first reviewed his self-monitoring homework. Nick had diligently recorded his evening-out impulsion. In addition, he was able to identify several additional triggers (light switches, petting his dog), which were added to his symptom list. He noted that he had performed his evening-out impulsion much more than he had previously thought. He also noted that he had tried to resist his impulsion several times, but was largely unsuccessful, stating, “Once I get going, I can’t stop.” A sample of Nick’s self-monitoring homework is provided in Table 21.2 . It was clear from his homework that some triggers were associated with stronger SUDS ratings than others and that “stronger” triggers tended to elicit a greater number of repetitions of the impulsion. It is noteworthy that Nick’s mother also reported that he needed frequent prompts throughout the week, as she often observed him performing evening-out impulsions that Nick claimed he did not notice. Based on his self-monitoring homework, Nick and the therapist created a trigger hierarchy based on the degree to which they elicited the urge to perform the evening-out impulsion. Again, Nick was asked to indicate, using a 0–10 SUDS rating scale, the degree to which each trigger elicits the feeling associated with his evening-out impulsion.\nTable 21.2 删除换行 Self-monitoring homework: evening out (session 1)\n\n| Number of repeats | Trigger | SUDS | Resist (yes/no) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 9 | Doorknob | 6 | No |\n| 3 | Pet/touch dog | 4 | No |\n| 5 | Light switch | 3 | No |\n| 4 | Light switch | 3 | No |\n| 12 | Doorknob | 8 | No |\n\n【7】SUDS subjective units of distress scale\n\n【8】After creating a trigger hierarchy, HRT was then conducted for Nick’s evening-out impulsion and consisted of two primary activities: AT and CRT. The purpose of AT was to teach Nick to become more aware of each time his impulsion occurred. The first step in AT involved developing a detailed description of the discrete, sequential movements involved in the impulsion, beginning with the first movement. To begin AT, Nick was asked to simulate his impulsion and describe each of the movements involved. Nick quickly came to realize that his impulsion almost always started by touching something with his right hand (he was right-handed) followed by his left hand. He also described that his left hand was usually at his side, requiring him to raise his left forearm and rotate his left elbow. He also described that the pressure feeling in his right hand preceded initiation of the movements of his left arm. So the sequence of his impulsion included: touch object with right hand → feeling in right hand → raise left forearm → rotate left elbow → touch object with left hand → repeat until feeling was assuaged.\n\n【9】After generating a detailed definition of Nick’s evening-out impulsion, the therapist initiated the second component of AT, response detection. The purpose of response detection was to teach Nick to recognize each instance of his impulsion (or the associated feeling) and catch it as early as possible in the sequence. To do so, the therapist presented Nick with several of the low-SUDS triggers from his symptom list and asked him to say a brief “code word” as soon as he recognized the urge or beginning actions of the evening-out behavior (Nick chose to say the word “yup”). The triggers were then introduced repeatedly, and Nick was asked to touch them with his right hand, keeping in mind that not every presentation of the trigger elicited the impulsion to touch the item with his left hand. Initially, Nick was able to say “yup” only after he actually touched the triggering object with his left hand. When this happened, the therapist prompted Nick by stating the code word (“yup”) as soon as he saw Nick’s left forearm rise and his left elbow rotate. After several minutes of repeated feedback and practice, Nick was able to catch the impulsion earlier in the sequence, saying “yup” when he recognized the urge and before his left arm began to move (which the therapist praised each time). When Nick was able to catch 80 % of his impulsions early in the sequence, the therapist introduced CRT.\n\n【10】The purpose of CRT was to teach Nick to perform a behavior that was incompatible with his impulsion (i.e. a competing response) each time he felt the associated urge, caught the impulsion midstream, and/or immediately after he performed an impulsion. Nick and the therapist worked together to come up with a CR according to five general rules: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> the CR should be something that would make his impulsion impossible or difficult to perform, 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> the CR should interrupt the earliest movement in the sequence, 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> the CR should be something that is less noticeable than the impulsion itself, 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> the CR should (ideally) be a behavior that he can perform anytime and anywhere, and 通用删除7(英):<u>(5)</u> the CR should be a behavior that he can sustain for an extended period of time, until his urge to perform the impulsion subsides. For Nick’s evening-out impulsion, the CR involved pinning his left elbow to his hip (elbow bone to hipbone) while making a fist with his left hand. The therapist then prompted Nick to simulate and practice the CR several times to assure mastery.\n\n【11】When it was clear that Nick understood and had mastered the CR, ERP was introduced. Nick was exposed to triggers from his hierarchy, beginning with those that had the lowest SUDS ratings, and was asked to use the CR to refrain from performing the impulsion 删除25：<u></u>. During these exposure tasks, Nick was also asked to provide periodic SUDS ratings, which the therapist recorded on worksheet 删除25：<u></u>. To begin, the therapist asked Nick to repeatedly turn the light switch on/off and to use the CR if he felt the urge to touch it with his left hand. Initially, Nick used the CR continuously while doing the exposure task, regardless of whether he felt the urge. Because the purpose of HRT and ERP was to teach Nick to inhibit the impulsion when it was triggered, the therapist prompted him to relax (not perform the CR) until he felt the urge. When he recognized the urge to perform the impulsion, Nick quickly initiated the CR and focused on the triggering stimulus for at least a minute or until his urge ratings reduced to zero (or a “near-zero manageable level”) for three consecutive ratings. Another trial of the exposure exercise was then initiated. If Nick performed the impulsion during exposure tasks, the therapist prompted him to use his CR, and the next practice trial began.\nTable 21.3 删除换行 Nick’s trigger hierarchy for his evening-out impulsion\n\n| Trigger | SUDS | Trigger | SUDS |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Light switch | 3 | Bump into someone with right arm | 5 |\n| Pet dog | 3 | Bump into object with right arm | 6 |\n| Open book | 4 | Turn doorknob | 7 |\n| Touch desk | 4 | Open and close door | 8 |\n| Shake hands with stranger | 4 | Turn kitchen faucet handle | 8 |\n| Shake hands with someone familiar | 5 | Turn bathroom faucet handle | 9 |\n\n【13】SUDS subjective units of distress scale\nTable 21.4 删除换行 Exposure record for Nick’s evening-out impulsion\n\n| Trigger | Assignment | Assignment | Assignment | Assignment | Assignment | Assignment | Assignment | Assignment | Assignment | Assignment |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Light switch | Flip light switch on/off with your right hand, use your CR to stop yourself from evening out with your left hand | Flip light switch on/off with your right hand, use your CR to stop yourself from evening out with your left hand | Flip light switch on/off with your right hand, use your CR to stop yourself from evening out with your left hand | Flip light switch on/off with your right hand, use your CR to stop yourself from evening out with your left hand | Flip light switch on/off with your right hand, use your CR to stop yourself from evening out with your left hand | Flip light switch on/off with your right hand, use your CR to stop yourself from evening out with your left hand | Flip light switch on/off with your right hand, use your CR to stop yourself from evening out with your left hand | Flip light switch on/off with your right hand, use your CR to stop yourself from evening out with your left hand | Flip light switch on/off with your right hand, use your CR to stop yourself from evening out with your left hand | Flip light switch on/off with your right hand, use your CR to stop yourself from evening out with your left hand |\n| Trial | SUDS 通用删除7(英):<u>(0–10)</u>: Rate every 30 s | SUDS 通用删除7(英):<u>(0–10)</u>: Rate every 30 s | SUDS 通用删除7(英):<u>(0–10)</u>: Rate every 30 s | SUDS 通用删除7(英):<u>(0–10)</u>: Rate every 30 s | SUDS 通用删除7(英):<u>(0–10)</u>: Rate every 30 s | SUDS 通用删除7(英):<u>(0–10)</u>: Rate every 30 s | SUDS 通用删除7(英):<u>(0–10)</u>: Rate every 30 s | SUDS 通用删除7(英):<u>(0–10)</u>: Rate every 30 s | SUDS 通用删除7(英):<u>(0–10)</u>: Rate every 30 s | SUDS 通用删除7(英):<u>(0–10)</u>: Rate every 30 s |\n| 1 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 1 | 1 | 1 |\n| 2 | 3 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 4 | 2 | 3 | 1 | 1 | 0 |\n| 3 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 0 | 0 |  |  |\n| 10 | 2 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |  |  |  |  |  |\n\n【15】CR competing response, SUDS subjective units of distress scale\n\n【16】By the end of the second session, Nick was able to recognize and interrupt most instances of his evening-out impulsion using the CR. In addition, he learned that although his urges increased initially while using his CR, they declined to a manageable level after a few minutes. To conclude the second session, Nick’s mother was taught how to appropriately prompt and praise use of the CR (i.e. social support), and Nick and his mother were asked to conduct daily 40–60-min practice sessions each day of the upcoming week. During practice sessions, Nick was assigned to repeatedly approach several of the least-provoking triggers (light switches, petting the dog, shaking strangers hands, touching books) and practice using his CR while recording his SUDS ratings on exposure record forms 删除25：<u></u>. In addition, Nick’s mother was asked to prompt him to use his CR throughout the week when she observed the evening-out impulsion. Finally, Nick was asked to use the CR as many times as possible throughout the week and to continue to self-monitor his evening-out impulsion as described in session 1, paying particular attention to any new triggers as well as whether he was able to resist his impulsions. He was also asked to begin to self-monitor his swiping impulsion, which was the second impulsion on his symptom list 删除25：<u></u>.\n\n【17】### Session 3\n\n【18】When Nick and his mother returned for the third session, the therapist first reviewed the self-monitoring and exposure homework. His self-monitoring homework revealed that Nick had been able to resist his evening-out impulsion about 70 % of the time during the past week. His homework also showed that both his initial and peak urge ratings reported during his exposure homework had decreased over the course of the week. The light switch was very rarely triggering the evening-out impulsion, and when it did, the urge was tolerable (peak SUDS rating of 1–2) and easy for Nick to resist, even without using the CR. Similar improvement was noted with several other low SUDS items on the trigger hierarchy. As a general rule, items were considered “mastered” when they were triggering a tolerable urge that could be easily resisted, and Nick demonstrated that he was able to resist the impulsion in the presence of the trigger several times across multiple days. In Nick’s case, the mastery criteria were set at (a) the peak SUDS ratings during exposure trials were reduced by at least 50 % from baseline and had a peak SUDS rating < 2 and (b) Nick was able to resist the impulsion in the presence of the trigger at least ten consecutive times across three consecutive days. When these criteria were met for an item on Nick’s hierarchy, the exposure exercise was considered mastered, and the next item on the hierarchy was introduced (e.g. bumping into something with his right arm, turning doorknobs).\n\n【19】After assigning and practicing several new exposure tasks for his evening-out impulsion, Nick and the therapist began working on his swiping impulsion 删除25：<u></u>. Based on his self-monitoring information from the previous week, it was clear that this impulsion was occurring during two different situations. On some occasions, the urge to swipe his finger was triggered simply by seeing a particular object, such as a TV or computer screen. In these instances, he recognized the urge well before he performed the behavior but said that he felt a pressure feeling in his fingers that compelled him to approach the stimulus and repeatedly swipe his finger across the surface until the feeling went away. Self-monitoring data showed that he was able to resist swiping under these circumstances about 50 % of the time. On other occasions, however, Nick was already interacting with the stimulus, and the swiping was experienced as “automatic.” For example, he demonstrated that when swiping through pictures on his mobile phone’s touch screen, he would swipe his right index finger on the screen one time (with intention) for the purpose of advancing to the next picture. However, periodically, he would swipe his finger across the screen several times in rapid succession (and with greater force) until the pressure feeling in his fingertip was alleviated. He was rarely, if ever, able to resist the impulsion under these circumstances. After creating a trigger hierarchy for his swiping impulsion, HRT was introduced as described above. First, Nick and the therapist came up with a detailed response description. The therapist then asked Nick to scroll through pictures on his mobile phone (at a rate of one picture every 2 s) and to respond by saying “yup” each time he felt the pressure feeling and/or performed the swiping impulsion (i.e. response detection). This continued until he was able to catch 80 % of his swiping impulsions. A CR was then introduced, which involved having Nick fold his index finger into his palm and placing the pad of his thumb over the top of the middle phalanx on his index finger. Nick then practiced using the CR to refrain from swiping while confronting the first items on his trigger hierarchy. Exposure homework for his evening-out and swiping impulsions was then assigned, and Nick was asked to begin self-monitoring the next impulsion on his symptom list.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

You should obtain a urinalysis, given hypertension and concern for urinary tract infection (UTI) or nephrotic syndrome, as well as a complete metabolic panel to assess blood urea nitrogen and creatinine as markers of renal function and hydration status. Finally, a complete blood count with differential can quickly help to assess for signs of infection, hematologic disease, or abnormalities indicative of chronic disease.\n\n【26】### Based on the initial laboratory evaluation, clinical examination, and vital signs, what findings are significant?\n\n【27】The abnormal laboratory values of concern include leukopenia with lymphocytopenia, mild anemia, elevated creatinine, hypoalbuminemia, proteinuria, and hematuria. The sustained hypertension and fever are abnormal vital signs. On examination, her malar rash and periorbital edema are also significant. The laboratory findings suggest that the most likely diagnosis is an autoimmune disorder with renal disease.\n\n【28】Table 57.4 Revised criteria for classification of SLE.\n\n| Criterion | Definition |\n| --- | --- |\n| Hematologic | Anemia defined as >2SD below the mean for age and sexLeukopenia: white blood cell count <4000/mm 3Thrombocytopenia: platelet count <100 000/mm 3Lymphopenia <1500/mm 3Hemolysis |\n| Mucocutaneous | Oral or nasopharyngeal ulceration, usually painless, observed by providerNon‐scarring alopeciaSubacute cutaneous or discoid lupusMalar rash or maculopapular rash |\n| Musculoskeletal | Non‐erosive arthritis or synovitis involving two or more peripheral joints, characterized by tenderness, swelling, or effusion |\n| Pleural or pericardial effusion | Imaging evidence of pleural effusion, orPericarditis: documented by EKG or imaging evidence of pericardial effusion |\n| Renal disorder | Persistent proteinuria >0.5 g/day orCellular casts: may be red cell, hemoglobin, granular, tubular, or mixedClass II, III, IV or V lupus nephritis on renal biopsy |\n| Neurologic disorder | Seizures: in the absence of offending drugs or known metabolic derangements, orPsychosis: in the absence of offending drugs or known metabolic derangementsDelirium |\n| Fever | Temperature >38.3°C |\n| Immunologic disorders | Anti‐DNA: antibody to native DNA in abnormal titer, orAnti‐Smith (Sm): presence of antibody to Sm nuclear antigen, orPositive findings of anti‐phospholipid antibodies on:an abnormal serum level of IgG or IgM anti‐cardiolipin antibodiesa positive test result for lupus anticoagulant using a standard methodor a false‐positive test for at least 6 months confirmed by Treponema pallidum immobilization or fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption test |\n| Anti‐nuclear antibodies | ANA titer ≥1 : 80 or an equivalent positive test at least once |\n| Complement | Low C3 or C4 or low C3 and C4 |\n\n【30】SD, standard deviation.\n\n【31】### What specialty service(s) should be consulted to be involved in her care?\n\n【32】When autoimmune disorders are suspected, the rheumatology service should be consulted. Begin an autoimmune evaluation and obtain ESR and ANA. Additional rheumatologic tests may include anti‐double‐stranded DNA, anti‐Smith, anti‐phospholipid antibody, direct Coombs, and complement with C3 and C4. With the concern for renal disease coupled with hypertension, the nephrology team should be consulted.\n\n【33】The diagnosis of SLE is based on clinical manifestations and laboratory testing. Diagnosis of SLE is defined by meeting four of eleven criteria based on the American College of Rheumatology 1997 Revised Criteria for Classifications of SLE .\n\n【34】This patient had the following criteria for diagnosis of SLE: malar rash, persistent proteinuria, leukopenia, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, positive anti‐double‐stranded DNA, and positive ANA test. She also presented with evidence of lupus nephritis, including hematuria, proteinuria, hypertension, and acute kidney injury.\n\n【35】### Are any other diagnostic studies warranted?\n\n【36】Hypocomplementemia adds to the suspicion for lupus nephritis, so renal biopsy is the gold standard for diagnosis, classifying degree of nephritis (I–VI), and guiding therapy.\n\n【37】### What interventions would you implement?\n\n【38】Renal involvement with SLE occurs in approximately 75% of children, usually within first two years of disease. Specific treatment is formulated for each patient based on organ involvement. Sunscreen is advised for all SLE patients to prevent exacerbation and non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) help with fevers and arthritis. With renal involvement, glucocorticoids are the first‐line therapy. Multiple side effects, including hypertension, hyperglycemia, and immune suppression, have led to improved steroid‐dosing techniques such as pulse doses or every other day doses. Immunosuppressive therapy including cyclophosphamide and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) is second‐line therapy (class III–V) and allows hopeful reduction in steroid resistance. Class VI SLE nephritis may require dialysis and renal transplant. Current research is being conducted regarding benefits of autologous stem cell transplant for refractory SLE. Treatment of hypertension secondary to SLE nephritis and steroid use includes low salt diet and antihypertensives.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

She studied anthropology  删除换行1 at university and had been in a long-term relationship. After leaving university with a good  删除换行1 degree, she struggled to get a job. She eventually found work in a restaurant, which she  删除换行1 seemed to enjoy. Last year her boyfriend moved out and she decided to quit her job and move  删除换行1 back home. Over the past year her family has become increasingly worried about her health  删除换行1 and behaviour. Her personal care has deteriorated and she has slowly withdrawn from interacting with her family. She has not bothered to find a job locally and only leaves her bedroom  删除换行1 to wash and get food from the kitchen. Kate has also begun to clean her hands obsessively  删除换行1 although otherwise she does not seem to wash. Her room smells stale and she has refused to  删除换行1 let her mum change her bedding. She does not seem to change her clothes and does not allow  删除换行1 them to be washed with the family clothes. Her mother has noticed that Kate’s hands are raw  删除换行1 and that she has sores on her back and her legs. She refused to speak to a GP about her mood,  删除换行1 and in desperation Kate’s parents have spoken to their GP about what can be done. The GP  删除换行5 was concerned enough to attempt a home visit, but on arrival Kate refused to come out of her  删除换行1 room, saying that she was just having a break from the stresses of living.\n\n【2】Questions\n\n【3】• Could Kate be detained for assessment or treatment under the Mental Health Act?\n\n【4】• Should Kate be detained for assessment or treatment under the Mental Health Act?\n\n【5】ANSWER 47\n\n【6】The Mental Health Act 1983, amended in 2007, (MHA) enables a person to be detained for  删除换行1 assessment of a mental disorder (Section 2) and, if a diagnosis has been made, to be detained  删除换行1 for treatment (Section 3). Section 2 is generally used for first admissions, and if Kate had  删除换行1 a known diagnosis she could be detained under Section 3. An admission for assessment lasts  删除换行1 for a maximum of 28 days and it cannot be renewed, although a patient can at any time be  删除换行1 detained under Section 3 instead. The application is usually made by an approved mental  删除换行1 health professional (AMHP), and the person must be seen by two separate doctors, one of  删除换行1 whom must have had specialist training.\n\n【7】Mental disorder is defined as ‘any disorder or disability of the mind’ and this is determined  删除换行1 by relevant professionals in accordance with good clinical practice and accepted standards.\nThere is a broad spectrum of clinically recognised conditions including schizophrenia,  删除换行1 bipolar disorder, severe depression, anxiety and obsessive compulsive disorders. Someone  删除换行1 with a learning disability and no other form of mental disorder may not be detained for  删除换行1 treatment unless their learning disability is accompanied by abnormally aggressive or seriously irresponsible conduct. The aggressive behaviour must relate to the learning disability  删除换行1 and not be attributable to other factors.\n\n【8】The purpose of the detention for assessment under Section 2 is to evaluate whether the person  删除换行1 has a mental disorder and whether treatment is necessary. It can be authorised if the person\n\n【9】• is suffering from a mental disorder of a nature or degree which warrants her detention in hospital and\n\n【10】• ought to be detained in the interests of her own health or safety or with a view to the  删除换行1 protection of others.\n\n【11】Consideration must be given to both the nature and degree of a person’s mental disorder.\n\n【12】Kate is not a risk to others, but her current obsessive and compulsive behaviours do seem to  删除换行1 pose a risk to her health and well-being. There is a suggestion of self-neglect and self-harm,  删除换行1 and her condition might deteriorate without treatment. Nevertheless there can be significant  删除换行1 harms of detaining someone against their will. Kate may be very frightened and anxious  删除换行1 and feel a real lack of control over her situation. She may distrust those who are seeking to  删除换行1 help her, which could have adverse long-term consequences. Consideration should be given  删除换行1 to alternative means of providing care and treatment which she would accept. A psychiatric  删除换行1 outreach team may be able to become involved.\n\n【13】Compulsory detention and treatment is an infringement of personal autonomy. However,  删除换行1 severe compulsive obsessive disorder would impair Kate’s ability to make an autonomous  删除换行1 choice about how she behaves and the care and treatment she requires. If she can get effective  删除换行1 treatment to ameliorate her distress and harmful effects of her disorder, and which thus may  删除换行1 ultimately enhance her autonomy, then the harms of detention may be justified.\n\n【14】Key Points\n\n【15】• Mental health legislation enables compulsory detention for assessment and treatment of a mental disorder.\n\n【16】• Whether someone should be detained against their wishes depends on the benefits to be achieved balanced against the harms of detention.\n\n【17】• The aim should be to minimise the undesirable effects of mental disorder and  删除换行1 maximise the safety and well-being of patients.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

He initially had fever, which resolved after antibiotics were initiated. He was noted to have developed rhinorrhea, significant barky cough, and hoarseness 2 days prior to the day of admission. He also had decreased oral intake.\n\n【5】The toddler was with grandparents on the day of presentation when they noticed that his cough was worsening, with increasing work of breathing and wheezing. He had significantly decreased oral intake and number of wet diapers. These concerns prompted the grandparents to bring him to the emergency department (ED).\n\n【6】The patient’s mother reports that the 11‐month‐old brother was diagnosed with croup 6 days ago.Past Medical History\n--------------------\n\n【7】This child was born at 38 week’s gestation after a normal pregnancy and normal perinatal and early neonatal periods and was discharged home from the newborn nursery on day 1 of life. All required immunizations are up to date including annual influenza vaccine.\n\n【8】His present weight and height are at the 11th percentile for age, and he has remained on the same growth curve since 6 months of age.Past Surgical History\n---------------------\n\n【9】None.Family History\n--------------\n\n【10】Non‐contributory. Parents are both healthy, and there is a younger sibling.Current Status\n--------------\n\n【11】On arrival at an outlying hospital ED, the patient is noted to have inspiratory and expiratory stridor. His initial respiratory rate is 50 breaths per minute with oxygen saturation of 88% and moderate supraclavicular and subcostal retractions. He is given dexamethasone (Decadron) and three 0.5‐mL doses of racemic epinephrine 2.25%, and is started on 100% oxygen via high‐flow nasal cannula (HFNC) at 8 L/min, with minimal improvement in work of breathing. As he continues to exhibit increased work of breathing, he is placed on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) support. Despite ongoing administration of racemic epinephrine and CPAP support, his work of breathing continues to worsen, with persistent oxygen desaturation and worsening retractions. A venous blood gas (VBG) analysis demonstrates respiratory acidosis, pH of 6.94, P CO <sub>2 </sub> 100 mmHg, and bicarbonate 25 mg/dL. He is emergently intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure and placed on the ventilator with settings of F i O <sub>2 </sub> 0.4, positive end‐expiratory pressure (PEEP) 5 cmH <sub>2 </sub> O, tidal volume 60 mL, inspiratory time 0.6 seconds, and rate 30/min.

Based on the data given, what are the differential diagnoses and the most likely diagnosis for this child?\n2.  What is the pathophysiology of the diagnosis?\n3.  What are the indications for admission?\n4.  What are the recommended therapies and their mechanisms of action?Rationale and Evidence‐based Practice Explanation\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【20】### Based on the data given, what are the differential diagnoses and the most likely diagnosis for this child?\n\n【21】The differential diagnoses for this child include the following.\n\n【22】   Croup (laryngotracheobronchitis): associated with viral illness.\n   Acute epiglottitis (rare in setting of Haemophilus influenzae vaccination): patients have toxic appearance, sitting upright and drooling.\n   Peritonsillar abscess: patients sit upright, drooling, with extended neck, neck swelling and muffled voice.\n   Retropharyngeal abscess: similar in presentation to peritonsillar abscess, with neck stiffness, barky cough is not present.\n   Foreign body aspiration: often a history of acute choking, coughing, and focal wheeze.\n   Anaphylaxis: acute presentation without cold symptom prodrome.\n\n【23】Croup is the most likely diagnosis due to the presenting symptoms of hoarseness, barky cough, and stridor, after a few days of coryza and viral prodrome.\n\n【24】### What is the pathophysiology of the diagnosis?\n\n【25】A viral infection causes inflammation of the larynx, trachea, bronchi, and occasionally bronchioles, and lung parenchyma. This inflammation leads to narrowing of the laryngeal area and tracheal and bronchial lumens, causing obstruction that is pronounced in the subglottic region. Obstruction increases the work of breathing, occasionally resulting in hypercapnia and respiratory failure. Atelectasis may occur concurrently if the bronchioles become obstructed. Croup is most common in children aged 6 months to 3 years. Symptoms of croup are almost always preceded by a viral prodrome.\n\n【26】### What are the indications for admission?\n\n【27】Only 8–15% of patients with croup require hospitalization, of which 1% are admitted to the PICU 删除10：<u>(Rosychuk et al . 2010 )</u>.\n\n【28】Severe croup leads to poor air entry, significant stridor at rest, altered consciousness, impending respiratory failure, persistent or deteriorating respiratory distress after treatment with nebulized epinephrine and corticosteroids, “toxic” appearance or clinical picture suggesting serious secondary bacterial infection, need for supplemental oxygen, and severe dehydration or intolerance of adequate oral intake.\n\n【29】The indications for PICU admission include:\n\n【30】   respiratory failure with imminent respiratory arrest, requiring endotracheal intubation; 删除换行1    persistent severe symptoms requiring frequent nebulized epinephrine dosing; 删除换行1    underlying conditions placing the child at high risk for progressive respiratory failure (e.g. neuromuscular disease or bronchopulmonary dysplasia) 删除10：<u>(Petrocheilou et al . 2014 )</u>.\n\n【31】### What are the recommended therapies and their mechanisms of action?\n\n【32】   Supportive care: humidified air, antipyretics.\n   Glucocorticoids: the mainstay of treatment for croup. Glucocorticoids decrease the severity of croup symptoms in 2–24 hours, reducing hospital length of stay and rate of return visits 删除10：<u>(Gates et al . 2018 )</u>. The mechanism of action involves reduction of inflammation by suppression of neutrophil migration, decreased production of inflammatory mediators, and reversal of capillary permeability. Dosing in infants and children is 0.6 mg/kg, routinely used once, but in certain situations where the patient exhibits recurrent stridor it has been repeated.\n   Racemic epinephrine: nebulized racemic epinephrine 2.25% should be considered for hypoxia or severe croup. The adrenergic effects induce vasoconstriction, leading to decreased subglottic edema. Onset is less than 10 minutes with duration of 2–3 hours; patient therefore requires observation for 3–4 hours for recurrence of stridor before discharge.\n   Heliox: There is evidence to suggest that Heliox therapy, which comprises 70% helium and 30% oxygen, may be used for moderate to severe distress or illness not responsive or refractory to racemic epinephrine, and before the full effects of glucocorticoids are established 删除10：<u>(Moraa et al . 2013 )</u>. It works by establishing laminar gas flow in edematous airways, thereby decreasing the effect of increased airway resistance and decreases the respiratory muscle work of breathing. If oxygen needs are more than 30%, then Heliox may not be effective.\n   Hydration: an assessment of the child’s hydration status is also necessary. Children with respiratory distress have insensible fluid loss requirements. Also, children who are ill may have had difficulty drinking adequate volumes of fluids preceding the hospitalization. These infants and children may require fluid boluses and maintenance intravenous fluid administration.\n   Intubation: rarely indicated, with less than 3% of croup admissions to the PICU requiring intubation. Intubation should be performed by a highly skilled practitioner (ENT, anesthesiology), because airway edema may make intubation difficult. The median duration for intubation is 60 hours 删除10：<u>(Tyler et al . 2017 )</u>.\n   Diagnostic testing: a neck radiograph is often considered for children with croup. However, croup is a clinical diagnosis and an X‐ray is not required nor is there always an evident classic “steeple” sign.\n\n【33】Continuation of case : The patient’s respiratory viral panel is positive for coronavirus OC43. He patient is admitted to the PICU and placed on conventional ventilator, with settings of PEEP 5 cmH <sub>2 </sub> O, tidal volume 6 mL/kg (60 mL), rate 35/min, and F i O <sub>2 </sub> 0.3. He is started on dexamethasone (Decadron) 0.6 mg/kg every 6 hours. A bronchoalveolar lavage is obtained and sent for evaluation. Subsequent VBG analyses are normal.\n\n【34】On day 2 of admission, the toddler is weaned to CPAP and extubated to helium/oxygen mixture (Heliox 70/30) combination via HFNC on day 3 of admission. He completes four doses of Decadron and receives another four doses for persistent stridor post extubation. A nasoduodenal tube is placed on PICU day 3 prior for nutrition.\n\n【35】The child is weaned to room air on day 5 of admission, and at this time he is breathing at a rate of 36/min with minimal intermittent inspiratory stridor. He is transferred to the regular inpatient care area, but restarted on Heliox for worsening stridor and hypoxia, receiving two further doses of racemic epinephrine and is therefore transferred back to the PICU.Additional Question and Evidence‐based Rationale\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【36】### How would you determine if the patient is ready for discharge?\n\n【37】Typically, croup is self‐limited and once the acute period has resolved it is unlikely for severe symptoms to recur. Indications for discharge include:\n\n【38】   no stridor at rest; 删除换行1    normal pulse oximetry in room air; 删除换行1    good air exchange; 删除换行1    normal color; 删除换行1    normal level of consciousness; 删除换行1    demonstrated ability to tolerate fluids by mouth.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

X-ray of the chest shows three broken ribs. Upon questioning， the woman tells the physician that her boyfriend got upset with her because she overcooked his steak. She claims that she provoked the incident by not preparing his food correctly and asks the doctor not to tell the police or anyone else.\n\n【2】What should the physician do in this scenario?\n\n【3】Because the patient is not considered to be a minor or an elderly patient (defined as being older than 65years ofage)， the patient's right to confidentiality must be respected. Although the physician should make all resources available to her， such as a battered women's home， the ethical principles of patient autonomy and privacy must be followed.\n\n【4】Should the physician contact members of the woman's family or close friends named in the social history?\n\n【5】No， the physician should not contact friends or relatives of the patient； doing so when clearly told not to by the patient would break the principle of autonomy. Also， the physician is bound by the privacy rule of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).\n\n【6】What are the exceptions to confidentiality?\n\n【7】There are a number of exceptions to confidentiality besides the age parameters that protect minors and the elderly. These exceptions rely on the physician's judgment. If the potential harm to self or others is great or serious， then confidentiality may be violated to preserve the principle of beneficence. It is the responsibility of the physician to take steps to prevent harm if there are no alternative means to protect those at risk.\n\n【8】What is the Tarasoff decision?\n\n【9】The Tarasoff decision is a law requiring a physician to directly inform and protect potential victims from harm. In this case， for example， if the woman told the physician that she had a gun and was going to go back home and kill her boyfriend for abusing her， the physician would have a duty to inform the boyfriend and detain the patient.\n\n【10】What is the physician's duty if a patient has a serious infectious disease and is putting others at risk?

His mother states that he has  删除换行1 periods of inconsolable crying, which are getting worse and more frequent. In the past few  删除换行1 hours, he had started to vomit and the last vomit was bile-stained. There is no history of  删除换行1 contact with gastroenteritis, travel or bleeding disorders. He had neonatal meningitis and  删除换行1 subsequently developed epilepsy, which is treated with sodium valproate. He has had no fits  删除换行1 in the past month. His mother is in good health but his father has type 1 diabetes.\n\n【3】Examination\n\n【4】Bobby has a temperature of 37.9°C.

The normality of the anus makes  删除换行1 an anal fissure unlikely. The age of the child, the rectal bleeding and the mass (a late feature of intussusception) make an intussusception the most likely diagnosis.\n\n【21】The typical age of children with intussusception is 3 months to 3 years. Intussusception is  删除换行1 due to a part of the bowel telescoping into the adjacent distal bowel. Approximately 75 per  删除换行1 cent of cases are idiopathic with the remainder caused by an underlying condition (e.g. a  删除换行3 Meckel’s diverticulum) creating a lead point for the intussusception. Most intussusceptions  删除换行1 are ileocolic (i.e. part of the ileum telescopes into the colon). They result in stretching of the  删除换行1 mesenteric vasculature that can potentially lead to bowel ischaemia or infarction. For this  删除换行1 reason, investigation and treatment need to be instituted urgently. Typically, the child has  删除换行1 paroxysmal pain during which he or she becomes very pale, stool containing a mixture of  删除换行1 blood and mucus (hence the name redcurrant jelly stool) and a sausage-shaped mass (the  删除换行1 intussusception itself) in the upper right quadrant of the abdomen. As the disease progresses,  删除换行1 bowel obstruction, peritonitis and septicaemia may develop.

A nasogastric tube should be inserted and the stomach emptied. In the majority of  删除换行1 cases reduction can be achieved by a radiologist with an ultrasound or fluoroscopy guided  删除换行1 air or hydrostatic (with barium or water soluble contrast) enema. The antibiotics are given  删除换行1 because of the possibility of intra-abdominal sepsis and the small risk of a perforation  删除换行1 during the reduction. If this procedure fails, or if the child is unstable or has signs of peritonitis or a perforation, then surgery is indicated.

Introns are noncoding regions of RNA that are spliced out of mature mRNA. Almost all introns begin and end with 5’-GU--------AG-3’. A mutation in one of those nucleotides affects splicing. This type of mutation is one of those found in the thalassemia picture, as described in this patient.  \nAnswer A is incorrect . Capping of the mRNA occurs at the 5’ end as it is being transcribed. A mutation at the 5’ end of an intron would not affect capping.  Answer B is incorrect . Hybridization is a process in which single-stranded DNA base-pairs with a complementary sequence. A mutation at the 5’ end of an intron would not affect hybridization   删除换行5 Answer C is incorrect . A poly (A) tail is added to the 3’ end of heterogeneous nuclear RNA (hnRNA, the initial RNA transcript) after transcription.

Pituitary-dependent CS is typically associated with mild-to-moderate CS， and 24-hour urinary free cortisol (UFC) excretion is typically 100-500 mcg and very rarely>1000 mcg. When patients with ACTH-dependent CS present with spontaneous hypokalemia and 24-hour UFC>1000 mcg， the clinician should suspect an ectopic ACTH-secreting tumor. However， there is a subset of patients with pituitary-dependent CS who have large pituitary adenomas and the clinical presenta-tion can overlap with that of ectopic ACTH secre-tion. Herein we present such a case.\n\n【3】The patient was a 28-year-old woman who was self-referred for possible CS. She experienced a62-pound centrally distributed weight gain over3 years. She had noticed a rounding and redness of her face， hirsutism on her cheeks and upper lip， and acne on her arms. She had marked weakness in her legs when going up stairs. Recently， she was diagnosed with mild hyperglycemia and placed on metformin. Elevated blood pressure readings were noted on her last few blood pressure checks. She had also developed secondary amenorrhea. As a registered nurse， she raised the possibility of CS to explain her signs and symptoms. Her medica-tions included metformin 500 mg twice daily and ranitidine 150 mg daily. Amlodipine and metoprolol were added to treat her hypertension.

She had spontaneous hypokalemia. The cortisol con-centrations in the blood and urine were diagnostic of severe hypercortisolism. The serum concentration of ACTH was markedly elevated.

The glucocorticoid taper to 15mg of hydrocortisone every morning and monitoring the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis recovery with the periodic measurement of morning serum cortisol is the standard approach at Mayo Clinic.4 The cosyntro-pin stimulation test is an unnecessary expense in this setting， it only informs the clinician about adrenal function and not what is needed， which is assessment of hypothalamic and pituitary recovery.\n\n【14】At 1 year after surgery she had lost 49 pounds of body weight， and 24-hour UFC was normal. She was informed of the approximately 25% risk of recurrent CS over time. Subsequent 24-hour UFC measurements were 14， 21， and 18 mcg (normal， <45 mcg) at 2，3， and 4 years after surgery. In a large series of 215patients who underwent transsphenoidal surgery for CS， surgical remission was achieved in 85.6%.5 Actuar-ial recurrence rates of CS after initially successful trans-sphenoidal surgery at 1， 2，3， and 5 years were 0.5%，6.7%， 10.8%， and 25.5%， respectively.

The patient is presenting with congenital extrahepatic biliary atresia. Descriptions of a pure elevation in direct (conjugated) bilirubin strongly suggest an obstructive etiology, as the liver is able to effectively conjugate bilirubin but fails to excrete it into the small intestine. The absence of bilirubin in the small bowel results in acholic stools, whereas increased renal excretion of conjugated bilirubin causes a darkening of the urine. Congenital extrahepatic biliary atresia occurs when the developing bile ducts close completely and fail to recanalize. Surgical therapy of biliary atresia involves anastomosis of the small bowel directly to intrahepatic bile ducts, a maneuver known as Kasai’s procedure, which is appropriate for the 10% of patients with limited disease. Liver transplantation continues to be the best chance of survival for the remaining patients.  \nAnswer A is incorrect. Gilbert syndrome is a benign disorder caused by a mutation in the promoter region of uridine 5’-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase, leading to diminished expression of the gene. Patients with Gilbert syndrome develop a mild unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia but usually are asymptomatic and have a normal life expectancy.  \nAnswer B is incorrect. Crigler-Najjar syndrome type 1 is caused by a complete deficiency in uridine 5’-diphosphoglucuronosyl-transferase, the hepatic enzyme necessary to conjugate bilirubin. This disorder produces a severe unconjugated (indirect) hyperbilirubinemia that causes death within the first few years of life. The patient in this case, however, has a conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, suggesting an obstructive cause and ruling out Crigler-Najjar syndrome.  \nAnswer C is incorrect. Physiologic jaundice refers to the mild unconjugated (indirect) hyperbilirubinemia that affects nearly all newborns because of the greater turnover of neonatal RBCs and the decreased bilirubin clearance in the first few weeks of life. The peak total serum bilirubin occurs between 72 and 96 hours of age and resolves within the first few weeks of life. Often phototherapy is used to hasten resolution. This patient has a severe conjugated hyperbilirubinemia that cannot be explained by normal neonatal physiologic jaundice.  \nAnswer D is incorrect. Biliary atresia is a rare condition whose cause is not entirely known; it is not inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. Hereditary spherocytosis is an example of an autosomal dominant condition that can cause jaundice and hyperbilirubinemia secondary to hemolytic anemia. This autosomal dominant condition is due to mutations in spectrin or ankyrin causing RBC membrane defects that make the cells more fragile to hemolysis. Peripheral blood smears show small RBCs without central pallor, and diagnosis can be confirmed with the osmotic fragility test. Unlike this case, hereditary spherocytosis usually presents later in life, with a mixed hyperbilirubinemia and normal stools.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Maintain a respectful alliance in working with a patient with paranoid person-ality disorder. 删除34：<u>(EPA 4，12)</u>\n\n【16】Considerations\n\n【17】The presentation in the case vignette is probably one of the most common for these patients， who do not normally seek out mental health treatment.Although pervasive paranoia and suspiciousness characterize this patient， the absence of any true paranoid delusions or hallucinations make a true psychotic disorder unlikely. The psychiatrist should take a low-key approach and not try to over-compensate by making friends with the patient. Clear， straightforward answers to all questions should be provided， along with explaining everything that is done or recommended. When challenged with some kind of paranoid ideation(such as the patient's response to the pager going off)， the psychiatrist should provide clear， direct reality testing (eg，\"I’m sorry the pager went off. I did not prearrange for it to go off. I will defer answering it until after we are finished talking.).\n\n【18】APPROACHTO：\n\n【19】DEFINITIONS\n\n【20】DELUSIONS： Fixed， false beliefs about the world that cannot be corrected with reasoning， education， or information.\n\n【21】HALLUCINATIONS： False sensory perceptions not associated with any real sensory stimulus. Hallucinations can occur in all five senses (gustatory， olfactory， auditory， visual， and tactile).\n\n【22】IDEAS OF REFERENCE： A person's false beliefs that people are talking about him or her.\n\n【23】PARANOID IDEATION： Suspiciousness that is less than delusional in nature.\n\n【24】WORKING ALLIANCE： A therapeutic relationship formed between patients and their clinicians that allows them to interact in a constructive manner.\n\n【25】CLINICAL APPROACH\n\n【26】Diagnosis and Clinical Presentation\n\n【27】Patients with paranoid personality disorder have a pervasive tendency to inter-pret the actions of others as being demeaning or deliberately harmful. These patients are often preoccupied with questioning the loyalty or trustworthiness of friends， even when this is unjustified. Patients are unforgiving of mistakes or slights， and they hold grudges. They believe that the motives of others are malevolent， and they are quick to react to defend their characters. These counter-attacks are almost always angry and hostile. As in all personality disorders， these symptoms cannot occur exclusively during the course of1e another psychi- atric illness such as schizophrenia， or occur due to another medical condition or the use of a substance.\n\n【28】Differential Diagnosis\n\n【29】Patients with paranoid personality disorder can be differentiated from those with schizophrenia because they do not have frank psychotic symptoms， such as delu-sions and hallucinations， or a formal thought disorder. They can be differentiated from those with a delusional disorder by the absence of fixed delusions， as the paranoia of patients with a personality disorder never reaches delusional propor-tions. Although one might consider the possibility of borderline personality disor-der (BPD) in a patient who displays angry outbursts toward others， patients with paranoid personality disorder typically do not have other features seen in patients with BPD， such as mood instability， dichotomous (\"black-and-white\") thinking， self-harm， involvement in many short-lived， tumultuous relationships， or chronic feelings of emptiness.\n\n【30】Ireatment\n\n【31】Patients with paranoid personality disorder can become even more suspicious when a clinician tries to become too friendly or close because they wonder about the motives behind this behavior. Therefore， be honest and respectful toward the patient， but use a low-key approach. Acknowledge any mistakes made and expect to explain procedures in detail. Use reality testing where necessary. For example，“No， Mr. Jones， I did not arrange to have my pager go off in the middle of our meeting. Someone from the outside simply needed to speak with me， and therefore my secretary paged me. Symptoms should be treated accordingly. For example， paranoid delusions should be treated with antipsychotic drugs. Patients exhibiting dangerous behavior to themselves or others should be hospitalized. Psychotherapy can improve insight and can help those patients who already have some insight manage their chronic symptoms when symptoms are not eliminated by antipsy-chotic medications.\n删除16：<u>CASE CORRELATION\n删除26：<u>。</u> See also Case 6 (Schizophrenia) and Case 8 (Bipolar Disorder \\[Child\\]).\n</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Children who are unable to cooperate represent just such an indication. The safest way to care for this child is to provide a general anesthetic using an ETT and an MRI-compatible machine. The child is kept NPO for a suitable period depending on his age， and standard monitors are applied (BP， pulse oximetry， capnography， ECG， and temperature) and must be compatible with the MRI environment. The MRI room is usually cold， but the scanner itself produces heat， so hypothermia is generally not as problematic as in the operating room.\n\n【13】ERCP is a fairly invasive and painfulprocedure usually performed under generalanesthesia.

Preoperative assessment of neck sideway range of motion is important in anticipation of this positioning.\n\n【14】ECTs are performed in a wide variety of patients using general anesthesia with mask ventilation. Since antidepressant drugs may have some synergies with anesthetic drugs， doses are minimized and reduced on subsequent treat-ments if possible.\n\n【15】Cases Outside the Operating Room\n\n【16】Providing anesthesia outside the operating room suite is challenging for many reasons. The equipment to perform the anesthetic and treat complications must be anticipated， and transported to the distant site. Generally， each insti-tution will set up equipment carts to accomplish this task efficiently. These carts have limited capacity， however， so compromises are made and one doesn't have all the equipment necessary to deal with any and all potential anesthetic scenarios.\n\n【17】Another challenge is the remote location away from other anesthesia per-sonnel. In an emergency situation having help and equipment is important， so it is easy to see the challenge when those resources are not available. Also， the personnel at the locations away from the operating room may not be familiar with anesthesia services. There may be limited room for equipment in the procedure room and there may be limited understanding of the sequence and timing of events during anesthesia delivery. Communication can help bridging this disconnect， but in the emergency situation the anes-thesia provider can be left feeling very much alone.\n\n【18】The MRI Scanner\n\n【19】The magnet in an MRI scanner is a remarkably powerful device. All equip-ment inside the room housing the MRI must be nonmagnetic (this includes implants within the patient). Stories of intubating stylets hurling as projec-tiles across the room， or even a metal anesthesia cart with a resident holding on to it are not unheard of. (The resident’s nose was broken， the cart had minor damage， but the MRI was out of service for several months). A second consideration is that the scanner is a long narrow tube. The patient’s airway is inaccessible inside the scanner. Moreover， sudden patient movement can result in injury to the patient.\nThe anesthetic procedure is dictated largely by the availability (or lack of) equipment compatible with the MRI within a given institution. If the anes-thesia machine is not MRI compatible， then it must remain outside the scan-ner and long breathing circuit tubing will be needed to connect the patient to the machine. First， a choice must be made as to whether to induce the patient on a stretcher outside the MRI room and transfer him/her into the MRI machine while anesthetized， or whether MRI-compatible equipment is available which can allow induction with the patient lying on the MRI. Most institutions currently have devices capable of measuring blood pressure， ECG(including ECG patches)， and pulse oximetry probes and devices that are 删除换行5 MRI compatible. However， the pulse oximetry devices used in the operating room interfere with the imaging process， and the imaging process interferes with the pulse oximetry.\n\n【20】Securing the airway in the MRI scanner must be done with MRI-compat-ible laryngoscopes or the patient has to be outside the MRI scanner for intu-bation. Some institutions have anesthesia machines that are MRI compatible. The presence or absence of an MRI-compatible anesthesia machine is partic-ularly important with respect to ventilatory dead space. Some centers have MRI-compatible machines and therefore the circle system dead space is iden-tical to that in the operating room. However， if there is no MRI-compatible machine， then the anesthesia machine is placed outside the MRI scanner. Dead space ventilation is the space occurring beyond the y-piece of a circle system， so the extensive tubing required to reach from outside to inside the scanner increases dead space ventilation and leads to inaccurate tidal volume measurements. Most Ambu bags are MRI compatible， however don’t forget to have long enough oxygen tubing to reach an oxygen source (which could be an oxygen E-cylinder located outside the MRI) if providing positive pressure breaths inside the scanner. If relying on spontaneous ventilation， there must be some assessment of adequacy of ventilation (ET CO， monitoring) as well as a plan for positive pressure ventilation if that becomes necessary.\n\n【21】The issue of an MRI-compatible machine is a particular issue when taking care of a child with a small tidal volume. Because the child's tidal volume is small， any inaccuracies in its measurement represent a larger percentage of the child's tidal volume. Another option is to use Mapleson circuits (provided the circuit has no magnetic metal) or to provide oxygen by cannula or mask and have the patient spontaneously ventilate.\n\n【22】The GI Suite\n\n【23】Anesthesia services are most often requested in the GI suite because of patient intolerance to sedation， extensive comorbid diseases， or an anticipated painful or longERCP. General anesthesia is most often performed for ERCP using standard monitors. The patient may be prone or supine， depending on the preferences of the gastroenterologist. The prone position involves turning the patient after induction as well as turning the patient’s head to one side to allow entry of the endoscope. Preoperative assessment of neck sideway range of motion is important in anticipation of this positioning. The placement and removal of the endoscope can also dislodge the ETT， so careful observation and monitoring for continued ventilation is imperative. An ERCP produces only minor postoperative pain in comparison to other surgeries (if sphinctero-tomy is performed at the sphincter of Oddi then expect more pain). However， the gas insufflation will often lead to bloating and discomfort post procedure despite the gastroenterologist's attempts to decompress the stomach. At the conclusion of the procedure， the prone patient is turned supine and then ETT removed when extubation criteria are met.\n\n【24】Anesthesia for Electroconvulsive Therapy\n\n【25】ECTs are performed under general anesthesia with ventilation by mask. Premedication is limited to an antisialagogue (glycopyrrolate)， atropine，anal-gesics， or antihypertesives if appropriate. Caffeine is sometimes administered as a premed to promote longer seizure duration. Benzodiazepines are avoided， because they raise the seizure threshold. If the patient is on chronic benzodi-azepines， then flumazenil may be requested by the psychiatrist to reverse their effects (with the caveat that a benzodiazepine will be given before emergence to prevent excessive patient anxiety). The patient is positioned on the proce-dure table with standard monitors and an extra BP cuff on the arm opposite the intravenous or on the leg. Sometimes the procedure is performed in the patient's stretcher.\n\n【26】After preoxygenation， anesthesia is induced with methohexital. The dose of methohexital is titrated so that unconsciousness is attained at the lowest possible dose so as to minimize any elevation of seizure threshold. The dose is often determined by that administered at the previous ECT treatment， or it is reduced if at all possible. Once the patient is unrespon-sive， the BP cuff on the arm or leg is inflated to a sustained pressure to cut off blood flow and prevent muscle relaxant from paralyzing that limb. A bite block is placed to protect the patient's teeth and the patient is hyperventi-lated to lower the seizure threshold. Succinylcholine is given and twitches monitored. Once there are no twitches an electrical stimulus is applied to the head and a seizure ensues.\n\n【27】The peripheral seizure activity is monitored in the leg with the BP cuff and the central seizure is monitored by EEG strip on the ECT machine. The initial tonic phase of the seizure is accompanied by a parasympathetic surge that usually manifests as bradycardia. The clonic phase follows shortly thereafter. It is conversely accompanied by a sympathetic surge resulting in tachycardia and hypertension. Pharmacologic treatment of these two phases can be employed depending on the comorbidities of the patient. Since the parasympathetic surge is very brief， treatment generally focuses on lessening the sympathetic surge by beta blockers or i.v. antihy-pertensives.\n\n【28】Once the seizure activity has abated， the patient's airway is supported until emergence. Analgesics are sometimes given to lessen any myalgias associated with succinlycholine-induced fasciculations. Once the patient is awake and supporting their airway they are transported to recovery.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Material is brought into the cell inside membrane-bound endocytic vesicles that are formed from the phospholipid bilayer of the cell’s plasma membrane (PM). Imagine the PM as the surface of a balloon. Pushing a finger into the balloon’s surface will cause the membrane to bend forming an indentation or pit. But a membrane, like a balloon, cannot change shape without force being applied. Peripheral membrane proteins present on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane are thought to produce the force necessary for inward bending of the PM.\n\n【4】Clathrin is one of the proteins involved in the process of endocytosis. A molecule of clathrin is made up of six proteins: three heavy-chain proteins and three light-chain proteins. The quaternary structure of clathrin is described as a triskelion with each of the heavy-chain proteins projecting out from a central hub. Multiple clathrin triskelions can self-assemble to form a complex honeycomb-like structure or coated pit on the surface of the PM. Clathrin-coated pits are associated with initial bending of the membrane; however, the assembly of clathrin at the surface of the PM requires the function of an additional set of proteins known as AP s.\n\n【5】AP2 functions in the formation of clathrin-coated pits during endocytosis in a wide range of cell types. AP2 forms a bridge between the inner leaf of the PM and clathrin through its ability to bind to phosphatidylinositol phospholipids. Other proteins associated with clathrin coat formation include epsin , AP-180 , synaptojanin , amphiphysin , intersectin , endophilin , auxilin , and syndapin . Each of these proteins is composed of a series of folding domains that regulate protein:protein or protein:lipid binding. The number and variety of proteins involved in the formation of a coated pit make it difficult to know precisely which proteins are necessary to induce a change in the shape of the membrane.\n\n【6】Endocytic vesicles are formed when clathrin-coated pits deepen, becoming structures known as buds . The GTPase protein dynamin then triggers separation of the buds from the rest of the PM, forming clathrin-coated vesicles. In a final step, the uncoating proteins auxilin and Hsc70 catalyze removal of the clathrin coat using the energy released through hydrolysis of ATP.\n\n【7】▪ Review/research the different forms of endocytosis.

Cell-free systems allow researchers to investigate biological reactions in vitro or outside the cell. The underlying assumption in these types of studies is that biological molecules will behave in an identical manner whether they are in a cell or in a test tube. A cell-free system gives a researcher control over the individual components present in a reaction. Variables such as time, temperature, and concentration are all defined by the experimental protocol. Genetically engineered or recombinant proteins can be used in place of the normal or wild-type proteins. If a cellular process can be replicated under the artificial conditions of a cell-free system, then it can be concluded that the combination of variables used in that experiment mimic the minimal conditions required for that process to occur inside a living cell.\n\n【14】In this work, the researchers developed a cell-free system that combined liposomes and proteins to model the formation of clathrin-coated buds and vesicles. Liposomes are vesicle-like structures made up of a phospholipid bilayer membrane. The mixture of phospholipids used to construct the liposomes determines the composition of the bilayer. For some of the experiments shown later, the researchers included the chemically modified phospholipid, Ni <sup>2+ </sup> \\-NTA-DOGS . In addition to clathrin, a genetically modified form of the AP epsin (H <sub>6 </sub> \\-∆ENTH-epsin通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>144–157 </sup></u> ) was included in the assays. This form of epsin is lacking the ENTH phospholipid-binding domain normally found in the protein. In its place, this epsin protein was engineered to include a His tag . His tags are a sequence of multiple (typically six to nine) histidine amino acids that are added to a recombinant protein. Histidine can bind to metal ions such as nickel (Ni), cobalt, or copper. The goal of these experiments was to determine the minimal conditions required to trigger clathrin-coated bud and vesicle formation through bending of the liposome membrane.\n\n【15】▪ Explain why it would be necessary to include an AP in this assay.\n\n【16】▪ How does the adaptor H <sub>6 </sub> \\-∆ENTH-epsin通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>144–157 </sup></u> bind to the liposome membrane if it is lacking the ENTH phospholipid-binding domain?\n\n【17】▪ Suggest a reason the researchers felt it was necessary to remove the membrane-binding domain of epsin.\n\n【18】Methods\n-------\n\n【19】### Cell-free system for clathrin binding\n\n【20】Phospholipids isolated from pig brain were resuspended by shaking in a buffer solution to form liposomes. For some binding experiments a chemically modified lipid Ni <sup>2+ </sup> \\-NTA-DOGS was included in the phospholipid mixture.

The sample was allowed to sit for 1 min and then was fixed using 3% glutaraldehyde and stained with 2% uranyl acetate. A heavy-metal stain surrounds the sample and provides contrast with the surface of the liposomes. Alternatively, liposome pellets were fixed and processed for plastic embedding and sectioning.

The neonate described above is suffering from Potter syndrome, a constellation of abnormalities including flattened facies, large and low-set ears, and limb deformities. The hallmark of this syndrome, however, is that these fetuses have bilateral renal agenesis, which is incompatible with life. As a result of bilateral renal agenesis, the fetus cannot urinate. This results in oligohydramnios. Another very common cause of oligohydramnios is chronic uteroplacental insufficiency (UPI). In cases of UPI, oligohydramnios occurs, because the fetus does not receive the proper nutrients or blood volume to maintain an adequate glomerular filtration rate. As a result, the fetus does not make urine and oligohydramnios develops.  \nAnswer A is incorrect . Anencephaly is a common neural tube defect. It is defined as partial or complete absence of the fetal brain or cranial vault. This condition is lethal, and most fetuses are stillborn. It can be diagnosed using ultrasound to identify the neural tube defect. Polyhydramnios also is commonly found in anencephaly, because the fetus is unable to swallow amniotic fluid.  \nAnswer C is incorrect . Duodenal atresia would lead to polyhydramnios. Polyhydramnios refers to excessive amounts of amniotic fluid. Conditions that cause polyhydramnios include fetal malformations that impair swallowing such as esophageal atresia and anencephaly. Polyhydramnios can be diagnosed with ultrasound imaging, but determining the etiology may require additional clinical workup. This condition is not associated with bilateral renal agenesis, which would prevent the fetus from urinating and result in oligohydramnios.  \nAnswer D is incorrect . Maternal diabetes has been associated with polyhydramnios. The pathophysiology behind this phenomenon is that increased serum glucose in the mother is transmitted to the fetus. Just as in any other diabetic patient, increased blood glucose acts as an osmotic diuretic, causing an increased production of urine. Any cause of increased urination in the fetus will lead to polyhydramnios.  \nAnswer E is incorrect . Trisomy 18, or Edwards syndrome, also can present with facial deformities such as low-set ears and limb deformities such as clenched hands. It is, however, not associated with a flattened facies. Instead, the pathognomonic features of this syndrome are micrognathia and a prominent occiput, along with the aforementioned anomalies in the ears and limbs. Edwards syndrome is the most common trisomy resulting in live birth after Down syndrome, and has not been associated with oligohydramnios in utero.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

The history and macrocytosis would suggest this is of alcoholic aetiology, but it is  删除换行1 important to ultrasound the abdomen to exclude gallstones as the cause. The pain is typically  删除换行1 severe and radiates through to the back, due to the retroperitoneal position of the pancreas.\nVomiting is also a common feature, as a result of gastric stasis caused by the local inflammation. The severity of the attack has no relation to the rise in serum amylase. Twenty per cent  删除换行1 of cases of pancreatitis have a normal serum amylase, particularly when there is an alcoholic  删除换行1 aetiology.\n\n【33】It is important to exclude a perforated peptic ulcer in this patient by requesting an erect chest  删除换行1 x-ray, which would show free subphrenic air in 90 per cent of cases. The serum amylase can  删除换行1 be elevated in a patient with gastric perforation due to the systemic absorption of pancreatic  删除换行1 enzymes from the abdominal cavity. An amylase rise of over 1000IU/dL, however, is usually  删除换行1 diagnostic of acute pancreatitis.\n\n【34】Ranson’s criteria are used to grade the severity of alcoholic pancreatitis, but it takes 48h  删除换行1 before the score can be used.

His mother describes the vomit as ‘shooting out’. He has a  删除换行1 good appetite but has lost 300 g, since he was last weighed a week earlier. He has mild constipation. The family have recently returned from Spain. There is no vomiting in any other  删除换行1 members of the family. His sister suffers from vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) and urinary tract  删除换行1 infections.\n\n【3】Examination\n\n【4】Tom is apyrexial and mildly dehydrated.

This condition presents between 2 weeks and 4 months of age (median 6 weeks) 删除换行1 and projectile vomiting is typical. The vomitus is never bile-stained as the obstruction is  删除换行1 proximal to the duodenum. As with Tom, infants may also be constipated. The hypochloraemic  删除换行1 alkalosis is characteristic and is due to vomiting hydrochloric acid (HCl). The low potassium  删除换行1 is due to the kidneys retaining hydrogen ions in favour of potassium ions. The raised urea and  删除换行1 creatinine suggest that there is also mild dehydration. The male-to-female ratio is 4:1 and occasionally there is a family history (multifactorial inheritance).\n删除26：<u>!</u> Differential diagnosis\n\n【27】• Gastro-oesophageal reflux\n\n【28】• Gastritis\n\n【29】• Urinary tract infection\n\n【30】• Overfeeding\n\n【31】Gastro-oesophageal reflux usually presents from or shortly after birth. Gastritis usually  删除换行1 occurs with an enteritis and diarrhoea. A urinary tract infection at this age may present in a  删除换行1 very non-specific way and it is therefore mandatory to test the urine. The absence of nitrites  删除换行1 and leucocytes in the urine dipstick makes a urinary infection very unlikely. Overfeeding  删除换行1 can be elucidated from a careful history.\n\n【32】The diagnosis in Tom could be clinically confirmed by carrying out a test feed. A feed leads  删除换行1 to peristalsis, which occurs from left to right. The abdominal wall is usually relaxed during a  删除换行1 feed, making palpation easier. A pyloric mass, which is the size of a 2 cm olive, may be felt in  删除换行1 the right hypochondrium by careful palpation. An ultrasound is also usually done for further  删除换行1 confirmation.\n\n【33】Tom is slightly tachycardia (normal pulse rate <1 year, 110–160 beats/min) with a normal  删除换行1 blood pressure and capillary refill time. His urea is slightly elevated. Initial treatment consists of treating the dehydration, acid–base and electrolyte abnormalities with intravenous  删除换行1 fluids (0.9 per cent saline with 5 per cent dextrose and added KCl would be the appropriate  删除换行1 starting fluid in this infant with low sodium and potassium levels). Feeds should be stopped,  删除换行1 a nasogastric tube inserted and the stomach emptied. The definitive surgical operation is \n\n【34】Ramstedt’s pyloromyotomy.\n\n【35】Key Points\n\n【36】• The peak age of presentation of pyloric stenosis is 6 weeks.\n\n【37】• The typical biochemical picture is a hypochloraemic alkalosis.\n\n【38】• The definitive treatment is Ramstedt’s pyloromyotomy.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Uncommonly， it may have a sensory component， which is small (the nervus intermedius of Wrisberg). It conveys taste sensation from the anterior two-thirds of the tongue and， probably， cutaneous impulses from the anterior wall of the external auditory canal.\n\n【59】What do you know of nervus intermedius?\n\n【60】Nervus intermedius or pars intermedia of Wrisberg is the sensory or the parasympathetic root of the facial nerve and is lateral and inferior to the motor root. Inside the internal auditory meatus it lies between the motor root and the eighth cranial nerve. The sensory cells are located in the geniculate ganglion (at the bend of the facial nerve in the facial canal) and their nerve fibres enter the pons with the motor root. The geniculate gan-glion is continued distally as the chorda tympani， which carries taste and preganglionic parasympathetic fibres. This nerve consists of contributions from three areas：\n\n【61】●Superior salivary nucleus (in the pons) supplies secretory fibres to the glands\nGustatory or solitary nucleus (in the medulla) receives taste fibres via the chorda tympani 删除换行5 Dorsal part of the trigeminal nerve receives cutaneous sensation from the external auditory meatus and the skin behind the ear (distributed with the facial nerve proper).\n\n【62】How would you manage Bell's palsy?\n\n【63】About 50-60% of patients recover spontaneously without deficits； others have considerable improvement， and about 10% have permanent residual deficits.

Drug-induced photosensitivity due to thiazides or tetracyclines may present as irregularly shaped hyperpigmentation. Actinic lichen planus often presents on the temples and may involve the neck and intertriginous sites. Exogenous ochronosis presents with hyperpigmentation followed by progressive darkening with superimposed pigmented papules. Acquired bilateral nevus of Ota-like macules (Hori’s nevi) presents with multiple brown to gray to blue macules, primarily on the malar region. It is usually more common in Asian females 删除10：<u>(Chung 2008 )</u>.\n\n【19】Wood’s Lamp Examination\n-----------------------\n\n【20】Wood’s lamp examination (365 nm) shows accentuation or darkening of the hyperpigmented patches.\n\n【21】Histopathology\n--------------\n\n【22】Melasma is typically a clinical diagnosis; however, if a biopsy were performed, pathology would show epidermal melanin in basal and suprabasal keratinocytes. The number of melanocytes is not increased; however, the melanocytes that are present are larger, more dendritic, and more active. Inflammation is typically absent 删除10：<u>(Chung 2008 )</u>.\n\n【23】Diagnosis\n---------\n\n【24】Epidermal melasma\n\n【25】Case Treatment\n--------------\n\n【26】The likely etiology of melasma, including her oral contraceptive usage, pregnancy, and sun exposure was discussed. A triple combination compound consisting of hydroquinone 6 % + tretinoin 0.025 % + fluocinolone 0.01 % cream was started every other night to the dark areas only. The patient was recommended to increase the cream to nightly after 1 week if she had no burning or irritation. A broad spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 was recommended daily. Daily use of Polypodium leucotomos was recommended as a supplement. A 3 month follow-up was recommended. After mild improvement was seen, she was started on a series of three 35 % glycolic acid peels every 4 weeks in addition to her topical regimen.\n\n【27】Discussion\n----------\n\n【28】Melasma is a common acquired disorder of hyperpigmentation that is found mostly in Latina, Southeast Asian, and African American women with Fitzpatrick skin types III-V. Women are more prone to developing the disease than men, especially after the woman has experienced childbirth—leading to the common term, “the mask of pregnancy.” Melasma is worsened by excess exposure to the sun; therefore, it is more common in those living in areas with intense ultraviolet radiation exposure 删除10：<u>(Sheth and Pandya 2011a )</u>. A recent multicenter survey from nine countries found that 41 % of women had onset of the disorder after pregnancy but before menopause. Only 8 % noted spontaneous remission, and 25 % had onset after starting their contraceptive 删除10：<u>(Ortonne et al. 2009 )</u>.\n\n【29】The exact cause of melasma is unknown. The high incidence among family members suggest a genetic component, and various surveys from around the world report 10–70 % of family members being involved 删除10：<u>(Ortonne et al. 2009 )</u>. Sun exposure is likely an exacerbating factor because of the ultraviolet induced upregulation of melanocyte proliferation, migration, and melanogenesis 删除10：<u>(Sheth and Pandya 2011a )</u>. While melasma is known to occur with hormonal changes, clinical evidence to date does not clearly associate serum hormone levels to melasma. Perez et al examined the link between circulating hormones and found that nulligravid women with melasma had significantly higher serum levels of luteinizing hormone and lower levels of estradiol than their counterpart controls, though further research is needed 删除10：<u>(Perez et al. 1983 )</u>. Several studies have noted the onset of melasma with oral contraceptive use and pregnancy. Therefore, it is recommended that patients who develop melasma while taking an oral contraceptive should stop the medication and avoid future use of such drugs when possible 删除10：<u>(Sheth and Pandya 2011a )</u>. However, stopping the culprit oral contraceptive will not necessarily reverse melasma. Some studies have suggested that mild abnormalities in thyroid function are associated with oral contraceptive or pregnancy related melasma; therefore, it is reasonable to consider checking thyroid function tests in melasma patients 删除10：<u>(Lutfi et al. 1985 )</u>.\n\n【30】Melasma presents as symmetrically distributed hyperpigmented macules that coalesce into reticular patches. There are three distribution patterns. Centrofacial melasma, the most common pattern, involves the forehead, cheeks, upper lip, nose, and chin 删除33：<u></u>. The malar pattern is limited to the cheeks and the nose 删除33：<u></u>, and the mandibular pattern is specific to the jawline. Histologically, melasma may be divided into three subtypes. In epidermal melasma, melanin is increased in the epidermis, and patients present with tan to brown hyperpigmentation. In dermal melasma, melanin is found in superficial and mid dermal macrophages, which often congregate around small, dilated vessels, and patients present with a bluish discoloration 删除33：<u></u>. Dermal melasma is typically harder to treat. In mixed melasma, melanin is found in both the epidermis and the dermis. In most cases, the number of melanocytes is not increased, yet the melanocytes that are present are larger, more dendritic, and more active. Inflammation is sparse or absent 删除10：<u>(Kang et al. 2002 )</u>.\n\n【31】删除3：<u>Figure 14.2\n\n【32】Malar melasma. Brown, reticular patches are noted on the medial cheeks and nose</u>\n\n【33】删除3：<u>Figure 14.3\n\n【34】Dermal melasma. Brown-bluish discoloration is noted on the bilateral malar cheeks</u>\n\n【35】The excess melanin can be visually localized to the epidermis or the dermis by use of a Wood’s lamp. Epidermal pigment is enhanced during examination with a Wood’s light, whereas, dermal pigment is not. Lesions that have both enhancing and nonenhancing areas have a mixed pattern.\n\n【36】Treatment\n---------\n\n【37】Melasma is often difficult to treat and has a significant negative impact on patients’ quality of life. The ultimate goal of melasma management is to lighten the affected area enough so that it is even with the rest of the skin. This can be difficult when treating patients with skin of color.\n\n【38】First line therapy involves topical compounds that affect the pigment production pathway. Topical hydroquinone is the most common topical treatment used for melasma. Hydroquinone is a tyrosinase inhibitor, which primarily leads to decreased melanin production, along with altered melanosome formation and increased melanosome destruction 删除10：<u>(Jimbow et al. 1974 )</u>. Ennes et al found that 38 % of patients treated with 4 % hydroquinone cream once daily for 12 weeks had a complete clinical response compared to only 8 % in the placebo group 删除10：<u>(Ennes et al. 2000 )</u>. There is some controversy over the use of hydroquinone. Although rare in the United States, there have been several reports of exogenous ochronosis, a bluish-gray discoloration, after the use of hydroquinone cream, especially in South African blacks 删除10：<u>(Sheth and Pandya 2011b )</u>. One explanation for the high incidence in South Africans is that patients outside of the United States have uncontrolled access to over the counter high concentrations of hydroquinone 删除10：<u>(Olumide et al. 2008 )</u>, often mixed with topical steroids, and used for long periods of time\n\n【39】Topical tretinoin cream is also an effective treatment, but often causes irritation and usually requires months to show improvement as monotherapy. The combination of hydroquinone, a retinoid, and a topical steroid appear to be highly effective for the treatment of melasma, with the Kligman-Willis Formula – 5 % hydroquinone, 0.1 % tretinoin, 0.1 % dexamethasone, and a hydrophilic ointment being the originally studied combination 删除10：<u>(Kligman and Willis 1975 )</u>. The theory behind the effectiveness is that tretinoin prevents the oxidation of hydroquinone and improves epidermal penetration while the steroid reduces the irritation side effect of both. Side effects include erythema, desquamation, burning, and pruritus. Because irritation may lead to post inflammatory hyperpigmentation in patients with darker skin types, there are other topical agents that are available. These include azelaic acid, kojic acid, and ascorbic acid (vitamin C), all which may be less efficacious than hydroquinone but typically have less irritation.\n\n【40】Because ultraviolet and visible light can induce melanin formation, regular use of a broad spectrum sunscreen is effective both in preventing melasma and in enhancing the efficacy of other topical therapies once melasma has developed. It is recommended that all patients with melasma use a UVA and UVB protective sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30 preferentially with a physical blocker, such as titanium dioxide or zinc oxide. Patients should also wear wide brimmed hats and protective clothing when outdoors. Many patients also use camouflage make-ups, with the most common brands being Dermablend (Vichy Laboratories, Paris, France), Covermark/CM Beauty (CM Beauty, Northvale, NJ), and Cover FX (Cover FX, Skin Care, Toronto, Ontario, Canada) 删除10：<u>(Sheth and Pandya 2011b )</u>.\n\n【41】Chemical peels can also improve melasma by removing unwanted melanin. However, they must be used with caution in skin of color, as they can cause irritation which can lead to postinflammatory hyperpigmentation. Glycolic acid peels are alpha hydroxyl acids that lead to epidermal remodeling, accelerated desquamation and pigment dispersion, along with inhibition of tyrosinase. When used in combination with a modified Kligman-Willis formula (5 % hydroquinone + 0.05 % tretinoin + 1 % hydrocortisone acetate), there was a decrease in the melasma area and severity index (MASI) by 79.9 % 删除10：<u>(Sarkar et al. 2002 )</u>. Salicylic acid peels, which are beta hydroxyl acids, have also been used for melasma, especially in Fitzpatrick skin types V and VI 删除10：<u>(Grimes 1999 )</u>.\n\n【42】The use of lasers have inconsistent results and is challenging because damage to surrounding tissue and subsequent inflammation can lead to postinflammatory hyperpigmentation. Fractional resurfacing is the only laser approved by the FDA for treatment of melasma. The microthermal zones of injury limit the area of skin that is damaged with each treatment, which may decrease the risk of postinflammatory hyperpigmentation. Studies have been limited to Fitzpatrick skin types III-IV 删除10：<u>(Rokhsar and Fitzpatrick 2005 ; Goldberg et al. 2008 )</u>. Q-switched Nd:YAG lasers appear to have an increased risk of hyperpigmentation and a very high rate of relapse following treatment. Intense pulsed light therapy has been shown to be effective in improving melasma but is also characterized by a high relapse rate. In general, laser and light therapies show the best response in lighter-skinned individuals and should be used very carefully, particularly in dark-skinned patients 删除10：<u>(Rivas and Pandya 2013 )</u>. The use of lasers for melasma should be restricted to cases unresponsive to topical therapy or chemical peels. Appropriate maintenance therapy should be selected to avoid relapse 删除10：<u>(Arora et al. 2012 )</u>.\n\n【43】Recently, orally administered Polypodium leucotomos has been shown to be beneficial for the prevention and potential treatment of several aesthetically relevant conditions, including melasma, due to the presence of its antioxidant and photoprotective properties. In a randomized, placebo-controlled study by Ahmed et al, the oral administration of Polypodium leucotomos as an adjunct to sunscreen improved the severity of melasma in women after 12 weeks. No adverse events have been associated with the use of Polypodium leucotomos. Therefore, Polypodium leucotomos appears to provide adjunctive benefits in treating melasma; however, more data with larger sample sizes are needed 删除10：<u>(Ahmed et al. 2013 )</u>.\n\n【44】Key Points\n\n【45】   Melasma is worsened by exposure to ultraviolet radiation, oral contraceptives, and pregnancy.\n   Regular use of a broad spectrum sunscreen is effective both in preventing melasma and in enhancing the efficacy of other topical therapies once melasma has developed.\n   First line therapy involves topical compounds that affect the pigment production pathway, including hydroquinone and tretinoin.\n   In general, laser and light therapies show the best response in lighter-skinned individuals and should be used carefully in dark-skinned patients.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

EXSTROPHY OF THE BLADDER)\n\n【2】This is a congenital abnormality in which there is  删除换行1 incomplete development or absence of the infraumbilical 删除换行1 part of the anterior abdominal wall, associated with  删除换行1 incomplete development of the anterior wall of the bladder.\n\n【3】Incidence. -\n\n【4】Obviously ectopia vesicae is rare and its incidence is once  删除换行1 in 50,000 births.\n\n【5】Types.—\n\n【6】Two types are commonly encountered with — complete  删除换行1 and incomplete varieties. The complete variety is more  删除换行1 common.\n\n【7】In incomplete variety the pubic bones are united and  删除换行1 the external genitalia are almost normal.\n\n【8】Clinical lectures.—-\n\n【9】1. Males are more often affected than females. The ratio  删除换行1 is 4 : 1.\n\n【10】2. Due to pressure of the viscera behind it, the posterior  删除换行1 wall of the bladder protrudes through the defect. This is  删除换行1 deep red in colour. Frequently the everted mucous membrane  删除换行1 becomes ulcerated and painful. It may undergo metaplastic  删除换行1 changes and form adenocarcinoma.\n\n【11】3. It bleeds readily.\n\n【12】4. When this mucous membrane is gently pulled  删除换行1 upwards, more pale, wet trigone becomes visible. Effluxes of  删除换行1 urine can be seen from the ureteric orifices.\n\n【13】5. A line of demarcation becomes obvious between the  删除换行1 protruding mucous membrane and the adjacent skin.\n\n【14】6. When the exposed bladder wall is pushed behind with  删除换行1 the fingers the firm edge beneath the mucocutaneous  删除换行1 junction can be felt as the defect in the abdominal wall.\n\n【15】7. The rami of the pubic bones are widely separated, but  删除换行1 are connected with strong ligaments. The pelvic ring thus  删除换行1 lacks rigidity, the femurs are rotated externally and the child  删除换行1 ‘waddles like a duck’.\n\n【16】8. Epispadias is almost always accompanied with it.\n\n【17】9. Associated abnormalities are :\n\n【18】(i) Usually the umbilicus is absent.\n\n【19】(ii) There may be umbilical hernia.\n\n【20】(iii) There may be inguinal hernia of one side or both  删除换行1 sides. Bilateral herniae may be associated with undescended  删除换行1 testes when sex differentiation becomes difficult.\n\n【21】(iv) Rectal sphincter is often lax.\n\n【22】(v) The penis is broader and shorter than normal.\n\n【23】(vi) The prostate and seminal vesicles are often  删除换行1 rudimentary or absent.\n\n【24】(vii) The testes are normal and are normally descended  删除换行1 in majortity of cases.\n\n【25】(viii) In females the clitoris is cleft and the labia minora  删除换行1 are separated.\n\n【26】(ix) The linea alba is wide in the same proportion as  删除换行1 the separation of the pubic bones.\n\n【27】(x) Recurrent attacks of ascending infection makes the 删除换行1 patient's life miserable. About half the patients die of renal  删除换行1 failure before 30 years of age.\n\n【28】(a) The exposed vesical mucous membrane is usually  删除换行1 ulcerated and becomes painful.\n\n【29】(b) Continuous bad odour of urine accompanies the  删除换行1 patient.\n\n【30】(c) Recurrent ascending infection makes the patient's life  删除换行1 miserable and it is difficult to control such infection.\nHydronephrosis is sometimes come across caused by  删除换行1 ureterovesical obstruction which is revealed on urography.\n\n【31】(d) Metaplastic change may take place at the exposed  删除换行1 mucous membrane of the urinary bladder and it may be the  删除换行1 ultimate site of an adenocarcinoma.\n\n【32】(e) Half of the patients die of renal failure.\n\n【33】1. Obviously the treatment is operation. First of all  删除换行1 diversion of urine has to be performed. Later on, after some  删除换行1 months the urinary bladder is excised and closure is done.\nThe operation is performed between 4 and 6 years of age. In  删除换行1 this case diversion of urine is done into the sigmoid colon.\nBut problem of infection has not made this operation very  删除换行1 successful. Stricture at the site of anastomosis (ureterosigmoidal), recurrent pyelonephritis and hyperchloraemic  删除换行1 acidosis are the reasons of ultimate death of patients.\n\n【34】2. Diversion of urine into an ileal conduit with excision  删除换行1 of the bladder can be performed at 5 years of age. As problem  删除换行1 of infection is less, renal function is better maintained and  删除换行1 this is a better operation. Urinary diversion and resection of  删除换行1 the bladder should be followed by repair of the epispadiac  删除换行1 penis.\n\n【35】3. Recently attempts are being made to reconstruct the  删除换行1 bladder and sphincters within first year of life. At first  删除换行1 osteotomy of both iliac bones are made just lateral to the  删除换行1 sacroiliac joints, the bladder is closed. The urethra is  删除换行1 reconstructed behind the pubis. The pubic bones are now  删除换行1 brought in the midline and fixed together. The problem of  删除换行1 incontinence is difficult to tackle. Similarly urinary infection  删除换行1 and stone formation and ultimately renal failure are also  删除换行1 difficult to control. Various operations have been suggested  删除换行1 for incontinence at bladder neck region, but overall success  删除换行1 rate is limited. Lattimer et al 通用删除7(英):<u>(1978)</u> pioneers in this field.\nTheir 17 patients with reconstructed bladders were followed  删除换行1 up for 15 years with good results. Subsequently Ansel 通用删除7(英):<u>(1979)</u> 删除换行1 and De Maria et al 通用删除7(英):<u>(1980)</u> claimed good results after bladder  删除换行1 reconstruction. Lima et al 通用删除7(英):<u>(1981)</u> reconstructed the bladder  删除换行1 with human duramater to increase the vesical capacity. They  删除换行1 recommended surgery to be performed when the patients  删除换行1 are 12 to 18 months old.\n\n【36】Mollard 通用删除7(英):<u>(1980)</u> recommended the operation as followsPENIS 255\n\n【37】— bladder closure was achieved with sacral osteotomy in  删除换行1 order to close the pelvic ring at symphysis pubis. Antiureteral  删除换行1 reflux procedure and bladder neck reconstruction were  删除换行1 performed. Finally epispadiac penis was repaired. This is  删除换行1 actually 3-stages operation. It must be remembered that  删除换行1 when the bladder is small, fibrotic and inelastic, functional  删除换行1 closure or good reconstruction becomes impossible. In this  删除换行1 case urinary diversion with cystectomy is the treatment of  删除换行1 choice.\n\n【38】PATHOLOGY\n\n【39】Phismosis is a condition in which the orifice of the prepuce  删除换行1 (foreskin) is too small to be retracted over the glans penis. In  删除换行1 children upto 6 years of age the prepuce is normally adherent  删除换行1 to the glans penis so that retraction of the prepuce may be  删除换行1 difficult. This gives a false impression of phimosis. The external  删除换行1 meatus however is clearly seen and when the prepuce is  删除换行1 separated from the glans by dividing the adhesions by means  删除换行1 of a probe, the prepuce can be retracted over the glans upto  删除换行1 the corona glandis. These cases are not typical phimosis.\n\n【40】Aetiology.—\n\n【41】1. CONGENITAL.— In these cases the preputial orifice  删除换行1 is narrow since birth. In extreme cases the preputial sac is  删除换行1 ballooned out when the patient micturates and a weak thin  删除换行1 stream of urine flows.\n\n【42】2. ACQUIRED.—\n\n【43】(a) Inflammatory.— Chronic infection from poor local  删除换行1 hygiene is a common cause. Phimosis may result from  删除换行1 scarring following long standing inflammation of the glans  删除换行1 (balanitis) or of the prepuce (posthitis) or a combination of  删除换行1 both (balano-posthitis). In diabetic older men, chronic  删除换行1 balanoposthitis may lead to phimosis. Phimosis may occur  删除换行1 later in life as a result of balanitis xerotica obliterans, a  删除换行1 condition in which the prepuce becomes thickened so as to  删除换行1 fail to retract. Sometimes calculi may develop under the  删除换行1 foreskin due to inspissated smegma and balanoposthitis.\n\n【44】(b) Traumatic.— Occasionally a vigorous trauma to the  删除换行1 prepuce may cause preputial fibrosis resulting in narrowing  删除换行1 of the opening of the prepuce. This may also follow forceful  删除换行1 stretching of the prepuce.\n\n【45】(c) Neoplastic.-— Underlying carcinoma may lead to  删除换行1 narrowing of the preputial orifice. This may often occur due  删除换行1 to squamous cell carcinoma developing under the foreskin.\nPossibility of such neoplastic cause should always be borne  删除换行1 in mind when an old patient presents with recent phimosis.\n\n【46】(d) Postoperative.— Excessive skin left after circumcision  删除换行1 can be stenotic and cause phimosis.\n\n【47】WITH SUBSEQUENT FIBROSIS\n\n【48】Age.— Congenital phimosis always presents in the first 删除换行1 few years of life. Acquired phimosis may occur at any age.\nLYMPH VESSELS\n\n【49】Difficulty in micturition is the main symptom. In a case of  删除换行1 typical congenital phimosis, the mother complains that when  删除换行1 the child passes water the prepuce balloons out and the urine  删除换行1 comes out in thin stream. There may be residual urine in  删除换行1 the bladder and back pressure effects on the ureters and  删除换行1 kidneys which is more often due to meatal atresia, which  删除换行1 may be masked by phimosis.\n\n【50】In an old case of phimosis patient may present with  删除换行1 recurrent balanitis causing oedema, erythema, pain and  删除换行1 purulent discharge coming out of the preputial orifice. This  删除换行1 condition is also seen in acquired phimosis following  删除换行1 recurrent balanoposthitis or presence of carcinoma inside  删除换行1 preputial sac.\n\n【51】Occasionally patient may present with paraphimosis when  删除换行1 the tight foreskin gets retracted and stuck behind the glans  删除换行1 penis. Patient presents with swollen glans penis as the  删除换行1 retracted foreskin is causing obstruction to the venous outflow  删除换行1 leading to oedema and congestion of the glans, which in  删除换行1 turn makes reduction of the prepuce more difficult.\n\n【52】Local examination.—\n\n【53】Diagnosis is easy. In case of adult, one should carefully  删除换行1 examine for infection of the inner side of the prepuce or  删除换行1 glans penis. One must remember to examine inside of the  删除换行1 prepuce and glans to exclude carcinoma as the cause of  删除换行1 phimosis.\n\n【54】General examination.— Abdomen should always be  删除换行1 examined to exclude any back pressure effects on the kidneys  删除换行1 and ureters.\n\n【55】Complications.—\n\n【56】(i) Balanoposthitis — which may be recurrent.\n\n【57】(ii) Preputial stone or calculus.— This may occur when  删除换行1 smegma does not get access and is retained for years to cause  删除换行1 such calculus. Smegma along with urinary salts make such  删除换行1 calculus.\n\n【58】(iii) Paraphimosis.\n\n【59】(iv) Obstruction to the flow of urine may result in residual  删除换行1 urine, hydroureter and hydronephrosis. In these cases one  删除换行1 must exclude pin-hole meatus or atresia meati which may  删除换行1 lie hidden by the phimosis.\n\n【60】(v) Carcinoma.— Phimosis itself may be an aetiological  删除换行1 factor in the development of the carcinoma of the penis.\nMuslims and Jews who practise early religious circumcision  删除换行1 are almost immune to the development of carcinoma of penis.\nIf an old man presents with phimosis, a careful examination  删除换行1 must be made to exclude a hidden carcinoma of the prepuce  删除换行1 or the glans penis beneath the preputial sac.\n\n【61】The treatment is circumcision.\n\n【62】When phimosis is associated with considerable inflammation 删除换行1 of the prepuce, a dorsal slit of the prepuce is performed to 删除换行1 improve drainage and in the mean time a broad spectrum  删除换行1 antibiotic should be started. Circumcision should be carried  删除换行1 out after the infection has been controlled.\n\n【63】CIRCUMCISION.— The operation is usually performed  删除换行1 under general anaesthesia in case of children, however local  删除换行1 anaesthesia may be applied in case of adult. First of all subpreputial adhesions are severed by blunt dissection with a  删除换行1 probe. This should be done all throughout the circumference.\nTwo pairs of artery forceps are applied to the prepuce and a  删除换行1 dorsal slit is made with scissors upto 1 cm of the corona.\nThen the prepuce with the mucous membrane layer is  删除换行1 divided parallel to the corona glandis 1 cm distal to it till  删除换行1 the frenum is reached. Here artery forceps is applied to secure  删除换行1 the artery of the frenum and then division of the foreskin is  删除换行1 completed. All the bleeding vessels are ligatured with  删除换行1 particular care to secure the artery of the frenum. One may  删除换行1 use catgut suture for artery of the frenum. Now the skin of  删除换行1 the prepuce is sutured to the mucous membrane with fine  删除换行1 interrupted catgut sutures.\n\n【64】The wound is dressed with sofratulle or penicillin-tulle  删除换行1 dressing. The patient is discharged in the afternoon.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

In particular, the symmetry symptom dimension, characterized by concerns over asymmetry and ordering compulsions, has been consistently highlighted in the literature on pediatric and adult OCD 删除10：<u>(Coles and Pietrefesa 2008 ; Radomsky and Rachman 2004 )</u>. Symmetry obsessions and compulsions were depicted in even the earliest phenomenological descriptions of OCD 删除10：<u>(Pitman 1987 )</u> and have been reliably identified as a discrete symptom cluster across multiple factor analytic studies 删除10：<u>(McKay et al. 2004 )</u>. In addition, symmetry symptoms tend to be among the most commonly endorsed by OCD patients. In one epidemiological study, 28 and 32 % of OCD patients experienced symmetry-based compulsions and obsessions, respectively 删除10：<u>(Rasmussen and Eisen 1992 )</u>. Another study found that ordering and arranging were the most common compulsions in an adolescent OCD sample, with over 50 % of participants reporting symmetry symptoms 删除10：<u>(Valleni-Basile et al. 1994 )</u>. Symmetry and ordering obsessions and compulsions have also been frequently observed in children with OCD 删除10：<u>(Swedo et al. 1989 )</u>\n\n【15】Symmetry symptoms are unique from other OCD symptom dimensions in several key regards. First, the emotional motivations underlying ordering and arranging behaviors are often quite distinct from those associated with other types of OCD. Individuals with contamination concerns, for example, may engage in excessive cleaning or avoidant behaviors as a way to prevent harm (e.g. illness or disease) and will report experiencing severe anxiety and fear in relation to these symptoms. By contrast, individuals with symmetry obsessions frequently cannot pinpoint any feared negative consequences that should be prevented through the means of a compulsion. Instead, they report strong desires for uniformity or intense urges to resolve feelings of incompleteness. Rituals and compulsions are therefore aimed at reducing feelings of dissatisfaction or uneasiness (rather than anxiety) that arise from a subjective sense of an experience that is “not quite right,” referred to as not just right experiences 删除10：<u>(NJREs; Coles et al. 2003 )</u> . The discomfort associated with these intangible NJREs can cause considerable distress, and individuals often go to great lengths to resolve perceived imbalance or asymmetry. One classic example, as described by Rasmussen and Eisen 通用删除7(英):<u>( 1991 )</u>, is a woman who felt compelled to let the telephone ring continuously without picking up—often up to 40 times—until she felt that the pitch was “just right” to her ears. These clinical observations have been bolstered by findings from self-report studies and experimental investigations, which examined NJREs and the reactive urges that accompany them. Results have consistently demonstrated a strong association between NJREs and symmetry concerns, along with subsequent ordering or arranging behaviors 删除10：<u>(Coles et al. 2003 , 2005 )</u>.\n\n【16】A second key difference between patients with symmetry concerns and those with other manifestations of OCD is that arranging and ordering symptoms are often perceived as ego-syntonic. This stands in sharp contrast to other symptom clusters (e.g. sexual and religious obsessions), which are experienced as highly aversive and inconsistent with one’s perception of self 删除10：<u>(Starcevic and Brakoulias 2008 )</u>. This additional difference may be directly in relation to perfectionistic tendencies and to NJREs linked with symmetry symptoms; in other words, obsessions are not experienced as aversive, and compulsions are viewed as helpful responses aimed at making things “right.” A final difference between the symmetry symptom dimension and other forms of OCD has to do with underlying brain morphology. Preliminary evidence suggests that symmetry and ordering symptoms may have unique neural correlates, characterized by distinctive activation patterns 删除10：<u>(van den Heuvel et al. 2009 )</u> as well as white matter abnormalities 删除10：<u>(Koch et al. 2012 )</u>.\n\n【17】An important consideration for understanding and treating symmetry concerns is that they appear to be captured on a dimension ranging from nonclinical, normative concerns about exactness and order, to severe manifestations that characterize clinical OCD 删除10：<u>(Olatunji et al. 2008 )</u>. It is possible that those with clinical levels of symmetry-type OCD share a common preference for orderliness and balance endorsed by many healthy individuals, yet this generally adaptive desire becomes poorly regulated and/or overly expressed to an extreme. In support of this notion, Radomsky and Rachman 通用删除7(英):<u>( 2004 )</u> found in a healthy, nonclinical population that ordering and arranging behaviors were characterized by a wide continuum. Those who endorsed higher levels of ordering concerns also reported significantly more anxiety when asked to complete a stressful task in a disorderly workspace, compared to those who did not strongly prefer order in their environment.\n\n【18】In line with this notion that symmetry symptoms are not inherently abnormal, research has found that ordering and arranging behaviors are among the top five most common (nonclinical) rituals endorsed across different cultures 删除10：<u>(Fiske and Haslam 1997 )</u>. Furthermore, developmental research has revealed that symmetry-related concerns are quite normative at different points in one’s lifespan, and that children frequently display preferences for balance, order, and symmetry 删除10：<u>(Leonard et al. 1990 )</u>. Across a large sample of healthy children, one study observed that “just right” experiences and behaviors emerged as early as 22 months of age 删除10：<u>(Evans et al. 1997 )</u>. It may be the case that symmetry-focused behaviors are rituals that occur within a developmental context throughout adolescence 删除10：<u>(Leonard et al. 1990 )</u>, the frequency and intensity of which may taper off over time as one progresses into adulthood 删除10：<u>(Radomsky and Rachman 2004 )</u>. This raises the possibility that symmetry symptoms have roots in socially prescribed or evolutionarily adaptive rituals 删除10：<u>(Leckman and Mayes 1998 )</u>, but may become dysfunctional in certain at-risk individuals 删除10：<u>(Coles and Pietrefesa 2008 )</u>. In other words, an inability to temper these habits and rituals that emerge normatively in childhood, may subsequently give rise to an incapacitating state of repetitive, time-consuming obsessions and compulsions.\n\n【19】The current treatments of choice for individuals with symmetry obsessions and ordering compulsions are the same as the recommended interventions for OCD in general. Within the cognitive behavioral tradition, both exposure and response prevention (ERP), and cognitive therapy have been found efficacious in reducing obsessions and compulsions 删除10：<u>(e.g. Abramowitz 2006 ; Franklin et al. 2002 )</u> whereas selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) represent the first-line option for pharmacological approaches to the treatment of OCD 删除10：<u>(e.g. Soomro et al. 2008 )</u>. In practice, ERP is often combined with SSRI pharmacotherapy, though individual patient characteristics (e.g. tolerance of side effects; ability to comply with exposure exercises) help direct these decisions. Despite the extensive literature supporting the efficacy of these interventions for OCD broadly construed, relatively few studies have examined whether there could be differential treatment effects across the symptom dimensions. The extant research suggests that symmetry patients do not, in fact, significantly differ from other OCD subtypes in their symptom reductions before and after ERP 删除10：<u>(Abramowitz et al. 2003 ; Mataix-Cols et al. 2002 )</u>. These findings notwithstanding, symmetry-type symptoms have been linked with lower rates of treatment seeking 删除10：<u>(Mayerovitch et al. 2003 )</u> and may therefore have been under represented in treatment outcome research 删除10：<u>(Sookman et al. 2005 )</u>, thus complicating the understanding of relative efficacy across subtypes. Additional investigations of differential risk and maintenance factors for the OCD symptom dimensions may shed light on how to best refine treatment approaches for symmetry, ordering, and arranging symptoms.\n\n【20】Description of the Presenting Problem\n-------------------------------------\n\n【21】The remainder of this chapter discusses the case of Natalie X, a patient who endorsed primary symmetry OCD and who was treated effectively with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), including ERP and elements of cognitive therapy. Natalie was a 27-year-old, single, Caucasian female who presented at a specialty anxiety disorders clinic. She was self-referred and was seeking treatment for her struggles with OCD, which included “constant worries about things not matching up” and “complicated routines.” More specifically, she reported categorizing objects, thoughts, and experiences into the gender classes of boy or girl based on a subjective feeling, and indicated that she felt the strong urge to always have a balance between these classes. This resulted in having to match every situation, object, or thought linked with one gender in kind to a situation, object, or thought of the other gender. The patient reported that she became extremely anxious and uncomfortable if things were not symmetrical in this particular manner.\n\n【22】Natalie stated that even though she had these symptoms for as long as she could remember, they were getting progressively worse. She noted that the urges and rituals had grown so extreme that they permeated every domain of functioning, and she was increasingly distressed by the disruptions they caused to her daily life. In particular, she experienced substantial impairment across social, work, and family spheres. In addition to difficulty making and maintaining friendships, Natalie’s graduate schoolwork and her job as a graduate teaching assistant were suffering due to these symptoms. She also reported significant financial strain, since she often had to purchase objects twice in order to achieve a girl/boy balance. Natalie reported that because she was so unhappy and distressed about her situation, she wanted to be closer to her family (who did not live near her) for greater social support. This desire resulted in repeated trips home, which were complicated by the need to fly in and out of particular girl/boy airports; Natalie was spending an inordinate amount of time and money to try and achieve equilibrium.\n\n【23】Case Information\n----------------\n\n【24】Family History\n\n【25】Natalie was born in a large northeastern US city to an upper-middle-class family. Her mother was a teacher and the primary stay-at-home parent, while her father had a successful career as an architect. Natalie additionally had two younger siblings: one brother and one sister. The patient reported that she was very close to her family members growing up and always felt supported—a sentiment she equally held in adulthood. Natalie reported that her parents divorced when she was 12 years old. Although she did not want her parents to be separated, Natalie felt her mother and father handled the situation in the “best way possible” and that the divorce was amicable. Her mother had primary custody of all the children, but Natalie and her siblings spent at least 2–3 days per week with their father. Natalie denied any history of physical, verbal, or sexual abuse. She also denied any abuse of alcohol or use of illicit drugs. She reported that she “rarely drank” alcohol and did so only for social purposes.\n\n【26】Although the patient indicated that there were no known psychiatric or medical illnesses in her family, she described her siblings and mother as a “generally anxious bunch.” In particular, Natalie characterized her mother as a “worrier” who always seemed to imagine “the worst case scenario.” The patient reported that her brother started “hanging out with the wrong crowd” in his late teens, and subsequently started “smoking a lot” of marijuana. Natalie suspected that her brother used marijuana “to relax,” but that this was “not a problem” for him and that he was functioning well in other respects. According to Natalie, her sister was the “sanest” of the three siblings, but also a “certified overachiever” who was doing very well in a competitive medical school. Natalie stated that her sister was always extremely perfectionistic growing up, but that her sister “grew out of it” and became more “healthy” during college.\n\n【27】Background and Course of Symptoms\n\n【28】Natalie reported that her mother remembered some of Natalie’s OCD symptoms emerging when she was still a toddler. In particular, her primary symptom of classifying objects and situations as boy/girl and her need to balance everything between those categories began at this time, along with some checking behaviors and rituals around eating. As an example, Natalie showed her therapists a picture of when she was approximately three, in which she wore several pink bracelets on one wrist and the exact same number of blue bracelets on the other wrist. A similar example was if she played a board game that she categorized as a girl game, she would purposely think of one that she considered a boy game to play thereafter. Natalie noted that as a child these “evening-out” behaviors were often not that problematic and she could easily hide her actions from others. However, if by chance she could not make things “even,” she would become extremely uncomfortable and distressed. Per her mother’s report, Natalie would frequently tantrum in response to what appeared to be harmless situations or occurrences; as an adult, Natalie hypothesized that these situations were likely exacerbations of her asymmetry concerns.\n\n【29】Natalie reached all developmental milestones within normal limits. As a whole, Natalie stated that she felt “generally normal,” but also a little “different” growing up. She engaged in social activities and maintained friendships throughout her school years. Natalie stated that her symptoms started to worsen around the time she reached puberty. At age 14, she was diagnosed with OCD, but she did not respond to treatment . Natalie reported that her OCD symptoms, including both checking and symmetry concerns, escalated during high school and prevented her from fulfilling her potential. She felt that she could have done much better academically if it were not for her obsessions and compulsions, which at this point had permeated most of her day-to-day activities. During this time, Natalie started feeling sad and depressed and avoided many social activities. At age 17, Natalie had a verbal altercation about her OCD symptoms with a male friend in whom she was interested romantically. The patient reported that this argument acutely exacerbated her feelings of sadness, and that she also started thinking she was truly “crazy.” Directly after the quarrel, Natalie refused to go to school for 3 days and became locked in an OCD cycle of counting, ordering, and checking compulsions. Her parents became highly alarmed about the sudden and intense deterioration and convinced her to voluntarily go to an in-patient hospital where she stayed for 2 days under observation. Natalie denied experiencing any suicidal ideation and was not deemed a risk to herself or others. Reflecting back, Natalie did not find her stay in the hospital helpful, but she stated that it did motivate her to better hide her symptoms from others.\n\n【30】Despite the difficulties Natalie experienced throughout high school, she gained admission to a good university in her home city. She continued to live at home with her mother while pursuing her undergraduate degree. Her OCD symptoms followed a waxing and waning course throughout her undergraduate years. Natalie reported feeling “freer” in college and gained more autonomy. Natalie successfully graduated with a bachelor’s degree in political science. After working in a law firm as an aid, Natalie subsequently applied to, and was accepted into, law school. This required her to move across the country, and it was during this transition and the start of her graduate studies that her OCD symptoms, particularly her symmetry concerns, once again worsened. After a year of significant struggles, she began to research local treatment options online, identifying the specialty anxiety disorders clinic that she eventually attended.\n\n【31】Treatment History\n\n【32】The patient’s symptoms worsened throughout her adolescent years and became particularly unmanageable around puberty. At that time, her parents sought out an evaluation with a local psychiatrist, who recommended a course of “talk therapy,” which Natalie did not find helpful. Starting at age 16 and throughout her early 20s, Natalie was prescribed a range of psychiatric medications to help treat her OCD, including escitalopram, alprazolam, paroxetine, sertraline, aripiprazole, citalopram, clomipramine, and fluvoxamine. In each instance, she stopped taking the medications due to negative side effects (e.g. headaches, increased appetite, and dizziness) and stated she did not believe medications could help her; she expressed no desire to pursue future pharmacotherapy. During a bout of symptom exacerbation during college, Natalie was referred to a therapist who provided biofeedback training as a therapy for OCD. Although initially hopeful, Natalie noted no change in her symptoms after 14 weekly sessions of biofeedback. Natalie underwent one more attempt at “talk therapy” while she was still in her early 20s; however, she subsequently did not find it helpful. Her therapist at that time suggested that ERP may be the specific type of psychotherapy that could be beneficial for reducing her symptoms. Natalie reported that she did not immediately pursue identifying a trained therapist, in part because she did not feel optimistic that psychotherapy would be effective, given the many treatment failures she had experienced in the past.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

But in clinical practice, we have treated a wide variety of patients with no fever, but other characteristics of KD are typical. We have treated one case with no specific symptoms and signs of KD, only with non-specific symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal distension, but developed CAA and other artery lesions (case 49). We have also treated some cases with recurrent fevers that eventually develop severe damage to the coronary arteries, aorta, and other body arteries, with massive thrombosis inside that leading to death at a young age (case 50 and case 51). According to the AHA guideline 删除10：<u>(McCrindle et al. Circulation 135通用删除7(英):<u>(17)</u>:e927–e999, 2017)</u>, they all didn’t meet the diagnostic criteria for KD, which we call the controversial KD.\n\n【15】If coronary and somatic artery damage occurs in infants less than 6 months old, it needs to be differentiated from polyarteritis. It has been reported that multiple arteritis is difficult to be diagnosed in live infants, and it is basically confirmed by postmortem autopsy 删除10：<u>(Zhu, Practical paidonosology \\[M\\]. 6th ed. Beijing: People’s Medicine Publishing House, 1996)</u>. KD can affect body arteries, but coronary arteries damage is a prerequisite (Newburger et al. Circulation 110通用删除7(英):<u>(17)</u>:2747–2771, 2004; Dionne et al. Pediatr Int 59通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u>:265–270, 2016). KD can involve the heart valve and cause regurgitation (Printz et al. J Am Coll Cardiol 57通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u>:86–92, 2011), but the disappearance of the entire valve has not been reported. KD combined with thrombosis almost all occurred in CAA, and rarely reported thrombosis in body arteries.\n\n【16】This chapter presented three cases different from classic KD, two patients died.\n\n【17】14.1 Case 49: Afebrile with CAA\n-------------------------------\n\n【18】A 3-month girl presented without significant past medical history and family history.\n\n【19】She presented on Day 15 of illness, with a history of vomiting after breeding and ventosity for about two weeks. On Day 5, liquid glycerinum was given via anal injection at home, but did not regress ventosity. On Day 8, she came to our outpatient clinic, and blood work revealed both elevated WBC and CRP. DR on abdomen showed ileus. She had infusion of third-generation cephalosporin for 3 days in local outpatient clinic, and vomiting and ventosity improved, but she still had significant malaise and no appetite. Retested CBC did not show any improvements. She was admitted in our pediatric cardiology ward. Since the onset of illness, she was sleepy and easily frightened; she had no fever, cough or diarrhea. Examination revealed the follows: she was in a bad state but her vital signs were almost normal (T 37.0°C, HR 120bpm, RR30bpm, WT 6kg), along with gloomy complexion and poor response, sunken bregma about 2cm×2cm, fast pupils reflection to light, ventosity abdomen without hepatosplenomegaly, normal bowel sounds. Others were normal. Tested blood work 7 days before admission revealed WBC 17.6×10 <sup>9 </sup> /L, NE 54.5%, HGB 82g/L, and PLT 800×10 <sup>9 </sup> /L. Normal CK and CK-MB. Abdominal ultrasound showed more intestinal gas reflection, without effusion or enclosed mass.

During the physical examination, the patient intermittently coughs up brownish-colored mucus. The rest of the physical examination is unremarkable. Mucus cultures are taken and the results are pending. An x-ray shows a mass within a cavity in his left lung.

This patient’s history is suggestive of infection with Aspergillus fumigatus , a ubiquitous fungus that can cause lung cavity aspergillomas (“fungus balls”), usually in patients with preexisting cavities in their lungs. Treatment for these lesions is by surgical removal, if they are causing significant hemoptysis; otherwise itraconazole is commonly given. A fumigatus can also cause bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and invasive aspergillosis, the latter almost exclusively in patients who are immunocompromised. A fumigatus is a non-dimorphic mold with septate hyphae that branch at a V-shaped 45-degree angle.  \nAnswer A is incorrect . Pneumocystis jiroveci recently was identified as a fungus and typically infects HIV-positive patients and other immunocompromised individuals. Symptoms include fever, malaise, dyspnea, and a nonproductive cough. Microscopy shows cup-shaped cysts with intracystic bodies. However, chest films will normally show a ground-glass appearance, not cavitations.  \nAnswer B is incorrect . Cryptococcus neoformans infection often does not present with any symptoms in an immunocompetent host. However, in an immunocompromised individual, it can present with meningoencephalitis. Cryptococcus is a heavily encapsulated yeast that is not dimorphic. The fungus is found in soil and pigeon droppings.  \nAnswer C is incorrect . Mucor species are molds with irregular nonseptate hyphae branching at wide angles (more than 90 degrees). Symptoms of Mucor pulmonary infection include an allergic reaction and infarction of distal tissue due to fungal proliferation in the walls of blood vessels. The disease is typically seen in patients with diabetic ketoacidosis and other causes of diminished immune function (eg, hematologic malignancies). Surgery and high doses of amphotericin B are used to treat pulmonary mucormycosis.  \nAnswer E is incorrect . Sporothrix schenckii is the cause of sporotrichosis. When S schenckii is introduced into the skin, usually by a thorn prick, it causes a local pustule or ulcer with nodules along draining lymphatics (ascending lymphangitis). S schenckii is a dimorphic fungus that has cigar-shaped budding yeast visible in pus.

He is found to have a large inferior wall myocardial infarction with 2-mm ST-segment elevations in leads II, III, and aVF. ECG also demonstrates gradual lengthening of the PR interval until one QRS complex is dropped. He is sent to the cardiac catheterization laboratory, where a stent is placed in one of his major coronary arteries. In which coronary artery was the stent most likely placed?\n\n【1】> (A) Diagonal branch of the LAD\n\n【2】> (B) Left anterior descending artery\n\n【3】> (C) Left circumflex artery\n\n【4】> (D) Left marginal artery\n\n【5】> (E) Right coronary artery\n\n【6】 Answer: The correct answer is E . The ECG findings are consistent with MI and a seconddegree Mobitz type 1 atrioventricular (AV) block or Wenckebach block. AV block occurs in 12%-25% of patients with acute MI; first-degree AV block occurs in 2%-12%, second-degree AV block occurs in 3%-10%, and third-degree AV block occurs in 3%-7%. Second-degree type I AV block occurs more commonly in inferior than anterior MIs. The right coronary artery (RCA) supplies the inferior wall of the heart. It also supplies the sinoatrial and AV nodes. The sinus node receives blood supply from the right coronary artery in 59% of patients, from the left circumflex artery in 38%, and from both arteries with a dual blood supply in 3%. The AV node is supplied by the RCA in 90% of patients. Thus the AV block is likely due to injury to the AV node as a result of an occlusion in the RCA causing ischemia to the right posterior atrium, where the AV nodal cells are located.  \nAnswer A is incorrect . The diagonal branches of the LAD are one or two large branches of the LAD that descend anteriorly across the surface of the left ventricle. A lesion here will not cause an inferior wall infarct of the heart.  \nAnswer B is incorrect . The left anterior descending (LAD) branch of the left coronary artery supplies the anterior two-thirds of the interventricular septum and the entire anterior wall of the left ventricle, as it travels along the anterior interventricular groove toward the apex of the heart. A lesion in the LAD would result in an anterior wall MI. It does not supply the inferior wall of the heart, as described in the vignette. A large proximal LAD infarction may also affect the conduction system, but it typically affects the area below the AV node that courses through the interventricular septum. This can sometimes result in bundle-branch blocks, higher-degree AV blocks, and even complete heart block.  \nAnswer C is incorrect . The left circumflex artery is a branch of the LAD that travels toward the left side of the heart. A lesion here will not cause an infarct on the inferior wall of the heart.  \nAnswer D is incorrect . The left marginal artery is a large branch of the left circumflex artery. It continues on the left side of the heart across its rounded obtuse margin. A lesion here does not cause an AV block or an inferior wall infarct.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

In other avian species, such as psittacine birds, the total leukocyte count would indicate a moderate leukocytosis. The normal heterophil morphology is important to note, because regardless of the cell count, the presence of heterophils exhibiting toxic changes would indicate a severe inflammatory response.

(a and b) Blood films from the hen (Wright–Giemsa stain, 100x).﻿</u>\n\n【11】Summary\n\n【12】The yellow urinary component of the droppings found on physical examination could represent biliru-binuria, suggestive of either hepatobiliary disease or hemolysis. Because birds lack biliverdin reductase enzyme in their livers, biliverdin, a green pigment, is their main bile pigment; therefore, hepatobiliary disease or hemolysis would expect to result in green urine. Some birds, however, do produce a yellow urine with these conditions. This is likely caused by post-hepatic reduction of biliverdin to bilirubin by other enzymes.\n\n【13】The plasma biochemistry panel revealed a mildly elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST), which is suggestive of hepatocellular disease; however, this enzyme is not specific for the liver. It is also possible that the elevated AST has resulted from the previous skeletal muscle injury or exertion that has yet to return to normal. The diagnostic testing that may have provided further evidence for hepatobiliary disease that included whole body radiographs, ultrasound, plasma bile acid concentration, and liver biopsy was offered but declined by the client.\n\n【14】The hypophosphatemia is likely the result of poor dietary intake of phosphorus. The hyperproteinemia could be explained by hemoconcentration or inflammation.\n\n【15】The mild heterophilia could represent mild inflammation or a stress response; however, the elevated total protein and globulins likely result from an inflammatory response. A protein electrophoresis that was offered but declined by the client would have added to the understanding of the increased total protein.\n\n【16】Although the packed cell volume (PCV) on day 1 is normal when compared to published values for chickens, this bird would be considered to be moderately anemic when compared to many other species of birds where a PCV less that 35% is generally considered to be low.\n\n【17】A weak presumptive diagnosis of hepatobiliary disease based on the yellow urates and elevated plasma AST was considered. There are many causes of hepa–tobiliary disease in chickens; however, a viral hepatitis was considered due to a high incidence of chickens in the area with hepatitis caused by an aden-ovirus according to a local poultry specialist. Also, another chicken in the patient's flock apparently began to show similar symptoms suggestive of a contagious etiology.\n\n【18】Without a definitive or stronger presumptive diagnosis and no specific treatment for the weaker viral hepatitis diagnosis, the chicken was placed on supportive care. The chicken was given subcutaneous fluids and sent home with treatments that included continuation of subcutaneous fluids, an oral antibiotic (trimethoprim-sulfa at 25 mg/kg twice daily), and milk thistle (9 mg given orally once daily). She was to be kept isolated from the other chickens for 10 days when she was to return for reexamination.\n\n【19】An examination of the chicken 9 days later revealed that the bird had greatly improved. Her presenting clinical signs had disappeared 5 days following her initial examination. Plasma chemistries that were abnormal on the initial visit were repeated and demonstrated a return to normal, except for the plasma AST activity, which had dropped, but had not yet returned to normal.\n\n【20】Clinical cases such as this are common in exotic animal practice where clients often decline diagnostic testing, usually because of the cost of the procedures.

He underwent a repair as a newborn. He is scheduled for a hypospadias repair. He has clear lung fields but left ventricular function is depressed, and he is maintained on chronic Lasix treatment as well as a salt-restricted diet. ABG reveals a pH = 7.44, paCO <sub>2 </sub> \\= 64, paO <sub>2 </sub> \\= 62, and HCO <sub>3 </sub> <sup>− </sup> \\= 44, on room air.\n\n【8】Preoperative Evaluation\n-----------------------\n\n【9】Questions\n\n【10】1.  1.\n    Interpret the ABG. How might you explain the findings? Is this patient alkalotic? Is the patient acidotic? Based solely on the PaCO <sub>2 </sub> —what would you expect the pH to be in this case? Explain why this patient’s acid/base profile is the way it is. What does chloride loss have to do with the development of alkalosis ? Why would the fact that there is a salt-restricted diet add to the problem?\n2.  2.\n    Is he ready for the OR? Does his acidosis/alkalosis need to be corrected prior to the OR? Where should you attempt to keep his CO <sub>2 </sub> during the operation? Is there a problem with normalizing his CO <sub>2 </sub> ? How much oxygen should he be on?\n3.  3.\n    What is a “normal” bicarbonate level? How does the concentration of HCO <sub>3 </sub> <sup>− </sup> relate to pH?\n4.  4.\n    Is it necessary to calculate an anion gap in this case?\n5.  5.\n    What is the most common cause of alkalosis in a child coming for surgery? If a child with severe vomiting or an NG tube to suction is given H <sub>2 </sub> receptor blockade—does that stop the development of alkalosis? Could that treatment cause them to become acidotic?\n6.  6.\n    Why does K <sup>+ </sup> depletion cause alkalosis?\n\n【11】Answers\n\n【12】1.  1.\n    The patient’s blood pH is in the normal range between 7.35 and 7.45. He has a significant metabolic alkalosis that is largely compensated by a respiratory acidosis . There are many possible explanations for these findings. Most probably the ABG is due to the fact that this patient has poor cardiac function that has necessitated him being on long-term diuretics to avoid congestive heart failure. This has led to chronic chloride and sodium loss. Since the kidney must maintain electrical neutrality, for every positive ion excreted, a negative ion needs to be absorbed. When chloride is deficient, bicarbonate is resorbed to maintain electrical neutrality—leading to accumulation of bicarbonate in the bloodstream and the resulting alkalosis. On the other hand, when carbon dioxide levels in the blood increase, there is a rise in carbonic acid. A 1 mmHg change in the PaCO <sub>2 </sub> above or below 40 mmHg results in a 0.008 unit change in the pH in the opposite direction. If there was no alkalosis, we would expect the pH to be 7.4 − 24(0.008) = 7.2 (approximately). The entire problem might be avoided if the patient was not on a salt-restricted diet (and inadequate Cl in the diet). GI absorption would make up for losses, and alkalosis would be minimal since the kidneys would be able to continue to resorb chloride instead of bicarbonate.\n2.  2.\n    Strictly in terms of his acid-base status, the patient is ready for the OR for this procedure. Attempting to correct his metabolic alkalosis prior to the operating room would take a long time and would almost certainly result in adverse effects (likely worsening of his cardiopulmonary status because of volume overload). During the case it would be wise to allow his CO <sub>2 </sub> to remain moderately elevated to the degree it is at his baseline. Respiratory drive in a child like this is primarily based on the pH of the CSF in the midbrain around the respiratory centers. Normalization of the respiratory acidosis would leave this child very alkalotic and would almost certainly lead to respiratory depression .\n3.  3.\n    Bicarbonate is normally about 24. Bicarbonate is related to pH through the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation which in this case would be pH = 6.1 + log (\\[HCO <sub>3 </sub> <sup>− </sup> \\]/.03 × PaCO <sub>2 </sub> ). A change in the HCO <sub>3 </sub> <sup>− </sup> concentration of 10 mEq/L will result in a change in pH of approximately 0.15 pH units in the same direction. In general, an increase in HCO <sub>3 </sub> <sup>− </sup> of 1 mEq/L will result in a rise in the paCO <sub>2 </sub> of approximately 0.7 mmHg. If the rise is more or less than that, it reflects a coexisting respiratory acidosis or alkalosis.\n4.  4.\n    In this case the patient is not acidotic, so the calculation of the anion gap would not be particularly helpful.\n5.  5.\n    The most common cause of alkalosis is acid loss through vomiting and/or NG suction. Loss of gastric HCl causes alkalosis—loss of acid and volume leads to an increase in mineralocorticoid activity which sustains alkalosis because increased catecholamines and angiotensin II levels increase bicarbonate absorption in the proximal and distal nephrons. Volume repletion with saline restores the ability of the kidney to excrete excess HCO <sub>3 </sub> <sup>− </sup> . H2 blockers can decrease H <sup>+ </sup> secretion in the stomach and stop the process since the fluid lost would lack significant H <sup>+ </sup> ions. It is unlikely that the patient would become acidotic unless the fluid loss was so great it led to significant hypovolemia and poor perfusion.\n6.  6.\n    K <sup>+ </sup> depletion —which occurs with mineralocorticoid excess—increases bicarbonate reabsorption from the proximal and distal tubule, resulting in alkalosis. Serum aldosterone release from the renal cortex would be suppressed by hypokalemia.\n\n【13】Intraoperative Course\n---------------------\n\n【14】Questions\n\n【15】1.  1.\n    You would like to perform a caudal for postoperative analgesia . What are your specific considerations for this patient? Does this patient need a volume load prior to a neuraxial block? What is your choice of IV fluid? If he has a pre-existing right bundle branch block from his cardiac surgery, would bupivacaine be as good a choice as ropivacaine? 2,3-Chloroprocaine? Would the pH of the patient affect the onset of local anesthetic? Why?\n2.  2.\n    What type of fluid would be most appropriate for this patient? Do you think lactated Ringer’s should be avoided? Why? What would happen if you mistakenly infused an IV fluid containing bicarbonate into this child? Would he/she become dangerously alkalotic? For how long? How is bicarbonate excreted? Why would bicarbonate containing solutions exist? Is there any reason to administer such a solution on purpose?\n\n【16】Answers\n\n【17】1.  1.\n    Hypospadias repair involves penile (sacral) dermatomes that are well covered by a caudal block. In general, caudal block performed after induction of anesthesia would decrease the MAC requirement during surgery by decreasing sensory input from the surgical intervention. The caudal would also supply an effective analgesic for the immediate postoperative time frame. A single-shot caudal or a caudal catheter with continuous infusion could be used depending on the extent of the surgery and the postoperative plans for the patient. In this particular patient we would like to know the current hemodynamic status of the patient. If the repair is completed, is there any residual shunt? Appropriately administered caudal anesthesia does not usually have much effect on the overall hemodynamic profile of patients in the infant and toddler age groups. These blocks have been safely applied for congenital heart surgery patients prior to and after repair. The volume status of this patient should be carefully considered. Prolonged NPO times could lead to volume depletion; however, this patient could be sensitive to volume overload. I would consider the NPO duration and administer a volume of fluid that would replace fluid deficit but it would not be necessary to administer additional fluids to a child in this age group to prepare for the caudal block. If the patient was on any anticoagulants, this could impact the regional anesthesia plan. Regional anesthesia is considered safe in patients taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. On the other hand, if the patient was on other anticoagulants such as low molecular weight heparin or specific antiplatelet agents, the recommended time frames for interruption of these medications prior to regional anesthesia must be observed. Implications of an intravascular injection could be significant in this patient and extra care should be taken to administer a test dose and fractionate the administration of a bolus dose. Local anesthetic toxicity is related to blockade of sodium channels. Bupivacaine is a stronger blocker of these channels than lidocaine or ropivacaine. If the patient has a pre-existing conduction abnormality such as a right bundle branch block, induction of dysrhythmias with high levels of local anesthetic could be an issue. As a result, ropivacaine or 2,3-choloroprocaine would be considered a better choice in a patient with compromised cardiac performance. Local anesthetics are weak bases. The ratio of the forms of the drugs can be expressed as BH+ = B + H <sup>+ </sup> . The pKa of each local anesthetic (the pH at which the drug exists 50% ionized and 50% unionized) will determine the concentration of the cationic and base forms that exist at any pH. This is expressed by the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation as pKa = pH + log (\\[BH <sup>+ </sup> \\]/\\[B\\]). Since the unionized base form of local anesthetics determines the onset of the drug, the more acidic the patient is, the more the drug will be in the ionized form. Therefore, the onset will be slower.\n2.  2.\n    Normal saline contains 154 mM of Na <sup>+ </sup> and Cl <sup>− </sup> . It has a pH of 5 and an osmolarity of 308 mOsm/L. Lactated Ringer’s solution has an average pH of 6.5, is hypoosmolar (272 mOsm/L), and has similar electrolytes to plasma. The administration of large amounts of NS has been associated with the development of hyperchloremic acidosis . There is some theoretical concern that lactate accumulation could lead to difficulties with high-volume LR administration, but this has not been clinically shown to be an issue. LR is not approved for administration with blood products. In this case, I would choose LR for fluid administration as long as blood products were not co-administered (extremely unlikely in this case). In the kidney, the distal tubule will resorb 100% of HCO <sub>3 </sub> <sup>− </sup> until the blood level reaches 24 mEq/L—at that point it will excrete almost all of HCO <sub>3 </sub> <sup>− </sup> above that level. An inadvertent bicarbonate infusion will increase the HCO <sub>3 </sub> <sup>− </sup> level significantly which will, in turn, lead to spilling of massive amounts of HCO <sub>3 </sub> <sup>− </sup> and alkalinize the urine. This is done purposely in some cases to encourage the excretion of toxins or chemotherapeutic agents. Systemic alkalosis would be very short-lived as the kidney is extremely effective at excreting excess bicarbonate.\n\n【18】Postoperative Course\n--------------------\n\n【19】Questions\n\n【20】1.  1.\n    On emergence your patient has developed a significant acidosis. What is the effect of acidosis on the major body systems ? What would be the effect of alkalosis on these systems?\n2.  2.\n    Your patient is not waking up after completion of the surgery. What possible effects of acidosis could be a cause of delayed emergence ?\n\n【21】Answers\n\n【22】1.  1.\n    Acidosis can have multiple effects. With pH <7.22, myocardial and smooth muscle depression can result in decreased cardiac stroke volume, cardiac output, and systemic vascular resistance. Hypotension that results can lead to poor perfusion and inadequate O <sub>2 </sub> delivery (in spite of a rightward shift of the O <sub>2 </sub> \\-Hb dissociation curve) and add to acidosis. The response to vasopressors and inotropes is impaired in this setting. Pulmonary artery pressures will increase secondary to increased pulmonary vascular resistance which leads to greater afterload on the right heart. An increased acidosis will lead to increasing K <sup>+ </sup> levels which could be dangerous if K <sup>+ </sup> was elevated to begin with. Alkalosis has several effects as well. 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> Increasing pH leads to a leftward shift of the O <sub>2 </sub> \\-Hb dissociation curve. This decreases O <sub>2 </sub> unloading which can be problematic in a patient with marginal cardiac output. 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> Calcium levels will decrease which can lead to decreased cardiac contractility—particularly in newborns and infants. 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> From the pulmonary perspective, alkalosis will lead to an increase in bronchial smooth muscle tone. 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> Respiratory alkalosis is associated with low CO <sub>2 </sub> and will result in lower cerebral blood flow due to cerebral arteriolar constriction. The effects of pH extend to the coagulation system as well. Coagulation factors are most active at elevated pH levels (pH = 8). While it is not recommended to purposely raise the pH to these levels for bleeding prophylaxis, it is important to appreciate that significant acidosis can impair procoagulant activity.\n2.  2.\n    Extremes of CO <sub>2 </sub> retention can induce a CO <sub>2 </sub> narcosis due to neuronal intracellular acidosis and intracranial hypertension from increased cerebral blood flow in those patients that are susceptible. In addition, monoquarternary muscle relaxants such as vecuronium and rocuronium will be potentiated and could be prolonged in their action. Finally, acidosis will decrease renal and liver blood flow, thus extending the half-life of most anesthetic agents and opioids—although unionized fractions will be reduced for almost all agents at low pH.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

You decide more information is needed before guidance can be drafted and delegate fact finding tasks to the other  删除换行1 members of the team.\n\n【7】Questions\n\n【8】• How does the law regulate assisted conception both privately and on the NHS?\n\n【9】• Are there limits to provision of NHS fertility treatment?\n\n【10】• Is there a ‘right’ to have a child?\n\n【11】ANSWER 8\n\n【12】Infertility is a common problem. It is estimated that approximately 7% of heterosexual  删除换行1 couples having regular intercourse will not be able to conceive within two years. Fertility  删除换行1 treatment is defined as a medical intervention to help conceive a child, and includes ovarian  删除换行1 stimulation, intrauterine insemination (IUI), in vitro fertilisation (IVF) as well as the use of  删除换行1 donor gametes and surrogacy. All fertility treatment is regulated by the Human Fertilisation  删除换行1 and Embryology Act 1990 删除10：<u>(as amended in 2008)</u>. The Human Fertilisation and Embryology \nAuthority (HFEA) was set up in order to license, monitor and collect data on any clinic  删除换行1 carrying out the above procedures. A licence is needed for any clinic involved in the use,  删除换行1 storage and disposal of gametes and embryos. In 2012 there were 77 licensed clinics in the  删除换行5 UK that performed 66,607 procedures (IVF or Donor Insemination) on 49,687 women.\nThe HFEA regulatory principles 删除换行1  reflect much of the content of the Human Fertilisation and  删除换行5 Embryology Act and incorporate key ethical concepts including equality, confidentiality  删除换行1 and consent. They also include guidance on assessing the welfare of the child to be born,  删除换行1 clinical safety and data transparency and research.\n\n【13】The latest NICE guidance recommends that infertility treatment should be offered to  删除换行1 individuals or couples who have a medical cause of infertility or those who have unexplained  删除换行1 infertility after trying to conceive for 2 years.\n\n【14】Current NICE criteria for treatment include\n\n【15】• Women under 40 who have been trying for more than 2 years should be offered  删除换行1 three full cycles of IVF\n\n【16】• Women aged 40 to 42 should be offered one cycle of IVF provided they have had  删除换行1 no previous IVF cycles, they have no evidence of low ovarian reserve and they are  删除换行1 made aware of the increased risks arising from pregnancy at this age\n\n【17】• Treatment is only recommended if the woman has a BMI of between 19 and 30\n\n【18】Despite this guidance data demonstrates that only 40% of IVF cycles performed in 2012 were  删除换行1 funded by the NHS.\n\n【19】CCGs are responsible for developing specific area criteria for funding and in reality they  删除换行1 impose far more restrictions on funding fertility treatment in line with limitations on their  删除换行1 budgets. Some CCGs refuse to offer any funding in any circumstances (Case 57) and this  删除换行1 ‘postcode lottery’ funding has come under heavy scrutiny. Restrictions commonly imposed  删除换行1 by CCGs include funding provided for explained infertility problems only, longer waiting  删除换行1 times before treatment is offered, much more stringent age and BMI restrictions, smoking  删除换行1 history and that no partner must have another living child.\n\n【20】Welfare of the child\n\n【21】Section 3 of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act states that prior to any fertility  删除换行1 treatment the clinic must take account of ‘the welfare of any child who may be born as a  删除换行1 result of the licensed treatment provided by them and any other child who may be affected  删除换行1 by that birth’. In 2005 the HFEA published Tomorrow’s Children, setting out a more focused  删除换行1 interpretation of the welfare requirement under the Act. It states that there is a presumption  删除换行1 in favour of providing treatment for those who seek it unless there is any evidence that any  删除换行1 child born to an individual or couple, or any existing child of the family, would face a serious risk of medical, physical or psychological harm. Consideration may be taken of previous  删除换行1  删除9：<u>http://www.hfea.gov.uk/184.html19</u> 删除换行1 convictions relating to harming children, chronic physical illness, mental health problems,  删除换行1 drug or alcohol addiction and any family history of inheritable genetic diseases.\n\n【22】In 1990, when the Act was originally passed, the ‘need for a father’ was included when considering the welfare of the child. This clearly discriminated against single women and same-sex  删除换行1 couples. The 2008 Act replaces that with the need for ‘supportive parenting’. This is defined  删除换行1 as ‘a commitment to the health, well-being and development of the child’.\n\n【23】Older women who may need donor eggs and would not meet criteria for NHS funding are  删除换行1 still able to ask for self-funded IVF treatment irrespective of age, although there may be concerns for the health of older women undergoing treatment and pregnancy.\n\n【24】Donor anonymity\n\n【25】The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (Disclosure of Donor Information)\nRegulations 2004 provide that any child resulting from gamete donation after April 2005  删除换行1 has the legal right to receive information about the donor when they reach the age of 18. This  删除换行1 includes identifying information such as name, date of birth, physical characteristics and last  删除换行1 known address. Of course, not all children will be told that they are conceived as a result of  删除换行1 conception with donor gametes. Since regulations came into effect there has been a decrease  删除换行1 in the number of sperm donors. Donor identification does not apply in some European countries or America, and because of this, more self-funding couples are making the decision to  删除换行1 have fertility treatment abroad.\n\n【26】Is there a right to have a child?\n\n【27】Article 12, European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) provides a ‘right to found a  删除换行1 family’. However, this is not an absolute right. A refusal to fund infertility treatment for  删除换行1 women over an age where it is clinically less effective may be justifiable in the light of limited  删除换行1 resources.\n\n【28】For the vast majority of people the decision to seek fertility treatment demonstrates that they  删除换行1 are committed to becoming parents and raising a child. Putting up a barrier to fertility treatment based on social reasons could be perceived as medical professionals making judgements  删除换行1 on who would make a fit parent. By comparison people with a history of unfit parenting are  删除换行1 not prevented from conceiving naturally. It could, therefore, be considered ethically unjust  删除换行1 for the State to judge the suitability of people with fertility problems to become parents.\nConversely, it could be argued that because assistance is being provided by a third party, an  删除换行1 ethical duty is owed to ensure that the child being created will be adequately cared for.\n\n【29】Key Points\n\n【30】• There is marked disparity between NICE guidelines and local guidelines about  删除换行1 eligibility for NHS funded fertility treatment.\n\n【31】• The welfare of the child must be considered in the provision of fertility treatment.\n\n【32】• The ‘need for a father’ has been replaced by the ‘need for supportive parenting’.\n\n【33】• Any child born as a result of donor gametes will have a right to identifiable information about their donor.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

The QT interval varies with heart rate and Bazett's formula (QT/√RR) is used to calculate the corrected QT interval for a given heart rate 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u>.\n\n【19】In this scenario the ECG recorded by the GP 删除33：<u></u> shows no P waves， with a regular， but extremely rapid heart rate of more than 200/minute. The QRS complexes are of normal duration and configuration. These findings are suggestive of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). The ECG recorded in clinic 删除33：<u>(Figure33.2)</u> shows P waves preceding all QRS complexes. The P wave is upright indicating sinus rhythm. There is a gradual variation in the RR interval (i.e. heart rate) with maintenance of the sinus rhythm characteristic. The rate is 72/minute (300 divided by the number of large squares between two R waves). The PR interval(from the beginning of the P wave to the beginning of the QRS complex) is 130 milliseconds， QRS duration(beginning of the Q wave to the end of the S wave) is 50 milliseconds and the QTc is 410 msec. This ECG is consistent with sinus arrhythmia. Sinus arrhythmia is a normal phasic variation in the heart rate， increasing during inspiration and decreasing during expiration. This is due to the variation in the activity of the autonomic nerves with the different phases of respiration. This girl is therefore having paroxysmal attacks of\n\n【20】SVT which are the cause of her palpitations. It must be noted however that palpitations in children are more often non-cardiac in origin 删除25：<u></u>. A careful history and examination may suggest the cause of the palpitations though often a 24 hour tape or an event recorder is required to document the arrhythmia.\n\n| Physiological  | Exercise， Excitement， Fever  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Psychogenic  | Stress， Anxiety disorders， Panic attacks  |\n| Cardiac  | Arrhythmias Congenital heart disease Postsurgical Cardiomyopathies Cardiac tumours or Infiltrative conditions  |\n| Other medical conditions  | Anaemia， Throtoxicosis， Hypoglycaemia  |\n| Drugs  | Caffeine， Smoking， Catecholamines， Theophylline， Beta-blockers，Antihypertensives， Antiarrythmic drugs， Cocaine  |\n\n【22】Table 33.1： Causes of palpitation in children\n\n【23】SVT is the most common abnormal cardiac rhythm disturbance in children， which requires treatment. The characteristics on ECG include a regular rhythm， fast heart rate (>210/minute in infants and >180/minute beyond infancy)， narrow QRS complex and absence of p waves (or abnormal p waves when identifiable). The history is important to exclude any other causes of tachycardia， such as fever or dehydration etc， especially when the heart rate is near the upper end of the normal. SVT is generally well tolerated. If the SVT is persistent， or causes haemodynamic disturbance， emergency management aims to achieve sinus rhythm by slowing atrioventricular conduction. An intravenous bolus of adenosine is the recommended treatment. While procuring adenosine， vagal manoeuvres (ice cold water on the face， carotid sinus massage， Valsalva manoeuvre etc) can sometimes revert the SVT to sinus rhythm without the need for a medication 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u>. The underlying mechanism in SVT in most children is the presence of an accessory pathway that can transmit the cardiac impulse between the atria and the ventricles. In a majority of children with SVT， this accessory pathway is inactive， and starts conducting only at the time when the child goes into SVT. In a small number of the children with SVT， the pathway is however active during sinus rhythm， and can be identified on a 12lead ECG by the presence of a short PR interval， delta wave and apparent prolongation of the QRS complex(secondary to the early take off of the delta wave) 删除33：<u></u>. The ECG pattern when the accessory pathway can be demonstrated on a 12 lead ECG is referred to as Wolf Parkinson White syndrome通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u>.\n\n【24】删除3：<u>Figure 33.4： ECG showing a short PR interval (40 milliseconds)， presence of a delta waves (initial slurring of QRS complex)， and an apparent prolongation of the QRS complex (120 milliseconds)-features consistent with Wolf Parkinson White syndrome</u>\n\n【25】Prevention of SVT depends on the age of the child and frequency of symptoms. A'no treatment'approach can be accepted with infrequent self-terminating episodes in older children. Beta adrenergic blockers are effective in prevention， and are especially used in neonates and infants who cannot verbalise their symptoms and who have less cardiac reserve compared to older children. Radiofrequency ablation 删除换行1 of the accessory pathway after mapping the pathway by electrophysiological studies is the treatment of choice in older children with frequent episodes of SVT 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u>.The important differential diagnosis for SVT is sinus tachycardia (ST)， which refers to a heart rate that is above the normal upper limit for the age of the child. With ST the ECG waves retain the features of a sinus rhythm. Causes include anxiety， fever， anaemia， hypovolaemia/circulatory shock and thyrotoxicosis. It is worth remembering that heart failure can also cause sinus tachycardia， so just the identification of sinus tachycardia on an ECG does not rule out heart disease.A less common， but more serious cardiac arrhythmia in children is ventricular tachycardia (VT)， identified on an ECG by the broad QRS complexes， absence of a regular p wave before the QRS complex and a bizarre pattern of the QRS complex with the R wave and S wave being in opposite directions 删除33：<u></u>. Where a p wave can be identified it bears no relationship to the QRS complex (atrio-ventricular dissociation)， a hallmark of ventricular tachycardia.\n\n【26】删除3：<u>Figure 33.5： ECG showing ventricular tachycardia</u>\n\n【27】Syllabus mapping\n\n【28】Cardiology\n\n【29】· Know the clinical features of common congenital heart conditions and understand the priniciples of management\n\n【30】Know the common causes of palpitations and syncope and chest pain， know when to refer\n\n【31】Emergency Medicine (including accidents and poisoning)\n\n【32】Be able to recognise and provide initial management for life threatening airway， breathing or circulatory collapse", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

She has experienced similar painful episodes in the past, usually in the evening following heavy meals, but the episodes always resolved spontaneously within an hour or two. This time the pain did not improve, so she sought medical attention. She has no medical history and takes no medications. She is married, has three children, and does not drink alcohol or smoke cigarettes.\n\n【3】On examination, she is afebrile, tachycardic with a heart rate of 104 bpm, blood pressure 115/74 mm Hg, and shallow respirations of 22 breaths per minute. She is moving uncomfortably on the stretcher, her skin is warm and diaphoretic, and she has scleral icterus. Her abdomen is soft, mildly distended with marked right-upper quadrant and epigastric tenderness to palpation, hypoactive bowel sounds, and no masses or organomegaly appreciated. Her stool is negative for occult blood. Laboratory studies are significant for a total bilirubin (9.2 g/dL) with a direct fraction of 4.8 g/dL, alkaline phosphatase 285 IU/L, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 78 IU/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 92 IU/L, and elevated amylase level 1249 IU/L. Her leukocyte count is 16,500/mm <sup>3 </sup> with 82% polymorphonuclear cells and 16% lymphocytes. A plain film of the abdomen shows a nonspecific gas pattern and no pneumoperitoneum.\n\n【4】 What is the most likely diagnosis?\n\n【5】 What is the most likely underlying etiology?\n\n【6】 What is your next diagnostic step?\n\n【7】### ANSWERS TO CASE 14:\n\n【8】#### Pancreatitis, Gallstones\n\n【9】Summary: A 42-year-old woman with a prior history consistent with symptomatic cholelithiasis now presents with epigastric pain and nausea for 24 hours, much longer than would be expected with uncomplicated biliary colic. Her symptoms are consistent with acute pancreatitis. She also has hyperbilirubinemia and an elevated alkaline phosphatase level, suggesting obstruction of the common bile duct caused by a gallstone, which is the likely cause of her pancreatitis.\n\n【10】 Most likely diagnosis: Acute pancreatitis\n\n【11】 Most likely etiology: Choledocholithiasis (common bile duct stone)\n\n【12】 Next diagnostic step: Right-upper quadrant abdominal ultrasonography\n\n【13】#### ANALYSIS\n\n【14】##### Objectives\n\n【15】1\\.

These prior episodes were short-lived. This is very consistent with biliary colic. However, this episode is different in severity and location of pain (now radiating straight to her back and accompanied by nausea and vomiting). The elevated amylase level confirms the clinical impression of acute pancreatitis. She likely has acute pancreatitis caused by a stone in the common bile duct. Biliary obstruction is suggested by the elevated bilirubin level. She is moderately ill but is hemodynamically stable and has only one prognostic feature to predict mortality—her elevated white blood cell (WBC) count .

Alcohol use is next most common cause (15%-30% of cases in the US) with episodes often precipitated by binge drinking. Hypertriglyceridemia is another common cause (1%-4% of cases) and occurs when serum triglyceride levels are more than 1000 mg/dL, as is seen in patients with familial dyslipidemias or diabetes 通用删除1(英):<u>(etiologies are given in Table 14–2 )</u>. Acute pancreatitis can be induced by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) , occurring after 5% to 10% of such procedures. When patients appear to have “idiopathic” pancreatitis, that is, no gallstones are seen on ultrasonography and no other pre-disposing factor can be found, biliary tract disease is still the most likely cause—either biliary sludge (microlithiasis) or sphincter of Oddi dysfunction.\n删除4：<u>Table 14–2 • CAUSES OF ACUTE PANCREATITIS</u>\n\n【42】Biliary tract disease (eg, gallstones)\n\n【43】Alcohol use\n\n【44】Drugs (eg, the antiretroviral didanosine \\[DDI\\], pentamidine, thiazides, furosemide, sulfonamides, azathioprine, L-asparaginase)\n\n【45】Surgical manipulation of the gland, or ERCP\n\n【46】Hypertriglyceridemia/hypercalcemia\n\n【47】Infections such as mumps or cytomegalovirus\n\n【48】Trauma such as blunt abdominal trauma\n\n【49】Abdominal pain is the cardinal symptom of pancreatitis and often is severe, typically in the upper abdomen with radiation to the back . The pain often is relieved by sitting up and bending forward, and is exacerbated by food. Patients commonly experience nausea and vomiting that is precipitated by oral intake. They may have low-grade fever (if temperature is >101°F, one should suspect infection) and often are volume depleted because of the vomiting and inability to tolerate oral intake, and because the inflammatory process may cause third spacing with sequestration of large volumes of fluid in the peritoneal cavity. Hemorrhagic pancreatitis with blood tracking along fascial planes would be suspected if periumbilical ecchymosis (Cullen’s sign) or flank ecchymosis (Grey Turner’s sign) is present.\n\n【50】The most common test used to diagnose pancreatitis is an elevated serum amylase level . It is released from the inflamed pancreas within hours of the attack and remains elevated for 3 to 4 days. Amylase undergoes renal clearance, and after serum levels decline, its level remains elevated in the urine. Amylase is not specific to the pancreas , however, and can be elevated as a consequence of many other abdominal processes, such as gastrointestinal ischemia with infarction or perforation; even just the vomiting associated with pancreatitis can cause elevated amylase of salivary origin . Elevated serum lipase level , also seen in acute pancreatitis, is more specific than is amylase to pancreatic origin and remains elevated longer than does amylase . When the diagnosis is uncertain or when complications of pancreatitis are suspected, computed tomographic ( CT) imaging of the abdomen is highly sensitive for showing the inflammatory changes in patients with moderate to severe pancreatitis.\n\n【51】Treatment of pancreatitis is mainly supportive and includes “pancreatic rest,” that is, withholding food or liquids by mouth until symptoms subside , and adequate narcotic analgesia, usually with meperidine. Intravenous fluids are necessary for maintenance and to replace any deficits. In patients with severe pancreatitis who sequester large volumes of fluid in their abdomen as pancreatic ascites, sometimes prodigious amounts of parenteral fluid replacement are necessary to maintain intra-vascular volume. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with papillotomy to remove bile duct stones may lessen the severity of gallstone pancreatitis, and is usually done within 72 hours. When pain has largely subsided and the patient has bowel sounds, oral clear liquids can be started and the diet advanced as tolerated.\n\n【52】The large majority of patients with acute pancreatitis will recover spontaneously and have a relatively uncomplicated course. Several scoring systems have been developed in an attempt to identify the 15% to 25% of patients who will have a more complicated course. When three or more of the Ranson criteria are present , a severe course complicated by pancreatic necrosis can be predicted. The most common cause of early death in patients with pancreatitis is hypovolemic shock , which is multifactorial: third spacing and sequestration of large fluid volumes in the abdomen, as well as increased capillary permeability. Others develop pulmonary edema, which may be noncardiogenic due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), or cardiogenic as a consequence of myocardial dysfunction.\n\n【53】Pancreatic complications include a phlegmon , which is a solid mass of inflamed pancreas, often with patchy areas of necrosis. Sometimes, extensive areas of pancreatic necrosis develop within a phlegmon. Either necrosis or a phlegmon can become secondarily infected, resulting in pancreatic abscess. Abscesses typically develop 2 to 3 weeks after the onset of illness and should be suspected if there is fever or leukocytosis. If pancreatic abscesses are not drained, mortality approaches 100%. Pancreatic necrosis and abscess are the leading causes of death in patients after the first week of illness. A pancreatic pseudocyst is a cystic collection of inflammatory fluid and pancreatic secretions, which unlike true cysts do not have an epithelial lining. Most pancreatic pseudocysts resolve spontaneously within 6 weeks, especially if they are smaller than 6 cm. However, if they are causing pain, are large or expanding, or become infected, they usually require drainage. Any of these local complications of pancreatitis should be suspected if persistent pain, fever, abdominal mass, or persistent hyperamylasemia occurs.\n\n【54】##### Gallstones\n\n【55】Gallstones usually form as a consequence of precipitation of cholesterol microcrystals in bile. They are very common, occurring in 10% to 20% of patients older than 65 years. Patients often are asymptomatic. When discovered incidentally, they can be followed without intervention, as only 10% of patients will develop any symptoms related to their stones within 10 years. When patients do develop symptoms because of a stone in the cystic duct or Hartmann pouch, the typical attack of biliary colic usually has a sudden onset, often precipitated by a large or fatty meal, with severe steady pain in the right-upper quadrant or epigastrium, lasting between 1 and 4 hours. They may have mild elevations of the alkaline phosphatase level and slight hyperbilirubinemia, but elevations of the bilirubin level over 3 g/dL suggest a common duct stone. The first diagnostic test in a patient with suspected gallstones usually is an ultrasonogram . The test is noninvasive and very sensitive for detecting stones in the gallbladder as well as intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary duct dilation.\n\n【56】One of the most common complications of gallstones is acute cholecystitis , which occurs when a stone becomes impacted in the cystic duct, and edema and inflammation develop behind the obstruction. This is apparent ultrasonographically as gallbladder wall thickening and pericholecystic fluid, and is characterized clinically as a persistent right-upper quadrant abdominal pain, with fever and leukocytosis. Cultures of bile in the gallbladder often yield enteric flora such as Escherichia coli and Klebsiella . If the diagnosis is in question, nuclear scintigraphy with a hepatobiliary iminodiacetic acid (HIDA) scan may be performed. The positive test shows visualization of the liver by the isotope, but nonvisualization of the gallbladder may indicate an obstructed cystic duct. Treatment of acute cholecystitis usually involves making the patient nil per os (NPO), intravenous fluids and antibiotics, and early cholecystectomy within 48 to 72 hours.\n\n【57】Another complication of gallstones is cholangitis, which occurs when there is intermittent obstruction of the common bile duct, allowing reflux of bacteria up the biliary tree, followed by development of purulent infection behind the obstruction. If the patient is septic, the condition requires urgent decompression of the biliary tree, either surgically or by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), to remove the stones endoscopically after performing a papillotomy, which allows the other stones to pass.\n\n【58】###", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

He  删除换行1 has refused food and drink and has attacked a member of staff. His first episode, 3 years ago,  删除换行1 had resolved successfully with olanzapine (atypical antipsychotic medication). However, he had  删除换行1 stopped taking this medication 3 weeks prior to admission. On admission, he was prescribed  删除换行1 oral quetiapine 300 mg at night with haloperidol orally 5 mg three times daily in case of agitation  删除换行1 along with lorazepam orally or intramuscularly (IM) 1–2 mg up to four times daily as required.He refused to take oral olanzapine and was administered haloperidol 5 mg three times daily IM  删除换行5 with lorazepam 1 mg twice daily and 2 mg at nighttime IM over the last 2 days. Despite this, his  删除换行1 agitation has been increasing and his speech has become more incoherent and bizarre.

This tetrad of symptoms is highly  删除换行1 suggestive of an idiosyncratic reaction to antipsychotic medication known as neuroleptic  删除换行1 malignant syndrome (NMS). The central pathology is severe dopaminergic blockade leading  删除换行1 to extreme muscle rigidity, which may cause rhabdomyolysis (muscle tissue breakdown) and  删除换行1 acute renal failure. Early recognition of this medical emergency is vital as it can be fatal in up  删除换行1 to 20% of cases.\n\n【25】Differential diagnoses include infections such as meningitis, encephalitis, and septicaemia  删除换行1 with or without concurrent extrapyramidal rigidity. Neuroendocrine possibilities include thyrotoxicosis and phaeochromocytoma. It could be drug induced with toxicity from illicit drugs  删除换行1 (e.g. cocaine and amphetamines) or prescription drugs (e.g. salicylates and anticholinergic  删除换行1 medication). Heat stroke or malignant hyperthermia should be considered. Also exclude neuropsychiatric presentations such as status epilepticus and catatonia (secondary to mood disorder or schizophrenia). Diagnosis is facilitated by a high index of clinical suspicion. Monitoring  删除换行1 all patients on antipsychotic medication for extrapyramidal side effects is vital. The presence of  删除换行1 any other feature such as fever, confusion or autonomic dysfunction should lead to a detailed  删除换行1 physical examination and investigations to rule out the above differentials. Useful investigations include the following (findings in NMS in parentheses): full blood count (leucocytosis),  删除换行1 urea and electrolytes (raised in renal failure), liver function tests (raised serum transaminases),  删除换行1 creatinine kinase (raised in renal failure) and urine drug screen to rule out drug intoxication.\n\n【26】Management\nThis is a medical emergency and will require urgent transfer to a medical unit. Maintaining  删除换行5 ABC (airway, breathing and circulation) is vital. The antipsychotic medication should be  删除换行1 discontinued immediately.

What other diagnostic studies can be completed to help differentiate diagnosis? How can they change management?Rationale and Evidence‐based Practice Explanation\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【5】### Based on the data given, formulate a differential diagnosis for this child?\n\n【6】Based on the presenting symptoms of increased work of breathing and poor oral intake, it is reasonable to consider a primary respiratory issue. Her poor oral intake can be related to her work of breathing or other possibilities. The differential diagnoses include viral bronchiolitis, viral pneumonia, or upper respiratory infection. When considering her general malaise, constipation, and increased work of breathing, her differential diagnosis should widen. Additionally, dehydration, failure to thrive, spinal muscular atrophy, suspected sepsis, or meningitis should be considered. With such vague symptomology the differential should be expanded and narrowed through the hospital stay.\n\n【7】### What other diagnostic studies can be completed to help differentiate diagnosis? How can they change management?\n\n【8】To gain clarity on her diagnosis a multitude of additional diagnostic studies can be completed. Procalcitonin (marker of inflammation) can help differentiate from a bacterial infection and better elucidate the need for antibiotics. A chest radiograph would be helpful to evaluate for airspace disease, aspiration, consolidation, and atelectasis. Continued monitoring of electrolytes will lead to supplementation or identification of disturbances. Laboratory values can be beneficial in the identification of fatigue related to hyponatremia or hypoglycemia in the setting of poor oral intake. A blood gas can be used for trending in the setting of impending respiratory failure.\n\n【9】Continuation of case : Within the first 12 hours of admission, she continues to have worsening weakness, proximal greater than distal, and intermittent hypoxia. A chest radiograph is completed with concern for bilateral airspace disease, and head computed tomography (CT) is completed and interpreted as normal. High‐flow nasal cannula is initiated and she is transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU). Following transfer to the ICU, she has increased frequency of oxygen desaturations, declining mental status, and hypotonia. Subsequently, her trachea is orally intubated for respiratory support in the setting of neurologic decompensation.Additional Questions and Evidence‐based Rationale\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【10】1.  What differential diagnosis are you considering with the changes in patient status?\n2.  What other diagnostic studies can be completed to help differentiate diagnosis? How can they change management?\n\n【11】### What differential diagnosis are you considering with the changes in patient status?\n\n【12】The clinical decompensation in addition to hypotonia expands the diagnosis to include, but not limited to, hypothyroidism, inborn errors of metabolism, encephalitis, poliomyelitis, ingestion/poisoning, neuromuscular junction disorders (botulism, myasthenia gravis), demyelinating disorders (Guillain–Barré syndrome/Miller–Fisher syndrome), acute flaccid myelitis, axonal neuropathy, and myopathy/myositis. Symptoms were consistent with bulbar paralysis. Referring to lower brainstem area or medulla oblongata, control of cranial nerves VII–XII. Term bulbar can be used for lesions at any level (muscle, neuromuscular junction, peripheral nerves, motor nuclei).\n\n【13】### What other diagnostic studies can be completed to help differentiate diagnosis? How can they change management?\n\n【14】Any patient with unknown disease etiology involving the respiratory system and neurologic decompensation warrants a full septic work‐up. Blood, urine and respiratory cultures, along with a chest radiograph, should be completed for further evaluation. Lumbar puncture should be performed to evaluate for meningitis, and viral studies from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) should be sent for evaluation. There are a number of adjunctive tests that can be used to help determine the cause of a neurologic insult. EEG should be completed to assess for seizure activity. EMG can be completed to assess for acute flaccid paralysis or botulism but results are not always definitive and can cause discomfort, so the benefits should be weighed. A nerve conduction study can typically be completed at the same time as EMG and is used to evaluate the speed of the electrical impulse and can eliminate the Miller–Fisher variant. The Tensilon test, which involves the injection of edrophonium chloride, can be sensitive for myasthenia gravis. The Tensilon test is influenced by patient response and may produce false‐positive results, with diagnoses such as botulism, Guillain–Barré syndrome, motor neuron diseases, and brainstem lesions.\n\n【15】Each diagnostic study by itself is not definitive, though a diagnosis can be made with additional information from CSF studies, laboratory results, and clinical presentation.\n\n【16】Continuation of case : During her first few days of ICU admission, she has decline in many body systems. Routine blood work is completed, along with blood, urine and sputum cultures. She requires moderate to high ventilator settings, with increased atelectasis and large mucous plugs. Cardiac echocardiogram is completed with normal function and anatomy, despite persistent hypertension. She no longer voids independently, and requires intermittent straight catheterization. Iatrogenic electrolyte disturbances are corrected with initiation of continuous feeds. A second viral swab is completed, which is positive for rhinovirus/enterovirus. Lumbar puncture is completed twice, with the results shown in Table 104.3 . Electroencephalography (EEG) shows stage 2 sleep, no wakefulness, and no seizures. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of her brain and spine is completed without acute findings. Electromyography (EMG) shows active myopathy or primarily axonal motor neuropathy. A 48‐hour course of intravenous gamma globulin (IVIG) is completed without clinical change. A muscle biopsy is completed. Viral studies are sent for evaluation, including human herpesvirus 7, cytomegalovirus (CMV), enterovirus, Epstein–Barr virus, herpes simplex virus, and West Nile virus. She is treated with ganciclovir for 5 days for a CMV viral load above 1400 copies/mL. She receives 48 hours of vancomycin and ceftriaxone for initial concern for sepsis which is discontinued following 48 hours of negative cultures and absence of fever. Enterovirus sent to the state laboratory for further subtyping.\n\n【17】Table 104.3 Initial CSF analysis.\n\n| Color | Colorless |\n| --- | --- |\n| Clarity | Clear |\n| Xanthochromia | Absent |\n| Red blood cells | 1/mm 3 |\n| Protein | 15 g/L |\n| Glucose | 126 mg/dL |\n\n【19】The current focused neurologic examination produces the following results.\n\n【20】   Mental status: she is encephalopathic with no spontaneous eye opening. She has spontaneous, but not vigorous movements of the bilateral hand and feet, with deep stimulation.\n   Cranial nerves: pupils are 3 mm with briskly reactive pupil on the left, 5 mm sluggishly reactive pupil on the right. Her facial structures appear symmetric. She has midline tongue movement without fasciculations. No cough or gag reflex is noted. She has weak dolls eye and absent corneal reflexes.\n   Motor: diffuse peripheral hypotonia with normal bulk throughout. She has 2+ strength of the fingers, wrists and elbows of the upper extremities. She has 1+ strength in the bilateral shoulders, 2+ strength in bilateral ankles and knees, and 1+ strength in her bilateral hips.\n\n【21】The patient is transferred to a children’s hospital in the setting of unknown etiology of her neurologic and respiratory decompensation. On arrival to the center of higher care, multiple services are consulted, including neurology, infectious disease, and pulmonology. The EMG, EEG, brain and spine MRI, and lumbar puncture are repeated. Blood and stool specimens for botulism are sent for evaluation. Medications are avoided which could interfere with neuromuscular junction functions. Antibiotics are not initiated, as the etiology of illness did not appear infectious. BabyBIG (human botulism immunoglobulin) is administered prior to any results.\n\n【22】The radiology repeat imaging and stool sampling produce the following results.\n\n【23】   MRI: negative for intracranial mass, midline shift, extra‐axial fluid collection or hemorrhage. The ventricles, sulci and cisterns are reported as normal. There are no abnormal areas of altered signal intensity or enhancement. There is no sign of infarction. The visualized aspects of the orbits, paranasal sinuses, and the mastoid air cells are normal. MRI brain and spine: susceptibility signals in the left cerebellar hemispheres may represent a stable‐appearing small cavernoma. No evidence of acute ischemia or acute parenchymal/extraparenchymal hemorrhage present in the study. No convincing evidence of spinal cord compression present. No abnormal enhancement of the spinal cord. No abnormal thickening of the cauda equina or the exiting nerve roots noted. No abnormal enhancement of the structures.\n   EMG: abnormal examination. There is electrodiagnostic evidence of a severe motor axonal polyneuropathy with active denervation, with the differential diagnoses including acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN) and anterior horn cell disorder. There is electrodiagnostic evidence of a severe sensory neuropathy or a defect in neuromuscular junction transmission.\n   EEG on day 1 of admission: normal EEG demonstrates slowing, encephalopathic features. There is also noted to be normal features of sleep seen intermittently as well. The background is reactive. No seizures and no epileptiform features are recorded.\n   EEG on day 4 of admission: abnormal tracing for age. There is normal sleep with no wakefulness despite noxious stimulation. Intermittent focal slowing is noted over the left parietal region.\n   Muscle biopsy: there is no evidence of abnormal central nuclei, cytoplasmic inclusions, or ragged red fibers. Focal mild endomysial inflammation is non‐specific but is consistent with immune reactive changes that could be due to viral infection or an autoimmune process. Clinical correlation is warranted.\n   CSF: results shown in Table 104.4 .\n   Stool specimen: Clostridium botulinum type A confirmed by mouse inoculation.\n\n【24】Table 104.4 Repeat CSF analysis.\n\n| Color | Colorless |\n| --- | --- |\n| Clarity | Clear |\n| Xanthochromia | Absent |\n| Red blood cells | 2/mm 3 |\n| Protein | 16 g/L |\n| Glucose | 73 mg/dL |Additional Questions and Evidence‐based Rationale\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【26】1.  What is the difference between an EEG and EMG? In what situation would you order either or both studies?\n2.  Should the provider be concerned for a toxic ingestion this far into her admission and what could still be evaluated for?\n3.  What is infantile botulism and how can it be prevented?\n4.  What is BabyBIG and how does it work?\n\n【27】### What is the difference between an EEG and EMG? In what situation would you order either or both studies?\n\n【28】EEG is the process of attaching electrodes to the scalp to evaluate the electrical activity of the brain. The activity is received from the neurons on the outermost layers of the cerebral cortex. EEG can be used to observe and identify refractory status epilepticus, achievement of cerebral silence, treatment monitoring of traumatic brain injury, metabolic encephalopathies, and neurologic conditions that inhibit patient responses. EEG continues to be a convenient evaluation of continuous, real‐time monitoring of brain function and is supplemental to the clinical examination.\n\n【29】EMG is a test that measures electrical signals. The process consists of inserting into a muscle a small needle that sends an electrical signal causing the muscle to contract. The contraction is recorded in as a number, wave or sound, which is interpreted by a specialist. EMG can be used to detect nerve or muscle dysfunction, or a dysfunction in their communication process. In this case, the EMG did not support a diagnosis of botulism.\n\n【30】### Should the provider be concerned for a toxic ingestion this far into her admission and what could still be evaluated for?\n\n【31】With an unknown neurologic decompensation, toxic ingestions should be considered early and urine and/or blood samples sent for evaluation. A week into her inpatient stay, evaluating for several toxic ingestions will not have much utility in reaching a diagnosis. Evaluating for alcohol is not useful, as it would have left her system this far into her course. Acetaminophen and salicylate levels are easily evaluated with a serum sample but this far into the course the levels would be decreased to non‐existent. Cholinergic toxidromes can have nicotinic effects with symptoms of weakness, paralysis, agitation and tachycardia; agents such as organophosphate pesticides present this way. Typical presentation following inhalation is respiratory distress, whereas emesis and drooling are typical clinical signs with oral ingestion. Airway management, atropine to reverse muscarinic effects, and benzodiazepines to control seizures are typical management strategies. Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry detects compounds even in small quantities in the urine but hold low utility at this time. Considering further evaluation of organophosphates, lead, cadmium, and arsenic could narrow the differential and help direct further treatment.\n\n【32】### What is infantile botulism and how can it be prevented?\n\n【33】In the United States, 99.8% of cases of infantile botulism have occurred in infants and children under 1-year-old, with 91.2% found in children under 6 months old. Illness occurs equally across ethnic and racial groups, with equal instances in males and females. Clostridium botulinum toxin is subclassified into types A–F, the most common being A and B. Infantile botulism occurs when the C. botulinum toxin is ingested/inhaled and the spores enter the digestive system. The spores will then grow and release the toxin. The botulinum toxin binds at the presynaptic segment of the neuromuscular junction and prevents acetylcholine from being released into the neuromuscular junction.\n\n【34】The commonly discussed causative agent of infant botulism is honey, even though it is uncommon for the ingestion of honey to be linked with reported cases of infant botulism. Avoidance of honey in infants under 12 months of age is a preventative strategy, but does not guarantee the development of botulism from a different source. Clostridium botulinum is a bacterium that inhabits soil and dust and is therefore found inside and outside the home. The distribution of confirmed cases nationally has been linked to the same botulism gene in the soil of a particular area.\n\n【35】### What is BabyBIG and how does it work?\n\n【36】BabyBIG is the human botulism immunoglobulin used for treatment of botulism. It is administered as soon as there is suspicion of infant botulism. It is an intravenous medication that helps reverse the toxemia by neutralizing the circulating toxins and preventing further disruption of the neuromuscular junction. BabyBIG has immediate onset, with an average half‐life of 28 days. The most common adverse reaction is skin rash, occurring in less than 5% of patients. As with any immunoglobulin administration, infusion should be initiated slowly with close monitoring of vital signs for the first hour; with stability, rate of infusion can increase. There is risk of anaphylaxis, and if this occurs the infusion should be discontinued, followed by administration of epinephrine. If patients have a known history of IgA deficiency, they can develop further antibodies to IgA, which would put them at higher risk for anaphylaxis to any subsequent blood product transfusions.Case Resolution\n---------------\n\n【37】Ten days following admission to the higher level of care, her stool sample resulted positive for botulism. She demonstrated improvement over the next weeks as an inpatient. She was successfully extubated 23 days following her initial presentation and intubation. Four months following her admission she was discharged home requiring non‐invasive positive pressure for nocturnal hypoventilation, and nasogastric feeds for oral aversion. She was able to tolerate supported sitting, roll from side to side, though was not yet supporting her own weight to crawl. She continued occupational and physical therapy as an outpatient.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

When the amount of fluids in the body contracts, the body attempts to compensate by releasing angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor. In order to protect the kidney from losing its perfusion due to this vasoconstriction, the kidney simultaneously releases prostaglandins at both the afferent and efferent arterioles, where they act as vasodilators. By inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 and/or COX-2 enzymes, the pathway that produces the prostaglandins that keep the kidneys perfused becomes blocked, leading to decreased blood flow to the kidneys and resulting in a prerenal cause of renal failure. Celecoxib is a selective COX-2 inhibitor that affects the arterioles of the kidney and can cause renal failure in dehydrated patients.  \nAnswer A is incorrect . Inhibition of the COX-2 enzyme will lead to a decrease in the production of prostacyclin, causing a possible increase in platelet aggregation as they continue to produce thromboxane, which is produced mainly by the COX-1 pathway. However, this effect is not the reason why COX-2 inhibitors are contraindicated in the context of volume contraction.  \nAnswer C is incorrect . Celecoxib is a selective COX-2 inhibitor that is effective because it spares the gastric mucosa the damaging effects of COX-1 inhibition.  \nAnswer D is incorrect . The macula densa is a specialized portion of the thick ascending limb adjacent to the hilus of the glomerulus. The cells of the macula densa sense changes in sodium and chloride concentrations as well as a drop in blood pressure, and they secrete renin in response. This patient’s vomiting will activate the renin-angiotensin pathway due to fluid and electrolyte loss, but the celecoxib will have little impact on the macula densa itself.  \nAnswer E is incorrect . Inhibition of the COX-2 enzyme will lead to a decrease in the production of prostaglandins, thromboxane, and prostacyclins, which affect platelet function and small vessel diameter.

Nikolsky’s sign is positive when lateral pressure is applied to the skin  删除换行1 and the top layer sloughs off, and is found in TEN, Stevens–Johnson syndrome and staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome and immuno-bullous diseases. The most likely culprit  删除换行1 drug here is the antiretroviral nevarapine. Currently physicians are unable to predict  删除换行1 which patients will develop severe drug eruptions; however, they are more common in  删除换行1 patients with HIV. The trigger antigen sets off a cascade of cell-mediated immune reactions including the activation of cytotoxic lymphocytes and natural killer cells resulting  删除换行1 in full-thickness skin necrosis (confirmed on the skin biopsy).\nTEN is a dermatological emergency. Patients should be managed in the intensive care unit  删除换行1 by a multidisciplinary team including a dermatologist. Many patients with TEN require  删除换行1 sedation and ventilation. The offending drug should be stopped immediately. Topical  删除换行1 50:50 white soft paraffin with liquid paraffin should be applied hourly to all the skin,  删除换行1 topical antibiotics and non-adherent dressings (Jelonet®) should be applied to denuded  删除换行1 areas. Patients should be kept in a warm room. Fluid and enteral nutrition are essential  删除换行1 to compensate for high insensible fluid losses and high protein demands. The evidence  删除换行1 for other proactive interventions are mainly anecdotal: many units will treat patients  删除换行1 with a total of 2–4 mg/kg of intravenous immunoglobulin over 4 days and 3 mg/kg per  删除换行1 day of ciclosporin.\nTEN has a reported mortality rate of around 20–40 per cent. The mortality rate for any  删除换行1 individual patient can be estimated by calculating their SCORTEN – based on seven criteria: \u0007 40 years of age, pulse \u0007 120 bpm, underlying malignancy, \u0007 10 per cent body surface involved, urea \u0007 10 mmol/L, bicarbonate \u0005 20 mmol/L and glucose \u0007 14 mmol/L.\nThe higher the number of these criteria the patient has, the worse the prognosis \n\n【26】(mortality: 1/7 \t 3 per cent, 2/7 \t 12 per cent, 3/7 \t 35 per cent, 4/7 \t 58 per cent,  删除换行1 5–7/7 \t 90 per cent).\nThis patient had a normal healthy baby delivered at term by caesarean section and was  删除换行1 switched to Kaletra, lamivudine and tenofovir.\n\n【27】 KEY POINTS\n\n【28】• TEN is a dermatological emergency requiring meticulous skin care and supportive  删除换行1 therapy.\n\n【29】• Patients usually require sedation and ventilation on the intensive care unit.\n\n【30】• The patient’s prognosis can be estimated by calculating their SCORTEN.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

She is referred to the paediatric outpatient department by her general practitioner (GP). Over the past 6 months she has been complaining of feeling tired all  删除换行1 the time, she has a sore throat, headaches, pains in her arms, legs and abdomen, and feels  删除换行1 weak. She has not been to school for the past 6 weeks because she cannot manage the walk to  删除换行1 the bus stop and now she needs her mother’s assistance to walk around her house. The referral letter says that they have attended the GP’s surgery five times over this period, and her  删除换行1 mother is very anxious about what is causing this. The GP did some blood tests and says that  删除换行1 a full blood count, renal and liver function tests were normal.\n\n【3】Further history reveals that this all started with a sore throat and fever for a few days. From  删除换行1 then on, she started to get headaches, worse in the evening, and became weak and lethargic.\nShe seemed to get worse each week, until she was hardly doing anything herself, staying in  删除换行1 bed or watching television. Despite sleeping a lot, she does not feel refreshed after sleeping.\nHer mother has to help her to shower and dress, as she feels so weak. She aches all over and  删除换行1 finds it very hard to concentrate on anything. Her periods have become irregular.\n\n【4】Charlotte was getting top grades at school before all this and wants to be a doctor. She enjoys  删除换行1 school and denies any bullying. She lives with her mother and stepfather. She has always been  删除换行1 very reliant on her mother. Her sister was successfully treated for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia 3 years ago. Charlotte has never been in hospital before and usually does swimming  删除换行1 team training five times per week.\nHer mother is very worried that this could be something sinister and she has looked on the  删除换行1 internet and thinks it could be a brain tumour or thyroid problem. She is upset that the GP  删除换行5 has not taken it seriously and only did blood tests because she made a fuss.\n\n【5】Examination\n\n【6】Charlotte is rather quiet, but will participate in conversation when prompted. Her weight is  删除换行1 45 kg (25th centile) and her height is 164 cm (75th centile). Otherwise, physical examination  删除换行1 is unremarkable.\n\n【7】Questions\n\n【8】• What is the most likely diagnosis?\n\n【9】• Would you request any more investigations?\n\n【10】• What is the prognosis?\n\n【11】ANSWER 99\n\n【12】The most likely diagnosis is chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). This condition is also known  删除换行1 as myalgic encephalopathy (ME), but the term CFS is now preferred. The cause of this condition is unknown. The diagnosis requires persistent fatigue disrupting daily life for 6 months,  删除换行1 associated with typical symptoms and no underlying cause found by routine investigation.\nTypical symptoms include malaise, headache, nausea, sore throat, painful lymph nodes,  删除换行1 myalgia, abdominal pain, poor sleep and poor concentration. Teenagers are more often  删除换行1 affected than younger children.\n\n【13】Charlotte’s personality, social and emotional background are probably predisposing factors.It is necessary to exclude organic pathology early on, and to demonstrate that the symptoms  删除换行1 are being taken seriously. At the same time it is important to indicate from the start that CFS  删除换行5 could be the cause of all these symptoms. Thorough physical examination should include  删除换行1 lying and standing heart rates and blood pressure, neurological assessment and examination  删除换行1 for lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, tonsil abnormalities and sinusitis. Investigations  删除换行1 should rule out active infection, inflammation, endocrine problems and malignancy. When  删除换行1 headache is prominent, it may be necessary to perform an MRI scan of the brain to exclude  删除换行1 a space-occupying lesion.删除26：<u>!</u> Recommended investigations in patients suspected to have CFS\n\n【14】 May indicate:\n\n【15】Full blood count and blood film Anaemia/leukaemia\n\n【16】Erythrocyte sedimentation rate and Inflammatory/infectious cause\n\n【17】 C-reactive protein\n\n【18】Urea, creatinine Renal disease\n\n【19】Glucose and electrolytes Endocrine disease, e.g. Addison’s\n\n【20】Creatine kinase Myositis\n\n【21】Liver function Hepatitis\n\n【22】Thyroid function Hypothyroidism\n\n【23】Urine dipstick Diabetes mellitus, renal disease\n\n【24】Epstein–Barr Virus (EBV) serology Current EBV infection \n\n【25】Prognosis is quite variable and although two-thirds of patients make a full recovery, this may  删除换行1 take 3–4 years. A multidisciplinary approach is often required. Management begins with  删除换行1 assessment of baseline function using an activity diary. Supportive treatment can be aimed  删除换行1 at alleviating symptoms, improving nutrition and sleep patterns and preventing overexertion. In prolonged and/or severe cases, referral to a specialist CFS service should be offered  删除换行1 to Charlotte and her family. This will involve enhanced support from physiotherapy, occupational therapy and child and adolescent mental health services. Graded programmes of  删除换行1 exercise therapy and managed return to activity, alongside cognitive behavioural therapies,  删除换行1 are often instituted once a stable baseline has been achieved. Sometimes medication may be  删除换行1 prescribed to manage low mood, pain or poor sleep. Occasionally in-patient management is  删除换行1 required for investigation, evaluation and planning of treatment.\nCase 99: A tired teenager\n\n【26】In this case, Charlotte was admitted to the paediatric ward for about 4 weeks, initially for  删除换行1 investigation, and then for some intensive assessment by physiotherapists, occupational therapists and child and adolescent mental health services. It was difficult to make Charlotte and  删除换行1 her mother accept the diagnosis of CFS. She was discharged after her baseline activity level  删除换行1 had been established and a programme of rehabilitation had been planned. She had regular  删除换行1 follow-up to support her in achieving her goals. After 18 months, she has returned to about  删除换行1 60  per cent of her previous activity levels, and continues to make slow progress. She has  删除换行1 dropped back 1 year at school, but now manages to attend most of her lessons.\n\n【27】Key Points\n\n【28】• Chronic fatigue syndrome can be a debilitating condition requiring a multidisciplinary approach.\n\n【29】• Chronic fatigue and associated features should have been present for at least  删除换行1 6 months.\n\n【30】• Other medical causes of the same symptoms should be excluded.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

He describes his stools as frequent, with 10 to 12 per day, small volume, sometimes with visible blood and mucus, and preceded by a sudden urge to defecate. The abdominal pain is crampy, diffuse, and moderately severe, and it is not relieved with defecation. In the past 6 to 8 months, he has experienced similar episodes of abdominal pain and loose mucoid stools with some bleeding, but the episodes were milder and resolved within 24 to 48 hours. He has no other medical history and takes no medications. He has neither traveled out of the United States nor had contact with anyone with similar symptoms. He works as an accountant and does not smoke or drink alcohol. No member of his family has gastrointestinal (GI) problems.\n\n【3】On examination, his temperature is 99°F, heart rate 98 bpm, and blood pressure 118/74 mm Hg. He appears uncomfortable and is lying still on the stretcher. His sclerae are anicteric, and his oral mucosa is pink and clear without ulceration. His chest is clear, and his heart rhythm is regular, without murmurs. His abdomen is soft and mildly distended, with hypoactive bowel sounds and minimal diffuse tenderness but no guarding or rebound tenderness.\n\n【4】Laboratory studies are significant for a white blood cell (WBC) count of 15 800/mm <sup>3 </sup> with 82% polymorphonuclear leukocytes, hemoglobin 10.3 g/dL, and platelet count 754 000/mm <sup>3 </sup> . The HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) assay is negative. Renal function and liver function tests are normal. A plain film radiograph of the abdomen shows a mildly dilated air-filled colon with a 4.5-cm diameter and no pneumoperitoneum or air/fluid levels.\n\n【5】 What is the most likely diagnosis?\n\n【6】 What is your next step?\n\n【7】### ANSWERS TO CASE 16:\n\n【8】#### Ulcerative Colitis\n\n【9】Summary: A 28-year-old man comes in with a moderate to severe presentation of colitis, as manifested by crampy abdominal pain with tenesmus, low-volume bloody mucoid stool, and colonic dilatation on x-ray. He has no travel or exposure history to suggest infection. He reports a history of previous similar episodes, which suggests a chronic inflammatory rather than acute infectious process.\n\n【10】 Most likely diagnosis: Colitis, probably ulcerative colitis.\n\n【11】 Next step: Admit to the hospital, obtain stool samples to exclude infection, and begin therapy with corticosteroids.\n\n【12】#### ANALYSIS\n\n【13】##### Objectives\n\n【14】1\\. Know the typical presentation of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).\n\n【15】2\\. Know the differences between Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis.\n\n【16】3\\. Know the treatment of IBD.\n\n【17】##### Considerations\n\n【18】Although the likelihood is low, infection must be excluded, and it is necessary to check for infections with organisms such as Entamoeba histolytica, Salmonella, Shigella, E coli , and Campylobacter , as well as Clostridium difficile , which can occur in the absence of prior antibiotic exposure. The main consideration in this case would be IBD versus infectious colitis. The absence of travel history, sick contacts, and the chronicity of the illness all point away from infection.\n\n【19】At the moment, the patient does not appear to have any life-threatening complication of colitis, such as perforation or toxic megacolon, but he must be monitored closely, and surgical consultation may be helpful. The combination of abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea, and the abdominal x-ray localizing the disease to the colon points to a “colitis.”\n\n【20】### APPROACH TO:\n\n【21】#### Colitis\n\n【22】#### DEFINITIONS\n\n【23】COLITIS: Inflammation of the colon, which may be due to infectious, autoimmune, ischemic, or idiopathic causes.\n\n【24】INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE: Autoimmune-mediated intestinal inflammation primarily due to either Crohn disease or ulcerative colitis.\n\n【25】#### CLINICAL APPROACH\n\n【26】The differential diagnosis for colitis includes ischemic colitis, infectious colitis ( C difficile, E coli, Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter ), radiation colitis, and IBD (Crohn disease vs ulcerative colitis). Mesenteric ischemia usually is encountered in people older than 50 years with known atherosclerotic vascular disease or other cause of hypoperfusion. The pain usually is acute in onset following a meal (“intestinal angina”) and not associated with fevers. Infectious colitis is usually characterized by an acute onset of symptoms, often in patients with a recent history of foreign travel, or recent use of antibiotics.\n\n【27】Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is most commonly diagnosed in young patients between the ages of 15 and 25 years. There is a second peak in the incidence of IBD (usually Crohn disease) between the ages of 60 and 70 years. IBD may present with a low-grade fever. The chronic nature of this patient’s disease (several months) is typical of IBD. Anemia may be present, either due to iron deficiency from chronic GI blood loss, or anemia of chronic disease. Patients with IBD may also report fatigue and weight loss.\n\n【28】Ulcerative colitis usually presents with grossly bloody stool, whereas symptoms of Crohn disease are much more variable, mainly chronic abdominal pain, diarrhea, and weight loss. Ulcerative colitis involves only the large bowel, whereas Crohn disease may affect any portion of the GI tract, typically the colon and terminal ileum. Ulcerative colitis always begins in the rectum and proceeds proximally in a continuous pattern; disease is limited to the colon . Crohn disease classically involves the terminal ileum but may occur anywhere in the GI tract from the mouth to the anus. Anal fissures and nonhealing ulcers are often seen in Crohn disease. Additionally, the pattern of Crohn disease is not contiguous in the GI tract; classically, it has a patchy distribution that is often referred to as “skip lesions.” Patients with Crohn disease may develop strictures caused by fibrosis from repeated inflammation which can lead to bowel obstruction, with crampy abdominal pain and nausea/vomiting. Ulcerative colitis is characterized by diarrhea and typically leads to bowel obstruction. The diagnosis usually is confirmed after colonoscopy with biopsy of the affected segments of bowel and histologic examination. In ulcerative colitis, inflammation will be limited to the mucosa and submucosa , whereas in Crohn disease , the inflammation will be transmural (throughout all layers of the bowel). Tables 16–1 and 16–2 list further clinical features. Surgery is indicated for complications of Crohn disease, such as obstruction, fistulas, or perforation, but recurrent disease is common.\n删除4：<u>Table 16–1 • COMPARISON OF CROHN DISEASE VS ULCERATIVE COLITIS</u>\n删除4：<u>Table 16–2 • EXTRAINTESTINAL MANIFESTATIONS OF INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE</u>\n\n【29】##### Crohn Disease Versus Ulcerative Colitis\n\n【30】The treatment of ulcerative colitis can be complex because the pathophysiology of the disease is incompletely understood. Management is aimed at reducing the inflammation. Most commonly, sulfasalazine and other 5-aminosalicylic acid (ASA) compounds such as mesalamine are used and are available in oral and rectal preparations. They are used in mild to moderate active disease to induce remission, and in the maintenance of disease to reduce the frequency of flare-ups. Corticosteroids such as prednisone may be used (PO, PR, or IV) to treat patients with moderate to severe disease. Once remission is achieved, the steroids should be tapered over 6 to 8 weeks and then discontinued if possible to minimize their side effects. Immune modulators are used for more severe, refractory disease. Such medications include 6-mercaptopurine, azathioprine, methotrexate, and the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antibody infliximab. Anti-TNF therapy, such as infliximab , has been an important treatment of patients with Crohn disease who are refractory to steroids, and more recently has shown efficacy in ulcerative colitis. Patients receiving the potent immunomodulator infliximab are at increased risk of infection, including reactivation of latent tuberculosis.\n\n【31】Surgery is indicated for complications of ulcerative colitis. Total colectomy is performed in patients with carcinoma, toxic megacolon, perforation, and uncontrollable bleeding . Surgery is curative for ulcerative colitis if symptoms persist despite medical therapy. Two very important and potentially life-threatening complications of ulcerative colitis are toxic megacolon and colon cancer. Toxic megacolon occurs when the colon dilates to a diameter more than 6 cm. It usually is accompanied by fever, leukocytosis, tachycardia, and evidence of serious toxicity, such as hypotension or altered mental status . Therapy is designed to reduce the chance of perforation and includes IV fluids, nasogastric tube placed to suction, and placing the patient NPO (nothing by mouth). Additionally, IV antibiotics are given in anticipation of possible perforation, and IV steroids are given to reduce inflammation. The most severe consequence of toxic megacolon is colonic perforation complicated by peritonitis or hemorrhage.\n\n【32】Patients with ulcerative colitis have a marked increase in the incidence of colon cancer compared to the general population. The risk of cancer increases over time and is related to disease duration and extent. It is seen both in patients with active disease and in patients whose disease has been in remission. Annual or biennial colonoscopy is advised in patients with ulcerative colitis, beginning 8 years after diagnosis of pancolitis, and random biopsies should be sent for evaluation. If colon cancer or dysplasia is found, a colectomy should be performed.\n\n【33】###", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

There was itching associated with the rash. Two to 3 days PTA， with worsening weakness， nausea， and vomiting， she was brought to the ER for evaluation.\n\n【3】Epidemiologic history suggested no exposure to insects， camping， bites， stings， pets or any animals. There was no known change in detergents or use of cosmet-ics. No other family members were ill.\n\n【4】The review of systems was positive for rash with itching， vomiting， poor appetite， generalized malaise， weakness， and some sore throat.\n\n【5】The past medical history was significant for hypertension， arthritis， and seizure disorder since her teenage years.\n\n【6】She was married， was a stay-at-home mom， and had three daughters aged11， 13， and 15 years. She was a non-smoker and non-drinker.

The neck showed a 2 cm prominent palpable lymph node in the right posterior cervical area， plus other tiny neck nodes. The heart， lung， and abdominal exams were unremarkable. Lower extremities showed non-pitting edema. Lymph nodes were palpably enlarged in both axilla， right posterior cervical， and in both 删除换行1 groins. They were moveable and non-tender. The neurologic exam showed a drowsy patient (on sedating meds - diphenhydramine)， who was easily arousable. She had no focal findings， but diminished deep tendon reflexes.\n\n【10】The skin showed a diffuse， erythematous， non-blanching rash， involving the upper and lower extremities， especially forearms and feet， trunk， face，and chest， with some desquamation. There was no cellulitis noted. The thighs， shin， and foot showed diffuse erythroderma and desquamation.\n\n【11】· At this stage what differential diagnoses are you thinking of\n\n【12】Laboratory and other investigations\n\n【13】Blood cultures on 5/6/00 and 5/7/00 (4 out of 4) were negative. A culture from left ear drainage on 5/7/00 turned out to be positive for methicillin-sensitive Staph. aureus.

The CBC on admission showed a WBC of 8.9 and on 5/16/00， WBC count was 13.3； H/H 9.5 and 28.3， respectively； platelet count 371. Differential count showed 67% polymorphonuclear leuko-cytes (PMNs)， 4% band forms， and 24%lymphocytes. There was no eosinophilia noted on the peripheral blood smear on any CBC done during the May， 2000admission. The initial BUN and creatinine were 25 and 1.8， respectively. The serial liver panel tests are shown in Table 11.3a.\n\n【14】Chest x-ray on admission on 5/6/00 did not show infiltrates， but a follow-up x-ray on 5/14/00 suggested diffuse interstitial infiltrates. Ultrasound (US) evalu-ation of the lower extremities showed no evidence for deep venous thrombosis. Gallbladder US and upper GI series on 5/8 and 5/9/00 were reported as normal.\n\n【15】Bone marrow biopsy done on 5/16/00 showed normal cellular marrow with trilineage hematopoiesis and mildly decreased iron stores. No malignancy was identified.\n\n【16】Needle biopsy of the liver done on 5/19/00 showed increased lymphocytes in the periportal areas. There was steatosis present and foci of intralobular col-lections of lymphocytes. There was no increase in fibrosis. It was interpreted as mild chronic hepatitis.\n\n【17】Table 11.3a Serial liver panel recorded in May， 2000.\n\n| Liver test  | 5/11/00  | 5/17/00  | 5/19/00  | 5/21/00  | 5/24/00  | Units  | Reference range  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| SGOT (AST)  | 51  | 196  | 214  | 148  | 206  | IU/L  | 15-46  |\n| SGPT (ALT)  | 97  | 132  | 123  | 110  | 141  | IU/L  | 11-66  |\n| Alkaline phosphatase  | 791  | 1075  | 953  | 1226  | 1700  | IU/L  | 38-126  |\n| Total bilirubin  | 0.56  | 2.01  | 5.15  | 6.57  | 3.32  | mg/DL  | 0.2-1.3  |\n| Conjugated bilirubin  | 0.12  | 0.93  | ND  | ND  | 1.68  | mg/DL  | 0.00-0.03  |\n| Albumin  | 1.7  | 2.0  | 1.8  | 1.7  | 2.1  | g/DL  | 3.1-5.1  |\n| Total protein  | 4.8  | 6.6  | 6.3  | 5.9  | 7.1  | g/DL  | 6.3-8.2  |\n\n【19】ALT， alanine aminotransferase； AST， aspartate aminotransferase； ND， not done or recorded； SGOT， serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase； SGPT， serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase.\n\n【20】Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) antibodies on 5/13/00 did not show elevation of IgM antibodies but serology for cytomegalovirus (CMV) IgM by immunofluores-cent antibody test was found to be elevated at 1：80 units (N<1：10). No CMVIgG result was available.\n\n【21】Acute hepatitis serology on 5/8/00 for A， B， and C was negative. The prothrombin time (PT) on 5/16/00 was elevated at 17.5 seconds， reflecting some coagulopathy. HIV serology screen on55/16/00 was negative while CD4 (helper/inducer T cell) was elevated at 68% or 2205 counts/cu mm 删除10：<u>(N720-1440)</u>.\n\n【22】Quantitative immunoglobulin levels (IgA， IgG， and IgM) were moderately elevated， with IgE levels particularly high at 11，600 KU/L (N <160.0 KU/L).

Qualitative rapid plasma reagin (RPR) test for syphilis was reactive at a low titer of 1：2，and C-reactive protein level was 5.1 mg/dL (N <0.8).\n\n【23】· Do you now have a specific diagnosis or how have you broadened your differential diag-noses?\n\n【24】Hospital course\n\n【25】A number of differential diagnoses were considered by the consultant： drug hypersensitivity reaction to phenytoin； autoimmune disease； reactive CMV disease； lymphoma or pseudo-lymphoma. Secondary syphilis was considered less likely because of the very low titer of RPR； typically with secondary syphilis， the RPR titer is high. The confirmatory fluorescent trepondemal antibody (FTA) test would turn out later to be negative. Liver or lymph node biopsy was to be recommended should the bone marrow (BM) biopsy done 2 days earlier turn out to be unrevealing or inconclusive.

What are the common causes of this condition?\n\n【6】iii. What is the prognosis and treatment?\n\n【7】Answer 29\n\n【8】i. This patient presents with erythema nodosum (EN), which is a form of panniculitis that is considered to be a delayed hypersensitivity reaction. It can occur at any age and is seen equally across different sex and races. Erythema nodosum characteristically presents as painful erythematous subcutaneous nodules, most often located symmetrically on the anterior shins, thighs and forearms. Occasionally, systemic symptoms can be associated with EN, including arthritis, arthralgia, fever and malaise.\n\n【9】ii. Erythema nodosum is often observed in the setting of various systemic diseases, although the largest proportion of cases (up to 50%) is categorized as idiopathic. Infections are common causes of EN, most commonly streptococcal infections and less often, bacterial gastroenteritis and viral upper respiratory tract infections. Other causes of EN include drugs such as estrogens and oral contraceptives, penicillin and biologic agents, sarcoidosis and inflammatory bowel disease, with a stronger association observed between EN and Crohn’s disease than with ulcerative colitis. Less common causes of EN include Chlamydia trachomatis infections, Mycoplasma pneumonia infections, tuberculosis, hepatitis B, Sweet’s syndrome and pregnancy.\n\n【10】In the setting of Crohn’s disease, EN can be seen prior to or contemporaneously with a flare. The presence of EN is considered as a prognostic factor in some instances; EN is associated with a more benign and self-limited form of sarcoidosis.\n\n【11】iii. The treatment of uncomplicated, mild EN consists of bed rest, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and potassium iodide. For more severe cases, colchicine, prednisone, dapsone and hydroxychloroquine have been used with success in a small series of patients.

His wife says that he has been recovering well； however， he has some behaviors which are concerning to her. For example， she must be standing on his right side in order for him to acknowledge her. When he eats， he only eats food of the right side of his plate. Looking at the patient， you realize he has only shaven the right side of his face. Physical examination is notable for a left facial droop， grade 2 strength of the left arm， and grade 3 strength of the left leg. When you call the patient's name while standing on his left， he turns his head to the right. The patient does not blink to threatening stimuli from the left side. The patient is asked to draw a clock and is only able to reproduce the right side.\n\n【1】What is the reason for this patient's behavior?\n\n【2】What other symptoms are frequently seen with a right MCA stroke?\n\n【3】What other tests can be used to elicit these symptoms?\n\n【4】Summary： A 67-year-old right-handed man presents with left-sided neglect follow-ing a right MCA stroke.\n\n【5】· Reason for the patient's behavior： Hemineglect， which is more common in patients with cerebral lesions on the right (33%-85%) rather than the left side of the brain (0%-24%).\n\n【6】· Other symptoms seen with a right MCA stroke： The motor deficits including weakness of the face and arm more than the leg. As with 95% of the right-handed population， Broca and Wernicke areas appear to be on the left in this patient and are therefore not affected by the stroke. Other language deficits include problems with prosody and nonverbal cues 删除25：<u></u>， behavior and attention (eg， extinction)， autonomic dysfunction， and hemianopia.\n\n【7】●Tests to elicit the symptoms of neglect： When patients are asked to bisect a line， they do so far to the right of center. If you show a photo or drawing to the patients and ask them to copy the image， they may copy only the right half of the image， or transfer the entire image to the right side of the paper. One may also ask the patient to verbally identify objects in the neglected field of vision. When asked to identify the right-sided limbs， patients may not be able to rec-ognize them as their own.\n\n【8】CLINICAL CORRELATION\n\n【9】Strokes provide important information about the function of the brain under normal as well as pathological circumstances. In this case， the stroke elucidated the impor-tance of the right brain in global spatial cognition. Overall， for the majority of patients the poststroke visuospatial dysfunction will resolve. For the remaining 10%-20% of patients who have difficulties lasting more than 3 months， rehabilitation and safety are the most concerning issues. The motor weakness secondary to stroke is compounded by the difficulties in rehab participation. For example， to have this patient practice strengthening his right arm muscles， he must first believe he has a right arm to move.\n\n【10】OBJECTIVES\n\n【11】1\\. Know the neuroanatomy involved in spatial cognition.\n\n【12】2\\. Predict how injuries to these areas will lead to challenges in spatial cognition.\n\n【13】3\\. Be familiar with the terminology and disorders of spatial cognition.\n\n【14】DEFINITIONS\n\n【15】EXTINCTION： Inattention to one stimulus when two stimuli are presented simultaneously.\n\n【16】VISUAL (HEMI)NEGLECT： Failure to give proper attention to the external environment.\n\n【17】HEMI-INATTENTION： Failure to give proper attention to one side of the per-sonal space.\n\n【18】CONSTRUCTIONAL APRAXIA： Inability to synthesize and comprehend dis-creet parts as a whole.\n\n【19】DRESSING APRAXIA： Inability to manage spatial aspects of dressing oneself； a manifestation of hemi-inattention.\n\n【20】PROSOPAGNOSIA： Inability to identify a familiar face， without injury to visual nervous system.\n\n【21】AGNOSIA： Inability to recognize and identify objects or persons despite intact memory knowledge of the objects or persons， and intact sensory function； generally limited to specific senses.\n\n【22】ALLESTHESIA： Consistently attributing of sensory stimulation on one side to stimulation of the other side.\n\n【23】IDEATIONAL APRAXIA： Improper sequencing of events (eg， drinking from a cup and then filling it).\n\n【24】In the majority of the population， the nondominant hemisphere is responsible for the composition and perception of spatial relations. This includes synthesizing individual parts of a visual image into a whole， as well as the perception of geomet-ric designs and esthetic patterns. Constructional apraxia describes the inability to synthesize discrete parts into a whole image. A cortical or subcortical lesion of the forebrain may have this result.\n\n【25】The function of the nondominant hemisphere includes the interpretation of extrapersonal space. Self-awareness in terms of pe J1121rsonal space and the conceptof one’s own body lies in the dominant parietal lobe. A lesion to this area leads to confusion of left vs right and an inability to identify body parts. This has to do with the posterior parietal lobe's function in the spatial localization of stimuli， which allows for the recognition of spatial relationships from the individual to an object， or between objects. Without this essential analysis of visuospatial information， the individual cannot orient herself or objects， nor can she navigate space appropriat1ely， s1S isecondary to an inability to interpret spatial relationships. The superior colliculus is also involved in the perception of an object’s location. Split brain studies suggest the function of the superior colliculus to be bilateral.\n\n【26】The posterior parietal lobe fixes visual attention on a particular stimulus of interest. Right-sided neglect， secondary to an assault to the left side of the brain， is generally accompanied by an aphasia and therefore may be difficult to detect.\n\n【27】Neglect， while generally thought to be secondary to a lesion of the parietal lobe， can also result from injury to the frontal lobe， thalamus， or caudate nucleus. The hemineglect syndrome embodied by the above example has multiple forms but can consist of hemineglect， hemi-inattention， visual extinction， allesthesia， anosogno-sia， anosodiaphoria， nonbelonging， visual-field defects， and gaze paresis.\n\n【28】Motor neglect refers to the under use of the side of the body contralateral to the cerebral insult. This may be mistaken for hemiparesis. With extraordinary care by the diagnostician， the patient may be encouraged to demonstrate function. Regard-less， on examination the affected side shows decreased withdrawal and a lack of routine movements， such as repositioning a limb when in an uncomfortable posi-tion. Likewise， when the patient falls toward the affected side， there is no reflexive effort to protect against injury. Attempts at rehabilitation may be successful， and a recent study indicated that limb activation and cueing may lead to a reduction in unilateral visual neglect.\n\n【29】Bilateral occipital temporal lesions result in visual agnosia. As the primary visual cortex is intact， the patient has normal visual fields and acuity； however， when a known object is presented visually， it cannot be named. The object can be verbalized when presented via other sensory modalities such as tactile， auditory， or olfactory. Occipitotemporal lesions may also lead to environmental agnosia.\n删除13：<u>CASE CORRELATES See Cases 41-49 (cognition).\n</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

She has mild swelling and erythema of her ankle, and pain on passive flexion of her wrist. Less than 1 mL of joint fluid is aspirated from her ankle, which shows 8000 polymorphonuclear (PMN) cells per high-power field (hpf) but no organisms on Gram stain.

Intravenous ceftriaxone\n\n【6】Answer: 21.1 E. The patient described best fits the picture of disseminated gonococcal infection. She has the rash, which typically is located on extensor surfaces of distal extremities. Pain on passive flexion of her wrist indicates likely tenosynovitis of that area. The fluid is inflammatory, but gonococci are typically not seen on Gram stain. Ceftriaxone is the usual treatment of choice for gonococcal infection. Nafcillin would be useful for staphylococcal arthritis and would be the more likely choice if she were older, had some chronic joint disease such as rheumatoid arthritis, or were immunocompromised. Gonococcal arthritis is the most common cause of infectious arthritis in patients younger than 40 years. Indomethacin or colchicine would be useful if she had a crystalline arthritis, but that is unlikely in this clinical picture.

Synovial fluid cultures usually are sterile in gonococcal arthritis (in fact, the arthritis is more likely caused by immune complex deposition than by actual joint infection), and blood cultures are positive less than 50% of the time.

Rapid clinical assessment is critical in case this patient is headed toward respiratory failure， perhaps necessitating endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. An ABG will quickly provide information regarding the adequacy of oxygenation status (Pao，) and ventilation (Paco，). A chest x-ray will determine the underlying status of the lung parenchyma and whether a trigger for the current situation can be identified.CHRONIC BRONCHITIS： COPD component that is diagnosed clinically and is characterized by excessive secretion of bronchial mucus and productive cough for3 months or more in at least 2 consecutive years in the absence of any other disease that might account for this symptom.\n\nCHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD)： Chronic air-flow obstruction caused by chronic bronchitis or emphysema.COPD is a prevent-able and treatable disease characterized by persistent airflow limitation that is usually progressive and associated with enhanced chronic inflammatory response in the lungs to noxious particles and gases. Diagnosis in the right clinical setting is usually supported by FEV /FVC ratio less than 0.7. Severity of COPD on spirom-etry is based on the level of FEV，/FVC ratio compared to the predicted value. The severity of airflow limitation can be classified based on postbronchodilator FEV.FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME IN 1 SECOND (FEV)： Volume of air expired in the first second during maximal expiratory effort. FEV is reduced in both obstructive lung disease (increased airway resistance) and restrictive lung dis-ease (low VC).| Table 15-1·CLASSIFICATION OF SEVERITY OF COPD BASED ON THE RESPONSE OF FEV TO BRONCHODILATORS  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Stage  | Severity  | FEV，(% predicted)  |\n| GOLD 1  | Mild  | \\>80%  |\n| GOLD 2  | Moderate  | 50%-79%  |\n| GOLD 3  | Severe  | 30%-49%  |\n| GOLD 4  | Very severe  | <30%  |\n\n【9】Abbreviations：FEV。 forced expiratory volume in 1 second； GOLD， Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease.The most common etiology for COPD is inhalation injury， specifically cigarette smoking. Another important cause is alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency， which is hered-itary； pulmonary disease may become evident by age 40 and may occur without cough or smoking history. Therapy by replacement of alpha-1 antitrypsin enzyme is available. Characteristically， patients with COPD present with progressively worsening dyspnea (first on exertion， then with activity， then at rest). Patients may vary in appearance from a\"blue bloater” (chronic bronchitis， overweight， edema-tous， cyanotic) to a\"pink puffer\" (emphysema， thin， ruddy cheeks).\n\n【10】Arterial blood gases often are normal in the early phase of the disease； however， in more advanced disease， there is evidence of hypoxemia and hypercapnia， often with a chronic compensated respiratory acidosis as a consequence of CO， reten-tion. Such chronic stable patients may have a Pao， near 50 mm Hg and a Paco， near 50 mm Hg， but a near-normal pH (the“50-50\" club). During an acute exac-erbation， more severe hypoxemia or hypercapnia， or respiratory acidosis noted on ABG， may be an indication of impending respiratory failure and need for ventila-tory support. Given an appropriate clinical context， general indications for measur-ing ABGs include low oxygen saturation on pulse oximetry (< 92%)， depressed level of consciousness， acute exacerbation， or assessment of hypercapnia in at-risk patients 30 to 60 minutes after supplemental oxygen is initiated.\n\nSpirometry is the most basic， inexpensive， widely valuable PFT to diagnose pulmonary diseases 删除33：<u></u>.

Restrictive lung diseases tend to have lower lung volumes (decreased TLC and VC)， whereas obstructive diseases have larger lung volumes (TLC normal or increased) with decreased expiratory flow rates (reduced FEV < 80% expected， and FEV，/FVC< 0.7). Specific parameters help to classify the type and degree of lung dysfunction . Reduced FEV /FVC with minimal response to bronchodilators is the hallmark of COPD.Figure 15-1.

She has several discrete subcuta-neous nodules but no organomegaly. A chest radiograph shows bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy but no lung or mediastinal masses. A biopsy of one of the skin nodules shows noncaseating granuloma.\n\n【5】Diagnostic considerations： Granulomatous diseases of the lung such as tuberculosis and sarcoidosis.\n\n【6】Confirmatory test： There is no single test for the definitive diagnosis of sarcoidosis； it is often a diagnosis of exclusion. Relevant investigations include elevated serum calcium and angiotensin-converting enzyme levels.\n\n【7】CLINICAL CORRELATION\n\n【8】This 35-year-old woman complains of a 2-month history of progressive dysp-nea， fatigue， and cough. She has subcutaneous nodules that on microscopy reveal noncaseating granulomas. She is African American， which is a risk fac-tor for sarcoidosis. Sarcoidosis is a multisystemic granulomatous disorder of unknown etiology that typically affects young adults， especially females. The chest radiographic finding of bilateral hilar adenopathy is also very character-istic of sarcoidosis. The liver and spleen often are enlarged in these patients. About one-third of affected patients have subcutaneous skin nodules or eye findings (iritis). The diagnosis of sarcoidosis is one of exclusion， and other causes of granulomas， such as tuberculosis and fungal infections， must be excluded.\n\n【9】APPROACH TO RESTRICTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE\n\n【10】Objectives\n\n【11】Describe the key features of sarcoidosis.\n\n【12】 Describe the causes of restrictive airway disease.\n\n【13】Describe the key manifestations of interstitial fibrosis.\n\n【14】Definitions\n\n【15】Obstructive airway disease： These are diseases in which there is obstruc-tion to air flow. Other obstructive diseases are chronic obstructive pul-monary disease (COPD) (irreversible obstructive airway disease) and bronchial asthma (reversible obstructive airway disease).\n\n【16】Restrictive airway disease： These are diseases in which there is diffuse and chronic involvement of pulmonary connective tissue. There is reduc-tion in oxygen diffusion capacity， lung volumes， and lung compliance.\n\n【17】DISCUSSION\n\n【18】Sarcoidosis\n\n【19】The most common presentation is respiratory symptoms or abnormalities discovered on chest x-ray. Bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy with lung mot-tling is a typical chest x-ray feature 删除25：<u></u>. Chest x-ray and com-puted tomography (CT) of the chest are likely to show involvement by the disease process. Lung function tests show a restrictive pattern of defect. Biopsy of the affected organs is likely to show noncaseating granulomas. These granulomas are composed of tightly clustered epithelioid cells， often with Langhans cells or foreign body giant cells. With chronic disease there is fibrosis. Other microscopic features that may be present are the presence of Schaumann bodies (laminated concretions of calcium and protein) and that of asteroid bodies (stellate inclusions in giant cells). As the histology of gran-ulomas caused by infectious diseases may be similar， special stains should be used to exclude them. These stains are typically acid-fast bacillus (AFB) to rule out Mycobacteria and Gomori methenamine silver (GMS) to rule out fungi. Serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) levels usually are ele-vated with this condition.\n\n【20】Skin sarcoidosis and ocular sarcoidosis are the most common extrapul-monary manifestations. These manifestations include erythema nodosum删除33：<u></u> and anterior uveitis. Sarcoid macrophages are responsible for 1-a-hydroxylation of vitamin D， with resultant 1，25-(OH)， vitamin D·This results in hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria. Levels of ACE are elevated in sarcoidosis. High levels also are seen in lymphoma， pulmonary tuberculo-sis， asbestosis， and silicosis. Although ACE levels are not of diagnostic value， they may be useful for monitoring the progression of disease.\n\n【21】Table 23-1\n\n【22】DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS OF BILATERAL HILAR LYMPHADENOPATHY\n\n| Sarcoidosis  |\n| --- |\n| Lymphoma  |\n| Pulmonary tuberculosis  |\n| Carcinoma of the bronchus with spread to the contralateral node  |\n\n【24】删除3：<u>Figure 23-1.

New York： McGraw-Hill， 2004：2019.)</u></u></u>\nRegardless of the specific type of restrictive lung disease 删除25：<u></u>， it is thought that the earliest manifestation of most of these conditions is alve-olitis. In alveolitis， there is increased accumulation of inflammatory cells that distorts the normal alveolar structure and also results in the liberation of harm-ful chemical mediators that injure parenchymal cells and stimulate fibrosis. Eventually， the alveoli are replaced by cystic air spaces separated by thick bands of connective tissue. This represents the end-stage lung， which also is referred to as “honeycomb lung.”\n\n【25】A progressive diffuse interstitial fibrosis occurs classically in progressive systemic sclerosis. Interstitial pneumonitis and fibrosis also may be seen in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis. Desquamative interstitial pneumonitis (DIP) typically affects males between ages 30 and 50years. It is usually a progressive disease that results in end-stage honeycomb lung that is unresponsive to medications such as steroids. Patients present with dyspnea， hypoxia， and clubbing. Crepitations are heard over the lung fields. Lung biopsy classically shows “temporal heterogeneity.\"This means there will be areas of unaffected lung， early lesions， and end-stage lung in the biopsy at\n\n【26】Table 23-2\n\n【27】SELECTED CAUSES OF RESTRICTIVE AIRWAY DISEASES\n\n| Sarcoidosis  |\n| --- |\n| Collagen-vascular diseases  |\n| Usual interstitial pneumonitis  |\n| Desquamative interstitial pneumonitis  |\n| Hypersensitivity pneumonitis  |\n| Dust lung diseases (pneumoconiosis)  |\n| Drugs  |\n\n【29】any point in time. DIP is characterized by the accumulation of intraalveolar macrophages with periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)-positive granules. Temporal het-erogeneity is absent， and patients do respond to steroids.\n\n【30】Hypersensitivity pneumonitis is thought to be due to immunologic mech-anisms related to inhalation of organic dusts and occupational antigens. The most well-known example of this type of pneumonitis is “farmer’s lung”This condition is due to the inhalation of spores of thermophilic actinomycete(Micropolyspora faeni). The spores are found on humid， warm hay. Typically， the patient will complain of dyspnea and wheezing several hours after expo-sure. Hypersensitivity pneumonitis is characterized histologically by granu-loma formation， which is useful in differentiating it from other types of pneumonitis.\n\n【31】Pneumoconiosis is dust lung disease 删除25：<u></u>.

DIAGNOSIS This patient has Horner syndrome (lesion) associated with dullness in the supraclavicular area indicating a Pancoast's tumour (aetiology). QUESTIONS What causes Horner syndrome? The syndrome is caused by the involvement of the sympathetic pathway. It starts in the sympathetic nucleus and travels through the brainstem and spinal cord to the level of C8/T1/T2 to the sympathetic chain， stellate 删除换行1 ganglion and carotid sympathetic plexus 删除10：<u>(Am JOphthalmol 1958；46：289-96)</u>). Its significance requires an understanding of the oculosympathetic pathway 3-neuron chain. The first-order nerve (FON) fibres descend from the hypothalamus without decussation to the thoracic spinal cord before synapsing with the second-order neurons (SON). The SONs exit the spine at the C8， T1 and T2 levels to enter the sympathetic chain and travel over the pleural cap of the lung and loop around the subclavian artery before synapsing near the carotid bifurcation. The final third-order neurons(TON) travel along the internal carotid artery to innervate the eyelids and the eye and also along the external carotid artery to innervate facial sweat glands.\n\n【21】What are the features of Horner syndrome?\n\n【22】It is characterized by：\n\n【23】miosis (resulting from paralysis of the dilator of the pupil) (partial ptosis or pseudo-ptosis (caused by paralysis of the upper tarsal muscle)\n\n【24】Q5Q\n\n【25】38Ptosis and Horner syndrome\n删除14：<u>A</u>删除14：<u>B</u>\n●enophthalmos (caused by paralysis of the muscle of Miiller) 删除换行1 often， slight elevation of the lower lid (because of paralysis of lower tarsal muscles).\n\n【26】What additional feature would you see in congenital Horner syndrome?\n\n【27】There would be heterochromia of the iris： the iris remains grey-blue.\n\n【28】How would you determine the level of lesion using only history?\n\n【29】The level of the lesion is determined by the distribution of the loss of sweating：\n\n【30】●Central lesion： sweating over the entire half of the head， arm and upper trunk is lost.\n\n【31】Lesions of the neck：\n\n【32】●Proximal to the superior cervical ganglion： diminished sweating on the face\n\n【33】Distal to the superior cervical ganglion： sweating is not affected.\n\n【34】ADVANCED-LEVEL QUESTIONS\n\n【35】How would you differentiate whether the lesion is above thesuperior ganglion (peripheral) or below the superior cervical ganglion (central)?\n\n| Test  | Above  | Below  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Sweating  | Such lesions may notaffect sweating at allas the main outflow tothe facial bloodvessels is below the superior cervical ganglion  | Such lesions affectsweating over theentire， head， neckand arm upper trunkLesions in the lowerneck affect sweatingover the entire face  |\n| Cocaine 4% in botheyes  | Dilates the normalpupil， no effect on theaffected side  | Dilates both pupils  |\n| Epinephrine删除10：<u>(adrenaline， 1：1000)</u>in both eves  | Dilates affected eye，no effect on normalside  | No effect on both sides  |\n\n【37】Note： In peripheral lesions there is depletion of amine oxidase as a result of postganglionic denervation.

Multiple myeloma (MM) must be on the differential diagnosis in any elderly patient with pathologic fractures. MM is a bone marrow neoplasm, specifically the plasma cell. The bone marrow biopsy findings are consistent with MM. Plasma cells can be seen throughout this image, recognized by their off-center nuclei and clock-face chromatin distribution. Also commonly seen on a blood smear are stacked RBCs, in what is known as a rouleaux formation. Because MM is a tumor arising from bone, it causes destructive bone lesions, which causes hypercalcemia.  \nAnswer A is incorrect . Aplastic anemia is a pancytopenia that manifests as anemia, thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia. Biopsies show a hypocellular marrow with fatty infiltration. This slide (image) has too many cells to represent aplastic anemia.  \nAnswer C is incorrect . Because MM is a tumor arising from within bone, it causes destructive bone lesions that result in elevated (not reduced) serum calcium levels.  \nAnswer D is incorrect . Lymphoma is a neoplastic disorder of the lymphoid tissue. There are many different types of lymphoma, two of the most distinctive histologic types being Burkitt lymphoma and Hodgkin lymphoma. Burkitt lymphoma shows a “starry sky” pattern on histology. This pattern is created by macrophage ingestion of tumor cells. Hodgkin lymphoma is distinguished by its Reed-Sternberg cells. The Reed-Sternberg cells are binucleate and display prominent nucleoli. There are no Reed-Sternberg cells in this image, and the clinical picture is more consistent with MM than lymphoma.  \nAnswer E is incorrect . While a slight increase in prostate-specific antigen is normal with aging, severely elevated levels indicate prostate cancer. It commonly metastasizes to the axial skeleton and can cause back pain and spinal cord compression. It causes osteoblastic lesions in bone, although the rib would be an unusual location.

Withdrawal symptoms usually， but not always， occur in stages： tremulous-ness or jitteriness (6-8 hours) (answer A)， psychosis and perceptual symp-toms (8-12 hours) (answer B)， seizures (12-24 hours) (answer C)， and DTs(24-72 hours， up to 1 week) (answer D). All symptoms should have resolved after more than one week (answer E).\n\n【25】43.3 C. Laboratory tests in alcoholics commonly show macrocytic anemia and elevated liver transaminase levels-particularly gamma-glutamyl trans-peptidase. Answer B (microcytic anemia) is more consistent with iron deficiency. The other answer choices (answer A， healed scar from previ-ous fall； answer D， slightly elevated AST with normal ALT； and answer E， MMSE score 28/30) are not contributory to the diagnosis of alcohol use disorder.\n\n【26】43.4 D. Although all these medications (answer A， alprazolam； answer B， chlor-diazepoxide； answer C， diazepam； and answer E， clonazepam) are benzodi-azepines， only lorazepam is metabolized solely by glucuronidation， which isIot as dependent on liver functioning. The metabolism of the other 删除换行1 benzodiazepines is much more dependent on liver function. In this patient(who has evidence of poor liver function)， using high doses of medications that are dependent on liver function for their degradation could result in excessive drug levels in the blood of an overly sedated patient.\n\n【27】CLINICALPEARLS\n\n【28】Alcohol withdrawal can occur within hours to days after heavy use and can include elevated vital signs， tremor， transient hallucinations，anxiety， and seizures.\n\n【29】The criteria (and symptoms) of alcohol withdrawal are identical to those for sedative-hypnotic withdrawal.\n\n【30】The treatment of choice for alcohol withdrawal is benzodiazepines. Anticonvulsants can also be used.\n\n【31】Benzodiazepines are not dependent on liver function， such as lorazepam， but are often preferred in the treatment of alcohol withdrawal.\n\n【32】Other medical conditions such as hypoglycemia and diabetic ketoaci-dosis may also cause symptoms similar to alcohol withdrawal.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Insulin is considered most potent among antihyperglycemic agents 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. The AHA/HFSA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u> scientific statement discussed preference for other agents, such as metformin and SGLT-2i, if adequate glycemic control can be achieved without insulin. The ADA Standards of Medical Care-2021 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u> stated that a GLP-1 RA is “preferred to insulin” in T2DM when possible, and a basal insulin and GLP-1 RA can be a valuable combination . However, there are times when insulin may be needed for certain patients with T2DM, such as for those experiencing weight loss, symptoms, and severe hyperglycemia, such as HbA <sub>1c </sub> over 9–10% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 \\]</u> and high glucoses (>300 mg/dL) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. The ADA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u> Standards of Medical Care-2021 and AACE/ACE 2020 algorithm 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u> both described ASCVD effects for insulin as neutral, and the ADA noted neutral HF effects. Insulin use has been associated with fluid retention 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>, which is an important consideration for the patient with HF.\n\n【24】A variety of insulin products are available with various onsets, peaks, and duration of actions, and most are injected via a vial and syringe or insulin pen (there is one inhaled insulin option at the time of writing). There are long-acting, intermediate-acting, short-acting, and rapid-acting insulin options. Assorted types of premixed human and analog insulins (such as 70/30, 75/25, 50/50) are also available. Analog insulins are considered to offer more precise and physiologic pharmacokinetic properties (onset, peak, and duration of action) and less hypoglycemia than human insulin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. A basal insulin may be initially selected for some patients with T2DM. Administration of an insulin indicated for use at mealtime (such as rapid-acting insulin) for one or more meals may be considered when greater treatment intensity is indicated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. Insulin type and doses should be individualized and adjusted at regular intervals as needed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【25】Some potential disadvantages of insulin therapy are hypoglycemia, weight gain (described as about 2–6 pounds more than other agents) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>, and fluid retention 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Some patients with DM have a high degree of insulin resistance and may require high doses of insulin, and an endocrinology consult can be a very helpful resource and guide for those requiring complex insulin regimens. Some potential benefits and risks to be considered with insulin are highlighted in Fig. 12.8 .\n\n【26】A graphic design to list the risks and benefits of insulin. The risks are, hypoglycemia risk, weight gain, and fluid retention superscript 2. The benefits are, higher efficacy, most potent, and variety of options.\n\n【27】删除3：<u>Fig. 12.8\n\n【28】Some potential benefits and risks for insulin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 , 11 \\]</u> (individual factors and priorities can shift the weight for the final decision)</u>\n\n【29】### 12.3.9 Combination Therapy\n\n【30】T2DM is progressive, and combination therapy comprised of medications with complementary actions is often necessary to address multiple pathophysiologic defects of T2DM 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u> and meet glycemic goals 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 , 11 \\]</u>. In general, the ADA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u> Standards of Medical Care-2021 recommended combining metformin with one of these six preferred treatment options: sulfonylurea, TZD, DPP-4 inhibitor, SGLT2 inhibitor, GLP-1 RA, or basal insulin; drug-specific effects and patient factors should guide drug selection. As noted in the ADA’s T2DM algorithm, many diabetes medications are compatible in combination, but not all 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. For example, combination of a DPP-4i and GLP-1 RA was not listed among recommended options in the ADA Standards of Medical Care-2021 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Risk for hypoglycemia and weight gain is further increased when a sulfonylurea and insulin are combined 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. The AACE/ACE 2020 insulin algorithm recommended providers consider discontinuing or reducing the dose of a sulfonylurea after starting basal insulin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. Further, even though metformin, GLP1-RA, SGLT2i, DPP4i, and TZD have lower hypoglycemia risks, if any of these are combined with insulin, the AACE/ACE recommended considering a lower dose of either drug to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>.\n\n【31】12.4 Conclusion\n---------------\n\n【32】Individualizing pharmacotherapy and weighing risks and benefits are important steps in diabetes management. There are a variety of factors that may make one drug a better fit for a particular patient. For those with cardiovascular disease, certain drugs may have compelling indications. As discussed, GLP-1 receptor agonists and SGLT-2 inhibitors have important cardiovascular benefits for patients with T2DM 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>, and SGLT-2 inhibitors should be considered for those with T2DM and HFrEF 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 4 , 10 \\]</u>, due to their beneficial effects and potential to reduce hospitalizations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【33】Though this chapter focuses on management of T2DM for those with HF, it is important to note that some SGLT-2 inhibitors, such as dapagliflozin and empagliflozin, have indications for HF, even without a diagnosis of T2DM 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 26 , 27 \\]</u>. The 2022 AHA/ACC/HFSA HF guideline recommended SGLT2i for patients with symptomatic chronic HFrEF to reduce hospitalization for HF and cardiovascular mortality, irrespective of the presence of T2DM 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 22 \\]</u>. In addition, this guideline added SGLT2i as a component of guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) for HFrEF 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 22 \\]</u>. The American College of Cardiology’s (ACC) 2021 Expert Consensus Decision Pathway update outlined indications for an SGLT2i in HF (in conjunction with a background of GDMT), including: HfrEF (EF < 40%) with or without T2DM and NYHA class II–IV HF 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 27 \\]</u>.\n\n【34】The AHA/HFSA scientific statement stated, “There are many unanswered questions regarding the epidemiology, pathobiology, optimal pharmacotherapy, and co-disease management strategies for patients with DM and HF” \\[ 2 , p. e313\\]. Further, DM and HF treatment options and recommendations are expected to change over time, as research reveals new information and new drugs are developed. Because of the dynamic nature of this content, it is important for providers to stay abreast of changes in updated, evidence-based literature and prescribing resources. There have been many exciting findings for some T2DM and HF therapies, and it will be interesting to see what new breakthroughs may be revealed in the future.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Pruritus is often present and may be ­localized or generalized. The condition is aggravated during the winter months by low humidity, cold and windy weather, dry heat, and excessive bathing.\n\n【25】Although xerosis may be triggered by drugs or physical health problems, it is usually not associated with a systemic disease. Nonetheless, a history of preexisting diseases, conditions, therapies, and medications may contribute to making the elderly more susceptible to xerosis. Such a history may include prior irradiation, advanced renal disease, zinc or essential fatty acid deficiencies, thyroid disease, diuretic therapy, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and malignancies 删除10：<u>(Norman 2003 )</u>.

Creams and moisturizers should be applied after getting out of the bathtub or shower. At that time, the body should be patted with a towel and the moisturizing preparation applied within a few minutes. Under these conditions, the skin is fully hydrated and the moisturizing preparation is more effective in preventing epidermal water loss.\n\n【45】Humectant moisturizers containing urea and lactic acid may not be tolerated because of irritation but are very effective in improving keratinocyte moisture retention and integrity. Topical corticosteroids can be selectively used if there are inflamed areas of skin (i.e. pink or red, not just dry and scaly). For many over-the-counter, all-purpose moisturizers, an inverse correlation between efficacy and cost has been demonstrated.\n\n【46】Prognosis\n---------\n\n【47】This condition tends to be chronic, but can be effectively treated with the above measures.\n\n【48】Key Points\n----------\n\n【49】   Xerotic dermatitis is a common and chronic condition in the elderly that is defined as dry, itchy skin.\n   Consistent use of appropriate dry skin care regimens that include moisturizers and gentle cleansers is the cornerstone of management.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Palpation of the supraclavicular regions shows a hard nontender irregular mass on the left side.\n\n【8】• Most likely diagnosis: Lung cancer with a left-side supraclavicular metastatic node\n\n【9】• Anatomical explanation for this particular mass: Lymphatic drainage through the thoracic duct to the left brachiocephalic vein\n\n【10】### CLINICAL CORRELATION\n\n【11】This smoker complains of hemoptysis , the expectoration of bright red blood, for 1 week. This is very suspicious for lung cancer. In addition, he has a hard irregular mass in the left supraclavicular region. This is most likely malignant metastasis to lymph nodes in this area. Because lymph draining the abdomen, thorax, and lower extremities is directed through the thoracic duct into the left subclavian vein, the most common location of supraclavicular node involvement is the left side.\n\n【12】### APPROACH TO:\n\n【13】#### The Neck: Lymphatics\n\n【14】### OBJECTIVES\n\n【15】1\\. Be able to describe general patterns of lymphatic drainage in the body\n\n【16】2\\. Be able to distinguish lymphatic flow through the supraclavicular nodes from flow through other nodes in the neck\n\n【17】### DEFINITIONS\n\n【18】HEMOPTYSIS: Coughing up blood\n\n【19】PALPATION: Technique of physical examination that uses the hands or fingers to sense involuntary muscle tightening due to pain, or masses\n\n【20】METASTASIS: Spread of disease from one part of the body to another, the term generally used to describe the spread of cancer cells\n\n【21】### DISCUSSION\n\n【22】The lymphatic system complements the venous system as a pathway for return of serum constituents to the heart. Blood flows from the lungs to the periphery by the pumping action of the heart. In the closed vascular system, the venous system forms from the capillaries, the vessels with the smallest diameter. The blood is drained into increasingly large veins as it is transported back to the heart and lungs. However, not all constituents of the extracellular fluid are captured into the venous system. A secondary pathway is through the lymphatic system. These fine vessels form from plexuses in tissues and, like veins, form vessels of increasing diameter. Unlike veins, however, the lymphatic vessels are not continuous channels. Instead, they are interrupted by lymph nodes , which contain dense aggregations of white blood cells.\n\n【23】In general, lymphatics from below the diaphragm on both sides of the body drain into the cisterna chyli and then to the thoracic duct. This is a particularly important pathway for fat droplets that are absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract after a meal. The thoracic duct ascends in the posterior mediastinum to drain into the venous system at the junction between the left subclavian and internal jugular veins. Above the diaphragm, including the head and neck, lymphatics on the left side also drain into the thoracic duct. On the right side , the vessels drain into the smaller right lymphatic duct, which drains variably into the right subclavian vein.\n\n【24】In the neck, lymphatic vessels flow from superficial to deep, paralleling the major veins. Several clusters of lymph nodes have been distinguished and divided into superficial and deep groups. In general, flow is from superior to inferior and from superficial to deep. However, the inferior deep group, which lies along the inferior portion of the internal jugular and subclavian veins, also drains the upper extremity, thorax, and abdomen.\n\n【25】The lymphatic system is important for understanding the spread of cancer 删除33：<u></u>. Unlike veins, the contractile force of the heart exerts no hydrostatic pressure in lymphatic vessels. Lymph moves by compression from surrounding tissues. Few lymphatic vessels have valves, so flow is highly variable. Transformed cells from one tissue can migrate through the lymphatics to adjacent tissues. Tumor cells will frequently proliferate within lymph nodes and cause the nodes to enlarge. In the neck, the supraclavicular nodes are frequently referred to as the sentinel nodes because their enlargement can be the first sign of cancer originating in the thorax or abdomen.\n\n【26】删除3：<u>Figure 39-1.

To enable evaluation of the palatal elevation, the patient is asked to “say ah.” The muscles used to perform palatal elevation are derived from which of the following embryologic structures?\n\n【1】> (A) Branchial arches 1 and 2\n\n【2】> (B) Branchial arches 3 and 4\n\n【3】> (C) Branchial arches 4 and 6\n\n【4】> (D) Branchial clefts 1 and 2\n\n【5】> (E) Branchial pouches 3 and 4\n\n【6】 Answer: The correct answer is B. The muscles that elevate the palate are derived from branchial arch 3 (the stylopharyngeus) and branchial arch 4 (the levator veli palatini). These are innervated by cranial nerves IX and X, respectively.  \nAnswer A is incorrect. The first branchial arch generates “M” muscles: muscles of M astication (te M poralis, M asseter, M edial and lateral pterygoids) and the M ylohyoid. The second arch gives rise to “S” muscles: S tapedius, S tylohyoid, and facial expression muscles. None of these muscles is involved in palatal elevation.  \nAnswer C is incorrect. Although branchial arch 4 does give rise to the levator veli palatini, branchial arch 6 gives rise to the intrinsic muscles of the larynx (except the cricothyroid, which is a fourth arch derivative). These muscles are not involved in elevating the palate.  \nAnswer D is incorrect. The first branchial cleft gives rise to the external auditory meatus, and the second, third, and fourth clefts are obliterated during development. The clefts are formed from ectoderm and could not give rise to muscles, which are derived from mesoderm.  \nAnswer E is incorrect. Branchial pouch 3 gives rise to the thymus (ventral wings) and inferior parathyroid glands (dorsal glands), and the fourth branchial pouch gives rise to the superior parathyroids. These are not involved in palatal elevation. Remember that pouches give rise to endoderm-derived tissue, and arches give rise to mesoderm-derived tissue such as muscle. Use the mnemonic “CAP” to remember that C lefts, A rches, and P ouches give rise to ecto-, meso-, and endoderm, respectively.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

For the past 2 months she has felt run down. She says that she doesn’t feel like participating in activities that she previously enjoyed, such as her weekly softball games. She has not been sleeping well and has not had much of an appetite. On questioning, she admits to feeling “down in the dumps” most of the time and has found herself crying frequently. She has never gone through anything like this before. She denies any thoughts of wanting to hurt herself or anyone else. She denies any symptoms now or previously of mania. She also denies any visual/auditory hallucinations, paranoia, delusions, or other psychotic symptoms. Other than becoming tearful during her interview, her physical examination is normal. Her blood tests, including a complete blood count and thyroid function, are normal. A serum pregnancy test is negative. You diagnose her as having a major depression and, along with referring her for counseling, start her on fluoxetine.\n\n【2】 What is the mechanism of action of fluoxetine?\n\n【3】 What are the common side effects of fluoxetine?\n\n【4】ANSWERS TO CASE 15:\n\n【5】Antidepressant Agents\n\n【6】Summary: A 30-year-old woman with major depression is prescribed fluoxetine.\n\n【7】 Mechanism of action of fluoxetine: Inhibition of the reuptake of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) at the prejunctional nerve terminal.\n\n【8】 Common side effects: Headache, nausea, agitation, insomnia, and sexual disturbances (loss of libido and erectile dysfunction).\n\n【9】#### CLINICAL CORRELATION\n\n【10】Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the most frequently prescribed antidepressant medications. They act by inhibiting the reuptake of serotonin by the prejunctional nerve terminal, allowing more serotonin to interact with post-junctional neurons in the central nervous system (CNS). This is thought to mediate their therapeutic effect. They have been highly effective in the treatment of major depressive disorders and have an excellent safety profile. Unlike tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), which have multiple severe and potentially fatal effects in an overdose, SSRIs have relatively few severe toxicities and a very low potential for fatality in an overdose. SSRIs do have several side effects of clinical significance. They often cause headache and gastrointestinal (GI) side effects such as nausea. In some cases, agitation, anxiety, and insomnia can be exacerbated. Many of these SSRI side effects tend to be temporary and can often be improved with dose reduction. Another common side effect of SSRIs is sexual disturbance. Decreased libido and erectile dysfunction occur frequently and do not generally spontaneously resolve while continuing SSRI therapy, often leading to reduced patient compliance. When diagnosing and treating depression, it is imperative to distinguish between unipolar versus bipolar depression. Agents used for unipolar depression (which major depression fits under) can cause an exacerbation of manic symptoms if used alone for major depression.\n\n【11】APPROACH TO:\n\n【12】Pharmacology of Antidepressant Drugs\n\n【13】#### OBJECTIVES\n\n【14】1\\. List the classes of antidepressant agents.\n\n【15】2\\. Contrast the mechanisms of action of the antidepressant agents.\n\n【16】3\\. Contrast the adverse effects and toxicities of the antidepressant agents.\n\n【17】4\\. Describe the indications and contraindications to antidepressant drug use.\n\n【18】#### DEFINITIONS\n\n【19】Major depressive disorder: Unexplained, long-term difficulty coping with life events characterized by an inability to experience pleasure, abnormal sleep, decreased libido and appetite, feelings of guilt, and suicidal ideation.\n\n【20】#### DISCUSSION\n\n【21】##### Class\n\n【22】Drugs used to treat depression are classified as SSRIs, serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), TCAs and tetracyclics, and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). Other conditions for which certain antidepressant agents are used include panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), bipolar affective disorder, chronic pain, and enuresis.\n\n【23】SSRIs are the most extensively prescribed antidepressant agents because, unlike tricyclic agents, they produce less sedation, have fewer antimuscarinic effects, and are safer in an overdose. Nevertheless, they may cause sexual disturbances, GI dysfunction, headache, and stimulation (insomnia, tremor, and anxiety).\n\n【24】TCAs may cause sedation, tremor, insomnia, blurred vision, constipation, urinary hesitancy, weight gain, and sexual disturbances. The MAOIs may cause weight gain, sexual disturbances, and sleep disturbances. Bupropion is contraindicated in patients with seizure disorders .\n删除4：<u>Table 15–1 • ANTIDEPRESSANT AGENTS</u>\n\n【25】Drug interactions of TCAs include additive sedative effects with other sedatives, particularly alcohol. MAOIs, by increasing catecholamine stores, sensitize patients to indirectly acting sympathomimetic agents, including tyramine that is contained in many fermented foodstuffs (red wine or aged cheese). Together MAOIs and sympathomimetics agents can result in a severe and sometimes fatal hypertensive episode. MAOIs and SSRIs can interact to cause a potentially lethal serotonin syndrome that includes tremor, hyperthermia, muscle rigidity, and cardiovascular collapse. All antidepressant agents now carry a “black-box warning” of an increased risk of suicidality, especially when used in children and adolescents.\n\n【26】##### Structure\n\n【27】TCAs have a three-ring nucleus similar to that of the antipsychotic phenothiazine agents. The MAOIs are subclassified as hydrazides (phenelzine) or nonhydrazides (tranylcypromine).\n\n【28】##### Mechanism of Action\n\n【29】The therapeutic activity of most of the available therapeutic antidepressant agents is due, at least in part, to their actions on norepinephrine and serotonin.\n\n【30】As the name implies, SSRIs selectively block the prejunctional neuronal uptake transporters in the CNS that terminate serotonin neurotransmission, thus allowing increased activity at serotonin receptors. SNRIs block the reuptake of both serotonin and norepinephrine.\n\n【31】The TCAs also block the prejunctional neuronal uptake transporters in the CNS that terminate norepinephrine and serotonin neurotransmission, thus allowing increased activity at their respective receptors. Amoxapine also blocks dopamine receptors.\n\n【32】The atypical agents have a variety of pharmacodynamic effects. Some act similar to the TCAs, whereas others act as inhibitors at certain subtypes of the serotonin receptor (trazodone, mirtazapine, nefazodone). Mirtazapine also blocks the prejunctional α <sub>2 </sub> \\-adrenoceptor to enhance serotonin and norepinephrine neurotransmission.\n\n【33】The MAOIs essentially irreversibly bind to and inhibit the activity of monoamine oxidase (A and B forms). New enzyme must be synthesized to restore activity. As a result of their actions, both drugs prevent prejunctional metabolism of norepinephrine and serotonin, thus allowing more to accumulate and to be released on nerve stimulation.\n\n【34】The neurochemical and biochemical actions described for the antidepressant agents occur soon after their administration. However, the therapeutic effect of these drugs may not be apparent for up to several weeks with continued administration. Thus, considerable attention has been devoted to discovering the long-term neurochemical and biochemical actions of the antidepressant agents that may correlate better with their clinical effectiveness.\n\n【35】The antidepressant agents also produce a myriad of adverse effects that, depending on the agent, may be caused by blockade of histamine receptors, adrenoceptors, and cholinergic receptors in the peripheral and central nervous systems 删除25：<u></u>.\n\n【36】##### Administration\n\n【37】Dosing, which may be by the oral or parenteral routes, is determined empirically in relation to the therapeutic response and the patient’s tolerance of adverse effects. Selegeline transdermal is the only antidepressant available in a patch formulation.\n\n【38】##### Pharmacokinetics\n\n【39】Metabolism of the SSRI fluoxetine results in an active metabolite, norfluoxetine, which has a long half-life. Fluoxetine and paroxetine inhibit a number of liver microsomal enzymes, particularly P450 2D6, that can cause clinically significant drug-drug interactions. Nefazodone inhibits cytochrome P450 3A4, which can result in increased levels of other drugs that are dependent on this metabolic pathway for their inactivation.\n\n【40】Monodemethylation by the liver of the tertiary amines TCAs amitriptyline and imipramine results in, respectively, the active metabolites nortriptyline and desipramine. Venlafaxine has an active metabolite, O \\-desmethylvenlafaxine.\n\n【41】####", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

The etiology is currently unknown. Its texture is rubbery and the color can range from gray, to yellow, to orange 删除10：<u>(Abdul-Karim et al. 1992 ; Abimelec et al. 1996 )</u>. Histologically, the tumor cells are infiltrated with a mixture of synovial cells, multinucleated giant cells, macrophages, and xanthoma cells.\n\n【30】Giant cell tumors of tendon sheath typically occur in males. These tumors can be categorized into two different types: localized and diffuse. The localized form is most common and usually affects the upper extremities, with a preference for the flexor surface of both the hand and wrist 删除10：<u>(Jones et al. 1969 )</u>. The rare diffuse form is related to diffuse pigmented villonodular synovitis (PVNS) and has a predilection for the lower extremities, most frequently around the patella. PVNS is more aggressive clinically, and tends to recur even after surgical removal 删除10：<u>(Murphey et al. 2008 )</u>.\n\n【31】This is a diagnosis by biopsy. Plain radiographs are beneficial in half of cases and may demonstrate cortical erosion of the underlying bone, especially if the tumor is particularly painful.\n\n【32】The treatment of choice for a giant cell tumor of tendon sheath is careful surgical excision, although recurrences can occur between 9–44% of the time.

The patient has a likely diagnosis of basal cell carcinoma. It is characterized by pink or flesh-colored pearly papules found in sun-exposed areas; the papules are locally invasive but usually non-metastatic. Histology shows islands of tumor within mucinous dermis, as show in the image. There is a purely basaloid population with minimal stromal response. Areas of palisading nuclei, or small fusiform cells with little cytoplasm and hyperchromic dense nuclei, are characteristic of the disease.  \nAnswer A is incorrect. Actinic keratosis is a premalignant lesion characterized by small, rough erythematous or brownish papules. It is commonly found in sun-exposed areas and is a precursor to squamous cell carcinoma.  \nAnswer C is incorrect. Dermatitis herpetiformis is a dermatologic condition associated with celiac disease that is characterized by pruritic papules and vesicles.  \nAnswer D is incorrect. Melanoma commonly presents with a dysplastic nevus that has undergone malignant transformation. It is commonly found in sun-exposed areas. However, histology would show tumor cells with large nuclei located directly below the epidermis.  \nAnswer E is incorrect.

Occurs with minor trauma in  删除换行1 haemophiliacs  删除换行5 Examination of the joint fluid is often required to aid the diagnosis. The gold standard for  删除换行1 diagnosis of septic arthritis is joint aspiration to identify an organism. In some instances  删除换行1 this may be difficult, and image-guided aspiration is recommended. The samples should be  删除换行1 sent for microscopy, culture, and sensitivity; tuberculosis (TB) culture (if clinically indicated) 删除换行1 and molecular testing (polymerase chain reaction [PCR]) if the patient has already started  删除换行1 antibiotics. The microscopy will give an initial result of the cell count and a Gram stain. The  删除换行1 cell count will identify whether white blood cells (indicating inflammation or infection) or red  删除换行1 blood cells (indicating haemarthrosis) are present. The Gram stain may identify organisms  删除换行1 present in the fluid. Polarised light microscopy is required to look for crystals. Microscopy  删除换行1 is fairly quick and cheap. However, it is not very sensitive in identifying the pathogen (50%  删除换行1 sensitivity). These initial results could guide empiric therapy while waiting for culture results  删除换行1 for a more targeted therapy. In instances where antibiotics are given prior to the aspiration,  删除换行1 organisms may be seen but will not grow on the culture media. When this occurs, molecular  删除换行1 tests (e.g. 16s PCR) could help identify the organism.\nIn this patient, aspiration was performed, and the microscopy showed a high white blood  删除换行1 cell count and Gram-positive cocci in clusters and chains. Culture results the next day grew \n\n【21】Staphylococcus aureus. Microscopy for crystals was negative.\nSeptic arthritis is an infection of the joint space and is most often monoarticular. It carries  删除换行1 significant morbidity to the patient and could lead to destruction of the infected joint. It can  删除换行1 also extend into the bone, leading to osteomyelitis. Septic arthritis is most commonly due to  删除换行1 bacterial infection, but may occasionally be caused by mycobacteria, fungi or viruses.\nThere are many predisposing factors for septic arthritis, and these include age, prosthetic  删除换行1 joints, diabetes mellitus, underlying arthritis and recent procedures to the affected joint.\nThe most common route of infection is haematogenous spread; however, direct inoculation  删除换行1 of bacteria to the joint following procedures or trauma is also common. Septic arthritis is  删除换行1 caused by many pathogens, the most common of which is S. aureus, followed by streptococci.In sexually active young adults, it is important to consider gonococcal arthritis caused by  删除换行5 Neisseria gonorrhoeae. The usual presentation is that of a painful, warm, red and swollen joint,  删除换行1 the most common site being the knee.\nTreatment of septic arthritis requires appropriate surgical drainage and antibiotic therapy.\nTreatment with antibiotics is usually for a prolonged period. Patients are usually kept for a  删除换行1 minimum of 2 weeks of parenteral antibiotics that are then switched to an oral option for a Case 86: A Painful Knee 267  删除换行1 further 2 weeks. The duration will vary depending on the pathogen isolated and response to  删除换行1 treatment.\nRadiography is usually normal on admission.

Deoxygenation of HbS leads to distortion of  删除换行1 the red blood cell into the classic sickle shape. The sickle cells are much less deformable than  删除换行1 normal red cells and can obstruct the microcirculation. This results in tissue hypoxia, which  删除换行1 causes further sickling. Patients with a sickle cell crisis should be treated with high-flow oxygen,  删除换行1 opioid analgesia and fluid resuscitation. If the precipitating factor is thought to be infective,  删除换行1 then intravenous antibiotics should be started.\n删除26：<u>!</u> Causes of sickle cell crisis\n\n【23】•\tDehydration\n\n【24】•\tBleeding\n\n【25】•\tInfection\n\n【26】•\tHypoxia\n\n【27】•\tCold exposure\n\n【28】•\tDrug and alcohol use\n\n【29】•\tPregnancy and stress\n\n【30】Limb and back pain are common presentations for sickle cell sufferers.

It has been present for some years but she can now only  删除换行1 stand for a short time before feeling uncomfortable. It is not noticeable at night. She has had  删除换行1 four vaginal deliveries. She had her menopause at 52 years and took hormone-replacement  删除换行1 therapy for several years for vasomotor symptoms. She has not had any postmenopausal  删除换行1 bleeding and has not had a smear for several years.\n\n【3】She is generally constipated and sometimes finds she can only defecate by placing her fingers into the vagina and compressing a ‘bulge’ she can feel. She has mild frequency and gets  删除换行1 up twice most nights to pass urine. There is no dysuria or haematuria. Occasionally she  删除换行1 does not get to the toilet in time and leaks a small amount of urine, but this does not worry  删除换行1 her unduly.\n\n【4】Medically she is very well and does not take any medications regularly. She lives alone and  删除换行1 does her own shopping and housework.\n\n【5】Examination\n\n【6】On examination she appears well. Blood pressure and heart rate are normal. She is of average  删除换行1 build. The abdomen is soft and non-tender. There is a loss of vulval anatomy consistent with  删除换行1 atrophic changes. On examination in the supine position there is a mild prolapse. On standing, the cervix is felt at the level of the introitus. There is a large posterior wall prolapse and a  删除换行1 minimal anterior wall prolapse.\n\n【7】Questions\n\n【8】• What is the diagnosis for her discomfort and pain?\n\n【9】• How could the prolapse be more thoroughly assessed?\n\n【10】• How would you manage this patient?\n\n【11】ANSWER 20\n\n【12】The diagnosis is of second-degree uterovaginal prolapse with rectocoele. Prolapse is traditionally categorized according to the level of descent of the cervix in relation to the introitus:\n\n【13】• first degree: descent within the vagina\n\n【14】• second degree: descent to the introitus\n\n【15】• third degree: descent of the cervix outside the vagina\n\n【16】• procidentia: complete eversion of the vagina outside the introitus.\n\n【17】A more thorough assessment using the Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification (POP-Q)\nSystem is now standard practice. It is a validated tool to quantify, describe and stage pelvic support. The hymen is used as the main reference point with measurements taken (and  删除换行1 recorded on a grid) from six defined reference points plus three further measurements, with  删除换行1 positive or negative numbers assigned according to whether the reference points are located  删除换行1 above or below the hymen.\n\n【18】Common presenting symptoms are of ‘something coming down’, a ‘lump’ or a dragging sensation. Symptoms are always worse on standing or walking because of the effect of gravity.\nProlapse is more common in women who are parous, have had long or traumatic deliveries,  删除换行1 have a chronic cough or constipation. However it may occur in any woman, even if she is nulliparous, as it relates to collagen strength.\n\n【19】Management\n\n【20】Initial management involves treating the constipation with dietary manipulation and laxatives. This may relieve some of the symptoms and is also important to prevent recurrence if  删除换行1 surgery is to be performed.\n\n【21】Pelvic floor exercises are helpful for mild prolapse and to preserve the integrity of repair  删除换行1 postoperatively, though in this case they are unlikely to make any significant difference to the  删除换行1 presenting symptoms. If surgery is not wanted then she can try a ring pessary to hold up the  删除换行1 prolapse, which can work extremely well and only needs replacing every 6 months.\n\n【22】Although she is 83 this woman has no medical problems and should be offered definitive prolapse surgery which for her involves vaginal hysterectomy and posterior vaginal wall repair  删除换行1 (colporrhaphy). As there is no abdominal incision involved, recovery is quick and she would  删除换行1 expect to be in hospital for around 3 days.\n\n【23】KEY POINTS\n\n【24】• Prolapse incidence increases with age, parity, constipation and chronic cough.\n\n【25】• Conservative management with a ring pessary, or surgical prolapse repair may be  删除换行1 appropriate.\n\n【26】• Relief of exacerbating factors is important to prevent symptoms worsening or to  删除换行1 maintain the integrity of the repair.Case 21: Postoperative confusion", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

During this time the  删除换行1 practice has had a change in staff; they have had to replace the practice manager, one GP  删除换行5 retired and another emigrated to Canada. Despite advertising to fill their positions, there has  删除换行1 not been any interest. Workload has increased due to the building of a new nursing home  删除换行1 and housing estate within the practice boundaries. Financial income is beginning to suffer as  删除换行1 there is not enough time to meet additional government targets. Although she has previously  删除换行1 enjoyed her job, Ruth is becoming emotionally exhausted by the constant stream of patients –  删除换行1 both the chronically ill and the worried well. Last week she overheard one of the secretaries  删除换行1 telling the receptionist that there was concern that patients were beginning to notice that  删除换行1 she was less interested in their problems and some had even mentioned that they found her  删除换行1 manner quite curt.\n\n【1】Questions\n\n【2】• In an increasingly stretched NHS, how important is compassion?\n\n【3】• Is compassion something that can be faked?\n\n【4】• How does burnout affect compassion?\n\n【5】ANSWER 79\n\n【6】Compassion is considered an emotive response to the suffering of others which motivates a  删除换行1 desire to provide support and help. The nature of healthcare means that most clinicians are  删除换行1 naturally empathetic and compassionate people who thrive themselves by being able to help  删除换行1 others. But in modern-day medicine could compassion be considered more of a hindrance to  删除换行1 clinical care than an essential attribute? Is demonstrating compassion something that can be  删除换行1 taught whilst simultaneously ensuring that clinicians learn to keep themselves emotionally  删除换行1 detached from their patients? Analogies have been made between frontline medicine – general  删除换行1 practice and A&E departments – and battlefields. Constant exposure to sustained levels of  删除换行1 human suffering, complex conditions and a loss of autonomy over working conditions is leading to higher rates of clinician burnout. One critical symptom of burnout is a loss of emotional  删除换行1 integrity and compassion. The clinician becomes so overwhelmed by absorbing the emotions  删除换行1 of others that subconscious barriers go up as a self-protective mechanism. This in turn can be  删除换行1 significantly detrimental to the patient, who will not feel listened to or cared about.\n\n【7】Ironically, it is often the most compassionate clinicians who burn out quickest, and in the current work environment there is increasing emphasis on how to become more resilient to both  删除换行1 the emotional intensity of the job and the increasing demands from patients. In this context  删除换行1 resilience has been defined as ‘the ability to maintain professional and personal well-being  删除换行1 in the face of ongoing work stress and adversity’ 删除10：<u>(McCann et al. 2013)</u>. Several studies have  删除换行1 explored ways of increasing resilience, and all of these suggest that factors such as a supportive  删除换行1 work environment, socialising, humour and high levels of job satisfaction are all protective  删除换行1 factors against burnout. One particular study suggested that resilience can actually be taught  删除换行1 and that the concept of resilience should be ‘introduced in all training programmes (including  删除换行1 education on ways to strengthen one’s own resilience, such as building a positive identity and  删除换行1 increasing social support, coping skills and spiritual connection)’ 删除10：<u>(McAllister and McKinnon  删除换行1 2009)</u>. Following the Francis Report in 2013, which demonstrated systemic failings in care at \n\n【8】Mid Staffordshire NHS Trust, it appeared that this could all be blamed on a lack of compassion from staff at all levels. This prompted public debate about how to increase compassion  删除换行1 in the healthcare setting. Should it be tested for when interviewing job applicants? Should  删除换行1 compassion be incentivised, with nurses who demonstrate higher levels of compassion being  删除换行1 paid more? Conversely, one could argue that a surgeon does not need to care about the patient  删除换行1 in order to do their job well and the Health Care Assistant does not need to care about their  删除换行1 patient in order to empty a bed pan or provide food to a patient. Incentivising compassion in  删除换行1 the current climate would be disastrous – persistent understaffing and lack of resources have  删除换行1 put many healthcare workers at breaking point, and being made to ‘act out’ compassion would  删除换行1 be more stressful and likely to result in more work-related stress than trying to rectify the  删除换行1 underlying problems. Yet compassion does improve patient experience of healthcare and has  删除换行1 been shown to help improve recovery. Finding ways to support healthcare workers remaining  删除换行1 compassionate is the key to preventing another crisis like the one in Mid-Staffs. Better staffing,  删除换行1 more job autonomy and the feeling that someone will listen if things are going wrong will all  删除换行1 support a better work environment and will help promote natural compassion.\n\n【9】Key Points\n\n【10】• Compassion is undoubtedly beneficial for a positive experience of patient care  删除换行1 but does not necessarily equate to being able to provide good-quality and safe  删除换行1 clinical care.\n\n【11】• Compassion without resilience can cause clinician burnout.\n\n【12】删除29：<u>Duties of a Doctor\n\n【13】</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Over the past 3 months, she has lost approximately 15 lb without changing her diet or activity level. Otherwise, she feels great. She has an excellent appetite, no gastrointestinal complaints except for occasional loose stools, a good energy level, and no complaints of fatigue. She denies heat or cold intolerance. On examination, her heart rate is 108 bpm, blood pressure 142/82 mm Hg, and she is afebrile. When she looks at you, she seems to stare, and her eyes are somewhat protuberant. You note a large, smooth, nontender thyroid gland and a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur on cardiac examination, and her skin is warm and dry. There is a fine resting tremor.\n\n【3】 What is the most likely diagnosis?\n\n【4】 How could you confirm the diagnosis?\n\n【5】 What are the options for treatment?\n\n【6】### ANSWERS TO CASE 44:\n\n【7】#### Thyrotoxicosis/Graves Disease\n\n【8】Summary: A 37-year-old woman presents with weight loss without anorexia, tachycardia, borderline hypertension, exophthalmos, and a smooth, nontender goiter.\n\n【9】 Most likely diagnosis: Thyrotoxicosis/Graves disease.\n\n【10】 Confirming the diagnosis: A low serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level and an increased free thyroxine (T <sub>4 </sub> ) level with this clinical presentation would be confirmatory of hyperthyroidism. However, other tests that would define the etiology would be thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins or diffusely elevated uptake of radioactive iodine on thyroid scan.\n\n【11】 Treatment options: Antithyroid drugs, radioactive iodine ablation, or less commonly, surgical removal of the thyroid.\n\n【12】#### ANALYSIS\n\n【13】##### Objectives\n\n【14】1\\. Understand the clinical presentation of thyrotoxicosis.\n\n【15】2\\. Be able to discuss the causes of hyperthyroidism, including Graves disease and toxic nodule.\n\n【16】3\\. Learn the complications of thyrotoxicosis, including thyroid storm.\n\n【17】4\\. Understand the evaluation of a patient with a thyroid nodule.\n\n【18】5\\. Know the available treatment options for Graves disease and outcomes of treatment.\n\n【19】##### Considerations\n\n【20】This 37-year-old woman has unintentional weight loss, loose stools, and warm skin, all symptoms of hyperthyroidism. Her thyroid gland is diffusely enlarged and nontender, and she has exophthalmus (protuberant eyes), which is consistent with Graves disease. This is a systemic disease with many complications that affect the entire body, including osteoporosis and heart failure. Treatment can include elimination of the excess thyroid hormone, but definitive therapy may include radioactive (or, less commonly, surgical) ablative therapy.\n\n【21】### APPROACH TO:\n\n【22】#### Hyperthyroidism\n\n【23】#### DEFINITIONS\n\n【24】HYPERTHYROIDISM: Hypermetabolic condition that results from the effect of excessive amounts of thyroid hormones produced by the thyroid gland itself. Because almost all cases of thyrotoxicosis are caused by thyroid overproduction, these terms are often used synonymously.\n\n【25】THYROTOXICOSIS: Usually used as a general term for the state of thyroid hormone excess from any source, for example, exogenous ingestion.\n\n【26】#### CLINICAL APPROACH\n\n【27】Hyperthyroidism affects numerous body systems.\n\n【28】Neuromuscular system: Nervousness, tremors, and brisk reflexes are common. Inability to concentrate, proximal muscle weakness, emotional lability, and insomnia might be present.\n\n【29】Cardiac system: Wide pulse pressure, flow heart murmurs, and tachycardia usually are present. Atrial fibrillation is present in 10% to 20% of patients. Long-standing thyrotoxicosis can cause cardiomegaly and result in high-output heart failure.\n\n【30】Gastrointestinal system: Despite increased food intake, weight loss is common. Hyperdefecation usually is present as a result of increased gastrointestinal motility, but diarrhea is rare.\n\n【31】Eyes: Retraction of the upper eyelid as a consequence of increased sympathetic tone gives some patients a wide-eyed stare. Lid lag might be found on physical examination (sclera can be seen above the iris as the patient looks downward). Exophthalmos is distinctive of Graves disease.\n\n【32】Skin: The skin is warm, moist, and velvety, with fine hair texture and alopecia. Sweating usually is present as a consequence of vasodilation and heat dissipation.\n\n【33】Reproductive system: Hyperthyroidism impairs fertility in women and may cause oligomenorrhea. The sperm count in men is reduced. Impotence and gynecomastia might be present.\n\n【34】Metabolism: Weight loss is a common finding, especially in older patients who develop anorexia. Many patients develop an aversion to heat and a preference for cold temperatures.\n\n【35】Apathetic hyperthyroidism: Older patients with hyperthyroidism may lack typical adrenergic features and present instead with depression or apathy, weight loss, atrial fibrillation, worsening angina pectoris, or congestive heart failure.\n\n【36】##### Thyroid Storm\n\n【37】Thyroid storm is a dangerous condition of decompensated thyrotoxicosis. The patient has tachycardia (>140 bpm), fever (104°F-106°F), agitation, delirium, restlessness or psychosis, vomiting, and/or diarrhea . It usually results from long-neglected severe hyperthyroidism to which a complicating event (intercurrent illness: infection, surgery, trauma, or iodine load) is added. Treatment includes supportive care with fluids, antibiotics if needed, and specific treatment directed at the hyperthyroidism.\n\n【38】 Large doses of antithyroid medications to block new hormone synthesis\n\n【39】 Iodine solution to block the release of thyroid hormone\n\n【40】 Propranolol to control the symptoms induced by the increased adrenergic tone\n\n【41】 Glucocorticoids to decrease T <sub>4 </sub> to triiodothyronine (T <sub>3 </sub> ) conversion\n\n【42】##### Etiology of Thyrotoxicosis\n\n【43】Graves disease is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism (80%) and usually is seen in women, especially between the ages of 30 and 50 years. It is an autoimmune disease caused by autoantibodies that activate the TSH receptor of the thyroid follicular cell, stimulating thyroid hormone synthesis and secretion as well as thyroid gland growth. In the pregnant patient, these antibodies cross the placenta and can cause neonatal thyrotoxicosis. The disease might follow a relapsing and remitting course.\n\n【44】Graves disease is marked by goiter (enlarged thyroid gland), thyroid bruit, hyperthyroidism , ophthalmopathy, and dermopathy . These features are variably present. Ophthalmopathy is characterized by inflammation of extraocular muscles, orbital fat, and connective tissue, resulting in proptosis (exophthalmos), sometimes with impairment of eye muscle function (diplopia), and periorbital edema. Ophthalmopathy can progress even after treatment of thyrotoxicosis. Graves dermopathy is characterized by raised hyperpigmented orange peel texture papules. The most common site is the skin overlying the shins (pretibial myxedema). A low serum TSH will confirm the diagnosis. The degree of elevation of serum-free T <sub>4 </sub> and free T <sub>3 </sub> levels can give an estimate of the severity of the disease. Tests that might be helpful in determining the etiology of thyrotoxicosis are the levels of thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin (TSI), which is elevated in Graves; thyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibodies, which are markers of autoimmunity in both Graves and Hashimoto thyroiditis; and a thyroid uptake and scan, which will reveal a diffusely elevated iodine uptake in our patient.\n\n【45】Treatment options for Graves disease are medications, radioactive iodine, or surgery. Medications include beta-blockers such as propranolol (which are used for symptom relief) and antithyroid drugs such as methimazole and propylthiouracil (PTU) . The antithyroid drugs work mainly by decreasing the production of thyroid hormone. They can be used for short-term (prior to treatment with radioactive iodine or surgery) or long-term (1-2 years) treatment, after which the chance for remission is 20% to 30%. Possible side effects are rash, allergic reactions, arthritis, hepatitis, and agranulocytosis. Radioactive iodine is the treatment of choice in the United States. It is administered as an oral solution of sodium <sup>131 </sup> I that is rapidly concentrated in thyroid tissue, inducing damage that results in ablation of the thyroid, depending on the dose, within 6 to 18 weeks. At least 30% of patients will become hypothyroid in the first year after treatment and 3% each year after that, requiring thyroid hormone supplementation. Radioactive iodine is contraindicated in pregnancy, and women of reproductive age are advised to postpone pregnancy for 6 to 12 months after treatment. Pregnant women with Graves can be managed with PTU, as it has a low transplacental transfer. Graves ophthalmopathy might be exacerbated by radioactive iodine treatment, so glucocorticoids can be used to prevent this in selected patients.\n\n【46】Subtotal thyroidectomy usually is reserved for large goiters with obstructive symptoms (dyspnea, dysphagia). Possible complications include laryngeal nerve injury and hypoparathyroidism (due to removal of parathyroids or compromise of the vascular supply to them).\n\n【47】For our patient, treatment with radioactive iodine or antithyroid medications seems the most reasonable way to proceed, and a discussion regarding her options and our recommendations should take place after the diagnosis is confirmed.\n\n【48】Other causes of thyrotoxicosis include the following:\n\n【49】Toxic multinodular goiter: Found mainly in elderly and middle-age patients. Treatment consists of radioactive iodine or surgery. Radioactive iodine uptake is normal to increased, and the scan reveals irregular thyroid lobes and a heterogeneous pattern.\n\n【50】Autonomous hyperfunctioning adenoma (“hot nodule” or Plummer disease): Hyperthyroidism usually is not present unless the nodule is more than 3 cm. The iodine scan looks like the flag of Japan: it demonstrates the hot nodule as having increased uptake (dark) and the rest of the gland with suppressed uptake (white). Hot nodules are almost never malignant. Cold nodules (no increased thyroid hormone production and no demonstration of local uptake if thyroid scan is performed) have a 5% to 10% risk of malignancy, so fine-needle aspiration, surgical removal, or ultrasonographic follow-up is needed for these nodules.\n\n【51】Thyroiditis: Caused by destruction of thyroid tissue and release of preformed hormone from the colloid space. Subacute (de Quervain) thyroiditis is an inflammatory viral illness with thyroid pain and tenderness. The hyperthyroid phase lasts for several weeks to months, followed by recovery, but some patients will then develop hypothyroidism. Treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications and beta-blockers usually is sufficient, but in severe cases, glucocorticoids might be used. Other forms include postradiation, postpartum, subacute (painless thyroiditis), and amiodarone-induced thyroiditis. In thyroiditis, the radioactive iodine uptake is invariably decreased.\n\n【52】Medications: Excessive ingestion of thyroid hormone (factitious or iatrogenic), amiodarone, and iodine load.\n\n【53】Other conditions such as TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma, hydatidiform moles, choriocarcinomas secondary to secretion of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), ovarian teratomas, and metastatic follicular thyroid carcinomas are rare causes of thyrotoxicosis.\n\n【54】####", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

The bilirubin level was 2.5 mg/dL (normal up to 1.0 mg/dL) with an elevated unconjugated component. He feels well and generally drinks one beer per night. He is monogamous with his wife and has no history of IV drug abuse or tattoos. His eyes are not icteric and there are no signs of jaundice. His liver enzymes, chemistries, TSH, and complete blood count (CBC) are normal. Which of the following is the next step in his evaluation?\n\n【1】A. Reassurance\n\n【2】B.

Hepatitis A does not proceed to cirrhosis and anti-HBs is present in people immunized to hepatitis B.\n\n【18】Question: 46.4 A 21-year-old college student plans to take a trip to Thailand with his friends in a couple of months. He is excited about the upcoming trip and wants to find out additional shots that he would need to get prior to his departure. The patient thinks he is up-to-date with all of his immunizations. He will most likely need which of the following vaccinations?\n\n【19】A. Hepatitis A, hepatitis B, Typhoid, and Japanese encephalitis\n\n【20】B. Hepatitis A only\n\n【21】C. Hepatitis B only\n\n【22】D. No additional shots needed\nAnswer: 46.4 A . Hepatitis A immunization is highly recommended when traveling to regions where hepatitis A infection is widespread such as Africa, Asia, Greenland, Middle East, Mexico, and Central and South America. The hepatitis B vaccine is recommended for previously unimmunized individuals. Typhoid and Japanese encephalitis vaccinations are indicated if travel is expected in smaller cities. Vaccination recommendations can change and it is best to review travel recommendations at 删除9：<u>www.cdc.gov/travel.</u> An appointment with a primary care physician or travel clinic should be made 4 to 6 weeks prior to taking any international trips to determine the appropriate vaccinations needed and general health information.\n\n【23】CLINICAL PEARL\n\n【24】 The acute onset of painless jaundice in a patient older than age 50 years should prompt an examination for pancreatic cancer (malignancy in the head of the pancreas causing compression of the bile ducts).\n\n【25】 All pregnant women should be screened for the presence of HBsAg. If positive, treating the newborns with hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIg) and vaccination can reduce the risk of vertical transmission.\n\n【26】 One of the greatest risks for the development of cirrhosis in those with chronic hepatitis C is alcohol use. Anyone with chronic hepatitis C should be counseled to avoid all alcohol intake.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

As to the time of stopping medication, there are different opinions. Some physicians recommend aspirin be continued until coronary artery normal 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 44 \\]</u>. It was also suggested that once coronary artery lesion occurred, aspirin should be taken orally for extra 3 months after coronary artery regressed to normal. This boy took aspirin for total 4 months (after 3 months his coronary artery was normal). Although aspirin could not lower the frequency of development coronary artery abnormalities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 46 \\]</u>, his coronary artery dilated again 2 months later and then there is the trend of continuing to broaden.

But to perform CTA HR must be less than 90 bpm and be absolutely calm during the performing time. To prevent vomit or aspiration after infused with the contrast agent, the child fasted over 4 h. It is difficult to stay calm when the child is hungry. Thus, sometime coronary artery CTA was unsatisfactory in some babies.\n3.  3.\n    When LCA abnormally originated from RCA, if it is not between the aorta and the pulmonary artery, it usually does not cause myocardial ischemia; if it is between the aorta and pulmonary artery, it does not cause myocardial ischemia either unless strenuous exercise occurs.

Therefore, the rash at the beginning may be related to it. But most of them had a history of using antibiotics. Pediatricians may first suspect that rash was allergic reaction to medication and treat patients with glucocorticoid. This boy was infused with dexamethasone twice, consequently, its anti-allege effect was obvious. But if infused with glucocorticoid before Day 5, especially before Day 3 of illness, it may mask the early symptoms of KD. If single glucocorticoid infused in early stage of KD, it may promote coronary artery thrombosis and result in coronary artery aneurysm 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 44 , 39 \\]</u>. This boy with the symptoms of conjunctival congestion, red and cracked lips are all happened at home, both parents and pediatrician focused on rashes and fever when admission. It was only after skin peeling off around fingernails, he was suspected KD. After talking with his mother, we learned more details. Thus, we suggest that if baby fever along with rash without convulsion, chilling, or cyanosis, choosing phenergan injection or chlortrimeton oral would be better.\n\n【35】Hong Wang", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

The location by stimulation triggered some partial fits that were quickly stopped by iced serum； these affected the control of bodily movements： elbow-fist-hand flexing， fist-hand flexing， jaw movements， and so on. My colleague indicates 删除换行1 some phonemic paraphasias； the excision of the tumour was carried out while taking account， according to the places， of some phonemic or semantic paraphasias. He approached the motor paths without touch-ing them， so as to avoid compounding the linguistic deficiency with a motor deficiency. After this brief account， I continue my search in the medical literature to deepen my knowledge.\n\n【1】This is a grade II glioma； the World Health Organization (WHO) clas-sification revised in 2007 is not straightforward to reproduce because it does not take into account the heterogeneity of tumours and makes no distinction between tumorous cells and infiltrated residual paren-chyma. The French Sainte-Anne classification has a better predictabil-ity， because it integrates clinical data and imagery by taking account of the results of the MRI investigation， which reveals the signs of necrosis and neo-vascularisation that are specific to high-grade tumours， but that does not apply in this case. Grade II tumours are called oligoden-droglial tumours； this is an oligoastrocytoma， which is a mixed tumour combining the characteristics of astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas. At La Pitie-Salpetriere， the INSERM teams， led by Jean-Yves Delattre and Denis Delattre at the Institut Curie， have identified several types of deletion on chromosome one that are related to good prognosis for some gliomas. As it is difficult to establish a correct grading in the clas-sification of gliomas， since it is essentially based on fine microscopic characteristics， I have preferred to omit them， for the time being， when predicting the psychosomatic risk in the development of this type of glioma.\n\n【2】In Chloe's case， the intervention was followed by severe aphasic problems that have since disappeared； the neurosurgeon also notes the relatively faint Germanic intonation. As mentioned above， Chloe is receiving treatment from a speech therapist.\n\n【3】Research into low-grade gliomas and brain plasticity gives me great hope for my patient's treatment； the dogma of Broca's localis-ing model has been challenged. For some years， new data from sur-gery have been demonstrating， increasingly clearly， that massive cerebral excisions can be completely compensated for， without leaving any discernible functional deficiency. Pre- and post-surgical imaging techniques， as well as peri-operative stimulation procedures， make it possible to follow the nature and kinetics of these compensations. In fact， well before the surgical operation， and in response to the tumor-ous invasion， the process of synaptogenesis (formation of synapses 删除换行1 between neurons) begins before the surgery and is consolidated after the operative procedure.\n\n【4】In the therapeutic strategy for Chloe， I have therefore taken into consideration the post-lesional brain plasticity that allows the nervous system to be reorganised following physical damage.\n\n【5】How psychosomatic psychotherapy can facilitate and aid the devel-opment of neuronal connections was the problem that confronted me； I was relying heavily on the plasticity of Chloe's brain to make progress.\n\n【6】The neuronal problems experienced by Chloe\n\n【7】In psychosomatics， we have developed two approaches to illness： the illness seen by the doctor (hence my meeting with the neurosurgeon) and the illness experienced by the patient. We also ask ourselves what role the illness is playing in the patient’s psychosomatic equilibrium.\n\n【8】What was Chloe suffering from after the operation on her brain?\n\n【9】After her operation， Chloe suffered from paraphasia， epileptic fits， and long periods of insomnia. Her verbal memory and her memory of current experience were affected. She experienced emotions and feel-ings of distress connected mainly with her condition and her lack of vocabulary. As I emphasised above， sometimes she seemed to me very robotic， and sometimes very human， in her desire to recover her verbal capacities. She could remember the atmosphere and general feeling of books， but not the characters or their dialogue.\n\n【10】She was very tired in the first few sessions， often due to nocturnal epileptic fits. She had not dreamt since the previous year； before her operation she had many anxiety-related dreams. According to my clini-cal psychosomatic experience， these dreams are produced by the body sending warning signals to the psyche： the body senses that its homeo-stasis is at risk and the brain worries. Since the operation， her verbal memory has been auditory rather than visual. She remembers every-thing she hears well but not what she reads in books； she makes notes and having read them she no longer remembers where in the book she has made them. She can no longer watch films either because she does not understand all the words she hears or she cannot follow the action of the characters (problem of integration in the auditory cortex). Chloe also wonders about her symptoms and， to help me understand her case， she brings me  a neuropsychology book in which she has noted some paragraphs that I will quote below.\n\n【11】Concerning Alexandre Luria's famous patient，“the man with a shattered world\"， who is called Zazetsky， the book states：\n\n【12】He could no longer understand logic， cause and effect， or spatial relationships. He couldn't distinguish his left from his right . He couldn't comprehend a whole word， understand a whole sentence， or recall a complete memory because doing any of those things would require relating symbols. He could grasp only fleeting fragments. 删除10：<u>(Doidge，2007， p.33)</u>\n\n【13】Chloe's operation has caused her some problems in her capacity to understand words， to put them together， to form them into intelligible sentences and to remember them all together.\n\n【14】She also tells me about the loss of her automatic linguistic functioning：when she talks with readers at the library， she does not remember all the questions they ask her； she only remembers the first question and tries to answer it. Automatic linguistic functioning， as with hello， goodbye， Happy New Year， and so on， seems to have disappeared. She cannot summon these expressions quickly； she has to think about it to know what she must say. She knows what all the words mean but cannot use them in a conversation. She likes punk music， but for now music is a noise that she cannot interpret； musical harmony has disappeared.\n\n【15】I set myself the following objectives based on our first few conversa-tions and my knowledge of the state of her central nervous system after the operation.\n\n【16】How to bring Chloe back to life?\n\n【17】It would be necessary to：\n\n【18】· develop her capacity to form longer sentences， as she could only speak in short phrases expressing a single idea；\n\n【19】●develop her working memory and recall memory；\n\n【20】recover her reading memory by means of motor (procedural) memory-this is a complex process that I will explain in the context of the progression of our encounters；\n\n【21】develop her ability to listen to her body to prevent epileptic fits；\n\n【22】facilitate her access to associations of ideas， to the preconscious， and to the elaborative capacity by making connections between differ-ent semantic fields， the associated emotions and feelings， and the recollection of behaviours.\n\n【23】In short， I needed to rebuild， with Chloe， a psychic apparatus that had been damaged by the tumour and the operation， and thereby to facili-tate rebuilding and strengthening of the synaptic connections.\n\n【24】The concept of the psychic apparatus is totally alien to conventional medicine， and I must say that I make a great deal of effort with my colleagues so that they may understand its functioning and， above all， its existence.\n\n【25】I was unable to put together a team to care for my patient， with each specialist working separately， but Chloe provided the liaison and often informed the neurosurgeon about the progression of her therapeutic work； it is clear that the speech therapist’s work was also outstanding.\n\n【26】Our meetings and our work continue\n\n【27】Chloe comes to the next session， bringing me a dream：\n\n【28】She is lying in her bed in her room and a woman is standing there lifting up the duvet； she shows her a cardboard box that contains a row of five children's bodies of different sizes.\n\n【29】In the previous session， Chloe had brought me a huge number of drawings that she had done in the last fifteen years； we had discussed her artwork at length and I had encouraged her to return to this so that her right hand that suffered from the operation could function again as a result of this learning. I had also advised her to talk openly with Guillaume (her closest colleague) about the disturbances to her work caused by her operation； this colleague had noticed Chloe's handicap but did not dare to talk to her about it.\n\n【30】I began by drawing her attention to the five children's bodies， putting forward the hypothesis that they probably represented her hand， with its five fingers. Chloe cannot associate for the time being， but she has gradually understood how a dream is interpreted. The use of metaphors in this case helps her to understand that the hand's five fingers were enclosed in a cardboard box. She then thinks (this is her interpretation) that it would be difficult for now to return to drawing； hence the five unusable fingers lined up in a cardboard box. This is a possible interpretation that I accept； she states that she is tired and cannot go back to drawing.\n\n【31】She has begun to talk with Guillaume and Andre， who understand her fatigue much better and her difficulty working at the library. She talks to me at length about her relationship with the readers because I ask her about this； she recognises that， because of her current difficul-ties， some people think she is stupid. She finds this hurtful (a narcissis-tic injury)， but says nothing.\n\n【32】I must say that the consequences of her operation meant that Chloe could appear like someone with whom it is difficult to communicate and who does not always understand what is being said to her.\n\n【33】The operation has caused problems in her capacity to understand words， to put them together， to form intelligible sentences from them and to remember them all together. When I talk to her using short sentences she understands perfectly， and we can have long conversa-tions for nearly an hour about many subjects， such as Bunuel's films， Bergman， and the American series or books she has been able to read. She recognises that， with time， she is beginning to recover some of her capacities for attention and concentration， but these have not yet been completely acquired.\n\n【34】Her eyes often get tired and this prevents her from devoting time to reading. She cannot focus her attention and remember what she reads(slight deficiency of the short-term memory). This is therefore an audi-tory impairmentat a very high level of cortical integration， which affects assembling words (the heard word and the read word). Nevertheless， there are some semantic capacities and it seems that she can recover them by working with the speech therapist， and with an orthoptist whom she is also consulting.\n\n【35】In the sessions I am trying to inject some imagination and auditory capacities by the use of metaphors， which is ordinary therapeutic work in psychosomatics. Pierre Marty called this “lending your apparatus for dealing with thoughts\". At the end of the session， Chloe is still tired； she smiles at me kindly and states that she had been tired when she arrived and that now the session has restored her will to live； we then part.\n\n【36】Next meeting： the \"mirror function\" emerges\n\n【37】When she arrives at the session， Chloe sits down timidly on the edge of the armchair and looks at me questioningly， anticipating everything from me. She looks at me as a child looks at her mother who is going 删除换行1 to take the initiative of speaking to her， telling her things about life， making her feel emotions， and so on. The psychotherapist's maternal function is primordial in psychosomatics. For her， I must be the mirror4of her thoughts and of the experience of her thoughts so that she can rebuild herself.\n\n【38】Ibegin by asking her about the meeting that week with the neuropsy-chologist， who made her take a test and told her that it is her working memory that is functioning poorly. Of course， Chloe and I realised this some time ago now， but this explanation does not satisfy me； I must find a technical procedure that she could use for training so as to recover some of her capacity for understanding long and abstract sentences. As explained above， Chloe does not understand the combination of words in a sentence that is too long.\n\n【39】Before a technical procedure can be formulated， Chloe and I talk about her relationship with Andre and Guillaume and with her work， as well as her relationship with the readers. She is still in the same situ-ation because they are not patient， and often she cannot remember the subjects of the books they choose. She is hurt by the way they look at her. She thinks that she is no longer suited to the quick work of select-ing and accessing books， and feels lost and misunderstood. Chloe is reliving some past episodes of narcissistic wounds and difficulties in overcoming conflictual situations.\n\n【40】We move on， by association， to physical exercises and sports that she might be able to practise； she tells me that she uses her bicycle every day and that she used to ride for very long distances， even hundreds of kilometres. She also practised a Vietnamese combat sport in a club near where she lived. Because of her operation， and from fear of traumatic shocks that might cause an epileptic fit， she gave up combat sports. Chloe is also taking care of herself in dietary terms-we then talk about cooking and meals. She tells me that she has been a vegetarian since she was fourteen； she adopted this diet over twenty years ago. Her mother cooked for her and her two sisters and she has always been greatly concerned with it in her own way； at midday she would eat some pasta and ham， and in the evening， vegetable soup， yoghurt， and fruit. Her mother was not an excellent cook， but she took care of her children and， despite Chloe's criticisms of her， the image that very gradually appears is of a highly ambivalent mother absorbed by her occupation as a maths teacher and the education of her three daughters. For many years， between the ages of five and thirteen， every day at midday her mother 删除换行1 would take all three of them to the seaside fairly close to their home and they would eat after having a swim-some pleasant memories are beginning to emerge.\n\n【41】I continue by addressing the relationship between her mother and her father and how they chose each other； she tells me that her father was an engineer； I then suggest an interpretation that makes her laugh a lot： they probably chose each other because they both liked maths. In this way， I encourage her to learn laughter and to distance herself from the parental superego. We then return to technical procedure， because suddenly I think of a technique for overcoming her difficulty in remembering.\n\n【42】Information reaches her more easily by sensory and motor paths and I form the hypothesis that the visual and auditory sensory circuits are partly damaged on several levels， which also involves some disconnec-tions in the psychic domain (c.f.， my interview with the neurosurgeon above). Chloe confirms this hypothesis to me and I then think that the only way of remembering would be to use the motor path： she would take some notes on index cards for each book she reads every week and in this way， by writing with her hand，she will be able to remember what she has read. She confirms to me that when she writes， she remembers what she has written. We decide together that she will use the fingers of her hand to remember what she has read (procedural memory)；she will write the summaries on index cards that she will arrange in a box. That will help her to reply more easily to the readers who ask her for information about the publication of new books.\n\n【43】At the end of the session， she returns to her adolescence； from the age of seventeen， she wandered all over Europe from squat to squat. We may have the opportunity to return to this particular history of wandering.\nThe recall technique uses the motricity of the hand and the motor cortices 删除换行5 After the Christmas holidays， Chloe arrives smiling and relaxed for her session. I greet her with a smile， and ask what has happened since the session before the holidays. She tells me that she was experienc-ing enormous tension and that she had an epileptic fit in the night at home. Thinking aloud， I tell her that the tension created in the last session had generated strong emotions that had increased the 删除换行1 neuronal excitation， and that by not being mentally elaborated， the neurones had been discharged in an epileptic fit.\n\n【44】Chloe agrees with this； we must continue to work to reduce her fits as much as possible， but her doctor has informed her that these will not end until two years after her operation. It is obvious that this is only the medical viewpoint. Medicine only assesses the condition， whereas I assess the reasons for the onset of a higher quantum of mental and neuronal excitations.\n\n【45】Throughout the session， we try to construct her history together(\"story-telling\") in order to assemble gradually the necessary elements for the psychic work. I encourage her to talk about her childhood， the Christmas celebrations， what relations she has had with her two sisters， Catherine and Sylvie， and with her mother and father. She does not like Christmas celebrations because her mother and all the family members on her mother’s side have never given her what she wanted as a pre-sent. Today she prefers celebrating with her boyfriend Andre and some other friends， but no one in this circle celebrates Christmas or New Year.\n\n【46】Concerning her work， she tells me that she has followed my advice and written some index cards to remind herself of the content of the books she has read with a view to recommending them to readers at the library. It seems that this writing technique， connecting visual words and written words with the hand (motor cortex)， enables her to recall the content of books better. I had thought about using the motor path to supplement the visual word that was not retained in her memory， based on the hypothesis that the hand's motricity could create some new complementary synaptic connections that would be more effec-tive. She confirms to me that she has found this very useful and that she is going to continue with this experiment.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

They begin suddenly at variable times during the day， and she must take deep breaths to calm herself down. The patient is confused\n\n| What is the most likely diagnosis? Panic disorder.  |\n| --- |\n| How are panic attacks related to this condition? Panic disorder requires repeated panic attacks (or episodes) with relevant behaviors or attitudes betweenattacks， such as worry about not being able to control the panic attacks. Patients tend to avoid situationswhere panic attacks occur and arrange their lives around fear of having an attack. This can lead toagoraphobia (ie， fear of having a panic attack in a place with no place to hide and no easy means ofescape). A panic attack requires the presence of at least four of the following symptoms： ·Palpitations. SSweating. ·TTrembling. ·Chest pain or discomfort. ·FFear of losing control. ·FFear of dying. · Chills or hot flashes.  |\n| What other conditions must be ruled out before a diagnosis can be made?Organic causes of symptoms (including tachycardia， hyperthyroidism， hyperparathyroidism，pheochromocytoma， hypoglycemia， seizure， and drug use) must be ruled out before panic disorder canbe diagnosed.  |\n| What are the appropriate treatments for this condition?Panic disorder is often treated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRls)， tricyclic antidepressants，and monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors. These drugs influence levels of norepinephrine， serotonin， andy-aminobutyric acid in the central nervous system. Benzodiazepines are also useful in the short term.  |\n| What syndrome can develop when SSRls are used with MAO inhibitors?Serotonin syndrome may result from the use of drugs that enhance serotonin signaling. MAO inhibitorsand SSRIs enhance serotonin signaling through different mechanisms， so the risk of serotonin syndromeis higher when these drugs are taken together. Serotonin syndrome is more likely to occur with thiscombination of drugs because most MAO inhibitors irreversibly inhibit MAO. Symptoms of serotoninsyndrome fit into three main categories： · Autonomic dysfunction (eg， hyperthermia， tachycardia， unstable blood pressure， diarrhea， and sweating).· Cognitive and behavioral changes (eg， agitation， confusion， and coma).

He has also noticed a slight watery penile discharge with no urinary frequency.\nOtherwise, he feels well with no fever, abdominal or testicular pain, joint pain or eye redness  删除换行1 and is generally a healthy young man who works on building projects in the European area. It  删除换行1 is Friday evening and he is back for a long weekend before returning to Spain where is he currently working. He is going back to Spain on Sunday evening. On questioning further, he is  删除换行1 heterosexual and had ‘one-off’ vaginal sexual intercourse with a friend a few days before and  删除换行1 sex with a woman he did not know well 2 weeks before that. He usually uses condoms, but the  删除换行1 last two times he has been quite drunk and did not use them. He does not have a stable sexual  删除换行1 partner and tends to have occasional sex with different women. He binge drinks on his days off  删除换行1 and drinks about five pints of strong beer on two or three nights a week (30–45 units a week).\nHe is a non-smoker. He takes occasional recreational drugs such as cocaine or ecstasy but alcohol is his drug of choice. He has had no serious past illnesses and is on no medication and his  删除换行1 last sexual health check was about 1 year ago. He has never been tested for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) but would be keen to have this done.\nQuestions\n\n【3】• What does the general practitioner focus on in his or her examination and  删除换行1 investigations?\n\n【4】• What management options does the GP have?\n\n【5】ANSWER 95\n\n【6】The most likely diagnosis is urethritis. Cystitis is possible, although less likely, as are balanitis  删除换行1 and genital herpes simplex infection.\n\n【7】The GP examines the patient. There is no sign of conjunctivitis, joint pain or swelling, inflammation of the glans or foreskin and there are no herpes lesions visible. Testicular and abdominal examination is normal. The patient last passed urine about 2 hours before and is asked  删除换行1 to provide a ‘first-catch urine’ into a male Chlamydia/Gonorrhoea testing tube and then a  删除换行1 further urine sample into a urine sample bottle.The testing tube holding the first-catch urine does show a few threads suggestive of  删除换行5 Chlamydia. The mid-stream urine sample is clear and urine dipstick shows leucocytes and  删除换行1 nil else. It is Friday evening and so it is not possible to send a urine sample to the local  删除换行1 laboratory for microscopy, culture and sensitivities. The Chlamydia/Gonorrhoea sample for  删除换行1 nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) can be sent to the laboratory the following week.\nThe GP ensures that he has the correct contact details for the patient so that he can let him  删除换行1 know about the test results.\n\n【8】Given the probable diagnosis of Chlamydia urethritis and to ensure that the patient adheres  删除换行1 with treatment, the GP prescribes Azithromycin 1 g stat. The patient is advised to avoid sexual intercourse (including oral sex) for 7 days. He is strongly advised to let his sexual contacts, if possible all those in the last 6 months, know about his diagnosis and encourage them  删除换行1 to go for testing and to use condoms with every sexual contact. He is told that Chlamydia 删除换行1 can be passed on through vaginal, oral or anal sex and that if it is not treated it can spread  删除换行1 from the urethra to the testicles causing epididymo-orchitis which, rarely, can affect fertility.\nIt can also cause pain and swelling in his joints as well as conjunctivitis. The patient is very  删除换行1 keen to have a full sexually transmitted disease check and is going to visit the local sexual  删除换行1 health clinic when he comes back to London for a week’s holiday in a couple of weeks time.\nHe decides after discussion, that he will not have sexual contact again until after this check.\nHe is advised that slight stinging when passing urine might take a few weeks to settle completely. In the meantime, if his symptoms are not clearing or getting worse, he is advised to  删除换行1 seek medical care in Spain.\nA discussion is also opened up about the patient’s alcohol use to continue when next they  删除换行1 meet.\n\n【9】• Routinely and regularly obtain sexual histories from patients.\n\n【10】• Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) are common and may be symptomless so  删除换行1 discuss the possibility frequently with those who are sexually active and test and  删除换行1 advise on safe sex.\n\n【11】• A confidential, respectful and non-judgemental approach to patients is essential in obtaining a thorough sexual history and managing STDs and prevention  删除换行1 strategies.\n\n【12】• A patient’s lifestyle can pre-dispose them to STDs so discuss these including partners, sexual practices, protection from STDs, past history of STDs and alcohol and  删除换行1 drug use.\n\n【13】• Discuss prevention of unwanted pregnancy.\n\n【14】• Remember to do your best to ensure that sexual partners are followed up, investigated and treated where necessary.\n删除12：<u>Key Points195\n\n【15】删除29：<u>Case 96: Vaginal Bleeding</u>\n\n【16】</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Cells other than erythrocytes appear to be embedded in a heavy eosinophilic background substance. These pleomorphic cells tend to be elongated to spindle-shaped with a basophilic cytoplasm and an eccentrically positioned nucleus that contains coarsely granular nuclear chromatin and large prominent nucleoli. Figure 92.3a shows numerous erythrocytes with cells embedded in a heavy eosinophilic background, making it difficult to evaluate the cells. Figure 92.3b shows a thinner area that reveals cells with indistinct cytoplasmic margins, a high nucleus-cytoplasm ratio, ba–sophilic cytoplasm, and nuclear pleomorphism. Figure 92.3c shows a thinner area with scattered mesenchymal cells with eccentrically positioned oval nuclei that contain coarsely granular chromatin and prominent large nucleoli. The cytoplasm is light blue and more abundant than cells observed in other fields. The oval to spindled cell on the right of the image has an abundant blue foamy cytoplasm with a distinct Golgi and an eccentrically positioned nucleus, features of an osteoblast. This poorly cellular sample that contains mesenchymal cells with features of malignancy embedded in a heavy eosinophilic background substance is indicative of either a chondrosarcoma or an osteosarcoma.\n\n【14】删除3：<u>Fig. 92.4 .

The tissue was very firm, difficult to remove, and the solid and white cut surface had a chalk-like texture 删除33：<u></u>.\n\n【19】Histopathologic results revealed the mass consisted of cartilage; however, the cartilage proliferated in a somewhat haphazard fashion. Cells were embedded within lacunae within a cartilaginous matrix. Nuclei were mildly pleomorphic, round, and had small nucleoli. Mitoses were not observed. Centrally, there were areas of ossification of the cartilage in the formation of bone.

B： Hospice\n\n【26】Palliative care for children and young people is an active and total approach to care from the point of diagnosis or recognition， embracing physical， emotional， social and spiritual elements through to death and beyond. It focuses on enhancement of quality of life for the child/young person and support for the family. It includes the management of distressing symptoms， provision of short respite breaks， and care through death and bereavement 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u>. A child does not need to be imminently dying to benefit from palliative care and frequently a palliative care journey will include several episodes of serious ill health where a child is sick enough that they might die， but they then recover and return to being clinically stable for a further period of time.\n\n【27】Kevin's new symptoms could potentially represent deterioration. This information was shared with the family but it is vital to acknowledge the uncertainty in predicting whether this deterioration would lead to a plateau in symptoms， a clinical improvement or move to end of life care and death. Acknowledging the concern of deterioration to the family enables further discussions focusing on planning Kevin's future care- a process known as advanced care planning. This falls under the umbrella term “palliative care\".\n\n【28】An advanced care plan (ACP) is designed to communicate the health-care wishes of children who have chronic and life-limiting conditions. It sets out an agreed plan of care to be followed when a child's condition deteriorates. It provides a framework for both discussing and documenting the agreed wishes of a child and their parents for when the child develops potentially life-threatening complications. Where a child is considered to have capacity their views should be considered in the decision-making. The ACP is designed so that it can be used in all environments： home， hospital， school， hospice and respite care. It is also appropriate for use by the ambulance service. An ACP can be used as a resuscitation plan and/or as an end-of-life care plan. It remains valid when parents or next of kin cannot be contacted but is not a legally binding document 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u>. Many areas around the UK are choosing to use a similar template for the ACP so that the document is widely recognised.\n\n【29】The ACP is a unique document to each child and family. It contains the diagnosis and an explanation of the how the illness affects the child including relevant past medical history. It includes any adjuncts the child requires (e.g. gastrostomy， non-invasive ventilation) and any relevant plans such as feeding plans. The family often like to include hints and tips on how to care for their child， particularly if they are non-verbal， for example what calms them down.Additionally， the family can choose to insert details of how to care for their child after death and any funeral plans.\n\nIn Kevin's ACP there should be details on how to manage his episodes of respiratory distress.

Collecting mementoes such as hand and foot prints locks of hair and photographs can help the bereavement process. There are many charities who grant children a ‘wish'， the memory of which the family will cherish forever.\n\n【34】Kevin continued to have episodes of respiratory distress of increasing severity and frequency. His clinical team and family agreed that the burden of further treatment outweighed any benefit. Therefore his advanced care plan was reviewed and amended with a plan to support end of life care at the hospice. Kevin was managed in accordance with an anticipatory symptom plan including the discontinuation of ventilator support and use of subcutaneous medications to minimise the need to give drugs by the enteral route. He died peacefully surrounded by his family.\n\n【35】After death， Kevin was moved to a specialist bedroom with cooling facilities， available in most hospices. Cold rooms can also be used by children who have died elsewhere e.g. in a hospital， as long as there is no restriction on moving the body. This enables family and friends to visit a patient after death. These facilities can also be made available in the home if families wish to take their infant/child/young person home as is common in some cultures.\n\n【36】If a child or young person dies in hospital then the hospital bereavement team will liaise closely with the family and support them in the hours and days after their child’s death. They will help them with practical tasks including the timings of a post-mortem， organising to transfer the body to a funeral directors or a hospice， and advising them of the process of a Coroner’s inquest if required by law. The bereavement team will arrange for the relevant documentation to be signed and instruct the family on how to register the death. After death， it is common practise for paediatric consultants to offer the family a bereavement visit to enable them to ask any questions and if necessary communicate or explain the results of post-mortem.\n\n【37】Syllabus Mapping\n\n【38】Palliative Care and Pain Management\n\n【39】· Know about end of life care and bereavement counselling and understand the opportunities for respite care， including the role of children's hopics", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

The drug theophylline is a phosphodiesterase inhibitor that leads to the decreased hydrolysis of cAMP to adenosine monophosphate. An overdose of theophylline will therefore result in an elevated intracellular level of cAMP. β-blockers such as metoprolol may therefore be given to reduce cAMP levels through inactivation of adenylate cyclase. A cardioselective β-blocker must be used in cases of asthma to avoid inducing bronchial hyperreactivity.  \nAnswer B is incorrect. β-agonists such as albuterol would potentiate the effects of theophylline by activating adenylate cyclase and increasing the conversion of ATP to cAMP.  \nAnswer C is incorrect. Epinephrine would potentiate the effects of theophylline by activating adenylate cyclase and increasing cAMP formation.  \nAnswer D is incorrect.

He has not experienced any other general or neurological symptoms. He has noticed that covering up either eye corrects his double vision. He has resorted to wearing an eye patch since yesterday so that he can see and walk without falling. In fact, he was able to drive on his own on the freeway to your office much to his family’s dismay. On further questioning you elicit the history that his double vision occurs only on horizontal gaze and not vertical gaze. He has been compliant with his medications for hypertension and coronary artery disease. On examination, his blood pressure (BP) is 124/72 mmHg with a heart rate (HR) of 88 beats/min. He is afebrile and has a regular rate and rhythm without murmurs on cardiac examination. There are no carotid bruits, and his peripheral pulses are normal. His neurologic examination is notable for intact orientation and intact motor strength. His cranial nerve examination is remarkable only for a right lateral rectus palsy. Sensory examination is normal, and his deep tendon reflexes are 2+ throughout. Plantar responses are flexor. His gait is normal.

He has not experienced associated symptoms such as chest pain or headache. His examination is significant for a normal blood pressure and heart rate and the findings of the isolated right sixth nerve palsy.\n\n【7】• Most likely diagnosis: Sixth nerve palsy secondary to ischemic mononeuropathy\n\n【8】• Likely neurological deficit: Sixth nerve palsy\n\n【9】#### ANALYSIS\n\n【10】##### Objectives\n\n【11】1\\. Understand the diagnostic approach in evaluating diplopia.\n\n【12】2\\. Describe the difference between monocular and binocular diplopia.\n\n【13】3\\. Know the differential diagnosis of a sixth nerve palsy.\n\n【14】##### Considerations\n\n【15】This 65-year-old man with known risk factors for cerebrovascular disease (hypertension and coronary artery disease) presents with an acute episode of binocular diplopia. The history suggests binocular diplopia as he tells you that covering up an eye resolves the diplopia. You are given the history that he has diplopia only on horizontal gaze. In this particular case, you are told that the patient’s bloodwork and brain MRI are normal. Given the history of hypertension and coronary artery disease he is at risk for cerebrovascular disease and ischemia. In this setting, the most likely cause of this man’s diplopia is an ischemic mononeuropathy to the abducens nerve. In this particular case, the patient has a completely normal examination except for a sixth nerve palsy. This makes it easy to pinpoint the location of the abnormality as the only location for an isolated abducens nerve palsy is in the nucleus. Table 34–1 shows locations where the sixth nerve can be affected and its associated clinical findings.\n删除4：<u>Table 34–1 • CLINICAL FINDINGS ASSOCIATED WITH CN VI PALSY</u>\n\n【16】### APPROACH TO: Binocular Diplopia\n\n【17】DEFINITIONS\n\n【18】PTOSIS: Drooping of the eyelids.\n\n【19】PROPTOSIS: Abnormal protrusion of the eyeball.\n\n【20】DIPLOPIA: Double vision.\n\n【21】ISCHEMIC MONONEUROPATHY: Isolated nerve injury from inadequate blood flow to the nerve.\n\n【22】#### CLINICAL APPROACH\n\n【23】Sixth nerve palsy has a variety of causes, and clinical examination usually leads to an accurate diagnosis. The abducens nucleus is located in the lower dorsal pons. The motor neurons of this nucleus send axons that course anteriorly in the pons and travel near the corticospinal tract and emerge in the sulcus between the pons and medulla. The abducens nerve exits the pons ventrally and ascends in the prepontine cistern via the subarachnoid space. It then rises over the petrous apex of the temporal bone and enters the cavernous sinus lying between the carotid artery and the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal nerve laterally. It finally passes into the orbit through the superior orbital fissure.\n\n【24】##### Etiology of Sixth Nerve Palsy\n\n【25】After the localization of the sixth nerve lesion, the next step is to determine the etiology of the abnormality. Table 34–1 shows there are various causes for a nuclear abducens abnormality. The evaluation includes serologic studies including an erythrocyte sedimentation rate, antinuclear antibody (ANA), complete blood count (CBC), glycosylated hemoglobin, and if appropriate a 2-hour glucose tolerance test. An MRI of the brain without contrast should be ordered concomitantly. An erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and ANA can help exclude inflammatory causes such as vasculitis; glycosylated hemoglobin can exclude diabetes mellitus, and a CBC can exclude infectious processes. An MRI of the brain and orbits can exclude vascular abnormalities such as an aneurysm and can exclude mass lesions that are inflammatory (sarcoid), demyelinating, neoplastic, or traumatic. An ischemic process may not be readily visualized on imaging studies and is often a diagnosis of exclusion.\n\n【26】##### Evaluation of Diplopia\n\n【27】Diplopia results from lack of visual fusion. The first step in evaluating a patient with diplopia is to determine whether it is binocular or monocular. Binocular diplopia is usually caused by an underlying primary neurologic problem. Monocular diplopia , conversely, is primarily caused by an ophthalmologic disorder such as abnormalities of the lens, cornea, vitreous humor, or iris . Rarely, monocular diplopia can be caused by occipital lobe disease or seizures. Binocular diplopia denotes double vision arising from misalignment of both eyes. Covering up one eye resolves the double vision. Monocular diplopia, however, arises from a primary problem within one eye. This type of diplopia does not resolve when an eye is covered.\n删除4：<u>Table 34–2 • CAUSES OF MONOCULAR DIPLOPIA</u>\n\n【28】The next step in evaluating someone with binocular diplopia is to determine if it is horizontal or vertical. Different eye muscles are involved in moving the eyes horizontally or vertically. There are only two muscles in each eye responsible for horizontal gaze and those are the medial rectus, which is innervated by the third nerve, and the lateral rectus, which is innervated by the sixth nerve. Worsening diplopia on near vision suggests a problem with the medial rectus, whereas diplopia that worsens when viewing distant and lateral objects suggests a problem with the lateral rectus.\n\n【29】The other four eye muscles (superior rectus, inferior rectus, inferior oblique, and superior oblique) move the eyes vertically. Individuals that present with vertical binocular diplopia are experiencing weakness in one or several of these muscles. Vertical diplopia that worsens on near vision suggests a problem with either the inferior oblique or superior oblique. At this point in the evaluation, it must be differentiated whether or not the patient’s binocular diplopia is secondary to a medial rectus or a lateral rectus problem. Examining extra-ocular muscles in the nine cardinal fields of gaze can readily point out which of the two muscles is affected. For example, if the right eye cannot cross the midline and look out laterally, the lateral rectus is affected. Conversely, if the right eye cannot cross the midline and turn inward, the medial rectus is affected.\n\n【30】One of these tests is called the alternate cover test and is performed by asking the patient to fixate on an object in each position of gaze. As the patient moves the eyes in each position, deviations in the eye as each one is alternately covered may be seen. The second test often used for evaluating binocular diplopia is the red lens test. In this test, a red lens is placed over an eye, most commonly the right eye, and the patient is asked to look at the nine positions of a cardinal gaze. The key to performing this test is to understand the following: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> image separation will be greatest in the direction of the weak muscle and 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> the image that is the furthest away from the midline is a false image and corresponds to the eye with impaired motility.\n\n【31】Evaluating other aspects of the cranial nerve examination will help determine from where the diplopia is arising. Special attention should be given to the eyelid, pupillary responses, symmetry of the pupillary size, abnormalities of cranial nerves V, VII, and VIII. For example, ptosis or droopiness of the eyelid can suggest a third nerve problem. Likewise, pupillary asymmetry suggests a third nerve problem. Fatigue of the eyelid can suggest myasthenia gravis. Patients who have a head tilt can also provide you with clues as to where the problem may lie. For example, someone with a right superior oblique palsy may have a leftward tilt of the head.\n\n【32】#### TREATMENT\n\n【33】Treatment of the underlying disorder of sixth nerve palsy is indicated when significant and persistent. An isolated and presumed ischemic-related sixth nerve palsy can be observed for improvement for 1 to 3 months. Patching of the involved eye can help alleviate diplopia symptoms temporarily. Eyeglasses made with prism lens can also be used to minimize or correct diplopia during recovery. Some suggest using botulinum toxin as a temporizing measure. It is injected into the antagonist muscle of the paretic muscle and the effect of a single injection can last for up to 3 to 6 months. However if these measures fail, surgery may be the only way to correct this problem.\n\n【34】####", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Figure 96.2 High-resolution  删除换行1 computed tomography scan.</u>\n\n【20】ANSWER 96\n\n【21】The history shows a progressive condition over at least 6 months. It is often difficult to be  删除换行1 sure of the exact length of history when a symptom such as breathlessness has an insidious  删除换行1 onset. A few possibilities are raised by the details of the history. There is a history of asthma,  删除换行1 but the absence of wheezing or obstruction on the respiratory function tests rule that out  删除换行1 as the cause of the current problem. An occupational history is always important in lung  删除换行1 disease but probably not here. Occupational asthma can be associated with isocyanates used  删除换行1 in the printing trade but this would cause an obstructive problem rather than the restrictive  删除换行1 problem shown here. The findings on examination fit with a restrictive problem with limited  删除换行1 expansion and crackles caused by reopening of airways closing during expiration because of  删除换行1 stiff lungs and low lung volumes.\n\n【22】The respiratory function tests show a mild restrictive ventilatory defect with reduced FEV1 删除换行1 and FVC but a slightly high ratio, suggesting stiff lungs or chest wall. Further tests such as  删除换行1 transfer factor would be expected to be reduced in the presence of pulmonary fibrosis.\n\n【23】The chest X-ray shows small lung fields and nodular and reticular shadowing most marked  删除换行1 in mid- and lower zones. The high-resolution CT scan shows widespread fibrotic change with  删除换行1 subpleural cyst formation. These changes are compatible with diffuse pulmonary fibrosis  删除换行1 (fibrosing alveolitis). In talking about fibrosis of the lungs, it is important to differentiate diffuse fine pulmonary fibrosis, as in this case, and localized pulmonary fibrosis as a result of  删除换行1 scarring after an acute inflammatory condition, such as pneumonia. The distribution and the  删除换行1 pattern of the changes on the CT scan are important in determining the diagnosis and the  删除换行1 likelihood of response to treatment in pulmonary fibrosis. Diffuse pulmonary fibrosis can be  删除换行1 associated with conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and can be induced by inhaled dusts  删除换行1 or ingested drugs. None of these seem likely here, making this likely to be idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). There is a rare familial form, so the father’s illness might be relevant. The  删除换行1 most common type of IPF is usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) with a subpleural distribution on the CT scan as shown here. In association with connective tissue disease, there may  删除换行1 be a more widespread patchy pattern of non-specific interstitial pneumonitis (NSIP). The  删除换行1 appearance of ‘ground-glass’ shadowing on the high-resolution CT is associated with active  删除换行1 cellular alveolitis and the greater likelihood of response to treatment. NSIP also has a better  删除换行1 response rate than UIP.\n\n【24】Further investigations consist of a search for a cause or associated conditions and a decision  删除换行1 whether a lung biopsy is warranted. Bronchoscopic biopsies are too small to be representative or useful in this situation, and a video-assisted thoracoscopic biopsy would be the usual  删除换行1 procedure. It would usually be appropriate to obtain histology of the lung in someone of  删除换行1 this age.\n\n【25】Treatment consists of low- to moderate-dose corticosteroids with or without an immunosuppressant such as azathioprine continued for several months to look for an effect, but the  删除换行1 results are poor in UIP, and it is important not to cause more harm than benefit from treatment with prolonged steroids and immunosuppressants. There is some evidence that antioxidants such as acetylcysteine improve the outlook, and these may be combined with the  删除换行1 steroids and azathioprine and new agents are under investigation. In a patient of this age,  删除换行1 lung transplantation might be a consideration as the disease progresses. Progression rates are  删除换行1 variable, and an acute aggressive form with death in 6 months can occur. More common in \n\n【26】UIP is steady progression over a few years.Case 96: Shortness of Breath\n\n【27】KEY POINTS\n\n【28】•\t Diffuse pulmonary fibrosis has a range of causes relevant to management.\n\n【29】•\t Ineffective treatment may produce serious side effects without significant benefit.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Cyclin proteins bind to and activate their partner Cdk. Active kinase then phosphorylates a host of protein substrates within the cell. Phosphorylation can alter the activity of a protein. The phosphorylation of a specific set of proteins by Cdk triggers the transition from one stage of the cell cycle to the next.\n\n【4】Cyclin proteins, as their name implies, undergo cyclic changes in abundance within the cytoplasm of a cell. Regulation of the timing of the transcription and translation of cyclin mRNAs controls the accumulation of specific cyclins within the cytoplasm. Similarly, cells control the destruction of cyclin proteins through the activity of the ubiquitin–proteasome pathway. The net effect is a series of biological “switches” turning the activity of the various Cdk proteins “on” or “off” and thereby moving the cell from one stage to the next in the cell cycle.\n\n【5】While the cell cycle includes all aspects of cellular life, it can also be viewed simply as a cyclic pattern of DNA replication and cell division. From this perspective, the cell is either 2N or 4N. In the normal diploid (2N) state chromosomes exist in pairs with one chromosome coming from each parent. A tetraploid (4N) cell has copied all of its genetic material, doubling the number of chromosomes. The classic “X” shape of a chromosome reflects this duplication. Only after a cell has gone through mitotic cell division will it restore itself to the 2N state.\n\n【6】Cell ploidy can be measured using an instrument called a flow cytometer . A flow cytometer uses laser light to detect a variety of properties of a cell. In the work described here, cells were stained with the DNA-specific fluorescent molecule propidium iodide . The cells are suspended in buffer and passed single file through the laser beam. Propidium iodide emits light in response to excitation by the laser. The intensity of the light emitted is proportional to the amount of DNA in the cell. The flow cytometer counts the number of cells in each of the populations being measured.\n\n【7】▪ Review/research the combinations of cyclins and Cdks associated with each stage of the cell cycle.\n\n【8】▪ Propose a model to explain how the activity of one cyclin could lead to the transcription of the next cyclin in the cell cycle.\n\n【9】▪ Which stage of the cell cycle is associated with DNA replication?\n\n【10】▪ Sketch and label the stages of the cell cycle. Indicate on your drawing which stages are 2N and which are 4N.\n\n【11】▪ Predict how the staining intensity of propidium iodide would change with the cell cycle.\n\n【12】Background\n----------\n\n【13】After DNA replication, several cellular events must occur before a cell can go through mitosis. Replicated centrosomes must migrate to opposite sides of the nucleus. The membrane surrounding the nucleus, the nuclear envelope , disassembles in a process known as nuclear envelope breakdown ( NEB ) in order to allow the microtubules growing out from those centrosomes to form a mitotic spindle and connect with the chromosomes. Cyclin proteins A2, B1, and B2 are all thought to be involved with these processes.\n\n【14】One way to investigate the role of each of the cyclins is to alter their expression in the cell. The technique of RNA interference (RNAi) allows researchers to knock down or reduce the level of expression of a protein of interest by selectively targeting its mRNA for destruction by the cell. Small interfering RNAs ( siRNAs ) are short double-stranded RNA sequences that interact with a collection of ribonucleases, proteins that function to degrade RNA molecules. Complementary base pairing between siRNA and mRNA results in the degradation and removal of mRNA from the cytoplasm.\n\n【15】Knockdown experiments require that researchers be able to transfect cells with the gene sequence for the specific siRNA. Transfected cells transcribe foreign DNA to make multiple copies of the siRNA. While many kinds of cells can be transfected, tissue culture cells are especially useful for these types of experiments. In this work, the researchers used HeLa cells , a very well researched human tissue culture cell line. HeLa cells were isolated from a woman named Henrietta Lacks who died of cancer in 1951. Because HeLa cells were originally tumor cells they divide rapidly in culture with a total cell cycle time of approximately 24 h.\n\n【16】▪ Sketch and label the stages of mitosis.

HeLa cells were treated with culture media containing 2 mM thymidine for a total of 35 h to insure that all the cells were blocked in S phase. Cells were released from the block by washing out the thymidine using fresh culture media lacking thymidine. All the cells simultaneously entered S phase and continued through the rest of the cell cycle as a synchronized population.\n\n【23】### Tracking nuclear envelope breakdown using a fluorescent mitosis biosensor\n\n【24】Fluorescent mitosis biosensor (MBS) is a genetically engineered protein that is designed to change its localization inside the cell in response to nuclear envelope breakdown. A plasma membrane–targeting domain was added to one end of yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) while a nuclear localization sequence was added to the other end. YFP accumulates in the nucleus when the nuclear membrane is intact and travels to the plasma membrane when it is not.\n\n【25】### Knockdown of cyclins by siRNA\n\n【26】Pools of double-stranded siRNA (d-siRNA) molecules complementary to portions of the mRNA sequences for cyclins A2, B1, and B2 were generated using a recombinant version of the protein dicer. HeLa cells were transfected with the d-siRNAs prior to their release from the thymidine block. A pool of d-siRNAs specific to firefly luciferase ( GL3 ) were also generated and transfected into HeLa cells.\n\n【27】### Determination of ploidy by flow cytometry\n\n【28】HeLa cells treated with various d-siRNAs were collected 20 h after thymidine release. The cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde followed by permeabilization with ice-cold methanol and stained with a solution of 50 μg/μL propidium iodide. Cell numbers for each population of fluorescence intensity were measured at various times after release from the thymidine block.\n\n【29】### Immunoblot analysis\n\n【30】HeLa cells were lysed and centrifuged to collect soluble proteins released from the cell. Total protein concentration was measured, and 8 μg of each protein sample was loaded onto an SDS polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were transferred from the gel onto a PVDF membrane and reacted with primary antibodies specific to cyclins A2, B1, and B2. Primary antibody binding was detected using an HRP-labeled secondary antibody followed by incubation with the HRP substrate.\n\n【31】▪ Excess thymidine accumulates in cells in the form of deoxythymidine triphosphate (dTTP).

The wife states that the two have been married for6 months and that they dated for 2 months prior to that. During all their sexual encounters， the husband insists that the wife wear very high-heeled shoes at all times. Although the wife initially thought that this behavior was sensual， she now worries that it is the shoes that the husband finds attractive and not her. She thinks the behavior is \"freaky\" and has asked the husband to stop， which he has refused to do.This has led to arguments between them. The husband states that he is unable to achieve an erection or orgasm without the presence of the shoes. He notes that for as long as he can remember， he has needed high-heeled shoes as part of his sexual play. He feels no shame or guilt about this behavior， although he is worried that it is causing problems between him and his wife.\n\n【2】What is the most likely diagnosis for the husband?\n\n【3】What is the course of and prognosis for this disorder?\n\n【4】ANSWERS TO CASE 58：Fetishistic Disorder\n\n【5】Summary： A 32-year-old man presents with\n\n【6】Insistence that his wife wear very high-heeled shoes during all sexual encounters\n\n【7】Problems in their marriage due to this behavior\n\n【8】Refusal to stop because he is unable to achieve an erection or an orgasm without the presence of the shoes\n\n【9】ILong-standing association of shoes with sexual activity\n\n【10】No shame or guilt about it but concern about its impact on his marriage\n\n【11】Most likely diagnosis： Fetishistic disorder.\n\n【12】Course of and prognosis for this disorder： The course of this disorder is chronic， and it has a poor prognosis.\n\n【13】Objectives\n\n【14】1\\.

Describe the treatment of patients with fetishistic disorder.删除34：<u>(EPA 4，9)</u>\n\n【17】Considerations\n\n【18】The patient has a long history of using high-heeled shoes to achieve erection and orgasm during intercourse. A poor prognosis is associated with an early age of onset， a high frequency of acts， no guilt or shame about the act， and substance abuse (the patient has three of these factors). The course and prognosis are better when the patient has a history of intercourse without paraphilic activity， when the patient has a strong motivation to change， and when the patient is self-referred(this patient has none of these factors-although he was not referred for treat-ment by a legal agency， it can be assumed that his wife suggested the visit to the psychiatrist).\n\n【19】ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION： Difficulty in obtaining and maintaining an erection， which can have a psychological or an organic cause. Some studies report that erectile dysfunction has an organic basis in 20% to 50% of men with this dis-order. This can include a large number of diseases such as diabetes， malnutrition， cirrhosis， chronic renal failure， atherosclerosis， and a host of others.Medications can also impair male sexual functioning， and many psychiatric drugs (antidepres-sants， mood stabilizers， and antipsychotics)， as well as antihypertensives and other drugs， can be to blame. To differentiate psychological causes from organic ones， a study of nocturnal penile tumescence (erections occurring during sleep) is often made. In patients who have normal nocturnal erections but erectile dys-function during their waking hours， or with a partner， the problem is much more likely to have a psychological cause.\n\n【20】EXHIBITIONISM： A disorder marked by recurrent and intense sexual arousal from exposing ones genitals to unsuspecting and nonconsenting persons.\n\n【21】FETISHISTIC BEHAVIOR： Similar to fetishistic disorder but without clinically significant distress or an impairment in functioning， whether engaging in solitary sexual behavior or with a partner.\n\n【22】FETISHISTIC DISORDER： A paraphilia in which the individual seeks sexual gratification primarily through contact with an object， such as shoes or underwear， which is closely associated with the body. Fetishists are mostly male， and fetishism usually starts in adolescence. The individual can masturbate with the fetishistic object or incorporate it into sexual intercourse. These behaviors must cause clini-cally significant distress or impairment in social， occupational， or other functioning.\n\n【23】FROTTEURISTIC DISORDER： Recurrent and intense sexual arousal from touching and rubbing against a nonconsenting person.\n\n【24】PARAPHILIC DISORDER： A disorder in which an individual primarily seeks sexual gratification (arousal and orgasm) through means considered abnormal by society. This is reserved for those cases in which a sexually deviant fantasy or impulse has been expressed behaviorally for at least 6 months. Paraphilias include fetishism， voyeurism， exhibitionism， sadism， masochism， transvestism， and pedo-philia. What is considered normal sexual behavior varies greatly among different cultures. Many individuals have more than one paraphilia. Paraphilic disorders must cause distress or impairment or entail personal harm， or a risk of harm to others. The presence of a paraphilia by itself does not necessarily justify or require clinical intervention.\n\n【25】PEDOPHILIC DISORDER： A form of paraphilia in which a person either has acted on intense sexual urges toward children or experiences recurrent sexual 删除换行1 urges toward and fantasies about children that cause distress or interpersonal difficulty. These sexual urges or behavior are generally directed toward a prepu-bescent child or children of age 13 or younger. This generally doesn't include an individual in late adolescence involved in an ongoing sexual relationship with a13-year-old.\n\n【26】SEXUAL MASOCHISM DISORDER： The deriving of sexual gratification， or the tendency to derive sexual gratification， from being physically or emotionally abused or humiliated.\n\n【27】SEXUAL SADISM DISORDER： Recurrent and intense sexual arousal from the physical or psychological suffering of others.\n\n【28】TRANSSEXUAL： A person who feels as if he or she is \"trapped in the body of the wrong gender， for example， a man who believes that he is really a woman although genetically and functionally male.\n\n【29】TRANSVESTIC DISORDER： Recurrent and intense sexual arousal from cross-dressing as manifested by fantasies， urges， or behaviors and which causes significant distress or impairment. It doesn't apply to all individual who dress as the opposite sex， even if done habitually.\n\n【30】TRANSVESTITE： A heterosexual male who dresses in female clothing.\n\n【31】VAGINISMUS： An involuntary muscle constriction of the outer third of the vagina that causes marked distress or interpersonal difficulty and interferes with sexual intercourse. A diagnosis of vaginismus is not made when there is an organic cause for the disorder or when it is better accounted for by another mental disorder such as somatic symptom disorder.\n\n【32】VOYEURISTIC DISORDER： A disorder that involves achieving recurrent and intense sexual arousal by observing an unsuspecting and nonconsenting person who is undressing or unclothed and/or engaged in sexual activity.\n\n【33】CLINICAL APPROACH\n\n【34】Diagnosis and Clinical Presentation\n\n【35】Usually fetishism has an onset during puberty， but fetishes can develop prior to adolescence as well. The particular fetish used may be linked to someone closely involved with the patient during childhood and may be associated with being loved or traumatized. A fetish may also be seen as a symbol of feeling sexually inade-quate. Once established， fetishistic disorder tends to be chronic. In clinical settings， the disorder is almost exclusively found in males. Sexual activity may be directed toward a fetish object (masturbating in shoes) or incorporated in the sexual act(a particular shoe must be worn for intercourse). Some patients with fetishistic disorder may prefer solitary sexual activity even when they are in meaningful rela-tionships. Diagnostic criteria are listed in Table 58-1. It is important to distinguish the disorder from fetishistic behavior without the disorder. Use of a fetish object for sexual arousal without distress or any other adverse consequences would not meet criteria for the disorder.\n\n【36】Table 58-1·DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA FOR FETISHISTIC DISORDER\n\n【37】An individual has intense， recurring sexual arousal from either the use of nonliving objects， such as shoes or female underwear， or a highly specific focus on a nongenital body part such as the foot. This is manifested by fantasies， urges， or behaviors；this must be present for at least 6 mo.\n\n【38】The sexual fantasies， desires， or behaviors must cause clinically significant distress or impair-ment in social， occupational， or other important functioning.\n\n【39】The fetish objects are not limited to articles of clothing used for cross-dressing (as in transvestic disorder) or devices specifically designed for the purpose of genital stimulation (eg，vibrator).\n\n【40】Differential Diagnosis\n\n【41】Paraphilias tend to be compound； the presence of one should prompt the clinician to inquire about others. Paraphilic disorders are often closely related， for example foot fetishism and shoe fetishism. Diagnostically， the closest disorder to fetishis-tic disorder is transvestic disorder， where fetish objects are limited to articles of clothing exclusively worn during cross-dressing. Fetishes can co-occur with sexual masochism/sadism disorder， where primary sexual arousal is from humiliation， domination of self， or suffering of others and nonliving objects. Fetishistic disorder may be associated with autoerotic asphyxiation， which can be life threatening. This behavior involves persons engaging in sexual activity while restricting blood flow to the brain (hanging by the neck， choking) to heighten the erotic sensations and intensity through mild hypoxia. The intention is to release restriction after orgasm， but accidental death may occur.\n\n【42】Treatment\n\n【43】Fetishistic disorder， like most paraphilias， is difficult to treat. The presence of only one paraphilia， normal intelligence， an absence of substance dependence， and stable adult relationships are all good prognostic indicators. Individuals do not usually seek treatment voluntarily. Various psychiatric interventions can be tried， including external control， reduction of sexual drives， treatment of comor-bid conditions (eg， depression， anxiety)， cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)， and dynamic therapy. When victimization is involved with the disorder， exter-nal control—including prison (which may not contain treatment) and removal from family or work-may be needed to eliminate opportunities to act on the urges. CBT includes sex education， social skills training， and cognitive restruc-turing， including a reevaluation of the ways in which the individual rationalizes the behavior. Treatment can involve desensitization to the fetish， relaxation tech-niques， and learning to avoid triggers for the fetishism. Psychodynamic psycho-therapy (insight oriented) explores the roots of the behavior and the events that caused the development of the fetish in childhood or adolescence. In this particu-lar case， given the solitary and isolated nature of the fetish， the therapist might also consider directly addressing the problems this has developed in the patient's relationship with his wife and consider whether more acceptance of this behav-ior within the marriage might be helpful. This is more difficult to achieve with greater numbers of paraphilias.\n\n【44】There have been published clinical trials and case reports on the use of pharma-cologic agents in the treatment of fetishes. Those psychiatric medications used include fluoxetine， sertraline， mirtazapine， topiramate， and buspirone. However， the number of subjects in these studies has been quite small and no clear conclu-sions have been reached. Pharmacotherapy can be useful to treat any comorbid mental illness. Antiandrogen medications such as cyproterone acetate， medroxy-progesterone acetate， and leuprolide acetate have also been studied， but again， no clear conclusion or best practice can be discerned.\n删除16：<u>CASE CORRELATION\n删除25：<u>See also Case 36 (Gender Dysphoria).</u>\n</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Gram-negative organisms are common and likely to contaminate the wound with such a severe laceration injury. The organism grew rapidly on all three culture media used (BA， Choc BA， and MAC). It was oxidase positive， non-lactose fermenting， mucoid， and beta-hemolytic on sheep BA. It did not require high salt concentration to grow， making certain Vibrio organisms (those that need high， 6.5% salt concentration) unlikely. The sensitivity pattern is also useful .

New skin lesions had appeared， beginning at least 6 months earlier， initially in the proximal left arm and elbow area， with several other lesions in other body sites in the subsequent 3 months. The skin lesions got larger over time.\n\n【3】The review of systems showed that the patient did not feel ill； he looked healthy. He had no itch or pain， but anesthesia at the center of the flat older skin lesions. There were no chills or fever， no body aches， except for old arthritis of the shoulders. He had no skin abscesses， no nasal discharge， and no cough.\n\n【4】The past medical history was significant for recurrent impetigo in the upper and lower extremities over the past 2-3 years (these are different from the newer skin lesions). He had been under the care of a dermatologist for 2 years， with 删除换行1 mainly topical agents prescribed for the impetigo. Two skin punch biopsies done by the dermatologist on the left forearm on 3/30/09 showed the following from the two sites： suppurative folliculitis and impetiginized non-specific ulcer. No fungal elements were found on the biopsies. The patient was treated over sev-eral months with topical and systemic antibiotic regimens， antifungal， and topical steroid therapy， without much effect. He had arthritis of the shoulder and elbows for years. No other serious medical or surgical problem was reported by the patient.\n\n【5】A biopsy of one of the new flat skin lesions was done on 9/10/10， following which he was referred to the office on 9/29/10.\n\n【6】The epidemiologic history suggested that he did a lot of vocational work in the yard， did woodwork， worked with and had contact with lawn， soil， and grass. He had bought an old， previously abandoned house， with overgrown yard and lawn， several years earlier. He rebuilt this house over a 10-month period， including cleaning， clearing， plumbing work， and crawling under the elevation. He had two healthy dogs (an outside dog， aged 7 years， and an inside dog 3 years old). He had been married to his wife for 22 years. She was healthy and had no skin lesions.\n\n【7】The family and social history included a daughter， aged 20 years， who was healthy， and lived at home with the parents. The patient worked as a firefighter. He did not smoke and very rarely drank alcohol. He had no drug allergies. He was on no regular medications， except for PRN tramadol and naproxen for arthritis， but was recently prescribed alpraxolam (0.25 mg) PRN， for sleep and anxiety.\n\n【8】On examination， he was alert and oriented， slightly anxious， but in no acute distress. The vital signs were as follows： BP 130/80， RR 20， HR 76， temperature98.1 °F； height 5'9\" and weight 161 pounds. The head and neck exam was unre-markable. He had normal oral mucosa， several tooth fillings， and no lesions in the face， nose， mouth， or neck. The heart， lung， and abdomen were normal. The external genitalia showed a normal circumcised male phallus. The lymph nodes were not enlarged in the neck， axilla， or groin. The neurologic exam was normal， except for the skin lesions. The upper extremities were unremarkable， except the skin lesions to be discussed below. The lower extremities showed mild changes suggestive of tinea pedis between the fourth and fifth toes， but otherwise were normal.\n\n【9】The skin findings were as follows. The left elbow radial forearm showed a large lesion with a flat center that was dry and anesthetic； the extensor area just above the right elbow showed a discoid， eczematous area with distinct borders. There were also a few younger lesions noted in the left and right flanks， as well as inner and outer elbow areas. The right posterolateral flank lesion was about3-4 cm in size， raised， oval shaped or elliptical， and purplish.

HlV serology was negative； glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) level18 U/g hemoglobin (normal range 7-20).\n\n【14】Case discussion\n\n【15】First， let us discuss the character of the skin lesions. These were typically large(several centimeters) and flat， with numbness developing in the center as the lesions got older. There was no itch or pain associated with the lesions. The lesions became flatter and dry in the center with aging， and were associated with loss of 删除换行1 hair. There were no lesions on the face or mouth area. The lesions were noted in bilateral upper extremities， especially the elbow， and also flank areas.\n\n【16】· Do these additional descriptions influence your differential diagnoses?\n\n【17】Our initial differential diagnoses before review of the biopsy included the following.\n\n【18】·Sarcoidosis\n\n【19】· Annular psoriasis\n\n【20】·Non-specific dermatitis\n\n【21】· Atypical mycobacterial infection\n\n【22】· Deep fungal infection\n\n【23】·Subcutaneous mycosis (e.g. dematiaceous fungal infection)\n\n【24】· Systemic lupus erythematosus\n\n【25】· Cutaneous leishmaniasis\n\n【26】·Leprosy (Mycobacterium leprae)\n\n【27】The histopathology of the skin punch biopsy of the right upper arm done on9/10/10， a biopsy of skin to the level of the subcutis， was described as showing non-necrotizing granulomatous inflammation involving the dermis with numer-ous acid-fast-positive organisms.\n\n【28】·How do the new findings modify your differential diagnoses?\n\n【29】More detailed characterization of the histopathologic findings revealed the fol-lowing in the histopathology report：\n\n【30】The epidermisSexhibitedlhyperkeratosis and focalacanthosis. Portions of the superficial dermis display fibrosis consistent with scar. In the dermis there are focal infiltrates of non-necrotizing granulomatous inflammation admixed with a moderate lympho-cytic inflammatory infiltrate. In focal areas， inflammatory infiltrate displays a perineural distribution. Numerous AFB are present in Fite-stained sections. No AFB or fungal organisms are identified in either routine AFB or PAS-stained sections， respectively. No foreign material is identified under polarized light.\n\n【31】·What is your final diagnosis?\n\n【32】The final histopathologic diagnosis was noted by the dermatopathologist as fol-IOWS：\n\n【33】The histopathologic findings show granulomatous inflammation and numerous acid-fast-positive organisms in Fite-stained sections， consistent with a mycobacterial infection. Given the focal perineural pattern of inflammatory infiltrate， positive staining of numerous organisms in Fite-stained sections， and absence of staining in routine AFB stained sections， the findings are suggestive of the lepromatous type of leprosy.\n\n【34】· Preliminary diagnosis： Leprosy (Mycobacterium leprae infection).\n\n【35】Follow-up findings and more data on the patient\n\n【36】Following extensive discussions with the patient and review of the epidemiol-ogy， as well as review of the histopathology of the skin biopsy done earlier， a tentative diagnosis was made. A call was made to a specialized center to discuss this diagnosis. The patient suggested (and I agreed) that he should be referred to this tertiary center， specializing in Hansen’s disease. A decision was then made to refer the patient to this center for further work-up， treatment， and follow-up.\n\n【37】Follow-up at the Hansen's disease center\n\n【38】Work-up for definitive diagnosis and treatment was initiated with the National Hansen's Disease Programs (NHDP) in Baton Rouge， LA. At the NHDP， the patient had additional skin biopsy just above the right elbow and skin smears performed from typical sites， which showed high bacterial index in some places and negative findings in other places.\n\n【39】Treatment with three drugs was started， with follow-up scheduled every 3months. Laboratory tests to be followed included CBC and liver function tests. His treatment was scheduled to last for 24 months.\n\n【40】Months later， during a follow-up visit， the diagnosis of thalassemia minor was confirmed when the patient became symptomatic with shortness of breath while on treatment (he was then found to be severely anemic). The anemia was thought to be secondary to dapsone， even though the screening G6PD level was normal. The dapsone was stopped and replaced with clarithromycin， with the new three-drug regimen being rifampin， clofazimen， and clarithromycin.\n\n【41】The patient has completed a 24-month treatment program， according to the NHDP protocol. Follow-up by this center will still continue for years.\n\n【42】Epidemiology of leprosy and Mycobacterium leprae infection in this patient\n\n【43】This patient was relatively healthy and looked well. He had multiple skin patches(6 lesions)， with central areas of anesthesia. His symptoms had been ongoing for at least 6-12 months or longer， although there was some concern initially that he may have had bacterial impetigo in 2009. At that time the punch biopsy showed suppurative folliculitis and impetiginized non-specific ulcer.\n\n【44】One of the key epidemiologic risk factors identified in this patient was that he was exposed to an armadillo-infested environment over a prolonged period， while renovating his home. He confirmed that the grounds of the abandoned old building that he bought were infested with armadillos. The renovation included crawling under buildings， doing plumbing work， and other activities that led to prolonged contact with contaminated soil and armadillo-infested grounds. It is thought that this was the most likely way in which he may have acquired the infection.\n\n【45】The literature suggests that currently， most cases of leprosy worldwide are from S.E. Asia (India， Indonesia， Bangladesh)， followed by the Americas (e.g. Brazil)， then Africa (e.g. Nigeria) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，2\\]</u>. However， these data are based mostly on passive case finding and not active case-finding reports. Between 1985 and2010， the number of registered cases fell from 5.4 million to 244，796， while the prevalence rate per 10，000 fell from 21.1 to 0.37.\n\n【46】In the United States， endemic cases have been identified in New York City， Louisiana， Texas， and Mississippi. According to the NHDP， 205 new cases were detected in the US in 2010 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. About 6500 cases were registered in 2006 with the NHDP， the vast majority of these being in Hispanic and Asian immigrants； 75%of new US cases annually are among immigrants. Some cases in native-born US citizens may be due to overseas exposure， and some to exposure to infected armadillos. In some cases no history of exposure can be established. In North America (USA)， leprosy appears sometimes to be a zoonosis (specifically from armadillos).\n\n【47】Our patient most likely acquired his leprosy locally through direct skin or mucous membrane contact to secretions or tissue from armadillos that infested the grounds of his old house.\n\n【48】Leprosy is a chronic disease that produces sores on the skin and mucous mem-branes， and infects nerves， producing loss of sensation in the affected areas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，3\\]</u>. Clinically， the disease appears as two types. In the more virulent form， or lepro-matous leprosy， the numerous sores contain many bacteria； in the milder form， or tuberculoid leprosy， fewer sores appear because of the body's immune response to the infection. Signs of the disease often do not appear for many years. While leprosy is rarely fatal， it can cause permanent disfigurements.\n\n【49】Leprosy in armadillos 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>\n\n【50】Nine-banded armadillos (Dasypus novemcinctus) dare naturally infectedwith Mycobacterium leprae and have been implicated in zoonotic transmission of leprosy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Studies have found infected armadillos in wide-ranging areas across the south-central regions of the US， especially Texas and Louisiana 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Since the leprosy bacillus concentrates in the body's extremities (e.g. fingers， ears) in people， scientists have suggested that the armadillo's susceptibility to leprosy was very likely due to its unusually low body temperature of 90°F (33°C)， which is more than 8°lower than the temperature of humans and other mammals.\n\n【51】Although the risk of transmission to humans appears low， scientists are still not sure how leprosy is spread to the human population from this animal. However， armadillos can shed leprosy bacilli into the environment in bodily secretions， and bacilli might survive extracellularly in the environment for short periods 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Prolonged contact with contaminated environments may therefore be relevant to the acquisition of leprosy from the armadillo.\n\n【52】Infection with M. leprae\n\n【53】删除3：<u>Figure 13.3b The different clinical classifications of leprosy using both the World Health Organization and the Ridley-Joplin systems.

His condition is refractory to the usual psychiatric medication, and psychosurgery may reduce his potential for violence and make him less dangerous to himself and to others. The health care team thus hopes the intervention will provide more humane treatment than the prison-like incarceration to which he is currently subjected. However, given the history and grim connotation of lobotomy as well as its irreversibilty, it raises major issues of appropriate consultation and informed consent more than for any other treatment. These concerns continue to be at the forefront of ethical considerations in psychosurgical techniques and other functional psychiatric interventions, such as electroconvulsive therapy (ECT ).\n\n【4】##### Historical perspective\n\n【5】Psychosurgery has a controversial history, in which medical, moral, social, and political considerations intermingle. First described in 1936, and defined as a surgical ablation or destruction of nerve transmission pathways with the aim of modifying behavior, the conventional “lobotomy” of the 1940s and 1950s flourished. There was a strong desire to relieve over-population in asylums and hospitals, and lobotomy came to be seen as a means for calming down and even discharging an appreciable proportion of committed patients,通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>1 </sup></u> or of at least of making caring for them easier. Little attention was paid to patient selection and consent. The unrestrained application of lobotomy makes it difficult to this day to gain an objective evaluation of its true efficacy.\n\n【6】Almost immediately after its introduction, lobotomy was noted to have severe collateral effects on the patient’s personality and their emotional experience of the world. Caregivers described them as listless, dull, apathetic, without drive or initiative, passive, preoccupied and dependent. A horror among the public developed that the operation actually excised free will.\n\n【7】In 1948, Norbert Wiener remarked,\n\n【8】> Prefrontal lobotomy … has been recently been having a certain vogue, probably not unconnected with the fact that it makes the custodial care of many patients easier. Let me remark in passing that killing them makes their custodial care still easier.\nIn 1950, physicians in the Soviet Union banned lobotomy, concluding that it was “contrary to the principles of humanity,” and that it “turned an insane person into an idiot.”通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>3 </sup></u> Notorious outcomes involving lobotomy, both in real life (e.g. Rosemary Kennedy and Rose Williams, sister of Tennessee Williams), as well as in fiction (e.g. Ken Kesey’s One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest ) perpetuated a horror of psychosurgical techniques.\n\n【9】After neuroleptics and chlorpromazine were discovered in the 1950s, psychosurgery declined rapidly, although it continued to be used in cases viewed as otherwise refractory to treatment. Following spirited social controversy in the US, a Federal commission was convened in 1977, which discredited growing public allegations claiming that psychosurgery was used to control minorities, restrict individual rights, and that its undesirable effects were nonethical. The Chairman of National Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research, even went so far as to declare:\n\n【10】> We have looked at the data and they did not support our prejudices. I, for one, did not expect to come out in favor of psychosurgery. But we saw that some very sick people had been helped by it … The operation should not be banned.\nNevertheless, lobotomy was subsequently prohibited in a number of states in the US and in other countries such as Germany or Japan. Psychosurgery continues to be performed, but is strictly regulated and controlled in the US, Finland, Sweden, the UK, Spain, India, Belgium, and the Netherlands <sup>1 <span class=\"target\"></span></sup> .\n\n【11】##### Psychosurgery techniques\n\n【12】###### Conventional lobotomy\n\n【13】Prefrontal leucotomy – or “standard” prefrontal lobotomy – and transorbital leucotomy destroyed parts of the frontal lobes or their connections to the limbic system. Significant “frontal lobe” syndrome was a common complication, characterized by permanent apathy or euphoria, inconsistency, puerility, boorishness, impaired judgment, and chaotic behavior. Harmful side effects included epileptic seizures or aggressiveness.\n\n【14】###### Functional neurosurgery\n\n【15】Earlier techniques have since been abandoned in favor of much more limited – although still destructive – procedures. Grouped under the heading of “psychosurgery,” these procedures based on a “functional” neurosurgical approach are:\n\n【16】通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> anterior capsulotomy – interrupting frontothalamic connections in the internal capsule\n\n【17】通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> cingulotomy – partial destruction of the cingulate gyrus, altering certain connections within the limbic system\n\n【18】通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> subcaudate tractotomy – acting on the lower portion of the frontal cortex to destroy the fibres which connect it to the hypothalamus and the head of the caudate nucleus and\n\n【19】通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> bilimbic leucotomy – combining cingulotomy and subcaudate tractotomy.\n\n【20】Results are generally considered effective, although this is on the basis of small case series due to the paucity of acceptable indications. The severe cognitive behavioral disorders experienced by early lobotomy patients are no longer observed. More recently, the administration of highly focused gamma radiation (“gamma-knife”) has produced clinical results similar to functional neurosurgical techniques, while being minimally invasive.\n\n【21】###### Cerebral stimulation techniques\n\n【22】New hopes are arising for new, nondestructive techniques based on stereotaxic neurostimulation. Initially used to treat severe Parkinson’s disease, they appear to be comparatively free of complications, as there is no permanent cerebral damage. They achieve psychomodulation, even the equivalent of a reversible anterior capsulotomy, by inducing radiofrquency stimulation to the brain in specific locations of the cerebral parenchyma via implanted electrodes. Although very different from surgery mutilating the cerebral parenchyma, these stimulation techniques will probably always remain less psychologically and socially acceptable than, for instance, cardiac electrical pacing. However, because the patient is free to interrupt the neurostimulation, the voluntariness of the patient’s submission to treatment is preserved. In fact, these new treatments share many points in common with behavioral modification induced by pharmaceutical treatment.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Multiple ring stages and appliqué forms are indicative of P. falciparum ; several erythrocytes show developing trophozoites that are spread across the erythrocytes in a band fashion that is indicative of P. malariae infection. Normal size erythrocytes without stippling (Schüffner dots) would exclude P. vivax and P. ovale .\n\n【7】Question: 48.2 A 35-year-old woman in California was diagnosed with malaria acquired through a blood transfusion. A discussion of this case by physicians included the following statements. Which statement is correct?\n\n【8】A. The infected blood used in the transfusion contained sporozoites.\n\n【9】B. The patient should be treated with chloroquine and primaquine.\n\n【10】C. The patient should be treated to eradicate the stages responsible for symptoms.\n\n【11】D. The blood donor had chloroquine-resistant malaria.\n\n【12】E. The patient would not be infective to mosquitoes.\n\n【13】Answer: 48.2 C. The primary goal should be to treat the patient to eliminate the erythrocytic cycle that is the cause of symptoms. This would constitute a radical cure because the liver phase only occurs if infection is initiated by sporozoites. Thus, treating with primaquine is not necessary because the patient will not harbor hypnozoites. Likewise, answer A is not correct because sporozoites are only acquired from mosquitoes. Transfusion malaria is caused by schizonts and merozoites present in the transferred blood. There is no way to know that the malaria is chloroquine resistant until after treatment with chloroquine and the patient, although not likely to occur, could transmit the infection to mosquitoes because gametocytes would be present in the blood and susceptible Anopheles species occur in the United States.\n\n【14】Question: 48.3 A 45-year-old man complained of episodic high fever and more recently of confusion and severe headache.

What specialties should be consulted?\n4.  What is the best way to manage emergent hypertension and what dosing would be used?Rationale and Evidence‐based Practice Explanation\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【21】### Based on the data given, what are the differential diagnoses and the most likely diagnosis for this child?\n\n【22】This teenage patient is presenting with a hypertensive emergency. The differential diagnoses include essential hypertension and secondary hypertension, although secondary hypertension is more likely given the severity of blood pressure elevation. The differential diagnosis of secondary hypertension in children more commonly includes renovascular disease or renal parenchymal disease. Other less prevalent causes of hypertensive emergency in adolescence include secondary hypertension due to aortic coarctation, endocrine conditions such as pheochromocytoma or Cushing disease, or secondary hypertension related to recreational drugs 删除25：<u></u>.\n\n【23】The most likely diagnosis is hypertensive emergency secondary to renal parenchymal disease given the significantly elevated serum creatinine level and distant history of UTI and FTT. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) defines hypertension as a blood pressure ≥95th percentile for age, height, and sex, or above 130/80 mmHg for children 13 years and older. Primary or essential hypertension is hypertension without a known etiology and is the most prevalent cause of hypertension is children over 6 years old. Secondary hypertension means that there is an underlying cause for the hypertension (cardiac, renal, endocrine, neurologic, vascular, ingestions, etc.). Hypertensive emergency is defined as hypertension with end‐organ damage (abnormalities in the heart, eyes, kidneys and/or brain). Prompt recognition and treatment of hypertensive emergency is critical in order to avoid further end‐organ damage. Treatment of hypertensive emergency should be targeted at gradually reducing mean arterial pressure by no more than 25% in the first hour and then gradually over the next 24–48 hours.\n\n【24】Table 94.4 Causes of hypertension related to age.\n\n| Age group | Cause of hypertension | Associated findings |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Newborn | Renal: anomalies of the kidneys and urinary tract, vascular stenosis, thrombosis | Elevated serum creatinine, abnormalities on ultrasound |\n|  | Cardiac: coarctation of the aorta | Discrepant four‐extremity blood pressures/perfusion |\n|  | Endocrine: primary hyperaldosteronism, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, pheochromocytoma, Cushing disease | Tachycardia, palpitations, sweating, elevated serum cortisol levels |\n| Preschool through age 6 years | Renal: congenital anomalies of kidneys and urinary tract, renal parenchymal disease, vascular stenosis, thrombosis | Elevated serum creatinine, abnormalities on ultrasound |\n|  | Cardiac: coarctation of the aorta | Discrepant four‐extremity blood pressures/perfusion |\n|  | Enodcrine: pheochromocytoma, Cushing disease | Tachycardia, palpitations, sweating, elevated serum cortisol levels |\n| School age (6–10 years) | Essential hypertension | Obesity + family history |\n|  | Renal: congenital anomalies of kidneys and urinary tract, renal parenchymal disease, vascular stenosis, thrombosis | Elevated serum creatinine, abnormalities on ultrasound |\n|  | Enodcrine: pheochromocytoma, Cushing disease | Tachycardia, palpitations, sweating, elevated serum cortisol levels |\n| Adolescence | Essential hypertension | Obesity + family history |\n|  | Renal: congenital anomalies of kidneys and urinary tract, renal parenchymal disease, vascular stenosis, thrombosis | Elevated serum creatinine, abnormalities on ultrasound |\n|  | Medications and recreational drugs: stimulants, oral contraceptives, corticosteroids, cocaine, amphetamines | Symptoms are related to medication or drug of exposure |\n|  | Endocrine: pheochromocytoma, Cushing disease | Tachycardia, palpitations, sweating, elevated serum cortisol levels |\n\n【26】Obtaining a detailed history and physical examination will help guide the hypertension evaluation. Physical examination should include height, weight, calculated BMI, and percentiles for age. Children with chronic illness often have impaired growth, while obesity is associated with primary hypertension. With stage II hypertension, or systolic blood pressure ≥95th percentile + 12 mmHg or ≥140/90 mmHg (whichever is lower), physical examination should include both upper extremity blood pressure measurements and one leg blood pressure measurement to evaluate for aortic coarctation.\n\n【27】### Would any other diagnostic studies be recommended?\n\n【28】Work‐up for hypertension includes tests to evaluate for secondary causes as well as to look for target organ damage. The work‐up should be guided by the age of the patient, the severity of hypertension, associated comorbid conditions, and findings on history and physical examination. General work‐up typically includes a urinalysis, comprehensive metabolic panel, and renal ultrasound with Doppler. Additional work‐up may include complete blood count, thyroid studies, metanephrines, additional imaging of the renal vasculature such as CT or magnetic resonance angiogram, and sleep study based on the individual patient. An eye examination and echocardiogram can help to evaluate for end‐organ damage from hypertension. In this case study, renal/bladder ultrasound was obtained later and confirmed the diagnosis of hypertensive emergency secondary to renal parenchymal disease as it showed small echogenic kidneys with bilateral hydroureteronephrosis and thickened bladder wall. He was diagnosed with end‐stage kidney disease due to congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract.\n\n【29】The AAP 2017 high blood pressure guidelines recommend obtaining a renal ultrasound for children less than 6 years of age or those (regardless of age) with abnormal urinalysis or renal function. Renal parenchymal disease combined with renal vascular disease account for 63–74% of secondary hypertension in children and adolescents.\n\n【30】### What specialties should be consulted?\n\n【31】Specialty consultation is recommended for pediatric patients presenting with stage II hypertension. Nephrology and cardiology are both specialty services that manage hypertension. Depending on the suspected etiology, one service may be consulted preferentially over the other. With vision disturbance and concern for target organ damage, an ophthalmology consultation is also recommended.\n\n【32】### What is the best way to manage emergent hypertension and what dosing would be used?\n\n【33】Recommended management for hypertensive emergency is aimed at reducing further end‐organ damage by decreasing blood pressure by no more than 25% in the first hour, with gradual reduction over the next 24–48 hours. Lowering blood pressure is done gradually as the vascular beds have accommodated to the current high pressure and lowering too quickly will cause hypoperfusion and ischemic injury. This can best be accomplished in the pediatric intensive care unit by a continuous infusion of a calcium channel blocker or beta‐blocker with close observation often requiring intra‐arterial blood pressure monitoring. In addition to the goal of reducing blood pressure, it is also important to plan for supportive care for potential life‐threatening complications such as seizures.\n\n【34】Medications used in a hypertensive crisis include the following.\n\n【35】   Calcium channel blocker: nicardipine 1–3 μg/kg per min.\n   Beta‐blocker: esmolol 125–500 μg/kg per min or labetalol 0.25–3 mg/kg per hour.\n   Direct vasodilator: diazoxide 1–3 mg/kg every 5–15 minutes or hydralazine 0.2–0.6 mg/kg bolus.\n\n【36】Longer‐term initial management of hypertension includes pharmacologic therapy with an angiotensin‐converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, angiotensin receptor blocker, long‐acting calcium channel blocker, or a thiazide diuretic. Beta‐blockers are not recommended as first‐line treatment based on adverse effects and adult data that there is a lack of effect with these agents. There are other recommendations by the AAP for managing children with other associated problems, such as diabetes and proteinuria.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

The most common distributions are localized to either the scalp or the legs. Most individuals are older, although rare cases have been reported in children. Diagnosis may be delayed due to overlap with actinic damage and infection. Diagnosis is generally made through a combination of biopsy, treatment failure, and therapy response. Histopathology may show a neutrophilic pustular inflammatory process, leading many to categorize EPD as a neutrophilic dermatosis. The etiology is still unknown, but trauma of any means tends to be a common preceding factor. Treatment is most commonly with topical steroids. Many other proposed treatments are mentioned in the literature. Prognosis is generally good, and many patients achieve long-term resolution of EPD.\n\n【15】Keywords\n\n【16】Erosive pustular dermatosis EPDS Cicatricial alopecia Corticosteroids Photodynamic therapy Tacrolimus\n\n【17】An 82-year-old female presented with scattered eroded plaques and pustules on the scalp for 2 months.

Other names include erosive pustulosis and erosive pustular dermatosis of the scalp (EPDS), due to it classically involving the scalp 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. EPD is most commonly located on the scalp or the legs of older individuals. There are contradictory reports in the literature regarding the prevalence in men versus women, although the consensus is that elderly women have the highest incidence and prevalence 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 \\]</u>. The overall incidence and prevalence of EPD is hard to estimate because the disease is most likely under/misdiagnosed and under-reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【28】EPDS is classically associated with trauma or pathergy to the afflicted region prior to development of the lesion. The most common trauma is actinic damage on the scalp of older individuals 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. However, there are many reports of other traumatic associations, such as inflammatory or iatrogenic sources. These include surgery, topical therapies, systemic medications, and inflammatory diseases. Interestingly, surgical studies have determined that skin grafting may have the highest association with EPDS compared to other methods of closure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Photodynamic therapy has also been considered a provoking factor, while also being described as a treatment modality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 9 \\]</u>. Thus, the etiology of EPDS is still very unclear.\n\n【29】EPDS generally presents as a large, poorly defined erythematous to eroded plaque on the vertex of the scalp. Pustules throughout the plaque often leave behind crusting 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. The appearance can be similar to diffuse actinic damage on the scalp. Differential diagnosis includes actinic keratoses, squamous cell carcinoma, pemphigus foliaceus, and kerion formation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. While there may or may not be symptoms associated with the plaque, the most common symptoms include itching and burning 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. EPDS is generally a scarring alopecia thought to be caused by regression of the plaque over time, leading to a loss of hair follicles 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. Dermoscopy, or more appropriately trichoscopy, shows loss of the follicular ostia, dilated vessels, and hyperkeratosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. Histopathological evaluation of the plaque can vary. EPDS can present as a neutrophilic, pustular folliculitis with features of spongiosis, but the presence of plasma cells and lymphocytes may be important in making the diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 13 \\]</u>. Histopathology is key in distinguishing EPDS from other scarring alopecias and conditions. Although there may be a background of actinic damage, there will not be evidence of actinic keratoses or squamous cell carcinoma. It is important to diagnose EPDS as early as possible to avoid irreversible damage. An early biopsy is important for many types of scarring alopecias as it provides cues to diagnosis and treatment.\n\n【30】Treatment\n---------\n\n【31】Treatment of EPDS is typically potent topical steroids with or without occlusion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Oftentimes, this treatment helps support the diagnosis when histopathology and clinical features alone are not enough to make the diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>. Regrowth of hair has been reported to occur but is not common 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. Even though steroids are considered very effective for EPDS, there are many other treatment options available. If the patient has a history of herpes zoster on the scalp or head and neck region, topical steroids may not be the best option for treatment. There have been reports of reactivation of herpes zoster involving treatment of EPDS with chronic topical steroid use 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>.\n\n【32】Other treatment modalities, reported in various case reports, have been noted to be effective for EPDS. These include non-steroidal immunosuppressive therapies such as topical tacrolimus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. The use of sulfasalazine in combination with a 308-nanometer excimer laser was successful in one case 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u>. Topical zinc oxide has been reported for treatment of the leg, with a recent report indicating effectiveness for the scalp 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 , 19 \\]</u>. As mentioned earlier, photodynamic therapy (PDT) is reported both as a cause and a treatment of EPDS. Case reports have combined PDT with surgical silicone gel or the fractional 1927 nanometer Thulium laser with effectiveness 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 20 , 21 \\]</u>. Tetracycline antibiotics, oral retinoids, and oral Janus kinase inhibitors are examples of systemic agents that have also been used to treat EPDS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 22 – 24 \\]</u>.\n\n【33】Due to the unclear etiology of EPDS, no treatment modality can be universally recommended for the condition. Currently, first-line therapy for patients without contraindications is potent topical steroids. No randomized controlled trials regarding EDPS have been conducted. Future therapies may involve topical tacrolimus, sulfasalazine, topical zinc oxide, and PDT.

Hydrocortisone only?\n\n【3】Answers\n\n【4】1.  1.\n    Craniopharyngioma , a benign suprasellar tumor, is one of the most common supratentorial tumors in children. Signs and symptoms are due to the location of the tumor. It may be confined to just the sella turcica or it may extend through the sellar diaphragm and compress the optic nerve with resulting visual field cuts as in this case. Pituitary-hypothalamic involvement leads to short stature, and if the tumor extends into the third ventricle, hydrocephalus may result. Most craniopharyngiomas have calcifications, and these are visible on plain films or CT. Adrenal and thyroid dysfunction also are possible in these children. The preoperative assessment of these patients should include an evaluation for the various endocrine abnormalities discussed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Hypothyroidism and/or adrenal insufficiency can cause problems if not managed appropriately. Although DI may be part of the initial presentation, it is more often seen postoperatively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n2.  2.\n    Acromegaly is the result of oversecretion of growth hormone (GH) in a person with closed epiphyses. If excess GH is due to a pituitary adenoma, it is possible that the tumor growth will compromise other anterior pituitary function. Secretion of gonadotropins, thyrotropin, or corticotropin may be impaired. The airway may be involved in this disorder 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 7 \\]</u>. In addition to growth of bone, excessive GH secretion causes enlargement of the tongue and epiglottis. Cases of difficult intubation have been reported, as has laryngeal stenosis. The patient should be questioned about dyspnea and examined for stridor. Peripheral nerves can become trapped by overgrowth of bone and connective tissue leading to various neuropathies.\n3.  3.\n    In SIADH , urine osmolality > serum osmolality, Uosm > Posm with serum Na <135 mEq/l, and urine Na concentration >40 mEq/l. In SIADH, levels of antidiuretic hormone are inappropriately high for the osmolality of the blood and do not decrease with further dilution of the osmolality. There are many causes of SIADH such as CNS disorders, pneumonia, and the use of positive pressure ventilation. SIADH is a known side effect of vincristine administration. The signs and symptoms of SIADH are due to the hyponatremia that results from water intoxication. Common signs and symptoms of hyponatremia include weakness, fatigue, confusion, headache, nausea and vomiting, seizures, and coma. In general, treatment of the underlying disorder will correct the problem. Treatment of the hyponatremia itself with fluid restriction and administration of maintenance sodium often will correct hyponatremia. In severe cases, administration of a diuretic such as furosemide will induce a diuresis and eliminate some of the excess water 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>.\n4.  4.\n    Congenital hypothyroidism can occur sporadically or in a familial pattern. Newborn screening programs are in place throughout the country, and most children with this disorder are detected this way. The overall prevalence is 2.5:10,000 (0.5:10,000 in African-Americans and 5:10,000 in Hispanics), and it is seen twice as often in females compared with males. Although there are many causes, most are due to thyroid dysgenesis, either aplasia or rudimentary ectopic thyroid tissue. In cases where the diagnosis is missed by the neonatal screen, clinical manifestations may not be evident at birth due to the presence of transplacentally acquired maternal thyroxine (T4).\n5.  5.\n    Mediastinal masses can have deleterious cardiovascular effects on affected patients, and these effects are significantly worsened during the induction of anesthesia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. The differential diagnosis of a mediastinal mass depends upon the location in anterior, middle, or posterior division of the mediastinum:\n       Anterior mediastinum: lymphoma, lymphangioma, teratoma, and thymoma\n       Middle mediastinum: bronchogenic cyst, granuloma, lymphoma\n       Posterior mediastinum: enteric cysts, neuroblastoma, ganglioneuroma\n\n【5】    While all locations can cause airway obstruction, anterior mediastinal masses also often decrease cardiac output by impairing filling of the right atrium (RA) and right ventricle (RV). Affected children will present with a superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome in addition to any signs and symptoms of airway compromise 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. History and physical exam can give the anesthesiologist clues to the degree of airway and cardiovascular impairment. The presence of stridor and/or difficulty breathing in various positions should be reviewed and progression of these complaints over recent time evaluated. Dilated veins on the face and upper extremities may be present. The preoperative laboratory evaluation of children with anterior mediastinal masses should include, in addition to as thorough an evaluation of the airway as possible, an echocardiogram 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 , 12 \\]</u>. The mass may not impinge on the trachea but impair RA filling, a very dangerous situation. Older children with mediastinal masses should undergo imaging studies as well as flow-volume loops 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. A CT scan of the chest and airway will give important information about tracheal size and/or deviation caused by the mass. Younger children often do not cooperate with the positioning and immobility needed for a CT scan or the more demanding pulmonary function testing. In these cases, the clinical assessment is even more important. General anesthesia for children with anterior mediastinal masses presents many challenges to the entire OR team, anesthesiologists, surgeons, and OR RNs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. One of the possible diagnoses for a posterior mediastinal mass is neurogenic tumor including pheochromocytoma. The elevation of blood pressure noted during placement of the epidural may be the result of excess catecholamine release by the pheochromocytoma. Anesthetic care of patients with pheochromocytoma requires careful preoperative evaluation and preparation. Once the diagnosis is confirmed with measurement of metanephrine, a metabolite of norepinephrine in the urine and in plasma, a thorough search for the full extent of the tumor is undertaken. In addition, prior to going to the OR, the patient should be treated with alpha-blocking medications until orthostatic blood pressure and heart changes are evident. Only when this is accomplished can beta blockade be administered. Even once satisfactory alpha and beta blockade has been accomplished, the procedure can be safely undertaken provided the anesthesiologist is prepared for significant vital sign swings. Invasive hemodynamic monitoring is indicated. Induction and maintenance should be planned to minimize the response to surgical stress. Epidural analgesia is a useful adjunct for these patients.\n6.  6.\n    Ambiguous genitalia in females are the result of a defect in the enzymes responsible for the synthesis of cortisol. The most common form is due to deficiency of 21-hydroxylase, an enzyme located in the adrenal cortex in the pathway to production of cortisol and aldosterone from cholesterol. The precursor 17-OH- progesterone increases in concentration, leading to excessive production of androgen. This is the cause for the virilization seen clinically. In addition to impaired cortisol production, aldosterone production is also affected. Decreased levels of aldosterone, another result of the 21-hydroxylase deficiency, lead to hyponatremia and hyperkalemia. One of the clinical variants of 21-hydroxylase deficiency, salt wasting, can present as an Addisonian crisis with severe sodium loss. Perioperative treatment of 21-hydroxylase deficiency patients involves the administration of hydrocortisone, 2 mg/kg, every 6 h. If salt wasting is present, IV fluid replenishment with NaCl-containing solutions and administration of an IV mineralocorticoid such as fludrocortisone are indicated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 , 15 \\]</u>.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Once hypogonadism is clinically suspected, hormonal testing should be performed (in males, blood testosterone in two samples taken between 08:00 and 09:00 h on different days, sex hormone-binding globulin and gonadotropins and in females, estradiol and gonadotropins combined with menstrual history); exclusion of other causes of hypogonadism, including hyperprolactinemia, also is required.\n\n【6】Monitoring for clinical manifestations of adrenal insufficiency is recommended in opioid users, and if there is high index of suspicion, measurement of morning blood cortisol should be performed; further dynamic assessment of the HPA axis will depend on the results of the morning cortisol.\n\n【7】Patients on long-term opioid use should be also assessed for clinical features of hyperprolactinemia.

Finally, taking into account that data on the effects of long-term opioid use on GH, ADH, and oxytocin are inconsistent, clinical recommendations cannot be made.\n\n【9】In our patient, pituitary hormone profile revealed low morning testosterone levels on two separate occasions, normal sex hormone-binding globulin and low gonadotropins; prolactin, cortisol reserve, and thyroid function were normal. After exclusion of other causes of hypogonadism, including pathology on pituitary MRI, the diagnosis of opioid-induced hypogonadism was made.\n\n【10】Management\n----------\n\n【11】Discontinuation or reduction of the opioid dose should be the first management step in cases of hypogonadism. Alternatively, switching to buprenorphine, an opioid with milder or no suppressive effect on the HPG axis, is a valid option. Our patient chose this approach which led to successful recovery of his HPG axis. If the above options are not feasible, gonadal hormone replacement is advised. In the six studies assessing the effects of testosterone replacement in men with opioid-induced hypogonadism, improvement in sexual function and desire, as well as in mental quality of life, was reported in those treated with testosterone compared to placebo 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. It should be mentioned that the effects of hormone replacement therapy have not been studied yet in women with gonadal dysfunction due to opioid use.\n\n【12】In cases of confirmed adrenal insufficiency, treatment with glucocorticoids should be initiated followed by cessation or reduction of the opioid dose, if feasible. Subsequently, further reassessment of the HPA axis for potential recovery should be performed including measurement of morning blood cortisol, off glucocorticoid treatment, or dynamic assessment of the axis.\n\n【13】Management of hyperprolactinemia involves discontinuation or reduction of the opioid dose as first options. Nonetheless, this approach should be followed only in the presence of relevant clinical manifestations (impact on gonadal function or galactorrhea).\n\n【14】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【15】Opioids have multiple effects on the hypothalamic-pituitary unit. Although hypogonadism is the most prevalent one, the inhibitory action of opioids on the HPA axis should not be overlooked. Hyperprolactinemia may also be seen. Long-term opioid use has not been associated with thyroid dysfunction, and the effects of opioids on GH, ADH, and oxytocin secretion remain to be clarified. Assessment of gonadal and adrenal function (particularly if high index of clinical suspicion) is recommended in opioid users. In cases of hypogonadism and/or hypoadrenalism, discontinuation or reduction of opioid dose and appropriate hormone replacement are the management approaches that need to be considered.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Adenosine is extremely useful in abolishing atrioventricular (AV) nodal arrhythmias when given in highdose intravenous (IV) boluses. Adenosine works by hyperpolarizing AV node tissue by increasing the conductance of potassium and by reducing calcium current. As a result, the conduction through the AV node is markedly reduced.

Clinically,  删除换行1 this superficial yeast infection is characterized by erythema, maceration and peeling of  删除换行1 the flexural skin between the fingers. So-called ‘satellite lesions’ can often be seen as  删除换行1 small erythematous papules/pustules at the periphery of the area of yeast-infected skin.\nCandida prefers a warm moist environment and hence the most commonly affected skin  删除换行1 sites include the groin, natal cleft, axillae, under the breasts and between the digits.\n\n【17】C. albicans yeast forms part of normal human flora, with reservoirs in the gastrointestinal  删除换行1 tract and vagina.

Table 13.6 gives a sampling of problems for which this hypothesis is relevant.\n\n【2】Table 13.6 Sample Problems for Deficits in Self and Relational Capacities 通用删除11(英):<u>(P3)</u> Hypothesis\n\n| Emotional Symptoms | Depression, often with feelings of emptiness and shame; Poor emotional regulation, including intense rage. |\n| --- | --- |\n| Low self-esteem | Apparent from negative self-description. Inferred from inflexible attitude of superiority. |\n| Relationship dysfunction | Excessive dependence.Difficulty sustaining intimate relationships in the face of conflict.Inability to tolerate aloneness.Inappropriate efforts to control other people.Difficulty coping with independence of children.Lack of empathy and indifference to the needs of others. |\n| Struggles with autonomy | Difficulty separating from family of origin.Lack of awareness of own true feelings and desires.Reliance on external direction. |\n| Problems with work and creativity | Difficulty accessing creativity.Excessive grandiosity in self-appraisal and ambitions.Inability to tolerate frustration in work environment.Repeatedly fired or quits job. |\n| Self-destructive behaviors | Dependence on alcohol or drugs to soothe painful emotions.Cutting.Eating disorders. |\n\n【4】Sometimes in attempting to apply another hypothesis you will realize that the client has deficits. For instance, the Freedom and Responsibility (ES2) hypothesis addresses the process of self-determination: identifying one’s own true desires, setting goals, creating action plans, and persisting toward goals in spite of obstacles. Inability to accomplish any of these tasks can be traced to a lack of certain self capacities.\n\n【5】#### DSM Diagnosis\n\n【6】Personality disorders are characterized by severe impairments in functioning that may be called adaptive failure in the forthcoming DSM-5 , involving “impaired sense of self-identity” or “failure to develop effective interpersonal functioning.” Impairments in functioning of the self will be described in terms of Identity Integration, Integrity of Self-Concept, and Self-Directedness; categories of interpersonal impairments will be Empathy, Intimacy and Cooperativeness, and Complexity and Integration of Representations of Others. In DSM-5 , the new approach will be to describe a specific trait profile for each patient with a personality disorder. 删除10：<u></u>\n\n【7】In DSM-IV , three personality disorders have criteria relevant to the Deficits in Self and Relational Capacities hypothesis:\n\n【8】   Borderline personality disorder: Frantic efforts to avoid real or imagined abandonment; relationships characterized by alternation between idealization and devaluation; unstable sense of self; chronic feelings of emptiness; and inappropriate, intense displays of anger.\n   Narcissistic personality disorder: Pervasive pattern of grandiosity that includes devaluing others; the need for excessive admiration and attention; a sense of entitlement with expectations of favored treatment; and a lack of empathy for others.\n   Dependent personality disorder: Reliance on others to fill functions for the self, such as making small decisions, initiating projects, and taking responsibility.\n\n【9】#### Developmental Diagnosis\n\n【10】A developmental diagnosis involves pinpointing the stage of early childhood development beyond which the person has failed to progress. As you listen to the client’s stories and notice the exact type of transference relationship that the client is creating, you determine the level of development at which the client is functioning. Review the three developmental stages previously presented in Table 13.4 and see if the client is functioning in adulthood at one of the two earliest stages. It is important to distinguish among clients who have never developed beyond the early childhood capacities, those who function at a high level except when in a state of emotional dysregulation, and those who have regressed to an early stage of development because of negative life events. Therefore, you need to ask for stories in the life history that might demonstrate high levels of empathy and altruism—the highest relational capacity that the client is capable of.\n\n【11】#### Trial Interpretation\n\n【12】The client’s response to a gentle interpretation in the early sessions can help the therapist determine whether the client has developed an “observing ego”—a capacity that distinguishes between people at selfobject and real-object levels of functioning. (An interpretation is an idea that comes from the therapist’s perspective, and it represents a break in the empathic connection.) For instance, the therapist might say, Perhaps he thinks you are making unreasonable demands . The mature client, who is not dependent on constant positive connection to a selfobject, may be resentful of this suggestion but has the capacity to ponder the idea; she can indeed shift perspectives and sustain positive feelings about herself and the therapist in the absence of validation. A client whose self-worth depends on the selfobject connection will either ignore the comment or treat it as an insult or an attack.\n\n【13】#### The Point-of-View Exercise\n\n【14】Another method for evaluating the client’s level of relational development is an activity used by Neurolinguistic Programming (NLP) practitioners called “Shifting Perspectives” or, simply, “The POV Exercise” 删除10：<u>(Linden, 1998)</u>. The acronym POV (for point of view) is used in filmmaking for each of three perspectives that the camera can take for any situation. Once you and the client have identified an interpersonal situation that needs to be explored, you guide the client to tell the story from the three POVs, either using three chairs or having the client move a chair to three different places in the room. In essence, you are asking the client to demonstrate her ability to mentalize . Here are examples of how to word the instructions.\n\n【15】### Developmental Diagnosis: At What Stage Does an Adult Client Function?\n\n【16】Most Immature Stage of Development\n\n【17】1.  Type of transference: Merger\n2.  The person, often diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, creates fused relationships, lacks ability to regulate emotions, and has severe impairments in reality testing.\n\n【18】Separation-Individuation Stage\n\n【19】1.  Type of transference: Selfobject\n2.  The person fits Kohut’s description of Narcissistic Disorder of the Self. She uses others as selfobjects to maintain self-esteem and achieve emotional regulation. She cannot meet the selfobject needs of others and lacks the capacity to take their point of view and empathize with them. There are swings between idealization and devaluation of others. Transference represents the activation of early childhood needs, along with extreme sensitivity to misattunement.\n\n【20】More Mature Stages\n\n【21】1.  Type of transference: Neurotic (real object)\n2.  The person has capacities of a cohesive self and views other people as real, separate, and unique. He is capable of empathy. When there is transference, the therapist is experienced as a (real) person from the past. The person shows capacities of an observing ego and can accept feedback and interpretation without feeling attacked or abandoned.\n\n【22】##### First POV: Yourself\n\n【23】This is the way you ordinarily experience the situation. You are inside your own self, seeing, hearing, and feeling your own experiences. When you use the pronoun “I,” you are referring to yourself.\n\n【24】##### Second POV: Observer\n\n【25】Now pretend you are an objective observer, like a person in the audience. You are seeing and hearing the interaction between (client’s name) and (other person’s name) with impartiality and compassion. Refer to the two people in the situation as “he” and “she.” When you use “I,” you are speaking as this observer.\n\n【26】##### Third POV: Other\n\n【27】Now you are (other person’s name). You see through her eyes and try to feel like you are inside her skin. You describe her feelings, thoughts, sensations, memories. In this position, “I” refers to the other person and “you” refers to you.\n\n【28】There are three possible results: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> the client shifts POV easily and shows an empathic understanding of the other (mature relational capacity); 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> the client realizes that she has no idea what the other person would say but that this is important to know (would benefit from further POV practice); 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> and the client is incapable of shifting from her own POV.\n\n【29】### Treatment Planning\n\n【30】In early sessions, the client may seem to function at a high level of maturity, so it is important to hold off on your developmental diagnosis until the client-therapist relationship has had time to develop. Many therapists believe that the type of transference the client develops—merger, selfobject, or real-object transference—is the major key to making the correct developmental diagnosis, which, in turn, is crucial for making decisions about treatment.\n\n【31】#### Psychoanalytic Strategies\n\n【32】One treatment approach for clients who function at immature levels is to use the selfobject transference for the purpose of character change 删除10：<u>(e.g. Basch, 1980; Wolf, 1988)</u>. The therapist needs to be “good enough” in the same way that parents are—provide a good selfobject relationship while helping the client build internal capacities, which lead to more mature styles of relating. A selfobject transference occurs when the client’s archaic (early childhood) needs are activated in therapy. The therapist allows herself to be “used” as a selfobject—as a parent does with a child—and needs to cope with countertransference reactions from the client’s lack of appreciation of her as a separate person. The key tool in the therapist’s repertoire is remaining empathically attuned to the client and attempting, through “vicarious introspection,” to enter the client’s subjective world. Because no one can be perfectly attuned to another human being and because the narcissistically wounded client is exquisitely sensitive to small lapses in empathy, there will be occasions when there are ruptures in the therapeutic alliance and the client overreacts to “empathic failures” on the therapist’s part. When properly handled, these incidents provide the optimum frustration that helps the client internalize the selfobject functions and build new capacities of the self.\n\n【33】#### Providing a Healthy Relationship\n\n【34】The humanistic therapies 删除10：<u>(Cain & Seeman, 2001)</u> make an important contribution to treatment of people who have failed to develop a healthy self. They provide experiences that enable the client to access feelings, strengthen reliance on inner resources, develop self-esteem, and become less dependent on the approval of others. Bohart and Greenberg 通用删除7(英):<u>(1997)</u> edited a volume with multiple perspectives on the importance of empathy, and S. M. Johnson 通用删除7(英):<u>(2004)</u> describes an approach to couples therapy that relies heavily on empathic attunement. Kahn 通用删除7(英):<u>(1997)</u> compares the contributions of Carl Rogers and Heinz Kohut—both of whom put primary emphasis on empathy—and finds many similarities in the desired behavior of the therapist, despite different theoretical underpinnings.\n\n【35】Relational-cultural therapy 删除10：<u>(RCT; Banks, 2006; Comstock et al. 2008; Jordan, 2010; Miller & Stiver, 1997)</u> provides a model for therapy based on mutual empathy and the creation of a growth fostering relationship . Mutual empathy and mutual empowerment are at the core of growth-fostering relationships. The counselor not only conveys connection with the client’s thoughts and feelings but also expresses how she is impacted by the client—“The client can see the therapist moved by her subjective experience” 删除10：<u>(Banks, 2006, p. 28)</u>. The therapist also ensures that the client has opportunities to initiate empathic connection with the therapist by revealing herself as a “fully dimensional human being” 删除10：<u>(Freedberg, 2007, p. 254)</u>. Similar to Kohut’s emphasis on the importance of repairing empathic failures, RCT therapists describe the process of moving through disconnections to developing “more sophisticated relational capacities that enable one to identify, deconstruct, and resist disconnections and obstacles to mutual empathy in counseling relationships and the broader culture 删除10：<u>(Comstock et al. 2008, p. 282)</u>. Therapists must have the awareness and maturity to resist their own disconnecting strategies, especially when working with trauma victims and clients from other cultures.\n\n【36】#### Cognitive-Behavioral Approaches\n\n【37】Hypotheses from the Cognitive Models and Behavior and Learning categories can be integrated. Therapists can focus on: (a) poor empathy skills, and (b) poor emotional regulation skills. Marsha Linehan (1993a, 1993b) provides treatment plans for working with these deficits in individuals with borderline personality disorder. Schemas that support immature relationships can be challenged; with a modified, more adaptive model of the world, the client will realize that other people do not exist just to serve his needs but instead are separate individuals with their own needs, feelings, and points of view. When psychoanalytic therapists talk about the “internalization of a soothing selfobject,” this goal can be redefined as the development of soothing self-talk.\n\n【38】#### Assignment to Interact With Family of Origin\n\n【39】Murray Bowen 通用删除7(英):<u>(1994)</u> would help individual clients differentiate from their family by giving them assignments to visit their family of origin and achieve two goals: control their usual emotional reactivity and get to know their family members as separate individuals. When adults return home to their parents, the pull to return to childhood behavior is so strong that success is sometimes measured as being able to tolerate a few hours. Therefore, the assignments can initially be for very small amounts of time and then gradually increase. Therapists can also give specific assignments to change the communication patterns, roles, and rules.\n\n【40】#### Parenting Programs\n\n【41】Teaching parents how to provide “good-enough parenting” is a valuable approach for primary and secondary intervention. An approach based on attachment theory as well as on the importance of mentalization focuses on parental reflective functioning 删除10：<u>(Slade, 2006)</u>. Söderström, and Skårderud 通用删除7(英):<u>(2009)</u> used a program called “Minding the Baby” to teach mothers with substance abuse histories to help their infant understand his own inner life. “Marked mirroring” is a skill of using nonverbal behavior (facial expression, voice, or movement) to represent the child’s inner states while helping to regulate his emotions. Training in reflective functioning includes asking questions like, How do you think your child experienced that incident? How did your child tell you that she felt afraid? If your child could speak, what would she say about that? A powerful technique is to videotape a parent-child interaction and then ask the parent to speculate about the child’s feelings. This gives the parent a chance to observe the child’s facial expression and behavior, and begin to mentalize the child’s experience.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Circulation 135通用删除7(英):<u>(17)</u>:e927–99, 2017\\]. Although IVIG was administered as soon as KD was established within 10 days of illness, approximately 10–20% patients developed IVIG resistance. These patients have an increased risk of CAA compared to those IVIG responders (15% vs. 5%) \\[Tremoulet et al. J Pediatr. 153通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u>:117–21, 2008\\]. Thus, identification of children who are likely to be IVIG resistant would allow utilizing additional therapies early in the course of their illness, and thus it would be possible to prevent coronary artery lesions. In 2006, Kobayashi et al designed scoring systems to predict IVIG resistance, risk factors include sodium≤133 mmol/L; days of illness at initial treatment≤4; ALT≥100 IU/L; neutrophils≥80%; CRP≥100 mg/L; age ≤12 months; platelet count ≤300 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L\\[Kobayashi et al. Circulation 113:2606–12, 2006\\]. In 2007, Kuo et al reported that post-IVIG eosinophilia (peripheral blood eosinophils ≥4%) had an inverse correlation to IVIG resistance and pre-IVIG hypoalbuminemia (albumin≤3.0 g/dL) was positively correlated with IVIG resistance\\[ Kuo et al. Pediatr Allergy Immunol. 18:354–9, 2007\\]. In 2013, Fu PP et al established scoring systems especially to predict IVIG resistance in Chinese Children with KD, plus clinical characteristics (polymorphous exanthema, changes around the anus) compared with the previous system \\[Fu et al. Pediatr Infect Dis J. 32:e319–23, 2013\\].\n\n【9】It is reasonable to administer a second dose of IVIG (2 g/kg) to IVIG-resistant patients \\[Sundel et al. J Pediatr. 123通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u>:657–9, 1993\\], high-dose pulse steroids (usually methylprednisolone 20–30 mg/kg intravenously for 3 days, with or without a subsequent course and taper of oral prednisone) may be considered as an alternative to a second infusion of IVIG or for retreatment of patients with KD who have had recurrent or recrudescent fever after additional IVIG \\[Kobayashi et al. J Pediatr. 163通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u>:521–6, 2013\\]. Administration of infliximab (5 mg/kg) may be considered as an alternative to a second infusion of IVIG or corticosteroids for IVIG-resistant patients, cyclosporine may be considered in patients with refractory KD in whom a second IVIG infusion, infliximab, or a course of steroids has failed, immunomodulatory monoclonal antibody therapy (except TNF-α blockers), cytotoxic agents, or (rarely) plasma exchange may be considered in highly refractory patients who have failed to respond to a second infusion of IVIG, an extended course of steroids, or infliximab \\[McCrindle et al. Circulation 135通用删除7(英):<u>(17)</u>:e927–99, 2017\\].\n\n【10】10.1 Case 35: KD with IVIG Resistance-IVIG too Early\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【11】A previously healthy 2-year-old male presented with unremarkable past medical history and family history.\n\n【12】He presented on Day 5 of illness with a 5-day history of persistent high fever along with rashes and 4-day history of bilateral conjunctivitis. Edema showed on hands and feet after cephalosporin infusion once. On Day 3 of illness he was admitted to local hospital as KD where he received IVIG (1 g/kg/day), furosemide, and methylprednisolone. Rashes were settled down but not fever. On the Day 5, he was transferred to our pediatric cardiology ward. Examination revealed fever (39.9 °C), poor mental state, and delayed response to surroundings. Cervical lymphadenectasis (1.5 cm), bilateral conjunctivitis, red cracked lips with strawberry tongue, and red and edematous palms and soles were present. There were rashes on his face, skin around BCG site, and crissum was red without desquamation. Others were normal. Admission blood test results were listed in Table 10.1 . Echo in local hospital showed bilateral dilation at initial part of coronary artery (LCA 4.1 mm, RCA 4.6 mm). For the boy met all the criteria of KD, he was given oral aspirin (30–50 mg/kg/day), dipyridamole (3–5 mg/kg/day), erythromycin, and third-generation cephalosporin, also polyene phosphorus ester acid radical choline (0.5 g/day) and compound glycyrrhizin (20 mL/day, to protect liver).\nTable 10.1 删除换行 The dynamic changes of Laboratory parameters\n\n| Time  | 3 days  | 5 days  | 6 days  | 9 days  | 13 days  | 16 days  | 19 days  | 22 days  | 6 months  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| WBC (×10 9 )  |  | 9.6  |  | 21.67  | 22.1  | 14.94  | 7.11  |  | 7.4  |\n| NE (%)  |  | 79.5  |  | 75.7  | 77.2  | 55.1  | 36.5  |  | 38.1  |\n| HGB (mg/L)  |  | 100  |  | 99  | 90  | 104  | 108  |  | 127  |\n| PLT (×10 9 )  |  | 252  |  | 799  | 799  | 600  | 363  |  | 305  |\n| CRP (mg/L)  | 74  | 35.6  |  | 91  | 18.8  | 11.4  | 13.3  | 6.58  | 3.76  |\n| NT pro- BNP (pg/mL)  | 2580  | 962.9  |  | 846.9  |  | 80.42  |  |  | 305  |\n| ALT (U/L)  | 103  |  | 75  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| ALB (U/L)  |  |  | 30.2  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n\n【14】On the Day 6, he was still febrile (>38.5 °C) and dispirited. The neck stiffness was positive. Liver function showed Alb 30.2 g/L, ALT 75 U/L, AST 63 U/L. MP-IgG (+), CP-IgG (+). ESR 60 mm/h. Neck ultrasound revealed bilateral cervical lymphadenectasis, with the biggest one about 2.3 cm × 1.0 cm. IVIG (2 g/kg) infusion was given within 24 h/over 12 h. Mannitol and furosemide were administrated after half of IVIG infusion. On Day 7, the high fever was persistent (39.5 °C) and he was in significant malaise. The lumbar puncture showed CSF pressure was 72 drops/min and CSF was lightly yellow and transparent, Pandy test(+), total cell 238 × 10 <sup>6 </sup> /L, WBC 238 × 10 <sup>6 </sup> /L, NE 17.6%.

On Day 11, for the persistent dispirited state, lumbar puncture was repeated and results were shown as followings: the CSF pressure 40–50 drops/min, light yellow transparent CSF, Pandy’s test (+), total cells 24 × 10 <sup>6 </sup> /L, WBC 24 × 10 <sup>6 </sup> /L, NE 8.3%, glucose 2.86 mmol/L, Cl <sup>− </sup> 114.3 mmol/L, protein 0.62 g/L. On Day 13, his body temperature was 37.7 °C, then regressed voluntarily. There were condensed red rashes in variable sizes showing on his trunk and hip skins, neck stiffness (+), bilateral Babinski sign (+). CSF culture test revealed negative bacterial colony after 48 h. Blood routine test revealed WBC 22.10 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L, NE 77.2%, HGB 90 g/L, PLT 799 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L. CRP 18.80 mg/L. Consultation with dermatologist concluded that the symptoms were drug eruption related. All the antibiotics were stopped, compound glycyrrhizin and Claritin plus hydrocortisone emulsifiable paste were used to relieve rashes.\n\n【22】On Day 14, he had cracked lips, and he coughed only once a while but with thick sputum, accompanied with the wheezy phlegm auscultated. He had watery stools twice, rotavirus was tested positive in stool. Oral aspirin and infusion of zithromax were prescribed. Probiotics and bismuth subsalicylate were administrated orally as anti-diarrhea measures.\n\n【23】On Day 15, he excreted yellow thin stools (three times a day), while the appetite loss trivially, urine volume remained adequate. The skin on knees was scratched broken from itching. 1:1 (Glucose: NS) solution was infused to replenish body fluid. On Day 17, his cough subsided but sputum increased with normal body temperature. His stool texture was almost normal. Lumbar puncture was performed again, the CSF pressure turned out to be 60 drops/min, CSF routine revealed total cell 11.00 × 10 <sup>6 </sup> /L, WBC 11 × 10 <sup>6 </sup> /L, NE 9.1%.\n\n【24】On Day 18, he got fever again (38.5 °C), with running nose. Sporadic red rashes appeared on bilateral opisthenar, with pruritus. Membranoid peeling skin appeared around nails. There was white yogurt-like substance in his mouth. He was given interferon inhaled. On Day 19, rechecked brain MRI revealed slight dilation of bilateral paraceles, which make us suspecting he had bilateral mastoiditis. Echo showed normal coronary arteries. On Day 21, his diarrhea was settled down, while the rashes stay unchanged. We reduced methylprednisone to 2 mg/kg/day.

This is an acute  删除换行1 respiratory condition, often caused by a viral infection, resulting in inflammation of the  删除换行1 bronchioles. The effects of this include increased mucus secretion, bronchial narrowing and  删除换行1 obstruction. This may lead to air trapping, atelectasis, alveolar injury and reduced ventilation  删除换行1 leading to a ventilation–perfusion mismatch.\n\n【13】Bronchiolitis occurs in children under 2 years of age and most commonly presents in infants  删除换行1 aged 3 to 6 months. It most frequently occurs in association with viral infections such as  删除换行1 respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in around 75% of cases and is most prevalent in the winter  删除换行1 and spring months.\n\n【14】Children most at risk of severe bronchiolitis include those with chronic lung disease, congenital heart disease, premature birth (particularly under 32 weeks), neuromuscular disorders,  删除换行1 immunodeficiency and those aged less than 3 months at presentation.\n\n【15】Symptoms of bronchiolitis in children include breathing difficulties, cough, poor feeding,  删除换行1 irritability and, in the very young, apnoea. Signs may include wheezing and/or crepitations  删除换行1 on auscultation and mild pyrexia. Symptoms usually peak between days 3 and 5 of the illness.\nDo not routinely perform blood tests/gases or chest radiographs in children with bronchiolitis unless you suspect another diagnosis or the patient is deteriorating. Rapid virological  删除换行5 PCR testing is recommended if admitting the patient. This helps with cohorting patients with  删除换行1 the same virus strains into the same bay on the ward.\n\n【16】The mainstay of treatment is supportive care. Consider upper airway suctioning in patients  删除换行1 with secretions and associated respiratory distress or feeding difficulties. Oxygen supplementation is required if saturations persistently fall below 92% in air.\n\n【17】The child may need high flow oxygen therapy (e.g. Optiflow) or continuous positive airway  删除换行1 pressure (CPAP) if there are signs of worsening respiratory failure. Commence fluids by  删除换行1 nasogastric or orogastric tube if the child cannot take sufficient amounts orally, and consider  删除换行1 intravenous fluids if they cannot tolerate this or if they have impending respiratory failure.\n\n【18】Signs of impending respiratory failure include exhaustion (laboured breathing), recurrent  删除换行1 apnoea or failure to maintain adequate oxygen saturations despite oxygen supplementation.\n\n【19】Around 3% of all infants under 1 year old are admitted to hospital with bronchiolitis.\nIndications for admission include observed or reported apnoea, oxygen saturation less than  删除换行1 92% in air, insufficient fluid intake (less than 50%–75% of normal intake in past 24 hours) or  删除换行1 persisting severe respiratory distress.\n\n【20】Key Points\n\n【21】• Bronchiolitis is predominantly caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).\n\n【22】• Although bronchiolitis is a clinical diagnosis, rapid virological PCR testing is helpful for cohorting patients on the ward.\n\n【23】• Not all patients require hospital admission. Hospital admission is required for supportive therapy when patients require supplementary oxygen or fluid therapy, and  删除换行1 those with signs of pending respiratory failure.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

This patient has developed a lupus anticoagulant, which is another name for acquired antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. Platelet phospholipids are required for both the intrinsic and extrinsic clotting pathways. Antiphospholipid antibodies bind to platelet phospholipids, thereby making them accessible to clotting factors and leading to recurrent venous and arterial thrombosis. Because both the PT and PTT assays use exogenous phospholipids, the antibodies inhibit their function and paradoxically show an increase in coagulation time.  \nAnswer A is incorrect . Factor VIII antibodies are a rare cause of acquired hemophilia in the elderly. Their presence would cause bleeding rather than thrombus formation. They would also elevate the PTT but not the PT.  \nAnswer B is incorrect . Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia is a hypercoagulable state caused by an immune reaction to exogenous heparin. This patient has no history of heparin exposure.  \nAnswer C is incorrect . Antibodies directed against platelet glycoproteins, especially IIb/IIIa, lead to idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura.

It occurs most commonly between2 and 5 years of age， although it can appear at any age. Impetigo is caused by a superficial bacterial invasion of the epidermis via breaks in the normal skin barrier. Although Streptococcus pyogenes was once the leading cause of impetigo， the incidence of Staphylococcus aureus has risen steadily since the1980s， and the majority of cases of childhood impetigo are now caused by Staphylococcus aureus. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) accounts for up to 80% of all cases of impetigo in some areas of the country. Most of these strains are community acquired and often affect healthy children with normal immune function， whereas historically MRSA is typically seen in hospitalized patients. Children are most often infected by direct contact with infected individuals， but fomites also pose a risk of infection spread.\n\n【49】Classic impetigo begins as erythematous macules or papules that quickly evolve to become vesicles with fragile roofs. The vesicles easily rupture， and the fluid inside dries to form honey-colored crusts on the eroded skin. Impetigo most often occurs on exposed areas of skin more susceptible to trauma， such as the face and extremities. The incidence is greatest in the summer months. Superficial breaks in the epidermis predispose an individual to develop impetigo. For that reason， impetigo frequently occurs overlying insect bites， atopic dermatitis， and other conditions that lead to skin abrasions. The differential diagnosis includes atopic or other forms of dermatitis， herpes simplex infections， a kerion caused by dermatophyte infection， varicella， Sweet's syndrome， scabies， pemphigus foliaceus， insect bites， ecthyma， discoid lupus erythematosus， and candidiasis.\n\n【50】Another form， bullous impetigo， accounts for approximately 30% of all cases of impetigo. Superficial vesicles also occur in bullous impetigo， but they rapidly enlarge to create bullae with sharp margins and no surrounding erythema. The bullae also rupture and develop honey-colored crusts as in classic impetigo. It is more common in neonates and represents a localized variation of staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome caused by a toxin-producing form of Staphylococcus aureus. Bullous impetigo typically occurs in areas prone to friction and moisture such as the diaper area， axillae， and neck folds. The differential diagnosis includes second-degree burns， fixed drug eruptions， immunobullous diseases such as immunoglobulin A dermatosis， bullous pemphigoid， epidermolysis bullosa， and erythema multiforme. Bullous impetigo can be mistaken for cigarette burns， so child abuse is some-times included in the differential diagnosis.\n\n【51】Although a bacterial culture and Gram stain are useful tools in diagnosing impetigo， the diagnosis can often be made clinically. Bacterial cultures will typically show Staphylococcus aureus with or without Streptococcus pyogenes. In rare instances， Streptococcus pyogenes impetigo can lead to poststrep-tococcal glomerulonephritis. Bacterial cultures are more useful when nephritogenic strains of Streptococcus pyogenes or drug resistance are suspected in a patient. In one study， carriage of Staphylococcus aureus was reported in the nasal passage of up to 42% of children between 7 and 19years of age. A higher incidence has been reported in patients who actually have impetigo. Decisions to treat an individual should not be made based on presence or absence of Staphylococcus aureus in CUS the nasal passage， because a large percentage of unaffected individuals will test positive； and， con-versely， an individual with impetigo may not be a nasal carrier. Other sites of the body may less commonly be colonized with Staphylococcus aureus.\n\n【52】Rare complications of impetigo include sepsis， osteomyelitis， arthritis， endocarditis， pneumonia， cellulitis， lymphadenitis， toxic shock syndrome， poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis， and general ized staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome. If an individual has recurrent MRSA infections， it may be useful to treat the patient and household members with intranasal mupirocin twice daily for 5days a few times per year in an attempt to reduce the risk of nasal carriage.\n\n【53】What is the appropriate treatment plan for this diagnosis?\n\n【54】Impetigo is usually self-limiting， localized， and heals without scarring， even without treatment. Small patches of impetigo will typically respond to topical antibiotics such as mupirocin applied twice daily for 5-7 days or retapamulin applied twice daily for 5 days. There is now documentation of mupirocin-resistant strains of staphylococci. Although most topical antibiotics cause at least partial clinical improvement， they may prolong the carriage state of the bacteria on the skin surface. Healthy children with impetigo that is widespread or recalcitrant to topical therapy may require oral antibiotics. Preferred oral antibiotics include antistaphylococcal penicillins， amoxicillin-clavulanate， cephalospo-rins， and macrolides. Erythromycin is not typically recommended due to widespread resistance in North America. If MRSA is recovered from a culture， bacterial sensitivities should guide drug selec-tion. If Streptococcus pyogenes is cultured， penicillins are preferred.\n\n【55】What would the appropriate treatment plan for this diagnosis be if the patient were febrile and/or showing other signs of systemic illness?\n\n【56】Infants and children with extensive disease， signs of progressive cellulitis， and systemic symptoms may need hospitalization for parenteral antibiotic therapy and close observation.\n\n【57】What is the appropriate plan for follow-up care?\n\n【58】A follow-up appointment in 7-10 days to assess response to treatment may be helpful. However， the high rate of cure and low rate of complications related to impetigo may render follow-up unnecessary except in recalcitrant cases.\n\n【59】Are any referrals needed?\n\n【60】Not typically， but some serious or special cases (as mentioned above) may need hospitalization.\n\n【61】Should the patient stay out of school and/or day care during treatment? If so， for how long? Children should be treated for a minimum of 24 hours before returning to school or other group set-tings such as day care in order to avoid spread.\n\n【62】What， if anything， should be recommended to unaffected household members?\n\n【63】It is important to emphasize good hygiene to the patient and family members in order to prevent further autoinoculation and spread to previously unaffected contacts. Good hand washing with antibacterial soap and disinfection of fomites is useful.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

The referral letter describes him as being ‘a happy, friendly child most of the time but who can have  删除换行1 periods of agitation in some situations. He has a few close friends at school but struggles with  删除换行1 larger group activities. He also likes to know the times of breaks and lunch and struggles if  删除换行1 these are delayed. He is progressing well in most areas of learning but we have noticed that he  删除换行1 does not engage in conversation with others and rarely initiates questions. He has a special  删除换行1 interest in sports cars and can talk about this happily for long periods of time.’ 删除换行5 Toby has been brought to the clinic by his parents. They too have noticed that Toby’s behaviour is different from his peers. They say that they first noticed this around 2 years of age as he  删除换行1 would prefer to play alone than with others at nursery and would also have repetitive speech  删除换行1 and movements. They say that he has mainly grown out of these but that if he faces significant changes to his routine he will get agitated and start flapping his hands. His parents are  删除换行1 not concerned about his behaviour and feel that he is doing well at school. Although they are  删除换行1 aware he is different they do not see how assigning him a ‘label’ will benefit him.\n\n【1】Questions\n\n【2】• When does a spectrum of normality become an illness?\n\n【3】• Who should make decisions about a child’s health if the parents do not have any  删除换行1 concerns?\n\n【4】ANSWER 89\n\n【5】The last half century has seen a marked change in societal perception of illness. The medicalisation of human experience – from childbirth to bereavement and alcoholism to obesity – has  删除换行1 presented anthropologists, physicians and bioethicists with a pandemic of new medical problems with perhaps the only real beneficiaries being pharmaceutical companies. Interestingly,  删除换行1 only two ‘conditions’ – homosexuality and masturbation – have been de-medicalised.\n\n【6】Medicalisation of normal human experiences such as childbirth and bereavement can also  删除换行1 have detrimental effects on individuals who perceive that their ‘experience’ should fit societal  删除换行1 expectations. Feelings of abnormality and failure if a birth does not go according to a birth  删除换行1 plan, or if feelings of grief do not resolve within a pre-existing expectation of when life should  删除换行1 get back to normal, can all have significant psychological consequences. The same thought  删除换行1 process can be applied to simple maladies such as premenstrual tension and menopause.\nAlthough not abnormal experiences, the ability to ‘treat’ the condition with pharmaceutical  删除换行1 or psychological interventions has medicalised unavoidable physiological changes.\n\n【7】There are many examples in clinical medicine where diagnoses are assigned to individuals  删除换行1 who are perceived to lie outside of a normal spectrum of development or behaviour. Autism  删除换行1 spectrum disorder is one of the most common ‘modern’ diagnoses. First identified in the  删除换行1 1970s it now has a prevalence of roughly 5/1000 children 删除10：<u>(Taylor et al. 2013)</u>. There was a  删除换行1 dramatic increase in prevalence in both the UK and the United States in the 1990s, but this  删除换行1 has now plateaued and there has been little annual variation over the past decade. One theory  删除换行1 is that prior to the increase in diagnosis in the 1990s the condition was not medically recognised and individuals with the classic triad of difficulties with social communication, social  删除换行1 interaction and social imagination were merely considered slightly reclusive or socially awkward. Similarities can be drawn with other newer medical disorders such as attention-deficit  删除换行1 hyperactivity disorder and emotionally unstable personality disorder, both of which could be  删除换行1 considered part of the spectrum of human behaviour.\n\n【8】The ethical debate revolves around the benefit of assigning diagnoses and the impact that  删除换行1 medicalisation of human behaviour has on the individual, their family and society as a  删除换行1 whole. The latest research suggests that the earlier autism is diagnosed the better the outcome  删除换行1 for the child, as the brain is more malleable and can be taught how to improve social interaction. But is medicine tampering with something more innate than just trying to prevent  删除换行1 disease? Is there a risk that these changes fundamentally alter personality at a young stage?\nRetrospective analysis of historical figures suggests that many of the most celebrated geniuses  删除换行1 showed typical autistic traits and by ‘curing’ individuals of autism we may be denying society  删除换行1 the very people who have the intense, single-minded focus to produce brilliance.\n\n【9】It is widely accepted among clinicians that the behavioural and developmental features  删除换行1 of autism lie on a spectrum, ranging from people with exceptional skills and flexibility of  删除换行1 thought, to individuals with really marked difficulties. The difficulty in making a diagnosis  删除换行1 thus throws into sharp relief a dilemma which is present across multiple conditions but is  删除换行1 seldom discussed: the difficulty of placing a dichotomy on the continuum of human development. There are individuals who undoubtedly will benefit from the additional educational  删除换行1 and psychological support that a diagnosis brings. It can also bring some comfort to family to  删除换行1 have a reason to explain behaviour or habits that may be perceived as socially unacceptable.\nHowever, there are others who may feel ‘labelled’ with a disease by professionals who feel that  删除换行1 treatment is needed in order for them to conform to social expectations of behaviour.删除个例：<u>Faith, Values and Culture</u>\nIn the case scenario Toby may well be exhibiting autistic traits which could be ticked off on  删除换行1 a medical checklist as meeting arbitrary criteria for a diagnosis of autism. This would no  删除换行1 doubt enable him (and his school) to have access to additional funding for educational support. What may be more important to consider, however, is Toby’s ‘lived experience’. Does he  删除换行1 perceive himself as having problems which need medical and social input? His parents’ views  删除换行1 and beliefs should also be taken into consideration. In a supportive environment differences  删除换行1 may be celebrated and individuals able to flourish without medicalisation of behaviour. This  删除换行1 could be in contrast to a more rigid environment where another child with fewer autistic  删除换行1 traits may actually benefit more from support in order to conform to societal expectations of  删除换行1 behaviour. Given the problems outlined, a flexible and collaborative approach to diagnosis  删除换行1 and prognosis is not only empowering for families, but also intellectually honest.\n\n【10】Key Points\n\n【11】• Careful consideration should be given to whether someone is experiencing normal emotions that can be helped with emotional support rather than medication.\n\n【12】• Diversity in abilities and interests should be encouraged unless there is evidence  删除换行1 that further intervention is needed for the support of that individual.删除个例：<u>Faith, Values and Culture</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

She has not been checking her temperature at home because she reports not being able to find the thermometer, but she states that she feels hot (especially at night) and has been having chills.Past Medical History\n--------------------\n\n【5】The patient was born full term with no known complications. Prior to presentation of her renal disease, her health history consisted of “several ear infections as a child” and extraction of molars 3 years ago. Two years ago, the teen went to the dentist and was found to be hypertensive with blood pressure 180/110 mmHg She was sent to the local emergency department where hypertension was confirmed and laboratory studies obtained. At that time, her creatinine was 7.6 mg/dL, and she had large amounts of protein and blood in her urine. She was sent to a pediatric nephrologist and underwent a percutaneous kidney biopsy and subsequently was diagnosed with FSGS and started on hemodialysis three times a week. After 12 months, she received a deceased donor transplant. At the time of transplant, the patient was EBV (Epstein–Barr virus) and CMV (cytomegalovirus) negative and the donor was both EBV and CMV positive. Creatinine at discharge was 0.6 mg/dL, on intravenous fluids; her creatinine post discharge has been stable at 0.6–0.8 mg/dL depending on oral intake. Her blood pressure on twice daily amlodipine is 118/68 mmHg. Her medication regimen is tacrolimus 2 mg twice daily, mycophenolate mofetil 750 mg twice daily, prednisone 5 mg daily, amolodipine 5 mg twice daily, and vitamin D 1000 mg daily.Past Surgical History\n---------------------\n\n【6】Deceased donor kidney transplant and central dialysis catheter removal after transplant.Family History\n--------------\n\n【7】Family history is negative for kidney disease or kidney stones.Current Status\n--------------\n\n【8】The teen presents to the emergency room with diarrhea and malaise.

What therapies could be offered if the creatinine does not improve with rehydration?Rationale and Evidence‐based Practice Explanation\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【12】### Based on the data given, what are the most likely differential diagnoses for this patient?\n\n【13】For a stable transplant patient who has had an acute increase in a previously stable creatinine, the differential diagnosis should include:\n\n【14】   a pre‐renal state secondary to poor perfusion related to diarrheal dehydration and hypotension; 删除换行1    intrarenal injury related to drug toxicity (tacrolimus), rejection, recurrence of her FSGS in the transplanted kidney, or viral/bacterial‐related infection; 删除换行1    post‐renal obstruction related to a kidney stone or blood clot.\n\n【15】### What therapy would you consider starting to try to improve the patient’s kidney function?\n\n【16】Because of the patient’s diarrhea and dehydration along with weight loss, initial therapy would be administration of an intravenous fluid bolus of normal saline followed by an increased maintenance rate of 1.5 times normal.\n\n【17】### How would you determine if the therapy is effective?\n\n【18】An improvement in the serum creatinine, with return to baseline values, on rehydration would indicate that the elevated serum creatinine was due to something that was either transient or reversible and related to dehydration. The clinician would also be reassured if the patient became normotensive, and had a clean urine (free of protein, blood and/or leukocytes) and near‐normal serum albumin.\n\n【19】### What additional studies should be ordered?\n\n【20】In addition to the laboratory and imaging studies already carried out, it would be important to obtain a tacrolimus level, viral PCR for EBV, CMV and BK polyoma virus, as well as donor‐specific antibodies. A random urine protein/creatinine ratio should be sent as well; this would ideally be a first morning sample.\n\n【21】### What therapies could be offered if the creatinine does not improve with rehydration?\n\n【22】Intravenous fluids should be infused at 1.5 times maintenance if the diarrhea continues. Antidiarrheal agents could be administered in the short term to prevent loss of electrolytes and tacrolimus toxicity. Laboratory work should be repeated 8–12 hours after starting intravenous fluids to determine a trend in the creatinine and to evaluate electrolytes. Because the urine is positive for blood, protein, and leukocytes, and the patient had urinary tract symptoms, antibiotics should be started after the blood and urine cultures are obtained and continued until the 24‐hour culture results are obtained.\n\n【23】Continuation of case : Over the first 12 hours, the serum creatinine improves to 1.0 mg/dL (still above baseline), and her blood pressure and hydration status normalized. Her pre‐renal state is reversed and she has no evidence of obstruction on ultrasound. Her differential diagnoses at this point still include recurrence of disease, resolving dehydration effect, tacrolimus toxicity, acute renal injury, acute rejection, or urinary tract infection.Additional Question and Evidence‐based Rationale\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【24】1.  Based on these supplementary data, what are now the most likely differential diagnoses for this patient?\n\n【25】### Based on these supplementary data, what are now the most likely differential diagnoses for this patient?\n\n【26】FSGS is an illness of the kidney that causes scarring in the glomeruli and can lead to kidney failure. There is about a 30% chance of recurrence in the transplanted kidney. Although this is more common immediately after transplant, it can occur at any point and should remain in the differential, especially if the patient is noted to have proteinuria and a lower serum albumin.\n\n【27】Dehydration secondary to diarrhea and decreased fluids is the most likely cause of the patient’s increased serum creatinine. She has experienced several days of frequent loose stools and a decrease in her urine output from baseline. Tacrolimus toxicity (or an elevated tacrolimus level) can be the result of persistent diarrhea and can also result in an increase in the serum creatinine. Diarrhea and dehydration, especially if the tacrolimus level is increased, can also lead to acute renal injury.\n\n【28】Rejection of the kidney transplant can occur at any time. Although the cause of this in the early months can be purely immunologic, non‐compliance should be considered in the patient who is further out from transplant. Teenagers in particular are at increased risk of losing kidneys because of skipping or not taking their immunosuppressant medications.\n\n【29】Another thing to consider in this patient who has previously had no evidence of CMV or EBV would be a change in viral status.\n\n【30】Finally, the increase in the creatinine could be the result of an infection, and in this case where the urine is positive for protein, blood and leukocytes, there should be higher suspicion of a urinary tract infection until the urine culture results show otherwise. In the presence of a fever and urinary tract symptoms, initiation of antibiotics is warranted while waiting on the urine culture results. Urinary tract infections (especially pyelonephritis) can damage the transplanted kidney causing acute or chronic injury.Case Resolution\n---------------\n\n【31】At 24 hours post admission, the creatinine has returned to baseline (0.8 mg/dL), and blood and urine cultures are negative. The tacrolimus level was elevated to 15 ng/mL on admission and returned to 5 ng/mL with improvement of diarrhea and hydration. The patient’s urine has improved, with only trace blood and protein with negative leukocytes. Blood and urine cultures were negative at 24 hours and antibiotics were discontinued. At this time, with a baseline creatinine, no proteinuria, and negative cultures, recurrence, rejection, infection, and acute kidney injury related to dehydration or tacrolimus toxicity can be excluded. The decision was made to cancel her transplant biopsy and the patient was discharged home on her routine medications.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

This is a pregnancy-specific condition in which there is intrahepatic reduction of bile excretion from the liver, causing a buildup  删除换行1 of serum bile acids. It usually develops in the third trimester. The effect on the mother is of  删除换行1 itching, which may be very distressing. In more severe cases the liver function or coagulation becomes deranged, and if this occurs then other diagnoses such as HELLP syndrome  删除换行1 (haemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and low platelets – a severe form of pre-eclampsia) or  删除换行1 hepatitis should be considered. An ultrasound should be performed to exclude other causes  删除换行1 of obstruction such as gallstones.\n\n【29】There is no long-term harm to the mother.

Surgical therapy is reserved for severe symptoms after exercise and pharmacologic agents are used, and quality of life is impaired. Pain at rest, lack of symptoms for medical therapy, nonhealing ulcers, and gangrene are some of those indications. Duplex ultrasound can help to discern whether the patient is a potential surgical candidate. Arteriography may also be performed. Diffuse atherosclerotic disease is a contraindication for surgery since bypass would not help in the face of significant and widespread disease.\n\n【33】CLINICAL PEARLS\n\n【34】 Smoking cessation is the single most important intervention for atherosclerotic peripheral vascular disease.

What is the appropriate treatment?\n通用删除5(英):<u>DOI: 10.1201/9781003242697-</u>\n\n【13】ANSWERS\n\n【14】The most likely cause of this elderly gentleman’s watery, non-bloody diarrhoea is Clostridium  删除换行1 difficile bacterial gastroenteritis, given the very high peripheral white cell count and raised  删除换行1 inflammatory markers (CRP) associated with the following risk factors: recent hospital  删除换行1 admission, living in a care home, antibiotic therapy, bowel surgery and being on proton  删除换行1 pump inhibitors. Important negative features of the history include no travel, not eating out  删除换行1 and no illness in other care home residents.\nC. difficile is an anaerobic, spore-forming bacterium that is carried in the gut of some people.\nIt causes disease (pseudomembranous colitis) through production of toxins that damage the  删除换行1 colonic mucosa. In severe disease it can lead to toxic megacolon, bowel perforation and death.\nThe differential diagnosis of watery diarrhoea includes: \n\n【15】•\t Viral—Enterovirus, rotavirus (usually in children), and norovirus (in which vomiting is almost always present)\n•\t Bacterial—Campylobacter spp. C. difficile, Yersinia enterocolitica, Salmonella sp. Shigella sp.\n(usually bloody diarrhoea), Vibrio cholera (associated with contact or travel to endemic  删除换行1 areas)\n•\t Parasitic—Giardia lamblia (appropriate travel history required) or cryptosporidium in  删除换行1 the immunocompromised or young children \n\n【16】•\t Toxins (which have the shortest incubation period after exposure)—Staphylococcal  删除换行1 food poisoning, Bacillus cereus toxin or enterotoxogenic Escherichia coli \n\n【17】•\t Non-infectious causes—Alcohol excess, lactose intolerance or inflammatory bowel  删除换行1 disease \n\n【18】Investigations of watery diarrhoea must include a stool sample sent for: \n\n【19】•\t Microscopy and culture and sensitivity (MC&S) for bacterial causes \n\n【20】•\t Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing looking for viral causes \n\n【21】•\t Ova, cysts and parasites \n\n【22】•\t C. difficile toxin testing, as only toxin-producing strains cause disease. Culture methods for C. difficile are slow and no longer used for diagnosis \n\n【23】Blood cultures are taken to exclude urinary sepsis and Gram-negative sepsis. The latter could  删除换行1 indicate a perforation of the gut or leakage of bowel contents that would indicate severe  删除换行1 colonic disease.\nTreatment is centred on removing risk factors as possible and treating with antibiotics (metronidazole or vancyomycin). Choice of antibiotics depends on the severity of the disease and  删除换行1 local hospital policy. In severe or life-threatening cases, surgical management may also be  删除换行1 required (colectomy). In chronic or recurrent cases, alternative therapy includes probiotics,  删除换行1 faecal enemas and fidaxomicin.\nPrevention is by eliminating risk factors, thereby reducing the likelihood of developing disease. Reduced transmission from person to person requires hand washing with soap and  删除换行1 water after every contact with a patient having diarrhoea. Alcohol hand rub does not destroy  删除换行1 the spores and is therefore not sufficient to prevent spread.

TType I familial hyperlipidemia is caused by lipoprotein lipase deficiency and results in abdominal pain，xanthomas， and hepatosplenomegaly. ●TType III is caused by a defect in apolipoprotein E2 synthesis and results in palmar xanthomas and tubo-eruptive xanthomas. Type lV is caused by increased very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) production and decreased elimination.  |\n| What is the genetic pattern of this condition? FH is inherited in an autosomal manner. Heterozygotes typically have high cholesterol， approximatelyOZ370 mg/dL， and are at increased risk of myocardial infarctions. Homozygotes frequently have extremelyhigh cholesterol levels， up to 1000 mg/dL， and frequently die before 30 years of age from cardiovasculardisease. Normal total cholesterol is < 200 mg/dL， and levels >240 mg/dL are considered elevated.  |\n| What is the molecular basis of this condition? In FH there is a mutation in the LDL receptor gene. This results in a smaller number of functional LDLreceptors. Normally， LDL circulates in the blood and binds to its receptor on hepatocyte membranes andis then taken up into the liver and metabolized. In FH patients， LDL is taken up by the hepatocytes lessefficiently， leading to elevated LDL levels in the blood.  |\n| What would the microscopic examination of the lesions on this patient's arms show?Cholesterol deposits in the skin， called xanthomas， form when there is a persistently elevated LDL level.They are composed largely of lipid-laden macrophages.  |\n\n【3】Statins inhibit 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl Acetyl-CoA 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA\n\n【4】coenzyme A reductase， a hepatic enzyme 删除换行1 that catalyzes the rate-determining step\n\n【5】Thiolase HMG-CoAreductase 删除换行1 in cholesterol synthesis.

Marfan syndrome is linked to a mutation in the fibrillin-1 gene. Ehlers-Danlossyndrome results from various defects in collagen synthesis or structure. Both syndromes are associatedwith an increased incidence of AAA.  |\n| Once the aortic wall is disrupted， how does coagulation proceed?Exposure of tissue factor in the vessel wall initiates the extrinsic pathway of coagulation. Circulating factorVII comes into contact with tissue factor， activating factor X. Activated factor X helps convert prothrombinto thrombin. Thrombin then cleaves fibrinogen to fibrin， allowing fibrin deposition and cross-linking to forma clot. The functionality of the extrinsic pathway is measured by the prothrombin time and InternationalNormalized Ratio.  |\n| What are the risk factors for this condition? AAA occurs most frequently in males. Advanced age and smoking are the most common risk factors.Atherosclerotic lesions in the abdominal aorta are thought to increase the risk of AAA； by contrast，hypertension is thought to increase the risk of aortic dissection.

Tobacco cessation is the most important intervention to improve cardio-vascular morbidity and mortality in high-risk patients， such as those with PAD， and to improve claudication symptoms. Cilostazol (answer C) may help with claudication symptoms but will not affect cardiovascular mortal-ity. Aspirin (answer A)， angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors， and beta-hydroxy-beta-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors are important adjuncts for risk factor modification and for relief of symp-toms， but their benefits pale in comparison to smoking cessation.\n\n【28】13.2 C. Thromboangiitis obliterans， or Buerger disease， is a disease of young male smokers and may cause symptoms of chronic arterial insufficiency in either legs or arms. Cholesterol embolisms (answer A) are most likely to occur after a vascular procedure， including cardiac catheterization. Location of arterial insufficiency is also important for differentiation of the cause. For example， fibromuscular dysplasia (answer B) is more likely to involve the renal arter-ies and extracranial cerebrovascular arteries rather than peripheral arteries of the extremities. Takayasu arteritis (answer D) is a large-vessel vasculitis that primarily affects the aorta and the primary branches.\n\n【29】13.3 D. Takayasu arteritis is associated with symptoms of inflammation such as fever， and it most often affects the subclavian arteries， producing stenotic lesions that may cause unequal blood pressures， diminished pulses， and isch-emic pain in the affected limbs. The other answer choices typically do not cause fever.\n\n【30】13.4 A. Embolism of cholesterol and other atherosclerotic debris from the aorta or other large vessels to small vessels of skin or digits may complicate any intra-arterial procedure. Signs may include livedo reticularis， ulcers， gangrene， renal involvement， and ocular involvement. Eosinophilia may be found on labora-tory work. The other answer choices may be associated with pain， but not sudden onset of ischemia.\n\n【31】13.5 A. Surgical therapy is reserved for those with severe symptoms after exercise despite pharmacologic agents or in cases where quality of life is impaired. Pain at rest (answer B)， refractoriness to medical therapy (answer C)， and the presence of nonhealing ulcers and/or gangrene (answer D) are some indica-tions for surgical intervention. Duplex ultrasound can help discern whether the patient is a potential surgical candidate. Arteriography may also be per-formed. Diffuse atherosclerotic disease is a contraindication for surgery since bypass would not help in the face of significant and widespread disease.\n\n【32】CLINICAL PEARLS\n\n【33】Smoking cessation is the single most important intervention for athero-sclerotic peripheral vascular disease.

He had been vomiting intermittently for the preceding 24 h and was unable  删除换行1 to tolerate oral fluids. He also reported several episodes of diarrhoea, passing watery greenbrown stools on each occasion.\n\n【3】The patient had been feeling well until the onset of the vomiting and had experienced no  删除换行1 recent illnesses. Of note, he had not received any courses of antibiotics recently. His granddaughter had experienced similar symptoms of diarrhoea and vomiting 3–4 days earlier.\n\n【4】Examination\n\n【5】The  patient appeared generally well although his mucus membranes were dry.

His abdomen was soft  删除换行1 and non-tender throughout with normal bowel sounds.\n\n【6】Results\n\n【7】Bloods: WCC 14.2 (neutrophils 11.3, lymphocytes 2.5), Hb 123, MCV 85, Plt 350, Na 134, \n\n【8】K 3.6, Creat 120 (baseline 80), CRP 46, Blood glucose 5.4\n\n【9】Questions\n\n【10】1. What is the most probable diagnosis?\n\n【11】2. Which medications should be prescribed to treat the patient’s nausea and vomiting?\n\n【12】ANSWERS\n\n【13】1. The differential diagnosis for nausea and vomiting is broad. There is no history of  删除换行1 progressive swallowing difficulties, odynophagia or regurgitation, thus making a  删除换行1 structural lesion within the oesophagus unlikely. There is additionally no abdominal pain on examination and the bowel sounds are normal and thus bowel obstruction is also unlikely. Neurological causes of vomiting, such as a space-occupying  删除换行1 lesion should be considered, although such cases typically present with worsening  删除换行1 symptoms after sleeping and may have associated changes in mental status.\n\n【14】 The patient’s blood results show elevated inflammatory markers (raised white cell  删除换行1 count and CRP) and an acute kidney injury (creatinine level greater than 150% of  删除换行1 baseline) and this is suggestive of a diagnosis of infection and pre-renal failure secondary to vomiting and diarrhoea. Gastroenteritis is the most probable diagnosis,  删除换行1 particularly in view of the patient’s granddaughter experiencing similar symptoms  删除换行1 recently. The patient has not received antibiotics recently and Clostridium difficile 删除换行1 infection is therefore unlikely. Other infections, such as lower respiratory tract or  删除换行1 urinary tract infections should also be considered, although these are less likely.\n\n【15】2. The patient should be prescribed an anti-emetic, either orally (if tolerated), or intravenously. The  intramuscular or subcutaneous routes are also an option for some  删除换行1 anti-emetics. The most commonly prescribed agents include:\n\n【16】a. Ondansetron, a serotonin 5-HT3 antagonist, which acts on the chemoreceptor  删除换行1 trigger zone in the medulla oblungata. This drug is particularly efficacious in  删除换行1 chemotherapy-induced vomiting.\n\n【17】b. Cyclizine and cinnarizine, histamine H1  receptor antagonists, which are  删除换行1 thought to also act on the chemoreceptor trigger zone and are particularly useful in the management of vomiting induced by vertigo or motion sickness.\n\n【18】c. Metoclopramide, a dopamine D2 antagonist, that additionally acts on the chemoreceptor trigger zone. This drug also displays 5-HT4 receptor agonist activity.

She complains of increasing discomfort when eating and finds that food  删除换行1 sometimes gets stuck in her throat. This is more often the case when eating meat or bread,  删除换行1 and she finds that if she does not chew her food carefully, then each mouthful needs to  删除换行1 be washed down with a glass of water. She has recently taken to eating soup for most  删除换行1 meals, and does not find this too much of a problem. These symptoms have been getting  删除换行1 very gradually worse over the past 5 months, and despite her change in diet she denies  删除换行1 any significant weight loss.\n\n【3】There is no relevant past medical history, but her GP has recently prescribed iron tablets  删除换行1 following a blood test for feelings of increasing lethargy. She attributes this to her heavy  删除换行1 periods. She is a non-smoker and only drinks socially.\n\n【4】Examination\n\n【5】Her barium swallow study results are shown in Figure 66.1.\n\n【6】Questions\n\n【7】• What does this view from the barium swallow show?\n\n【8】• What is the likely diagnosis?\n\n【9】删除3：<u>Figure 66.1 Barium swallow image.</u>\n ANSWER 66\n\n【10】For a barium swallow study, the patient is positioned between a fluoroscopy machine  删除换行1 containing an X-ray tube and an image intensifier. This provides a real-time image that  删除换行1 can be collimated to emphasize organs of the patient’s neck and chest. The patient is  删除换行1 asked to drink a contrast agent (e.g. barium) and hold it in the mouth. In coordination  删除换行1 with the radiologist, asking the patient to swallow on command allows for good opacification of the oesophagus and direct real-time observation of the passage the contrast  删除换行1 takes. Although many fluoroscopy studies are rarely used these days (e.g. barium enemas), swallow studies using barium or iodinated contrast medium are the ‘workhorse’ of  删除换行1 foregut imaging. As a relatively non-invasive technique, it allows for accurate visualization of the oesophageal diameter and mucosa, and is often used to confirm the presence  删除换行1 of persistent oesophageal leaks post-operatively.\n\n【11】This single lateral image is centred on the hypopharynx and upper oesophagus. Contrast  删除换行1 passes freely from the mouth to the mid-oesophagus with no evidence of hold-up or  删除换行1 obstruction. There is no evidence of aspiration. Within the proximal oesophagus at the  删除换行1 level of C5, there is an anterior ‘shelf-like’ filling defect seen. This arises at right angles  删除换行1 to the anterior oesophageal wall and appears to encroach into the oesophageal canal by  删除换行1 approximately one-third. There is no transition delay of contrast, and no evidence of  删除换行1 prestenotic dilatation or oesophageal diverticulosis. These features are in keeping with  删除换行1 an oesophageal web.\n\n【12】Oesophageal webs are thin membranes of normal oesophageal squamous tissue that grow  删除换行1 out from the anterior mucosal wall. Measuring approximately 1–2 mm in thickness, they  删除换行1 can cause complete or incomplete circumferential narrowing of the oesophageal lumen  删除换行1 and are most commonly seen in middle-aged white women. Symptoms are dependent on  删除换行1 the degree of obstruction, with patients complaining of dysphagia for solids rather than  删除换行1 liquids. Often found incidentally when patients present with feelings of globus or suffering food bolus impaction, symptoms can also include pain (odynophagia).\nThe aetiology of oesophageal webs is uncertain but can be both congenital, or more  删除换行1 commonly, acquired. They are associated with chronic inflammatory conditions of the  删除换行1 oesophagus including epidermolysis bullosa, pemphigus and bullous pemphigoid, and  删除换行1 are also seen in coeliac and graft-versus-host disease. There is a strong association with  删除换行5 Plummer–Vinson syndrome (PVS), in which patients experience concomitant glossitis,  删除换行1 angular stomatitis and iron-deficiency anaemia. Image findings should always be correlated with a full blood count to exclude this.\n\n【13】Treatment of oesophageal webs is routinely performed with balloon dilatation, and is  删除换行1 often a common byproduct of upper gastrointestinal endoscopy by bougienage. There is  删除换行1 an increased association with oesophageal cancer, and recurrence of symptoms should  删除换行1 be investigated early.\n\n【14】 KEY POINTS\n\n【15】• A barium swallow investigation is recommended for assessment of dysphagia.\n\n【16】• Oesophageal webs are thin membranes of normal oesophageal squamous tissue that  删除换行1 grow out from the anterior mucosal wall.\n\n【17】• There is a strong correlation between oesophageal webs and other chronic  删除换行1 inflammatory conditions.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

The risk factors are multiple sexual partners, unprotected sex, a history of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), and intrauterine devices.

Evaluating a female patient in the emergency department frequently results in a diagnostic difficulty, which has been emphasized in the literature numerous times 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Tubo-ovarian abscesses are a late complication of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), and if the abscess ruptures and causes sepsis, they can be fatal. Retrospectively on CT, it was recognized as an abscess part of the inflammatory mass.\n3.  3.\n    Ovarian cyst rupture : The patient presented with abdominal pain, intermenstrual bleeding, and tenderness in the pelvic area. Looking at the low socioeconomic status of the patient, it is assumed that she wasn’t able to do a regular screening or well-woman exam; hence this can be considered a differential as it is one of the common causes of gynecology emergencies in young females 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. The patient’s history, clinical progress, and inability to respond to the routine antibiotic treatment were unusual for PID. Furthermore, the imaging was suggestive of PID but not conclusive. An early laparoscopy could have been avoided if a more comprehensive differential diagnosis had been considered 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>.\n4.  4.\n    Acute abdominal infection : Lower abdomen pain can also be caused by infections that are not always transmitted sexually. The most prevalent kinds are pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and urinary tract infections (UTIs). PID is an upper genital tract infection that is most frequent in sexually active women. In our situation, an ultrasound scan performed during the patient’s initial presentation revealed what was termed as “complex fluid,” but no tumors were visible 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 29 \\]</u>. Despite the previous conversation, the transvaginal ultrasound images could not be connected with the CT scan, which revealed only nonspecific intestinal alterations and thus did not aid in the proper diagnosis, leading to the differential of abdominal infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 , 24 \\]</u>.\n5.  5.\n    Acute hepatitis : The patient has a low socioeconomic status and an active hepatitis C infection; she has a history of drug abuse and LLETZ conization for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN 2), making this patient highly prone to sexually transmitted diseases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 30 \\]</u>. According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), transmission from sharing needles is higher than sexual activity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 31 \\]</u>.\n\n【3】What Was Misdiagnosed in this Case and why?\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【4】Severe abdominal sepsis was misdiagnosed as PID. Evaluating a young female patient in the emergency room commonly leads to diagnostic difficulty, which has been highlighted in the literature multiple times 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>. The patient presented with very distinct features of PID, leading to the suspicion of it. Still, the imaging was inconclusive for the same as it showed an adnexal mass, creating another differential of tubo-ovarian abscess. The patient reported right iliac fossa tenderness, persistent nausea, and anorexia, increasing abdominal infection suspicion.\n\n【5】Discussion\n----------\n\n【6】PID frequently causes lower abdomen pain in women. Age under 25, age at first sexual intercourse under 15, lower socioeconomic level , being single, a self-reported history of a sexually transmitted disease, and C. trachomatis exposure are all risk factors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【7】The woman in our case had been a prior drug user and had a low socioeconomic background , an inactive hepatitis C infection, and a history of LLETZ conization for CIN 2, making her a high-risk patient for sexually transmitted disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Furthermore, because her abdominal pain was accompanied by fever, elevated inflammatory markers, intermenstrual bleeding, and “complex,” free fluid in the Douglas pouch, PID was quickly diagnosed. She was in a stable relationship. Risk-lowering factors included having bilateral tubal ligation; nonetheless, this was inadequate to rule out the diagnosis. On reflection, the patient’s medical history and clinical course and the failure to respond to the routine antibiotic treatment were not wholly typical of PID. Furthermore, the imaging was suggestive of PID but not conclusive. An early laparoscopy could have been avoided if a more comprehensive differential diagnosis had been considered. NETs are made up of neuroendocrine cells dispersed throughout the gastrointestinal tract’s mucosa. The ability to express proteins usually associated with neural cells, such as neuron-specific enolase and synaptophysin, and the ability to produce hormones like somatostatin, substance P, and vasoactive intestinal peptide, gives these cells their name. Sixty-four percent of all NETs are thought to start in the gastrointestinal system, whereas 28% begin in the lungs and bronchi. The small intestine (29%), rectum (14%), stomach (5%), and appendix (5%) are the most often afflicted areas within the gastrointestinal system 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 , 12 \\]</u>. Irritable bowel syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u> is a rare tumor form, and 60% of individuals with NETs are asymptomatic and discover their tumors by chance during medical workup for something else 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Lesions are typically >2 cm in diameter at diagnosis, with the invasion of the muscularis propria and metastases to regional lymph nodes if they are not an accidental observation. Even in the absence of a visible abdominal mass, midgut NETs are associated with mesenteric fibrosis, which can compress mesenteric arteries and produce bowel ischemia and malabsorption 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 26 \\]</u>. Multiple lesions are discovered in up to 40% of patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. The annual incidence of NETs has risen from 40 to 50 cases per million in recent years, owing to improved diagnostic tools that have become increasingly available 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 29 \\]</u>. This is likely not due to an actual increase in incidence but rather to better diagnostic tools increasingly available. The evaluation of a female patient in the emergency department frequently results in a diagnostic difficulty, as evidenced by numerous studies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 16 – 19 , 24 , 25 , 32 \\]</u>, to name a few instances. CT or ultrasound imaging, on the other hand, proved helpful in all of those cases in determining an accurate diagnosis. In our situation, an ultrasound scan performed during the patient’s initial presentation revealed what was termed as “ complex fluid,” but no tumors were visible. A transvaginal scan revealed a mass in the pouch of Douglas on her second presentation, which was misinterpreted as an adnexal mass given her previous diagnosis of PID. It was later discovered that the abscess, not the tumor, was the source of the inflammatory mass seen intraoperatively. Despite the prior discussion, the transvaginal ultrasound images could not be connected to the CT scan, which only revealed nonspecific intestinal alterations and hence could not aid in the accurate diagnosis. Our case shows that, despite advances in diagnostic tool development, rigorous history taking and clinical examination remain essential and cannot be replaced solely by imaging.\n\n【8】Plan of Action, the Points Clinician Should Consider. Pitfalls to Avoid and Pearls of Knowledge to Think about\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【9】The fundamentals must not be overlooked:\n\n【10】1.  1.\n    When a patient comes, a thorough and complete medical history should be collected and pathognomonic and crucial facts. The most common risk factors should be considered keeping the patient’s condition in mind.\n2.  2.\n    A comprehensive physical examination is also required in primary health care, even or especially when the medical history appears to be minor. An annual well-woman exam effectively minimizes the severity of diseases like PID by diagnosing them early.\n3.  3.\n    Alternative diagnoses were not regarded enough when the patient continued to complain of gastrointestinal issues and did not respond well to antibiotic treatment.\n4.  4.\n    It is important to look into all the aspects related to each sign and symptom presented by the patient.\n5.  5.\n    It’s crucial to rethink your diagnosis, especially if a patient’s symptoms linger despite receiving proper treatment for the initial diagnosis. Prevalent things are common; nevertheless, if the patient continues to be unresponsive to therapy, a rarer differential diagnosis must be investigated.\n\n【11】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【12】Regardless of sex partner therapy, all women diagnosed with chlamydial or gonococcal PID, including pregnant patients, must repeat chlamydial and gonorrhea testing in 3 months 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 , 28 \\]</u>. Rescreening after 3 months is different from a cure test, which takes place sooner. Patients should be seen within 48 to 72 h of being discharged from the hospital or starting outpatient treatment to assess clinical progress and treatment tolerance. All sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including HIV and syphilis, should be tested. The need for more diligent screening for asymptomatic STIs in suitable female patients has been recognized in this review of the literature. This is to prevent PID through early treatment of STIs with the goal of preventing damage to the reproductive tract that predisposes patients to infertility and ectopic pregnancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 23 \\]</u>. Importantly, behavioral interventions that enhance provider and patient adherence to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) treatment guidelines work, but they must be widely implemented for population outcomes to improve 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 , 13 \\]</u>. Three days after starting medication, women should show clinical improvement (e.g. defervescence; reduction in direct or rebound stomach soreness; and reduction in uterine, adnexal, and cervical motion tenderness). If there has been no clinical improvement after 72 h of outpatient IM or oral medication, hospitalization, evaluation of the antibiotic regimen, and additional diagnostics, including diagnostic laparoscopy for alternative diagnoses, are advised. Regardless of whether their sex partners have been treated, all women who have been diagnosed with chlamydia or gonococcal PID should be retested 3 months after therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 28 , 33 \\]</u>. If retesting at 3 months is not practicable, these women should be retested 12 months following treatment when they next seek medical care.\n\n【13】> To reverse the STD epidemic, we should all learn to talk more openly about STDs- with our parents, partners and providers.\n> \n> ~Dr. Gail Bolan, Director of CDC’s Division of STD Prevention", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

He received infusion of ceftizoxime at a local clinic. His fever did not regress, and rashes developed on the trunk on Day 2 of illness. The doctor stopped the infusion immediately. After intramuscular injection of dexamethasone, the rashes improved, but fever was persistent, and he started to have cough. Then he received infusion of erythromycin for 2 days. On Day 5, he had increasing rashes along with mild edema in arms, legs, and scrotum, the doctor stopped giving him intravenous infusion of cefoperazone sodium and sulbactam sodium. Yesterday, the doctor started to give him infusion of meropenem, imipenem, and cilastatin sodium, but his rashes worsened again. Then he was transferred to our clinic and admitted in pediatric respiratory ward as a patient with acute bronchopneumonia. Examination findings include: T 39.1 °C, PR136 bpm, RR30 bpm, weight 7 Kg. His mental stage was stable. He had rashes on the face, trunk, arms, and legs. He had cervical lymphadenectasis about 0.5 × 0.5 cm. Auscultation assessment revealed respiratory rudeness in bilateral pulmonary systems. Examination found normal heart and abdomen. He had edema in the arms and legs, scrotum. Neurological system was normal. On Day 2 of illness CBC revealed WBC 16.5 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L, NE 70.3%. On Day 3 of illness, WBC 15.7 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L, NE 76.6%. CRP 95.3 mg/L.

Chest X-ray revealed bronchopneumonia. After admission, CBC showed WBC 11.5 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L, NE 83%, HGB 80 g/L, PLT 231 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L. CRP 133 mg/L. PT 16.1s, INR 1.2, APTT 37 s, D-dimer 1133 ug/L, FDP 16.5 mg/L. Chest CT presented inflammation at the lower lobes of the lungs. He had (i) acute bronchopneumonia; (ii) sepsis. He was treated with (i) infusion of cefepime hydrochloride and vancomycin after blood sample drawn for culture; (ii) IVIG 2.5 g/d (350 mg/kg/d) for supporting therapy; (iii) infusion of erythromycin.\n\n【3】On Day 9, he still had a fever and the red rashes on the trunk. The dermatologist we consulted with recognized that the patient had erythema multiforme. The dermatologist suggested the patient staying away from possible factors taking low sensitive diet, and having the infection under control. The dermatologist also recommend oral compound glycyrrhizin capsules, half a capsule each time, three times a day; chlorphenamine maleate tablets, 1 mg each time, twice a day. Investigation revealed CKMB 35 U/L; TP 46.4 g/L, ALB 27.20 g/L. CK, ALT, AST, tuberculosis antibody, MP-IgM and MP-IgG antibody were normal. In the night, the rashes were aggravated; they were red spotted rashes, protruded from the surface of the skin and partially merged into pieces, along with eyelid edema. On Day 10, after IVIG, the edema became obvious. To reduce the amount of intravenous infusion, erythromycin and immunoglobulin were left out, and furosemide (2 mg/kg/d, in 2 divided doses) intravenous injection was given. After that, the edema in eyelid was relieved, the edema in the arms and legs was reduced than before. On Day 13, he still had a fever (peak 39 °C). The condition of edema was improved, but there were still rashes. His heart rate was 160–200 bpm.

Subendothelial deposits in the glomerular capillaries are indicative of lupus nephritis, a complication of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) that largely dictates the patient’s prognosis. SLE classically presents with a malar “butterfly” rash on exposure to sunlight. Various manifestations of SLE can affect different aspects of the body, such as the cardiovascular (pericarditis), respiratory (pleural effusion), musculoskeletal (arthralgias), and hematologic (anemia, various cytopenias) systems. Treatment generally consists of immunosuppressive drugs such as prednisone.  \nAnswer A is incorrect . Achalasia is not particularly associated with lupus. It can be associated with Chagas disease, as a result of infection with Trypanosoma cruzi .  \nAnswer B is incorrect . Aortic aneurysms are not particularly associated with lupus.

She has no known risk factors for exposure to the virus. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?\n\n【1】A. Immediately begin therapy with azidothymidine.\n\n【2】B. Perform the screening test a second time.\n\n【3】C. Request that blood culture be performed in a laboratory.\n\n【4】D. Tell the patient that she is likely to develop AIDS.\n\n【5】E. Test the patient for Pneumocystis carinii infection.\n\n【6】Answer: 29.1 B. Because HIV cannot be safely isolated and grown in the standard medical center diagnostic laboratory, diagnosis of HIV infections relies on detection of antibodies against the virus. The standard screening test is performed by ELISA. ELISA test formats are quite reliable and accurate and can be used for antibody or antigen detection. However, by definition, screening tests are not 100% accurate for sensitivity and specificity rates. HIV infection, especially, is a tragic infection that requires utmost accuracy in laboratory diagnosis results to aid the physician in counseling the involved patient and family. Under the conditions described in question 29.1, no known risk factors for HIV contact are claimed or identified. For this situation and any other requiring diagnostic laboratory testing for HIV infection, extra effort is taken to ensure accuracy and correct results. Because it is widely accepted that HIV ELISA screening is not 100% sensitive and specific (however, it is approximately 98% accurate), a second blood sample is collected for retesting by ELISA. If both ELISA results are positive, then a second confirming test is done. This is usually a Western blot technique. If the Western blot test is positive, then HIV infection is confirmed and related to the patient.\n\n【7】Question: 29.2 In a person with HIV-1 infection, which of the following is the most predictive of the patient’s prognosis?\n\n【8】A. CD4+ cell count\n\n【9】B. CD4:CD8 cell ratio\n\n【10】C. Degree of lymphadenopathy\n\n【11】D. Level of HIV-1 RNA in plasma\n\n【12】E. Rate of decline in anti-HIV antibody\n\n【13】Answer: 29.2 D. Amplification assays (RT-PCR, DNA PCR, and bDNA tests) are routinely used to detect viral RNA in clinical specimens. The tests can be quantitative when reference standards are used, and appropriate positive and negative controls must be included in each test. Because these molecular based tests are very sensitive, they form the basis for plasma viral load determinations. It is generally agreed that the amount of HIV in the blood (viral load) is of significant prognostic value. There are continual rounds of viral replication and cell killing in each patient, and the steady-state level of virus in the blood varies with individuals. A single measurement of plasma viral load approximately 6 months after infection can predict the risk of development of AIDS in men several years later. In women, viral load appears to be less predictive. The plasma viral load appears to be the best predictor of long-term clinical outcome, whereas CD4 lymphocyte counts are the best predictor of short-term risk of developing an opportunistic disease. Plasma viral load measurements are a critical element in assessing the effectiveness of antiretroviral drug therapy.\n\n【14】Question: 29.3 Highly active antiretroviral therapy against HIV infection includes 1 or more nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors in combination with representatives of which class of antiretroviral agents?\n\n【15】A. Inhibitors of viral binding\n\n【16】B. Inhibitors of viral protein processing\n\n【17】C. Inhibitors of viral release\n\n【18】D. Inhibitors of viral uncoating\n\n【19】E. Non-nucleoside antiretroviral agents\n\n【20】Answer: 29.3 B. A growing number of drugs have been approved for treatment of HIV infections. It must be remembered that all HIV drug treatments are only virostatic and not virucidal at this point in time. Classes of drugs include nucleoside and nonnucleoside inhibitors of the viral reverse transcriptase and inhibitors of the viral protease enzyme. The protease inhibitors are significant because protease activity is absolutely essential for production of infectious virus, and the viral enzyme is distinct from human cell proteases. These inhibitors 删除10：<u>(approved in 2003)</u> block virus entry into host cells.\n\n【21】Question: 29.4 Which of the following is the pathogen responsible for blindness in advanced HIV infections?\n\n【22】A. Cytomegalovirus\n\n【23】B. Epstein-Barr virus\n\n【24】C. Fungus\n\n【25】D. Toxoplasma\nAnswer: 29.4 A. The predominant causes of morbidity and mortality among patients with late-stage HIV infection are opportunistic infections. These are defined as severe infections induced by agents that rarely cause disease in immune-competent individuals. Opportunistic infections usually do not occur until CD4 T cell counts drop from normal (1000 cells/μL) to less than 200 cells/μL. Common opportunistic infections in patients with untreated AIDS are caused by protozoa, fungi, bacteria, and other viruses. Coinfection with DNA viruses are reported to lead to enhanced expression of HIV in cells in vitro. Herpesvirus infections are common in patients with AIDS, and cytomegalovirus has been shown to produce a protein that acts as a chemokine receptor and is able to help HIV infect cells. Cytomegalovirus retinitis is the most common severe ocular complications of AIDS.\n\n【26】MICROBIOLOGY PEARLS\n\n【27】 HIV is a retrovirus and requires reverse transcriptase to make a double-stranded DNA copy of the viral genomic RNA.\n\n【28】 Antibody detection is the most common method of diagnosing an infection.\n\n【29】 The treatment of HIV largely depends on targeting viral reverse transcriptase and protease enzymes.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Affected areas undergo a continuous cycle of healing and recurrences with a fluctuating course 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Pain and pruritus are rarely observed. The vertex is the most common location for erosive pustular dermatosis of the scalp, followed by the frontal and parietal areas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Diagnosis of the disease is based on a combination of history, physical examination, trichoscopy, and histopathology 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Trichoscopic features of erosive pustular dermatosis of the scalp include absence of follicular ostia, tufted and broken hair, crusts, serous exudate, dilated vessels, pustules and hyperkeratosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.

It is characterized by subepithelial blisters and erosions with following scarring strictly limited to the head and neck. The mucous membranes are spared.\n\n【37】Pyoderma gangrenosum is a rare, noninfectious, neutrophilic dermatosis with an incidence between three and 10 patients per million 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. It presents as pustules or papules that undergo a central necrosis and extend peripherally to form ulcers. Lower extremities are the most common location, however the scalp involvement has been described in the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Classic pyoderma gangrenosum is most common in adults between 20 and 50 years of age. However, the scalp lesions frequently occur in the pediatric and geriatric patient populations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Women are slightly more commonly affected compared to man. Pyoderma gangrenosum is commonly associated with an underlying comorbidity such as inflammatory bowel disease, hematologic disorders (myelodysplastic syndrome, multiple myeloma), or inflammatory arthritis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【38】Basal cell carcinoma is the most common skin malignancy. The incidence rate of the disease increases with age. There are five types of basal cell carcinoma: nodular, pigmented, morpheaform, superficial and premalignant (fibroepithelioma) that vary in clinical presentation. Basal cell carcinoma presents as solitary lesion, most commonly on the face, scalp or neck areas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【39】Based on the clinical manifestation, trichoscopy and histopathological examination, the diagnosis of erosive pustular dermatosis of the scalp was established.

During this session, however, there was one explosion of rage by Max, whereby he became extremely irritated during an argument with Mum. An argument broke out on the beach, whereby Max and his mother clashed over throwing a stick to their pet dog. Unclear about what was Max’s concern, his mother continued to throw the stick, refusing to give into Max’s demands, at which point Max screamed, yelled and ran off down the beach for a short period of time. Upon his return, while still extremely frustrated, he explained his fear that the stick was too small and the dog was at risk of choking. The therapist used this opportunity to introduce another modification to CBT aimed at addressing Max’s poor problem-solving skills and explosive behaviour.\n\n【4】Collaborative problem solving (CPS) strategies were introduced whereby Max and his parents were taught steps in resolving problems in a mutually satisfactory manner 删除10：<u>(Greene 2010 )</u>. The model conceptualizes aggressive or explosive behaviour as the by-product of deficits in the development of cognitive skills, specifically in the domains of flexibility, frustration tolerance, and problem solving. These skill deficits are characteristic of youth with ASD, and they were certainly hypothesized to contribute to Max’s inability to regulate his emotions and problem-solve conflicts with his parents. The CPS approach aims to achieve three primary goals. The first goal is to help parents understand the “lagging cognitive skills” model, thereby enhancing parental empathy for the child at times of disagreement and stress. The second goal is to help parents and youth become cognizant of three common options for handling problems or unmet expectations—imposition of adult will (plan A), CPS (plan B), and removal of the parents’ expectation (plan C)—and the impact of each of these three strategies on adult–child interactions. The third goal is to help adults and children become proficient at solving problems collaboratively, so as to resolve potential conflict in a manner that reduces the likelihood of aggressive outbursts .\n\n【5】For Max and his parents, the therapist used the current conflict as an example to demonstrate (using a stick in the sand) the three alternate outcomes—plan A (do what mum says), plan B (work it out together), or plan C (give in to Max, and the OCD mean team wins). Using this framework, the various options were discussed, that is, when plan A (adult) and plan C (child) solutions are used, one party either surrenders to the other or does not have an opportunity to contribute to the solution (i.e. win/lose scenario). When plan B (both) is used, both parties express their concerns and generate solutions to the problem (i.e. win/win). Using the current difficulty as an example, Max and his parents expressed their concerns or point of view, and then they generated solutions to the problem. They agreed on a solution to seek a larger, more solid stick for the dog to chase. Max’s ability to stay calm, “use his IQs” to work out why he was feeling so upset, and problem solve with his parents was praised. At the completion of the session, Max’s therapist developed a form for the family to use at home, to practice CPS throughout the week. Max’s achievements were reviewed, photos provided to the family of lap wins, and reward points allocated. His increase in confidence and ability to manage his OCD symptoms were becoming evident to all .\n\n【6】E-Therapy Maintenance of Gains\n\n【7】Three weekly 1-h follow-up e-therapy sessions followed Max’s intensive treatment, allowing for generalization of ERP to continue at home and school, to practice further ERP tasks during session, and to provide ongoing support to his family in reducing their accommodation to Max’s OCD demands. It was at this stage of therapy that withdrawal of family accommodation practices began to occur in a systematic way. Given the extent and chronicity of the family accommodation , together with Max’s poor emotional regulation and deficits in problem solving skills, it was deemed important to time the reduction of family accommodation when Max was better equipped to understand his intense emotions and manage these more effectively, and his parents were more confident in understanding OCD and how to assist Max in managing his symptoms, without engaging in maladaptive accommodation. Steps to achieve his parents’ gradual withdrawal of accommodation were decided by Max, and steps were developed to address this systematically, week by week.\n\n【8】Post Assessment Summary\n-----------------------\n\n【9】A full review of Max’s progress was conducted at the completion of his therapy and again at a 3-month follow-up. An overview of his therapeutic outcomes is presented in Table 23.6 . On the basis of parent diagnostic interviews, Max maintained a diagnosis of OCD (CSR = 4) and comorbid diagnosis of ADHD (CSR = 4) at post treatment, indicating a significant improvement in his OCD despite still meeting clinical range. At a 3-month follow-up, however, Max no longer met diagnostic status for OCD, with a subthreshold CSR rating of 2. The three most distressing target behaviours were rated by Max throughout the treatment process. As can be seen in Fig. 23.3 , there was systematic reduction of distress across these symptoms, from pretreatment to 3 months post treatment.\n\n【10】删除3：<u>Fig. 23.3\n\n【11】Max’s self-rated SUDs of his three most troubling target behaviours</u>\nTable 23.6 删除换行 Posttreatment and 3-month follow-up assessment summary\n\n| Measure | Post-score | Description | 3-month score | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| OCD CSR | 4 | Clinical | 2 | Subclinical |\n| ADHD CSR | 4 | Clinical | 4 | Clinical |\n| CY-BOCS obsessions | 10 | Moderate | 4 | Mild |\n| CY-BOCS compulsions | 10 | Moderate | 3 | Mild |\n| CY-BOCS total | 20 | Moderate | 7 | Subclinical |\n| CDI T-score | 67 | Elevated | 64 | High average |\n| MASC T-score | 69 | Elevated | 61 | Slightly elevated |\n| PedsQL | 48 | Reduced physical, emotional, social, and school impairments | 40 | Reduced physical, emotional, social, and school impairments |\n| FAS | 48 | Extreme family accommodation | 4 | Very low family accommodation |\n\n【13】OCD obsessive-compulsive disorder, CSR clinician severity rating, ADHD attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, CY-BOCS Children’s Yale–Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale, CDI Child Depression Inventory, MASC Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children, FAS Family Accommodation Scale, PedsQL Pediatric Quality of Life\n\n【14】Complicating Factors\n--------------------\n\n【15】Max’s comorbid presentation of OCD and ASD presented a number of complicating issues that required modifications to the standard delivery of CBT for paediatric OCD. Deficits in Max’s emotion regulation, poor frustration tolerance, and lags in his problem solving skills meant Max experienced explosive emotional outbursts. Indeed, during treatment Max experienced moments of rage, which were seized by his highly attuned therapist as opportunities to teach Max and the family additional strategies for (a) emotional regulation and (b) CPS. These approaches not only addressed Max’s poor emotion regulation and problem solving deficits but also presented a vehicle for bringing the family together to work collaboratively towards the same goals, which appeared to improve the general emotional functioning of Max’s parents and went some way towards improved parent–child interactions.\n\n【16】The degree to which the family was over involved in OCD and modified their expectations of Max within the home was another major complicating factor in Max’s treatment. The family accommodation in this case served to exacerbate Max’s symptoms and reinforce his diminished sense of self-efficacy. This pathological degree of accommodation led to dysfunctional family relationships, and it was crippling Max’s parents. Psychoeducation about family accommodation and its impact was central to Max’s treatment and recovery. In order to effectively deliver ERP, as well as transfer control back to Max’s parents, it was essential that his parents were involved in every step of treatment. This allowed the therapist opportunities for modelling of appropriate responses to OCD, as well as addressing unacceptable behaviour by Max; training his parents in effective ways to support ERP at home; cultivating an alliance amongst the family against OCD; and the development of adaptive stress management and conflict management within the family.\n\n【17】Conclusions and Key Practice Points\n-----------------------------------\n\n【18】This case has demonstrated that CBT with ERP can be effective in treating comorbid OCD in a young person with ASD. While the treatment approach used in this case was intensive, the therapeutic process and outcomes would be very similar if given in standard weekly sessions. This treatment produced a clinically significant reduction in OCD, anxiety and depression symptoms, while improvements were also seen in Max’s quality of life and overall functioning. Max’s parents were also to benefit, being able to enjoy leisurely activities together once more. With Max’s distress and demands for accommodation greatly reduced, the family unit was functioning much better at conclusion of therapy.\n\n【19】The present case highlights the importance of psychoeducation concerning family accommodation in the treatment process of paediatric OCD, particular when accommodation practices are extreme, which might be a correlate of ASD comorbidity. As family accommodation is of significant clinical relevance, and accommodation may worsen manifestations of the illness and interfere with treatment approaches, determining contributory familial factors in childhood OCD and involving the family in therapy are vital to the management of this illness. For clinicians, assessing family accommodation is an important process in order to develop a functional assessment and formulation of the disorder and develop individualized treatment plans. Addressing family accommodation behaviours with parents may serve to not only improve outcomes for their child but also reduce guilt and blame for past behaviours and redirect attention to focus on more adaptive strategies in supporting change in a child with OCD.\n\n【20】An important consideration when treating comorbid OCD and ASD is parental involvement in the treatment process. Certainly in this case, Max’s parents were motivated and took an enthusiastic approach to participating in the treatment and supporting their son. Efforts to improve existing interventions increasingly have focused on aspects of the family environment that may influence treatment adherence and the maintenance of therapeutic gains, and the inclusion of families has routinely been recommended as an adjunct to individual child interventions. While it is generally agreed that CBT should include parents, to date there have been no systematic trials providing empirical evidence for the benefits of family augmented CBT in comparison to child focussed CBT. This is an area for future research, given that parents are perfectly placed to ensure the longevity of therapeutic gains by having an increased ability to expose their children to feared situations.\n\n【21】In this case, modification to CBT was essential to address some of the unique complications associated with comorbid ASD and OCD, and it included 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> use of clear, precise language, instructions, and visual aids; 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> utilizing the child’s area of restricted interest to cultivate motivation and compliance with therapeutic goals; 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> dealing with elopement during session; 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> involving a high degree of family involvement to adequately address family accommodation and maladaptive parent–child interactions; 通用删除7(英):<u>(5)</u> emotion regulation training to address explosive behaviour and poor emotional functioning of the child and family; and 通用删除7(英):<u>(6)</u> CPS to address parent–child conflict and deficits in child’s problem solving, frustration tolerance, and chronic inflexibility.

Diagnostic overshadowing is problematic because it detracts from learning how ASD and OCD may intersect and possibly complicate treatment. A thorough clinical evaluation should include a functional assessment of the RB. It is currently unknown how the accurate differentiation of ASD-specific RBs versus co-occurring OCD with ASD informs the treatment approach. Although ERP has growing support as a treatment for OCD in high-functioning ASD, preliminary findings suggest that modified ERP may also be effective in reducing RBs within the context of ASD and co-occurring intellectual disability 删除10：<u>(Boyd et al. 2013 )</u>.

It is usually caused by the  删除换行1 impact of a clenched fist with a skull or a hard, immovable object.\n\n【11】Only the collateral ligaments remain attached to the proximal phalanx and therefore  删除换行1 the metacarpal head is freed from any proximal stabilizing influence.

He also notes that his road rage is worse on hot days (his car doesn’t have air conditioning). |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Sample Problem Areas: Autism; excessive eating, drinking, smoking; disruptive classroom behavior; insufficient exercise; challenges of parenting; marital dissatisfaction. | Sample Problem Areas: Autism; excessive eating, drinking, smoking; disruptive classroom behavior; insufficient exercise; challenges of parenting; marital dissatisfaction. | Sample Problem Areas: Autism; excessive eating, drinking, smoking; disruptive classroom behavior; insufficient exercise; challenges of parenting; marital dissatisfaction. |\n| Sample Treatment Ideas: Strategy based on behavioral analysis; use of positive reinforcement; contingency contract; token economy; stimulus control. | Sample Treatment Ideas: Strategy based on behavioral analysis; use of positive reinforcement; contingency contract; token economy; stimulus control. | Sample Treatment Ideas: Strategy based on behavioral analysis; use of positive reinforcement; contingency contract; token economy; stimulus control. |\n\n【8】This hypothesis originated with the operant conditioning experiments of B. F. Skinner. These experiments demonstrated how behavior can be under the control of (a function of) its consequences. Picture a poor hungry rat in a cage emitting random behaviors until it presses a bar and receives a pellet of food; the bar pressing increases, and the rat would end up fat and happy if the fiendish experimenter did not decide to conduct new experiments, such as varying the intervals and frequencies for delivering the reward ( reinforcer ). Other experiments demonstrated that animals would learn a behavior that terminated aversive stimuli, a process labeled negative reinforcement . If the experimenter stopped giving rewards, the rat would eventually stop pressing the bar, a condition called extinction. For the behavior to be resistant to extinction, it is best to put the animal through the extinction process and then reinstitute rewards on an intermittent basis.\n\n【9】Further experiments demonstrated how behavior can be under the control of (a function of) its antecedents —the stimuli which precede it. A discriminative stimulus is a cue or signal that indicates that performance of the behavior will lead to reinforcement. The absence of this stimulus means that no reinforcer will be forthcoming for a particular behavior. If the experimenter adds a cue for delivery of the reward (e.g. red light), then the animal learns to press the bar only when that light is present, and to not press it with a different stimulus (e.g. green light). The behavior is “under stimulus control” when a certain cue needs to be present for the behavior to occur; we can say that it triggers the occurrence of the behavior. The concept of stimulus generalization was also demonstrated in these laboratories: When the trigger is a red light, the response will occur to lights of various shades of pink or orange. Planning for generalization is important in clinical practice to ensure that the behaviors successfully performed with the therapist will also occur outside the therapy office.\n\n【10】The application of these principles of learning in clinical settings formed the foundation of Behavior Modification; these principles provide the rationale for interventions currently used in Behavior Therapy and Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy.

The idea of “behavioral diagnosis” 删除10：<u>(Kanfer & Saslow, 1965)</u> formed the foundation of applied behavioral analysis , a systematic method for gathering data, creating hypotheses, and developing interventions. Behavioral analysis is so powerful because it allows clinicians to focus on specific variables amid complexity, and design treatments that can be empirically validated.

ECG shows ST-segment elevations and inverted T waves in leads II, III, and aVF. His troponin I level is high. He is taken to the cardiac catheterization unit, where he is diagnosed with an obstructive myocardial infarction due to occlusion of the right coronary artery. Assuming this man’s coronary vasculature is right dominant, which of the following areas is most likely to be spared after this event?\n\n【1】> (A) Anterior interventricular septum\n\n【2】> (B) Atrioventricular node\n\n【3】> (C) Posterior interventricular septum\n\n【4】> (D) Right ventricle\n\n【5】> (E) Sinoatrial node\n Answer: The correct answer is A . The right coronary artery (RCA) arises from the aortic sinus of the ascending aorta and runs along the right side of the pulmonary trunk in the coronary groove. It gives off a sinoatrial (SA) nodal branch, the acute marginal artery, and an atrioventricular (AV) nodal branch. About 80% of people have “right-dominant” circulation, meaning the RCA also gives off the posterior descending artery, which supplies the posterior and inferior ventricles and the posterior one-third of the interventricular septum. An acute occlusion of the RCA commonly manifests on ECG as ST-segment elevations in leads II, III, and aVF. These leads are called the “inferior leads” because they represent the inferior surface of the heart. ST-segment elevations in these leads suggest an occlusion of the RCA because the inferior surface is most commonly supplied by this vessel. The left anterior descending (LAD) artery branches from the left main coronary artery as it approaches the AV junction. It descends toward the apex on the anterior wall of the heart between the right and left ventricles and supplies the anterior wall of both ventricles and the anterior two-thirds of the inter ventricular septum, including the AV bundle. These areas of myocardium supplied by the LAD would be less affected by an occlusion of the RCA.  \nAnswer B is incorrect . In 80% of people the AV node is supplied by AV nodal branches that come off the RCA, making it unlikely to be spared after an RCA occlusion. Note that in 20% of people the AV node is supplied by branches of the left main coronary artery.  \nAnswer C is incorrect . In right-dominant individuals, the RCA courses around to the posterior wall of the heart and gives off the posterior descending artery. This vessel supplies the posterior regions of both the left and right ventricles, as well as the posterior one-third of the interventricular septum. Thus the posterior septum is less likely to be spared in an occlusion of the RCA. If this patient’s coronary vessels were left-dominant (as occurs in 20% of people), the posterior descending artery would branch off the left circumflex artery and the posterior septum would not be affected by an RCA occlusion.  \nAnswer D is incorrect . The right ventricle receives most of its blood supply from the acute marginal and posterior descending arteries, both of which are branches of the RCA in right-dominant individuals. The LAD, which runs in the interventricular groove, also provides some blood flow to portions of the right ventricle. However, the primary source of blood supply is from the RCA, so the right ventricle is less likely to be spared when the RCA becomes occluded.  \nAnswer E is incorrect . In 60% of people the RCA gives off SA nodal branches near its origin that supply the SA node. Thus this area is less likely to be spared in an acute occlusion of the RCA. However, it is important to note that in the remaining 40% of people, the SA node is supplied by branches from the circumflex artery, which comes off the left main coronary artery.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

The findings of the echocardiogram make infective endocarditis (IE) the most likely diagnosis.\n\n【27】IE is infection of the inner lining of the heart, the endocardium. This includes the heart  删除换行1 valves, their supporting structures, intraventricular septa and the walls of the heart. Strictly  删除换行1 speaking it also includes the endothelium of the intrathoracic great vessels and any intracardiac foreign bodies, such as prosthetic valves or pacemaker wires.\n\n【28】Two factors are necessary for bacterial colonization of a valve to take place:\n\n【29】1. Valvular damage: this can occur from turbulent blood flow, congenital heart  删除换行1 disease, prosthetic valves, previous endocarditis, physical manipulation, the  删除换行1 particulate material of intravenous drug user’s injections, and degeneration.\nDegenerative valves make the incidence of IE three times higher in the elderly  删除换行1 population.\n\n【30】2. An inflammatory reaction to the exposed and damaged valvular endothelium  删除换行1 results in the deposition of platelets and fibrin. Circulating bacterial colonies grow  删除换行1 on these platelet-fibrin clots to form vegetations which are relatively resistant to host  删除换行1 immune defences.\n\n【31】In the general population left-sided valves are predominantly affected, most often the mitral  删除换行1 valve. Right-sided valve involvement forms less than 10% of IE, and has a lower mortality  删除换行1 than left-sided disease. Right-sided IE is more common to cohorts of intravenous drug users,  删除换行1 congenital heart disease and in patients with pacemakers.\n\n【32】On account of their resistance to complement and their propensity to adhere to damaged valvular endothelium, more than 80% of microbes responsible for endocarditis are  删除换行1 gram-positive, namely streptococci, staphylococci, and enterococci. Coagulase-negative  删除换行1 staphylococci more commonly causes prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE). Native valve  删除换行1 endocarditis (NVE) has a mortality of up to 30%, with Staphylococcus aureus infection  删除换行1 displaying more pathogenicity than oral streptococci species. PVE has a higher mortality  删除换行1 than NVE.\n\n【33】There are underlying risk factors that assist in determining the likely pathogen. Poor dentition, recent dental procedures and other maxillofacial pathology make oral streptococci  删除换行1 more likely. Skin lesions, recent trauma or surgery, intravenous drug use or presence of a  删除换行1 vascular access device make staphylococci more likely. Bowel and urological pathology, or  删除换行1 endocarditis in patients who are severely debilitated and have had multiple courses of broadspectrum antibiotics, makes enterococci more likely. A noteworthy association is Strep. bovis 删除换行1 with colon cancer in elderly patients.\n\n【34】A causative organism will be identified in 90% of cases if two separate sets of blood  删除换行1 cultures are taken 30 minutes apart. It is imperative to take blood cultures before antibiotics are started, which was not done in this scenario. Antibiotics are the leading cause Case 81: Fever and collapse 删除换行1 of negative blood  cultures. Other causes of culture-negative endocarditis include the  删除换行1 fastidious gram-negative bacteria of the HACEK group (Haemophilus, Aggregatibacter,  删除换行3 Cardiobacterium, Eikenella, Kingella), Coxiella burnetii (Q fever) and Bartonella spp. Each  删除换行1 of these three groups is responsible for up to 3% of endocarditis in England and Wales.\n\n【35】All patients with suspected IE must have a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) which  删除换行1 detects valvular vegetations with a sensitivity of approximately 70–80%. If this is negative  删除换行1 or there is still a high index of clinical suspicion, a transoesophageal echocardiogram (TOE) 删除换行1 is indicated, which has a sensitivity of 90–100%. If a prosthetic valve or intracardiac device  删除换行1 is present, a TOE is strongly recommended, as the sensitivity of the TTE is low. A follow-up  删除换行1 echocardiogram is required at the end of antibiotic treatment to assess valve and cardiac  删除换行1 function.\n\n【36】The mainstay of treatment is a prolonged course of antibiotics. About 50% of patients  删除换行1 will require surgical intervention to remove the infected area, as host defences in heart  删除换行1 valves are relatively ineffective. Reasons for surgical intervention are divided into 3 broad  删除换行1 groups:\n\n【37】1. Uncontrolled infection (not responding to antibiotic therapy, a perivalvular abscess,  删除换行3 PVE, most gram-negative and fungal IE)\n\n【38】2. Prevention of embolism (very large vegetations, signs of emboli)\n\n【39】3. Heart failure or severe valve regurgitation\n\n【40】KEY POINTS\n\n【41】• Infective endocarditis is infection of the inner lining of the heart, the endocardium.\n\n【42】• A causative organism is usually identified if blood cultures are taken before antibiotics are started.\n\n【43】• More than 80% of microbes responsible are gram positive, namely staphylococci,  删除换行1 oral streptococci and enterococci.Case 82: Burning sensation when passing urine", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

The patient was recently promoted to a position that requires increased interpersonal interaction as well as new supervisory responsibilities. Subsequently， his job performance has dropped off significantly. The patient states that since his transfer， he has been so ner-vous at work that he has not been able to think straight. He reports that his mood at home has been good， but that he knows he will fail at the new job because，\"I have always been such a dope when it comes to working with other people. After several sessions， the counselor diagnoses the patient with avoidant personality disorder.

Give the patient a beta-blocker to help him control his anxiety.\n\n【4】D. Prescribe a benzodiazepine.\n\n【5】E.Tell the patient that he is probably not ready for this job if he is this anxious，\n\n【6】50.2 A 24-year-old man presents to a therapist. Which of the following statements made by the patient is most consistent with avoidant personality disorder?\n\n【7】A.“I have a couple of close friends， but it is very hard to make friends. I’m afraid most people wouldn’t want me around”\n\n【8】B. “I'm usually fine around people. It's just when I’m around a lot of people I've never met before that I get freaked out”\n\n【9】C“I'm afraid that people are plotting against me.\"D\n\n【10】“My mom thinks I have a problem with people. I can take them or leave them”\n\n【11】E.“My girlfriend thinks I have a problem with people， like with her friends. What do you think?”\n\n【12】50.3Which statement best characterizes the difference between patients with avoidant personality disorder and those with schizoid personality disorder?\n\n【13】A.Patients with avoidant personality disorder have fewer friends than those with schizoid personality disorder.\n\n【14】B. Patients with avoidant personality disorder have higher self-esteem than those with schizoid personality disorder.\n\n【15】C.。Patients with avoidant personality disorder would like to have friends more than patients with schizoid personality disorder.\n\n【16】D. Patients with avoidant personality disorder are better at accepting criti-cism than patients with schizoid personality disorder.\n\n【17】E. Patients with avoidant personality disorder are less anxious than are patients with schizoid personality disorder.\n\n【18】50.4 A 35-year-old woman is engaged in psychotherapy to address her avoid-ant personality disorder. In particular， she is distressed by her inability to maintain a romantic relationship with a man. During the course of treat-ment， the therapist learns that her father was an alcoholic and was physi-cally abusive to the patient and her mother. Which defense mechanism best describes the patient’s behavior?\n\n【19】AUndoingBSplitting\n\n【20】C.Isolation of affect\n\n【21】D. Idealization\n\n【22】F.Displacement\n\n【23】50.5 A 44-year old woman presents to your clinic for anxiety during social func-tions at her office. As a manager， she is expected to attend these events. You learn that her anxiety occurs only in social situations outside her small circle of friends. She tells you， \"People keep looking at me because I’m not worthy of my role. She does not have discrete panic attacks， and her anxiety does not occur at other times. What is the best treatment for this patient?\n\n【24】APrescribe an SSRIBPrescribe a benzodiazepine to take before attending social events\n\n【25】C.Psychodynamic psychotherapy\n\n【26】D. Exposure therapy\n\n【27】E.Prescribe a beta-blocker to take before attending social events\n\n【28】50.1 B. The goal of cognitive behavioral psychotherapy in such cases is to help patients critically examine if their assumptions about themselves and other people are correct. Telling the patient that he should\"suck it up\" (answer A) or that he is not ready for his current job (answer E) is unhelpful. Because the job he has taken is (hopefully) for the long term， medicating the patient with a benzodiazepine (answer D) or beta-blocker (answer C) would not be a first-choice therapy.\n\n【29】50.2 A. Answer A is most consistent with avoidant personality disorder. The patient has some close relationships and seems to desire more but does not feel that he can maintain such relationships. They often feel that they will not be welcome in social situations. Thus， the phrase\"I'm afraid people dont want me around\"if very classic for avoidant personality disorder. Answer B is more consistent with social phobia. Answer C is grossly paranoid， consistent with a psychotic disorder. Answer D is highly suggestive of schizoid personal-ity disorder， as the patient has a close relationship with his parent but has no interest in other human contact. Answer E suggests dependent personality disorder， because of asking for reassurance\"What do you think?”\n\n【30】50.3 C. Patients with avoidant personality disorder would desperately like to have social relationships， but they are afraid of criticism and/or rejection. Answer A (Patients with avoidant personality disorders have fewer friends than those with schizoid personality disorders) is not correct since those with schizoid personality disorder are usually socially isolated. Answer B (Patients with avoidant personality disorders have higher self-esteem than those with schizoid personality disorders) is incorrect since those with avoidant personality disor-ders have low self-esteem. Patients with avoidant personality disorders tend to be very sensitive to criticism (answer D) and have anxiety (answer E). In contrast， those with schizoid personality disorder choose not to have close relationships， choose solitary activities， and lack close friends； they tend to be indifferent to the praise or criticism of others and usually display a cold or flat-tened affect.\n\n【31】50.4 E. This patient can be theorized to be using displacement to assume that all men will act as punitively toward her as her father did. Displacement and projection are the two defense mechanisms most commonly utilized by patients with avoidant personality disorders. Undoing (answer A) is a defense mechanism in which a person tries to \"undo”an unhealthy thought or action by engaging in its opposite. Splitting (answer B) is a defense mechanism (frequently used by those with borderline personality disorder) in which the person literally \"splits\" apart the positive and negative quali-ties of the self and others. For example， an individual is either all bad or all good， but never an integrated whole of both good and bad. Isolation of affect(answer C) is a defense mechanism involving the creation of a gap between an unpleasant or threatening cognition and other thoughts and feelings. Ide-alization (answer D) is the defense mechanism in which a person attributes exaggeratedly positive qualities to self or others.\n\n【32】50.5 C. Psychodynamic psychotherapy is beneficial in patients with avoidant per-sonality disorder to build trust and help the patient develop a more accu-rate awareness of self. A key element of treatment includes creating safety in the therapeutic relationship. Because her anxiety does not occur when she is alone or with her close， trusted friends， she does not have an anxiety dis-order that would warrant treatment with an SSRI (answer A). A benzodi-azepine (answer B) should be avoided， given its high potential for addiction and abuse. Exposure therapy (answer D) is too confrontational and would likely cause the patient to discontinue therapy. A beta-blocker (answer E) before these social functions may be beneficial if psychotherapy is insufficient in managing her symptoms， though it would not be a first-line treatment.\n\n【33】CLINICALPEARLS\n\n【34】Patients with avoidant personality disorder have a pervasive hypersensi-tivity to criticism and rejection. They avoid interpersonal relationships in every setting because they fear criticism and rejection. Their self-esteem is low， and they usually believe that they are inferior or inadequate，espe-cially in the social arena.\n\n【35】Patients with avoidant personality disorder are differentiated from those with schizoid personality disorder by the fact that they desperately would like interpersonal relationships but are afraid of them. Individuals with schizoid personality disorders do not have relationships but do not miss them.\n\n【36】Patients with avoidant personality disorder are differentiated from those with dependent personality disorder by the fact that the former are afraid of rejection and criticism in relationships. Patients with dependent personality disorder are afraid of being left alone to fend for themselves.\n\n【37】Clinicians need to be tactful，encouraging， and accepting of patients with avoidant personality disorder， especially regarding their fear of rejection. Confrontation and coercion are not appropriate， as they can drive the patient away.\n\n【38】Defense mechanisms used by patients with avoidant personality disor-der include displacement and projection.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Following introduction of the meningococcal C conjugate vaccination in 1999, there was  删除换行1 a marked fall in disease caused by serogroup C strains.

This 84-year-old woman with poorly compensated CHF has asymptom-atic stenosis shown on duplex to correspond to 50% to75% stenosis of the right carotid artery. The margin of benefit in an asymptomatic patient is smaller than the margin for a symptomatic patient. Given the fact that her CHF has been refractory to medical management， further medical therapy may not improve her operative risks for CEA.

The patient described in“A”is asymptomatic with 55% stenosis of the left carotid artery. The degree of stenosis is below the 60% studied in the ACAS trial.

She subsequently develops a postpartum hemorrhage  删除换行1 and informs the doctors of her refusal to receive blood products, if they are needed in treatment, because she is a Jehovah’s Witness.\n\n【2】Joshua, age 15, sustained multiple injuries in a car accident. He refuses blood products  删除换行1 because he is a devout Jehovah’s Witness.\n\n【3】A newborn baby has been diagnosed with a serious heart condition requiring surgery. His  删除换行1 parents consent to him undergoing the cardiac surgery, but because of their religious beliefs  删除换行1 they cannot consent to him receiving blood during the course of that surgery or subsequently,  删除换行1 if it is needed.\nA 27-year-old devout Jehovah’s Witness, Gemma, is attacked whilst walking home from  删除换行1 work. A passer-by calls an ambulance and she is rushed to A&E, where she is found to have a  删除换行1 ruptured spleen. She is unconscious but she is carrying a document that informs doctors that  删除换行1 she does not wish to receive a blood transfusion even if the outcome would be death. When  删除换行5 Gemma’s husband arrives, he informs the doctors that her wishes have not changed since  删除换行1 signing the document.\n\n【4】Questions\n\n【5】• What is the religious constraint on Jehovah’s Witnesses refusing blood products?\n\n【6】• Is a refusal respected in all situations?\n\n【7】ANSWER 90\n\n【8】Jehovah’s Witnesses obey the Biblical injunction to abstain from blood (Acts 15:29). As a  删除换行1 result of their beliefs they may refuse the administration of whole blood and primary blood  删除换行1 components (red blood cells, white cells, plasma and platelets). However, individual beliefs  删除换行1 vary and some may accept blood salvage techniques and the use of minor blood fractions.\nThe Jehovah’s Witness Hospital Liaison Committee can be contacted to provide information  删除换行1 about practises and beliefs.\n\n【9】As a competent adult, Zoe’s refusal to accept a blood transfusion must be respected.\n\n【10】A refusal by a teenager of life-sustaining treatment, even if competent to make that decision,  删除换行1 may be overruled to preserve his life and thus his future autonomy. This may be so even if the  删除换行1 refusal is for religious reasons.\n\n【11】Although his parents may have understandable objections on religious grounds, surgery is  删除换行1 clearly in the baby’s best interests and as it is inevitable that he must receive blood transfusions during the course of or subsequent to the surgery it would be lawful for the baby to be  删除换行1 given blood products. The welfare of the child is paramount. However, in a situation which  删除换行1 is not imminently life-threatening, doctors should consult with parents and consider if it is  删除换行1 appropriate to use alternative forms of management.\nGemma was unconscious on arrival at hospital. As a practising Jehovah’s Witness she is carrying an Advance Decision Document prohibiting blood transfusion. The Mental Capacity  删除换行5 Act Code of Practice provides that an advance decision (AD) refusing all treatment in any  删除换行1 situation, for example with an explanation of her personal or religious beliefs, may be valid  删除换行1 and applicable (paragraph 9.13).\n\n【12】The lack of advance dialogue with Gemma about whether she really understands the nature  删除换行1 and effect of her AD is a concern. It would be easy to err on the side of caution and treat in her  删除换行1 medical best interests irrespective of her AD. This is legally and ethically problematic; treating in the face of a valid and applicable advance refusal may be subject to a claim of battery.\n\n【13】There is protection from liability if a healthcare professional provides treatment when they  删除换行1 were unaware of an advance decision. If somebody tells a healthcare professional that the  删除换行1 patient has made an AD, reasonable efforts should be made to find out what it says. Healthcare  删除换行1 professionals should not delay emergency treatment to look for an AD if there is no clear  删除换行1 indication that one exists. If no such document is found on an unconscious person, they  删除换行1 should be treated in their best interests.\n\n【14】Key Points\n\n【15】• A refusal of blood products by a competent adult is respected.\n\n【16】• It is in the best interests of babies and young children to receive blood products which are necessary as part of the treatment, irrespective of their parents’  删除换行1 religious views.\n\n【17】• Blood products may be refused in an advance decision and it is the responsibility  删除换行1 of the person who is in charge of the care of the patient when treatment is required  删除换行1 to determine whether a valid and applicable advance decision exists.删除个例：<u>Faith, Values and Culture</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

There, computed tomography (CT) of his head revealed a large (> 100 cm <sup>3 </sup> ) intracerebral hemorrhage, extending into the lateral ventricles and associated with hydrocephalus. An external ventricular drain (EVD) was placed, and he was found to have elevated intracerebral pressure (ICP). Over the first 48 hours, the patient’s ICP was difficult to control. After 6 days the patient remained in a coma and dependent on a ventilator, but with some brainstem reflexes (eg, gag reflex, blink reflex) intact. All of the caregivers involved, including the patient’s wife, who is his legally designated health care proxy, recognized that there was no meaningful chance for a good neurologic outcome. A decision is made by all involved to stop the patient’s ventilator, intravenous fluids, and medications, understanding that he would die shortly thereafter. The patient’s wife then asks about organ donation, observing that the patient had long expressed an interest in organ donation and was registered with the Department of Motor Vehicles as an organ donor.\n\n【3】 Is it ethically and morally permissible to discontinue this patient’s life support, knowing that he will die as a result? If so, how should such a decision be made?\n\n【4】 Would the analysis be different if the patient did not need a ventilator but only was receiving tube feedings?\n\n【5】 Would the analysis be different if the patient was in a coma and lacked all brainstem reflexes, including the drive to breathe?\n\n【6】 Can this patient be an organ donor?\n\n【7】### APPROACH TO:\n\n【8】#### Discontinuing Life Support\n\n【9】### DEFINITIONS\n\n【10】ADVANCE DIRECTIVES : Instructions that a formerly competent patient left regarding his or her medical care in the event he or she was to become incompetent. Examples include living wills, designating a health care proxy, or even conversations with family, friends, or health care professionals.\n\n【11】BEST INTEREST STANDARD : This is used to supplement advance directives or substituted judgment in decision-making for an incompetent patient. Under this standard, decision-makers try to estimate what is in the patient’s best interests, all things considered.\n\n【12】SUBSTITUTED JUDGMENT : This is when a health care proxy attempts to make the decision that the patient would have made, based on knowledge of his or her values, preferences, and approach to decision-making. Only surrogates who knew the patient prior to losing his or her capacity can exercise substituted judgment.\n\n【13】### CLINICAL APPROACH\n\n【14】When making important decisions for an incompetent patient, clinicians must understand the various standards for making decisions and their ethical priority. When decisions are difficult or contentious, clinicians should consult widely, most importantly with ethics consultants, to help with decisions and to provide an independent check of their thinking. When a decision to withhold or withdraw LST is being considered, then clinicians must also understand ethical and moral norms regarding LST. In the discussion below, standards for decision-making and moral norms about LST are discussed in detail.\n\n【15】### DISCUSSION\n\n【16】##### Is it ethically and morally permissible to discontinue this patient’s life support knowing that he will die as a result?\n\n【17】Yes. Properly selected or designated health care proxies can withhold or withdraw LSTs on behalf of an incapacitated patient. This conclusion is widely accepted in the practice of medicine, biomedical ethics, and in the law, and can be defended fairly straightforwardly by recognizing following two principles:\n\n【18】1\\. Competent informed patients have the right to refuse any medical interventions, life-sustaining or not, even if it would result in their death coming sooner than it otherwise would.\n\n【19】2\\. Incompetent patients do not lose this right (but it must be exercised by others on their behalf).\n\n【20】These two principles are generally quite uncontroversial. The first is recognition of the competent patient’s right to self-determination (also expressed as respect for the patient’s autonomy). The second reflects recognition that patients without decision-making capacity should have access to all the options that competent patients would have, including the right to refuse LST. This reflects a deep respect for the rights of disabled or incompetent patients.\n\n【21】The tricky part is exercising the right to refuse LST on behalf of an incapacitated patient. There are some decision-making standards that should be applied in such situations. The following standards are arranged in a rough order of priority, from highest to lowest. When a higher-priority standard is unavailable, decision-makers must rely on a lower-priority standard.\n\n【22】1\\. The patient’s previously expressed wishes (advance directives) : This could be in the form of a specific document that details what should be done in certain medical situations (eg, a living will), or it could simply be knowledge of pertinent prior conversations with physicians, family, or friends.\n\n【23】2\\. The substituted judgment standard : Substituted judgment occurs when family or friends who knew the patient attempt to make the decision that the patient would have made, based on their knowledge of his or her values, preferences, and approach to decision-making. Only persons who knew the patient before he or she lost decision-making capacity are in a position to exercise substituted judgment. Physicians cannot exercise substituted judgment on behalf of a patient they did not know previously. There is a rough order of priority when it comes to deciding who is in the best position to exercise substituted judgment. The order can vary somewhat from state to state, and not every state specifies an order in statutes. But in case law or in statutes, most states respect something like the following priorities, listed from highest to lowest:\n\n【24】a. Anyone that the patient previously designated as a decision-maker. This is usually done officially by way of assigning someone durable power of attorney for health care, or in some states executing a health care proxy that assigns a decision-making agent. When the patient did not previously designate someone, the remaining persons in this list are generally involved.\n\n【25】b. Spouse\n\n【26】c. Adult children\n\n【27】d. Parents\n\n【28】e. Siblings\n\n【29】f. Extended family members\n\n【30】g. Acquaintances\n\n【31】3\\. Best interests standard : Under this standard, decision-makers who do not know the patient’s prior values or priorities try to make a decision about what would be best for this patient, all things considered. This standard is applied for patients who have never had capacity (children or the cognitively disabled), or when no one is available who knows the patient well enough to exercise substituted judgement on his or her behalf.\n\n【32】In the case described above, we are unaware of any advance directives that apply to this situation. The patient did designate his wife as his health care proxy, which reassures us that he made the conscious decision that his wife would be the best individual to exercise substituted judgment on his behalf. This patient’s wife has to exercise substituted judgment on her husband’s behalf.\n\n【33】Physicians and other medical professionals can help her by describing her role (eg, “Your job is to help us make the decision that your husband would have made”) and by helping her to explore her husband’s preferences and values through discussion and questioning. For example, clinicians might say things like, “Help us understand your husband as a person. What did he value most in life? How did he feel about medical care? About disability? About being dependent on others?” Such a conversation achieves several important goals. First, it helps clinicians better understand their patient as an individual. It also signals to family and friends that clinicians care about the patient as an individual, which can be very helpful in establishing trust that clinicians have the patient’s interests firmly in mind. It helps focus the surrogate on the right questions—for example, “Would my husband want to be kept alive with LST, given the prognosis?”—rather than focusing on minutiae—for example, “How difficult or painful is the procedure for placing a gastrostomy tube?”—that only distract from the important questions.\n\n【34】After such a conversation, it is perfectly permissible for clinicians to make a specific recommendation if it seems clear what the patient would have wanted. For example, if the conversation revealed that the patient was someone who highly valued his personal bodily integrity, his independence, and intellectual and interpersonal pursuits, it might be clear that he would not want to continue LST. If so, it would be reasonable for a clinician to say something like, “Based on our discussions, it sounds to me like your husband would not want to continue LST. I think what we should do is change the focus of our care to simply make him comfortable, and we should stop the things we’re doing that are only prolonging his life, like the ventilator. Does this sound to you like a decision he would have made?”\n\n【35】Contrast this with an impersonal approach, employed all too commonly, in which clinicians simply describe the medical situation and the prognosis, and then ask the surrogate, “What do you want us to do?” This approach has one (somewhat dubious) advantage, which is that it allows clinicians to feel like they are “off the hook” in terms of moral responsibility for withdrawing or withholding LST, and it doesn’t require a sometimes emotionally challenging conversation about the patient as an individual. It has major disadvantages, however. It can signal to surrogates that the clinician is indifferent to the outcome (“We’ll do whatever you tell us to do”). It fails to remind the surrogate that her job is to make the decision that the patient would have made, rather than the decision that she prefers. Perhaps most importantly, it places all of the decision-making burden on surrogates, which can make it psychologically impossible for some to authorize the withdrawal of LST, even when it may be clear to all that the patient would have wanted it.\n\n【36】##### Would the analysis be different if the patient did not need a ventilator but only tube feedings?\n\n【37】Imagine that the patient was breathing adequately on his own but remained unconscious or minimally conscious, such that he could not be fed safely and adequately by mouth. In this situation, the only LST required by the patient is tube feedings (initially through a nasogastric tube, or later through a gastrostomy). Are surrogates permitted to withhold tube feedings on behalf of an incapacitated patient? Tube feedings (including water for hydration) are sometimes called artificial hydration and nutrition (AHN), or medically administered hydration and nutrition (MHN).\n\n【38】Again, the answer is yes. It is now well established in Western law, ethics, and the medical profession that AHN is no different than any other life-prolonging medical therapy. Competent patients have the right to refuse AHN even if would mean that they will die, just as they have a right to refuse ventilator support or any other medical intervention. Because respect for the incompetent patient requires that he or she has the same right, exercised through a surrogate, the wife in this case has the right to refuse AHN on her husband’s behalf.\n\n【39】##### Would the analysis be different if the patient was in a coma and lacked all brainstem reflexes, including the drive to breathe?\n\n【40】Patients who have experienced an irreversible whole-brain injury that eliminates consciousness and all the brainstem reflexes, including the drive to breathe, can and should be pronounced dead on the basis of brain death criteria. In all the states of the United States and in most developed Western nations, death can be diagnosed in two ways. The first is using cardiorespiratory criteria. Perhaps obviously, a patient who has irreversibly lost the ability to circulate blood and/or exchange gases through respiration is dead. The second is by way of brain death criteria. There are formal procedures for pronouncing death by brain criteria. The brain injury must be irreversible. There must be no reversible conditions that could mimic brain death (eg, drugs, hypothermia, neuromuscular conditions producing paralysis). The patient must be comatose—having no signs of interaction with the external or internal environment. All brainstem reflexes must be absent. Finally, the drive to breathe, mediated by the lower brainstem, must be absent, as determined through an apnea test. Once these criteria are satisfied, then the patient is pronounced brain dead.\n\n【41】If the patient in this case were brain dead, then this would no longer be a case involving end-of-life decision-making, because no decisions remain, apart from the timing of discontinuing the ventilator and other medical interventions. Physicians are under no legal or moral obligation to continue LST for patients pronounced dead, because no therapy can sustain life in these circumstances. It should be noted that in two US states (New Jersey and New York), limited exceptions exist for families who do not accept the concept of brain death on religious grounds.\n\n【42】Naturally, after pronouncing death by brain death criteria, obligations to the family do not cease. Physicians are obliged to explain brain death carefully and sensitively. It is permissible to continue LST for a brief period even after brain death has been declared to allow families to understand the situation and say their last goodbyes. Pronouncing death by brain death criteria has implications for organ donation as well. This is discussed further in the following section.\n\n【43】##### Can this patient be an organ donor?\n\n【44】If the patient in the case were brain dead, then he could potentially donate all of his vital organs, including his heart and lungs. This is possible because brain-dead donors can serve as so-called beating heart donors. They may have their vital organs (eg, whole liver, pancreas, both kidneys, and portions of the gastrointestinal tract) removed even while circulation and respiration continue. This does not violate the dead donor rule (DDR), which states that patients must not be killed by the process of organ donation, because persons pronounced brain dead are already dead before the process of organ retrieval begins.\n\n【45】The patient in the original case is not brain dead. Although he is comatose, he still has some brainstem reflexes. Therefore, it would violate the DDR to retrieve his vital organs while his heart is still beating. However, he might be a candidate for DCD. In other words, after his LST has been discontinued, and after he is pronounced dead on the basis of cardiorespiratory criteria, it might be possible to procure some of his vital organs. In our case, DCD would play out roughly as follows:\n\n【46】1\\. The patient’s wife and clinicians agree that the patient would want to withdraw LST.\n\n【47】2\\. Representatives of the organ donation system (not the clinical team) would discuss the possibility of DCD.\n\n【48】3\\. If a decision is made to pursue DCD, then the ventilator is discontinued while the patient is monitored for evidence of death by cardiorespiratory criteria.\n\n【49】4\\. If death (absence of circulation and respiration) occurs within approximately 60 minutes, organ procurement can begin.\n\n【50】DCD necessarily involves a period of hypoperfusion of the organs, which has two important consequences. First, DCD can only be performed for donors who are on ventilator support, because death by cardiorespiratory criteria must happen within 60 minutes (some institutions have a slightly longer limit, up to 90 minutes). Patients on tube feedings alone cannot donate using DCD protocols, because they will usually take days to die after tube feedings are discontinued, which would render their organs unsuitable for donation. The second consequence of the period of hypoperfusion is that the heart and lungs cannot generally be donated, and the organs that are donated have a slightly lower chance of graft survival in the recipient.\n\n【51】For some patients who die too slowly for DCD, tissue donation may still be possible. Tissues that can be donated may include bone, heart valves, veins, skin, ligaments, and tendons.\n\n【52】###", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

This answer choice can be definitively ruled out, because Alzheimer disease is not associated with Lewy bodies.  \nAnswer B is incorrect . The pathology described in this answer choice is consistent with Wilson disease, an autosomal recessive defect in copper transport that leads to the accumulation of copper in tissues. Wilson disease can be associated with parkinsonian symptoms, as well as chorea, psychiatric symptoms, liver disease, and the characteristic Kayser-Fleischer ring. Although some aspects of this answer choice are possible, this patient’s symptoms are most consistent with Parkinson disease. Furthermore, Wilson disease is not associated with Lewy bodies.  \nAnswer C is incorrect . This answer choice describes the pathologic process associated with Huntington disease, an autosomal dominant disease caused by a trinucleotide repeat on chromosome 4. Huntington disease is commonly associated with chorea, athetosis, and changes in personality. This disease generally presents in the third to fifth decades and is not associated with Lewy bodies.  \nAnswer E is incorrect . This answer choice is likely referring to metastatic melanoma of the brain. This choice may be appealing because of the pigmentation of the histology shown in the image. Ultimately, though, Lewy bodies are seen only in Parkinson disease and Lewy body dementia.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

She is no longer completely paralyzed.\n\n【10】48.3. A 35-year-old type 1 diabetic male undergoes an open carpal tunnel release with an axillary nerve block. The patient received 2 mg of midazolam for sedation prior to the block， but no additional medica-tions in the operating room. He was alert after the midazolam and early in the case， but near the end of the case， he is somnolent and dif-ficult to arouse. Which of the following is the most appropriate treat-ment!\n\n【11】A. Physostigmine\n\n【12】B. Naloxone\n\n【13】C. Dextrose\n\n【14】D. Midazolam\n\n【15】48.4.

Excessive administration of opiates\n\n【19】D. Residual effects of inhalation anesthetics\n\n【20】ANSWERS\n\n【21】48.1. A. This patient has received an overdose of his opiate pain medica-tion. Naloxone will reverse these effects. Most likely， this patient will require a naloxone infusion until dilaudid is metabolized. Flumazenil is a benzodiazepine antagonist. Neostigmine is an acetyl cholinesterase inhibitor. Glycopyrrolate is an anticholinergic.\n\n【22】48.2. D. This patient has no signs of prolonged paralysis following suc-cinylcholine administration. For this reason， she should have normal pseudocholinesterase enzymes in both quantity and activity. Since all her twitches have returned to normal， she is no longer completely paralyzed. Since the dibucaine number represents the percent of the enzyme's activity， a normal number would be ≥70.\n\n【23】48.3. C. This patient is likely hypoglycemic and requires dextrose. Use a glucometer to check the blood glucose level. This patient had a peripheral nerve block and had intraoperative medications. Since no muscle relaxant was given， physostigmine would be an inappropriate choice. For much the same reason， opiate was not administered thus eliminatLi1nng the need for naloxone. Midazolam is a benzodiazepine and would be of no benefit in this situation.\n\n【24】48.4. C. While each of the choices is theoretically a possible etiology for the delayed emergence described at the beginning of the case， the most likely cause is an excessive administration of opiates. Opiates reduce the ventilatory response to CO。 an effect that is synergistic with the residual effects of any inhalation anesthetics which may not have been eliminated. Hypoglycemia is less likely insofar as the patient is not a diabetic， although it has been observed in young， fasting women undergoing surgery late in the afternoon. Pseudocholinesterase deficiency is also a possibility， especially if this patient never had sur-gery before. However， the incidence of cholinesterase deficiency is much less frequent than somnolence caused by opiates and retained anesthetic agents.\n\n【25】Clinical Pearls\n\n【26】Patients may have comorbidities or physical conditions such as normal pregnancy that make them susceptible to prolonged effects from com-mon anesthetic medications.\n\n【27】Be methodical when evaluating the patient with delayed emergence. Consider their age， medical history， and the intraoperative record includ-ing medications given when developing a differential.\n\n【28】Monitors such as vital signs， the physical examination， a Train-of-Four stim-ulus， capnograph， monitor of anesthetic depth， imaging， and laboratory tests should be available to you to help guide your diagnosis.\n\n【29】If an opiate is reversed with naloxone， remember that the opiate's half-life may exceed naloxone's，and that redosing the naloxone may be necessary.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

This separation is a helpful clue for pathologists when making the diagnosis, as oftentimes these two can be difficult to differentiate. Immunohistochemical studies demonstrate that cutaneous ACC stains positively for S-100, epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), and is occasionally positive for carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 – 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【28】Discussion\n----------\n\n【29】Adenocystic or adenoid cystic carcinoma is a rare, aggressive carcinoma. There are approximately fifty cases published in the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. It typically arises from the major or minor salivary glands but may also arise primarily from an extra-salivary gland site like the skin, external auditory canal, respiratory tract, esophagus, breast or prostate 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【30】Primary cutaneous ACC presents clinically as a firm, slow-growing nodule or tumor with poorly defined borders. Although usually asymptomatic, some patients may complain of pruritus, tenderness, or alopecia. The average age of those affected by cutaneous ACC is 59 with 57 % of cases involving male patients. Approximately 41 % of cutaneous ACC occurs on the scalp. Other areas commonly affected include the chest, abdomen, back, eyelids, and perineum 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【31】Salivary ACC is more aggressive than cutaneous SCC with greater rates of local destruction, recurrence and late metastasis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. The lungs and lymph nodes are the primary sites of metastasis. Although cutaneous SCC is more indolent than salivary ACC, it does have a high incidence of local recurrence. One study with an average follow up time of 58 months calculated the local recurrence rate to be 44 % after wide excisional surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Another study calculated the recurrence rate to be 50 % 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Some authors argue that this high recurrence rate is a consequence of the carcinoma’s tendency of discontinuous perineural invasion or “skip areas” that lead to high rates of false negative reports upon histological examination 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 7 \\]</u>. In one study, approximately 76 % of the cases demonstrated perineural invasion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. For this reason, some authors believe that Mohs micrographic surgery is a better treatment option than the customary wide local excision with histologically clear margins.\n\n【32】As mentioned, treatment for cutaneous ACC has traditionally consisted of wide local surgical excisions with histologically proven negative margins. While some authors debate the benefit of Mohs micrographic surgery, all agree that patients diagnosed with cutaneous ACC must have life-long follow up for possible recurrence later on. One study described a recurrence of cutaneous ACC 35 years after initial treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Furthermore, once a patient has been diagnosed with cutaneous ACC, it is recommended that a work up be performed to rule out the possibility of metastatic primary salivary gland ACC. This can be done with a thorough physical exam as well as CT imaging of the head and neck, chest and abdomen.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Long-time diabetes in this patient most likely caused a neurogenic bladder. Overfilling of the bladder could have caused vesicoureteral reflux to the kidneys. Renal damage results when a bacterial urinary tract infection is superimposed on the reflux. Chronic pyelonephritis results in a kidney that grossly shows blunting and thickened dilation of the calyces and uneven scarring. The condition may happen unilaterally if due to some congenital anatomic abnormality. In the image above, there is a staghorn calculus filling calyces of kidney with chronic pyelonephritis; the cortex and medulla is atrophie and the calyces are dilated. Staghorn calculi (struvite stones) can be seen in association with chronic infection and are classically associated with urease producing organisms such as proteus species. The classic diagnostic clue for a struvite stone is alkaline urine.  \nAnswer A is incorrect . While diabetic patients are susceptible to acute pyelonephritis from increased instrumentation and neurogenic bladder, the kidney shown in the image is not characteristic of acute pyelonephritis. In the acute condition, the kidney surface is frequently studded with microabscesses, indicating a recent infection.  \nAnswer C is incorrect . There is nothing in this patient’s history to indicate acute tubulointerstitial nephritis. Acute tubulointerstitial nephritis is often caused by hypersensitivity to a drug (eg, methicillin, rifampin, thiazide diuretics, and NSAIDs). It is characterized by fever, rash, eosinophilia, and renal anomalies (hematuria, increased serum creatinine, and oliguria).  \nAnswer D is incorrect . While hypertension may be a sign of the chronic renal failure being caused by chronic pyelonephritis, hypertension alone would not cause the pathology shown in the image.  \nAnswer E is incorrect .

Darier’s sign describes the development of a wheal and surrounding  删除换行1 erythema in a lesion after rubbing (physical degranulation of histamine from mast cells).\nMastocytosis is the abnormal accumulation of mast cells within the skin and rarely other  删除换行1 organs (liver, spleen or lymph nodes). The differential diagnosis would include lentigines  删除换行1 or melanocytic naevi (if Darier’s sign negative) or xanthogranuloma, histiocytosis X or  删除换行1 generalized eruptive histiocytoma (if the lesions were raised or indurated).\n\n【28】All forms of mastocytosis in children have a good prognosis and systemic involvement is  删除换行1 rare. The majority of cases resolve spontaneously. In adults, however, systemic involvement may be aggressive or even represent a mast cell leukaemia. Symptoms of systemic  删除换行1 involvement or of acute degranulation of widespread cutaneous disease include flushing,  删除换行1 diarrhoea, nausea/vomiting, abdominal cramps and wheeze. Adults may also complain of  删除换行1 syncope, angina, headaches and bone pain.\nAlthough this young patient has no symptoms of systemic disease, basic investigations  删除换行1 would be justified including particularly full blood count, serum tryptase and liver function tests. A skin biopsy can be performed if there is diagnostic doubt. Mast cell infiltrates  删除换行1 can be difficult to identify by routine haematoxylin & eosin staining, and special stains  删除换行1 such as Giemsa or toluidine blue, which demonstrate metaochromatic staining of mast  删除换行1 cells, are required. For patients with rapidly progressive disease and abnormalities of the  删除换行1 above investigations, further testing such as bone marrow aspirate and biopsy under the  删除换行1 supervision of the haematology department may be indicated. Demonstration of activating mutations of the c-kit proto-oncogene would help tailor therapy in aggressive or  删除换行1 leukaemic disease (e.g. imatinib).\n\n【29】As the skin lesions are likely to resolve spontaneously by the boy’s 10th birthday, no  删除换行1 treatment is indicated. For patients with skin symptoms antihistamines (H1-blocker) may  删除换行1 be helpful. Moderate sunlight exposure can hasten the resolution of diffuse lesions and  删除换行1 psoralen–UVA can be offered to adults/older children. Patients with numerous lesions or  删除换行1 diffuse disease should avoid mast cell degranulating agents such as non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs, opiates, alcohol, caffeine, radiological contrast media and abrupt  删除换行1 physical degranulation such as a hot bath or other acute temperature change, vigorous  删除换行1 rubbing (e.g. after a bath or by tight clothing). Exposure to degranulating agents or to  删除换行1 allergens (such as hymenoptera stings) can potentially provoke anaphylaxis.\n\n【30】 KEY POINTS\n\n【31】• Urticaria pigmentosa is characterized by mast cell proliferation and accumulation  删除换行1 within the skin.\n\n【32】• When a urticaria pigmentosa or mastocytoma lesion is stroked, it typically urticates,  删除换行1 becoming pruritic, oedematous and erythematous. This change is referred to as Darier’s  删除换行1 sign.\n\n【33】• Most patients with urticaria pigmentosa exhibit onset before age 2 years. The disease is  删除换行1 associated with an excellent prognosis, often with resolution by puberty. The number of  删除换行1 lesions diminishes by approximately 10 per cent a year.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Varicella is a common childhood illness, characterized by fever, viremia, and scattered vesicular lesions of the skin. After the primary infection, the virus lies dormant in the nerves, including the cranial nerve ganglia, dorsal root ganglia, and autonomic ganglia. Herpes zoster is the result of reactivation of latent VZV. The disease most frequently occurs in older adults. It presents as painful, unilateral dermatomal, vesicular lesions on the erythematous background that do not cross the midline 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Crusts can be also presented. The most common locations are the thoracic nerves and the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve with possible eye involvement (keratitis, scarring, and vision loss). The major complication of herpes zoster is an post-herpetic neuralgia, defined as a pain persisting for more than 90 days after the resolution of the skin lesions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. The diagnosis on herpes zoster is established based on the clinical picture. Polymerase chain reaction, direct fluorescent antigen testing or viral culture are rarely performed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Antiviral drugs (acyclovir, famciclovir, and valacyclovir) should be considered for all patients with herpes zoster and they are especially recommended for patients older than 50 years, those who have a moderate or severe pain or rash, and those with involvement of non-truncal dermatomes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【21】Differential diagnoses for the presented patient included herpes gladiatorum, contact dermatitis and basal cell carcinoma.\n\n【22】Herpes gladiatorum is a skin infection caused by herpes simplex virus type 1. The disease is spread through direct skin-to-skin contact, thus it is more commonly observed in individuals who play sport with the close contact 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Clinically, herpes gladiatorum is characterized by the presence of cluster or clusters of clear, fluid-filled vesicles with surrounding erythema. Each body area can be affected. Pain may be reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. The lesions can be multiple and are not limited to one dermatome. Fever and enlarged lymph nodes are rarely reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【23】Contact dermatitis is an inflammatory eczematous skin disease. The disease is rarely presented on the scalp area, because of the great thickness of the epidermis in this region. In the case of application of irritants or allergens on the scalp symptoms are usually observed on the face or neck. Clinically, contact dermatitis presents as an erythema with scaling and coexisted itch 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. In acute disease, vesicles or pustules may be presented 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【24】Basal cell carcinoma is the most common skin malignancy. The incidence rate of the disease increases with age. Basal cell carcinoma presents as a tiny, hardly visible papule, growing into a nodule or a plaque that is sometimes ulcerated. The face, scalp and neck are most commonly affected 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【25】In the presented patient, based on the clinical manifestation the diagnosis of herpes zoster involving ophthalmic branch (V1) of the trigeminal nerve was established. She was treated with 500 mg intravenous acyclovir three times daily per 10 days and oral paracetamol in order to reduce pain. A complete resolution of skin lesions was observed.\n\n【26】Key Points\n\n【27】   Herpes zoster is a viral skin infection that may affect the scalp area.\n   It is characterized by the presence of unilateral, dermatomal, painful vesicles and crusts with surrounding erythema.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

The clinical features of hypoglycaemia  删除换行1 are divided into either autonomic or neurologic symptoms. This presentation highlights the  删除换行1 neuroglycopaenic symptoms (e.g. blurred vision, amnesia, loss of consciousness) that occur as  删除换行1 a result of a deficient supply of glucose to the brain. The responses of glucagon and adrenaline  删除换行1 to a low-glucose state are responsible for the symptoms of autonomic hyper-reactivity, such as  删除换行1 sweating, tremor, nausea and palpitations.\nSymptomatic hypoglycaemia has several causes, which may be broadly classified as either  删除换行1 fasting or non-fasting. Non-fasting hypoglycaemia occurs after a meal; possible causes of  删除换行1 this include 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> gastrectomy or alimentary bypass surgery resulting in rapid gastric emptying, leading to overproduction of insulin; 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> pancreatic islet cell hyperplasia; and 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> occult  删除换行1 diabetes, which may produce late hypoglycaemia after a meal owing to the deficient early  删除换行1 response of insulin in diabetics, leading to exaggerated delayed release 4–5 hours afterwards.\nThe causes of fasting hypoglycaemia include: \n\n【13】1. Hyperinsulinaemic states \n\n【14】a.\t Insulin reaction or sulphonylurea overdose (the most common cause)\nb.\t Autoimmune hypoglycaemia \n\n【15】c.\t Surreptitious use of insulin or sulphonylureas \n\n【16】d.\t Pancreatic β-cell tumours (typically insulinoma)\n2. Non-hyperinsulinaemic states \n\n【17】a.\t Reduced hepatic gluconeogenesis, which may arise from liver disease or inborn  删除换行1 errors of metabolism \n\n【18】b.\t Renal insufficiency (the kidney contributes to gluconeogenesis too)\nc.\t Alcohol excess, which increases the activity of alcohol dehydrogenase (consuming NAD+) and thereby limits the conversion of lactate to pyruvate, which is a  删除换行1 gluconeogenic substrate \nd.\t Non-pancreatic tumours (e.g. retroperitoneal fibrosarcoma) that release  删除换行1 insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-2, which can activate the insulin receptor  删除换行5 This patient has fasting hypoglycaemia (a clue is the persistent drinking of Coca-Cola as a  删除换行1 subconscious defence against this), and the absence of other causes point towards a hyperinsulinaemic state as the cause. If we assume that the patient has not been using insulin or  删除换行1 other antidiabetic agents, the most important diagnosis to exclude is an insulinoma, which  删除换行1 is the most common cause of spontaneous, fasting hypoglycaemia in an otherwise healthy  删除换行1 individual.\nInsulinomas are benign tumours of pancreatic β-cells, with hypoglycaemia arising from  删除换行1 excess secretion of insulin. The key investigation for insulinoma is a supervised fast, the  删除换行1 premise of which is to elicit Whipple’s triad, which is required for diagnosis. Whipple’s triad  删除换行1 requires 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> symptoms to be associated with fasting or exercise, 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> confirmation of hypoglycaemia during these episodes and 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> reversal of symptoms on administering glucose. In this  删除换行1 case, all three criteria are met, and the inappropriately high levels of insulin at the end of  删除换行1 the fast (with a glucose level of 1.8 mM) confirm hyperinsulinism. The high C-peptide levels  删除换行1 confirm an endogenous rather than exogenous cause (C-peptide is the other product from  删除换行1 cleavage of pro-insulin and is released with insulin from β-cells). Case 8: A Young Woman Is Found Unconscious in Bed 21 \n\n【19】As the majority of insulinomas are single and benign, the treatment of choice is surgical  删除换行1 resection. Further investigations are needed for tumour localisation, including abdominal  删除换行1 ultrasound and CT; endoscopic ultrasound may be useful to identify pancreatic lesions. If  删除换行1 these are not fruitful, selective angiography of pancreatic vessels with calcium stimulation (to  删除换行1 cause vesicle release) and measurement of insulin levels in the hepatic vein may help locate  删除换行1 the tumour anatomically.\nWhile awaiting surgery, options to manage the hypoglycaemia include cornstarch infusion at  删除换行1 night (this releases glucose in a slow, sustained fashion) and diazoxide, a thiazide-type drug  删除换行1 that opens the KATP channel, leading to efflux of K+ from β-cells, which causes hyperpolarisation and reduced insulin release.\nThe finding of an insulinoma in a young patient should raise the possibility of an endocrine  删除换行1 syndrome, in particular multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1). This is an autosomal  删除换行1 dominant syndrome characterised by tumours in the pancreas, pituitary and parathyroids  删除换行1 (‘3Ps’) caused by germline mutations in the MEN1 gene. While insulinoma is generally not  删除换行1 a presenting feature of MEN1, the family history of ‘thyroid problems’ should serve to raise  删除换行1 notice about its relevance to this patient.\nKEY POINTS \n\n【20】• The symptoms of hypoglycaemia arise from neuroglycopenia and autonomic  删除换行1 hyper-reactivity.\n• The most common cause of fasting hypoglycaemia in an otherwise healthy person  删除换行1 is an insulinoma.\n• The diagnosis of insulinoma is made by fulfilling Whipple’s triad.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Ring occlusion test 删除25：<u></u>.— In  删除换行1 this test indirect hernia  删除换行1 will not bulge out.\n\n【23】CLINICAL FEATURES. -\n\n【24】(i) Age.— Inguinal hernia can occur at any age.\nIndirect inguinal hernia may occurt in children in the  删除换行1 first few months of life, but more common in the late  删除换行1 teens and young adults. A direct hernia is mostly seen in  删除换行1 older subjects.\n\n【25】(ii) Occupation.— Strenuous work is often  删除换行1 responsible for development of hernia. Heavy work,  删除换行1 especially lifting weights, puts a great strain on the  删除换行1 abdominal muscles. If there is an underlying weakness  删除换行1 already present, hernia may develop. The patient may be  删除换行1 able to relate the onset of the hernia to a particular event  删除换行2 e.g. lifting a heavy weight.\n\n【26】(i) PAIN.— The commonest symptom of hernia is  删除换行1 discomfort or pain. Patient complains of a dragging or  删除换行1 aching type of pain in the groin which gets worse as the  删除换行1 day passes. This is often noticed when there is a ‘tendency  删除换行1 to hernia’. So pain may appear long before the lump is  删除换行1 noticed. In case of indirect hernia patient often complains  删除换行1 of pain while performing heavy exercise or strenuous job  删除换行1 mostly in the groin or referred to the testis. Pain continues  删除换行1 so long as the hernia is progressing, but ceases when it is  删除换行1 fully formed. In well formed hernia, there is a sense of  删除换行1 heaviness or weight. Pull on the mesentery may cause  删除换行1 pain in the epigastric region. The patient may complain  删除换行1 of pain all over the abdomen due to drag on the mesentery  删除换行1 or omentum.\n\n【27】When the hernia becomes very painful and tender, it  删除换行1 is probably strangulated.\n\n【28】(ii) LUMP.— Many herniae may cause no pain 删除换行1 and he has noticed only a swelling in the groin. But this  删除换行1 is rare and some sort of discomfort is almost always  删除换行1 present.\n\n【29】(iii) SYSTEMIC SYMPTOMS.— If the hernia is  删除换行1 obstructing the lumen of the bowel (incarcerated hernia) 删除换行1 cardinal symptoms of intestinal obstruction will appear.\nThese are colicky abdominal pain, vomiting, abdominal  删除换行1 distension and absolute constipation. If the patient is  删除换行1 vomiting, note the character of the vomitus -— whether  删除换行1 bilious or faecal. Faecal smelling vomitus heralds ominous  删除换行1 sign.\n\n【30】(iv) OTHER COMPLAINTS.— The cause of  删除换行1 hernia must be enquired into. Persistent coughing of  删除换行1 whooping cough or chronic bronchitis, constipation,  删除换行1 dysuria due to benign enlargement of prostate or stricture  删除换行1 urethra are the symptoms which the patients deliberately  删除换行1 do not mention considering them to be irrelevant.\nLeading questions should be asked to find out these  删除换行1 symptoms.\n\n【31】(v) PAST HISTORY.— Whether the patient had  删除换行1 any operation or not ? During appendicectomy division  删除换行1 of subcostal or ilioingunial nerve may lead to weakness of  删除换行1 the abdominal muscles at the inguinal region. This may  删除换行1 cause subsequent direct inguinal hernia. Many patients  删除换行1 give previous history of hernia repair on the same side  删除换行1 (recurrent hernia) or on the opposite side (right sided  删除换行1 hernia generally precedes that of the left side).\n\n【32】The patient should be first  删除换行1 examined in the standing position and then in the supine  删除换行1 position. Majority of the herniae are better examined in  删除换行1 the standing position.\n\n【33】Two classical signs of an uncomplicated hernia are —\n\n【34】(i) Impulse on coughing and (ii) reducibility. Sometime  删除换行1 must be spent for inspection. Impulse on coughing can  删除换行1 be detected by inspection alone.\n\n【35】1. POSITION AND EXTENT.— If the swelling  删除换行1 descends into the scrotum or labia majora it is obviously  删除换行1 an inguinal hernia. When it is confined to the groin, it  删除换行1 should be differentiated from a femoral hernia. Two  删除换行1 anatomical structures are to be considered in this respect\n\n【36】— (a) the pubic tubercle and (b) the inguinal ligament.\nAn inguinal hernia is positioned above the inguinal  删除换行1 ligament and medial to the pubic tubercle, whereas a  删除换行1 femoral hernia lies below the inguinal ligament and lateral  删除换行1 to the pubic tubercle.\n\n【37】2. TO GET ABOVE THE SWELLING.— This 删除换行1 examination differentiates a scrotal swelling from an  删除换行1 inguinoscrotal swelling. The root of the scrotum is held  删除换行1 between the thumb in front and other fingers behind in  删除换行1 an attempt to reach above the swelling. In case of inguinal 删除换行1 hernia one cannot get above the swelling, whereas in case of  删除换行1 pure scrotal swelling e.g. vaginal hydrocele one can getHERNIA 201 删除换行1 above the swelling.\n\n【38】3. CONSISTENCY.— If the inguinal hernia contains  删除换行1 omentum (omentocele or epiplocele) the swelling feels  删除换行1 doughy and granular. If it contains intestine (enterocele) 删除换行1 it feels elastic. A strangulated hernia feels tense and tender.\n\n【39】4. IMPULSE ON COUGHING.— When there is no  删除换行1 swelling, a finger is placed on the superficial inguinal  删除换行1 ring and the patient is asked to cough. The root of the  删除换行1 scrotum can also be held between the index finger and  删除换行1 thumb and the patient is asked to cough. An expansile 删除换行1 impulse on coughing can be felt as the contents of the  删除换行1 hernia will be forced out through the superficial inguinal  删除换行1 ring and will separate the thumb from the index finger.\nWhen hernia is already present it becomes larger and more  删除换行1 tense on coughing. Impulse on coughing will be absent in 删除换行1 case of strangulated hernia, irreducible hernia and obstructed 删除换行1 hernia.\n\n【40】5. REDUCIBILITY.— The patient is first instructed  删除换行1 to lie down on the bed. In many instances the hernia  删除换行1 reduces itself when the patient lies down (direct hernia).\nThe patient himself can often reduce the hernia. In the  删除换行1 remaining cases only the surgeon can reduce the hernia.\nThe patient is asked to flex the thigh of the affected side,  删除换行1 to adduct and rotate it internally. This will not only relax  删除换行1 the pillars of the superficial ring but also the oblique  删除换行1 muscles of the abdomen. The fundus of the sac is gently  删除换行1 held with one hand and even pressure is applied to squeeze  删除换行1 the contents into the abdomen while the other hand will  删除换行1 guide the contents through the superficial inguinal ring.\nThis is known as ‘Taxis’.\n\n【41】6. INVAGINATION TEST.— After reduction of the 删除换行1 hernia one can perform this test to know the gap in the  删除换行1 superficial inguinal ring. Little finger should be used.\nInvaginate the skin from the bottom of the scrotum, the  删除换行1 little finger is gradually pushed up and then rotated to  删除换行1 enter the superficial inguinal ring. Normally the  删除换行1 superficial ring is a triangular slit which admits only the  删除换行1 tip of the little finger. When the patient coughs the  删除换行1 examining finger will be squeezed by the approximation  删除换行1 of the two pillars. A palpable impulse will confirm the 删除换行1 diagnosis. For convenience of the clinician one may use  删除换行1 the index finger, but utmost gentleness is expected.\n\n【42】7. RING OCCULUSION TEST.— The hernia must  删除换行1 be reduced first. A thumb is pressed on the deep inguinal  删除换行1 ring i.e. 1/2 inch above the mid-inguinal point. The  删除换行1 patient is asked to cough. A direct hernia will show a  删除换行1 bulge medial to the occluding finger but an indirect  删除换行1 hernia will not find access, so no bulge.\n\n【43】A HERNIA CAN BE CLASSIFIED INTO :\n\n【44】1. CONGENITAL — when a preformed sac was  删除换行1 present congenitally i.e. presence of partly or completely 删除换行1 unobliterated processus vaginalis.\n\n【45】2. ACQUIRED — when there was no preformed sac  删除换行1 and the sac has acquired later in life.\nA hernia is whether congenital or acquired can  删除换行1 sometimes be confirmed by the history alone. A  删除换行5 congenital hernia becomes complete within a short period  删除换行1 of its appearance. Whereas an acquired hernia progresses  删除换行1 gradually and usually fails to be complete.\n\n【46】All direct herniae are acquired. Many surgeons believe  删除换行1 that all indirect herniae are congenital. Though the sac  删除换行1 was present since birth, the hernia may not appear until  删除换行1 adult life. But other surgeons believe that some of the  删除换行1 indirect herniae are acquired.\n\n【47】According to the contents of the sac a hernia can beclassified into :\n\n【48】1. Enterocele — when the sac contains intestine.\n\n【49】2. Omentocele — when the sac contains omentum.\n\n【50】3. Entero-omentocele — when the sac contains both  删除换行1 intestine and omentum.\n\n【51】4. Cystocele — when a part of the urinary bladder  删除换行1 is inside the sac. This usually occurs in a direct hernia or  删除换行1 in sliding hernia. It is suspected when the patient gives  删除换行1 the history that the hernia gets enlarged just before  删除换行1 micturition and smaller after micturition. Moreover  删除换行1 pressure on this hernia induces a desire for micturition  删除换行1 particularly when it is distended.\n\n【52】COVERINGS OF THE SPERMATIC CORD.—\nOMENTOCELE ARE :\n\n【53】Enterocele\n\n【54】1. On inspection one may  删除换行1 see visible peristalsis in  删除换行1 this case.\n\n【55】2. Consistency of the  删除换行1 hernia is elastic.\n\n【56】3.

In such a hernia the  删除换行1 caecum on the right side, the pelvic colon on the left side  删除换行1 or the urinary bladder on either side may slide down.\nThere may be the usual contents in the sac. The  删除换行1 peculiarity is that the posterior wall of the hernial sac is  删除换行1 not formed by the peritoneum alone but by a viscus which  删除换行1 lies behind the peritoneum. It may occur with both direct  删除换行1 and indirect hernia.\n\n【69】This type of hernia is usually seen in older men.\nSliding hernia may be suspected when it reappears very  删除换行1 slowly after reduction. When a large globular hernia  删除换行1 descends into the scrotum this condition is suspected.\nThis condition may be associated with strangulated small  删除换行1 intestine within the sac or a strangulated large intestine  删除换行1 outside the sac.\n\n【70】2.

Approach to Reading\n\n【1】There are seven key questions that help to stimulate the application of basic science information to the clinical setting. These are:\n\n【2】1 . Which of the available medications is most likely to achieve the desired therapeutic effect and/or is responsible for the described symptoms or signs?\n\n【3】2 . What is the likely mechanism for the clinical effect(s) and adverse effect(s) of the medication?\n\n【4】3 . What is the basic pharmacologic profile (e.g. absorption, elimination) for medications in a certain class, and what are the differences among the agents within the class?\n\n【5】4 . Given basic pharmacologic definitions such as therapeutic index (TI) or certain safety factor (TD <sub>1 </sub> /ED <sub>99 </sub> ), or median lethal dose (LD <sub>50 </sub> ), how do medications compare in their safety profile?\n\n【6】5 . Given a particular clinical situation with described unique patient characteristics, which medication is most appropriate?\n\n【7】6 . What is the best treatment for the toxic effect of a medication?\n\n【8】7 . What are the drug-drug interactions to be cautious about regarding a particular medication?\n\n【9】1 . Which of the following medications is most likely to be responsible for the described symptoms or signs?\n\n【10】The student must be aware of the various effects, both desirable and undesirable, produced by particular medications. Knowledge of desirable therapeutic effects is essential in selecting the appropriate drug for the particular clinical application; likewise, an awareness of its adverse effects is necessary, because patients may come into the physician’s office with a complaint caused by a drug effect unaware that their symptoms are because of a prescribed medication. It is only by being aware of the common and dangerous effects that the clinician can arrive at the correct diagnosis. The student is encouraged not to merely memorize the comparative adverse effect profiles of the drugs, but rather to understand the underlying mechanisms.\n\n【11】2 . What is the likely mechanism for the clinical effect(s) and adverse effect(s) of the medication?\n\n【12】As noted above, the student should strive to learn the underlying physiologic, biochemical, or cellular explanation for the described drug effect. This understanding allows for the rational choice of an alternative agent or the reasonable choice of an agent to alleviate the symptoms or explanatory advice to the patient regarding behavioral changes to diminish any adverse affects. For example, if a 60-year-old woman who takes medications for osteoporosis complains of severe “heartburn,” one may be suspicious, knowing that the bisphosphonate medication alendronate can cause esophagitis. Instruction to the patient to take the medication while sitting upright and remaining upright for at least 30 minutes would be the proper course of action, because gravity will assist in keeping the alendronate in the stomach rather than allowing regurgitation into the distal esophagus.\n\n【13】3 . What is the basic pharmacologic profile (absorption, elimination, volume of distribution) for medications in a certain class, and what are differences among the agents within the class?\n\n【14】Understanding the pharmacologic profile of medications allows for rational therapeutics. However, instead of memorizing the separate profiles for every medication, grouping the drugs together into classes allows for more efficient learning and better comprehension. An excellent starting point for the student of pharmacology would be to study how a prototype drug within a drug class organized by structure or mechanism of action may be used to treat a condition (such as hypertension). Then within each category of agents, the student should try to identify important subclasses or drug differences. For example, hypertensive agents can be categorized as diuretic agents, β-adrenergic-blocking agents, calcium-channel-blocking agents, and renin-angiotensin system inhibitors. Within the subclassification of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors, the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors can cause the side effect of a dry cough caused by the increase in bradykinin brought about by the enzyme blockade; instead, the angiotensin-1 receptor blockers do not affect the bradykinin levels and so do not cause the cough as often.\n\n【15】4 . Given basic pharmacologic definitions such as therapeutic index (TI) or certain safety factor (TD <sub>1 </sub> /ED <sub>99 </sub> ), or median lethal dose (LD <sub>50 </sub> ), how do medications compare in their safety profile?\n\n【16】Therapeutic index (TI): Defined as the TD <sub>50 </sub> /ED <sub>50 </sub> (the ratio of the dose that produces a toxic effect in half the population to the dose that produces the desired effect in half the population).\n\n【17】Certain safety factor (TD <sub>1 </sub> /ED <sub>99 </sub> ): Defined as the ratio of the dose that produces the toxic effect in 1 percent of the population to the dose that produces the desired effect in 99 percent of the population; also known as standard safety measure.\n\n【18】Median lethal dose (LD <sub>50 </sub> ): Defined as the median lethal dose, the dose that will kill half the population.\n\n【19】Based on these definitions, a desirable medication would have a high therapeutic index (toxic dose is many times that of the efficacious dose), high certain safety factor, and high median lethal dose (much higher than therapeutic dose). Likewise, medications such as digoxin that have a low therapeutic index require careful monitoring of levels and vigilance for side effects.\n\n【20】5 . Given a particular clinical situation with described unique patient characteristics, which medication is most appropriate?\n\n【21】The student must weigh various advantages and disadvantages, as well as different patient attributes. Some of those may include compliance with medications, allergies to medications, liver or renal insufficiency, age, coexisting medical disorders, and other medications. The student must be able to sift through the medication profile and identify the most dangerous adverse effects. For example, if a patient is already taking a monoamine-oxidase-inhibiting agent for depression, then adding a serotonin reuptake inhibitor would be potentially fatal, because serotonin syndrome may ensue (hyperthermia, muscle rigidity, death).\n\n【22】6 . What is the best treatment for the toxic effect of a medication?\n\n【23】If complications of drug therapy are present, the student should know the proper treatment. This is best learned by understanding the drug mechanism of action. For example, a patient who has taken excessive opioids may develop respiratory depression, caused by either a heroin overdose or pain medication, which may be fatal. The treatment of an opioid overdose includes the ABCs (airway, breathing, circulation) and the administration of naloxone, which is a competitive antagonist of opioids.\n\n【24】7 . What are the drug-drug interactions to be concerned with regarding a particular medication?\n\n【25】Patients are often prescribed multiple medications, from either the same practitioner or different clinicians. Patients may not be aware of the drug-drug interactions; thus, the clinician must compile, as a component of good clinical practice, a current list of all medications (prescribed, over-the-counter, and herbal) taken by the patient. Thus, the student should be aware of the most common and dangerous interactions; once again, understanding the underlying mechanism allows for lifelong learning rather than short-term rote memorization of facts that are easily forgotten. For example, magnesium sulfate to stop preterm labor should not be used if the patient is taking a calcium-channel-blocking agent such as nifedipine. Magnesium sulfate acts as a competitive inhibitor of calcium, and by decreasing its intracellular availability it slows down smooth muscle contraction such as in the uterus. Calcium-channel blockers potentiate the inhibition of calcium influx and can lead to toxic effects, such as respiratory depression.\n\n【26】####", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

This patient likely has pertussis, or whooping cough, which is caused by the gram-negative rod Bordetella pertussis . This organism has four virulence factors, including pertussis toxin. The A subunit of this exotoxin inhibits membrane-bound G αi proteins, which ultimately results in the accumulation of cAMP. The effects of this accumulation include histamine sensitization, increased insulin synthesis, lymphocytosis, and inhibition of phagocytosis.  \nAnswer A is incorrect. The botulinum toxin released by Clostridium botulinum prevents the release of acetylcholine into the synaptic cleft, resulting in muscle weakness and paralysis.  \nAnswer B is incorrect. The alpha toxin of Staphylococcus aureus binds to the plasma membrane of host cells, forming a pore in the membrane that allows ions and small molecules to enter the cell. This leads to cell swelling and eventual lysis. Streptolysin O of Streptococcus pyogenes functions in a similar manner.  \nAnswer C is incorrect. The exotoxin of Corynebacterium diphtheriae functions via the inactivation of elongation factor 2, causing pharyngitis and the formation of a pseudomembrane in the throat. Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A also works via this mechanism.  \nAnswer E is incorrect. Lipopolysaccharide-lipid A is an endotoxin released only by gram-negative bacteria, with the exception of Listeria monocytogenes , a gram-positive bacteria responsible for meningitis in neonates and immunosuppressed patients.

Fractures of the  删除换行1 pelvis are classified by the mechanism of injury. There are three main types:\n\n【14】1. AP compression (open book fractures)\n\n【15】2. Lateral compression injury\n\n【16】3. Vertical shear injury\n\n【17】Complex fracture patterns may also occur if the above mechanisms are combined.\n\n【18】Pelvic injuries may be associated with significant haemorrhage. There are two physical characteristics that account for this. Firstly, the internal pelvic volume roughly equates to an  删除换行1 inverted cone. Increasing the radius of this cone, as in open book fractures, will greatly  删除换行1 increase this volume. The other is the potential volume of the retroperitoneum. Even when  删除换行1 intact it can accommodate the entire circulating blood volume. Bleeding in pelvic fractures  删除换行1 is predominantly venous but may also be arterial. Clues may be elucidated on CT scan or by  删除换行1 the site of injury.\n\n【19】Management of this patient should follow the step-wise approach as detailed by ATLS.\nVolume loss from bleeding should be replaced with either crystalloid or blood according to  删除换行1 haemodynamic status. Permissive hypotension or balanced resuscitation may be employed  删除换行1 to prevent dislodging primary clots. Whilst this is gaining more acceptance, local guidelines  删除换行1 should be followed.\n\n【20】Often, a pelvic binder will have been applied by pre-hospital personnel, and this should not  删除换行1 be removed until pelvic injury has been ruled out radiologically. Pelvic binders are most useful in ‘open book’ type injuries whereby they help to reduce pelvic volume.\n\n【21】Should the patient remain persistently hypotensive despite volume resuscitation and a binder,  删除换行1 then the pelvis and retroperitoneum must be suspected as sources of ongoing blood loss once  删除换行1 the other main sites have been excluded (chest, abdomen, long bones, open wounds).\n\n【22】Stable patients may be suited to angiographic embolisation in the interventional radiography  删除换行1 suite. Unstable patients should be taken to a theatre by a trauma surgeon for pelvic packing  删除换行1 and external fixation. Decision-making can be difficult as these patients are often young and  删除换行1 may deteriorate suddenly (e.g. on the way to the interventional suite or CT scanner), and so  删除换行1 senior support is advised from the outset.\n\n【23】The definitive management of pelvic fractures is surgical. They may be temporarily stabilised  删除换行1 with an external fixator (either applied in theatre or the ED) to allow access to the abdomen  删除换行1 and other life-threatening injuries to be treated before definitive operative management.\n\n【24】Open book fractures are also associated with bladder and urethral injuries. The presence of  删除换行1 blood around the perineum, the urethral meatus or a high riding prostate should increase  删除换行1 suspicion of this. Do not attempt to catheterise the patient. Obtain a urological opinion and  删除换行1 perform a retrograde urethrogram to assess the urethra and the bladder first.\nCase 51: Pelvic injury in a motorcycle accident\n\n【25】Key Points\n\n【26】• Pelvic fractures are associated with major trauma. Assess all patients according to \n\n【27】ATLS guidelines.\n\n【28】• The mechanism of injury determines the fracture type and management.\n\n【29】• In the absence of other sources of haemorrhage, suspect pelvic or retroperitoneal  删除换行1 blood loss in the persistently hypotensive patient.\n\n【30】• Assess the perineum carefully for potential bladder or urethral injury.删除9：<u>http://taylorandfrancis.com181</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

This patient has physical signs consistent with anorexia nervosa, most notably a low body mass index, bradycardia, evidence of hypotension, lanugo, and concomitant depression. Anorexia nervosa is a serious condition that requires intensive mental health care, as well as close medical monitoring of weight, electrolyte levels, and hydration status. The mainstay of therapy is a combination of cognitive behavioral therapy and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Use of the antidepressant bupropion is contraindicated in patients with anorexia nervosa because it increases the risk of seizure in this population.  \nAnswer A is incorrect . Amitriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA). TCAs, although effective, are not first-line therapy in the management of anorexia nervosa, given the potential for cardiac adverse effects in anorexic patients already suffering from bradycardia and electrolyte abnormalities. TCAs are not known to increase the risk of seizure in anorexic patients.  \nAnswer C is incorrect . Fluoxetine is an SSRI most commonly used as an antidepressant.

The predominantly cause of human hookworm disease is the nematode parasites Necator americanus and Ancylostoma duodenale.

Impetigo is often on the face in children and has a distinct crusted pattern.\n\n【21】Cutaneous larva migrans (CLM) is usually confined to the skin of the buttocks, feet or abdomen and is serpiginous and often highly pruritic. When a child such as this patient presents with a rash and with the history of playing in the dirt, it is important to carefully look for the characteristic serpiginous pattern of CLM.\n\n【22】The etiology is dog and cat hookworms who are the normal hosts and, the worm eggs pass through the feces and hatch in moist, warm, sandy soil. The skin irritation is due to a hypersensitivity reaction to the worms (nematodes) and their byproducts.\n\n【23】The disease primarily occurs during warmer months of the year in tropical and subtropical climates.

This patient has symptoms, physical findings, and a peripheral blood smear suggestive of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). The image has a classic “Auer rod” in the cytoplasm. Auer rods are are fused lysosomal granules. A sudden release of Auer’s rods may cause acute disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and fatal hemorrhage. DIC is a disorder in which activation of the coagulation cascade leads to the development of microthrombi and the consumption of platelets, fibrin, and coagulation factors. Lab findings in DIC include increased PT and PTT, an elevation in fibrin split products, and thrombocytopenia. A peripheral blood smear of a patient with DIC would reveal helmetshaped cells and schistocytes. Schistocytes are irregularly shaped or fragmented RBC forms that are generated when RBCs attempt to squeeze through the fibrin meshwork associated with small vessel thrombi.  \nAnswer A is incorrect . Acanthocytes (sometimes called spur cells) are spiny RBCs that are associated with abetalipoproteinemia as well as severe liver disease.  \nAnswer B is incorrect . Burr cells (also known as echinocytes) are abnormal RBCs with short, blunt projections around the periphery. These cells can be seen in hemolytic-uremic syndrome, pyruvate kinase deficiency, uremia, and other disorders.  \nAnswer D is incorrect . Target cells are abnormal RBCs with a “bull’s-eye” appearance. They are seen in a variety of conditions including asplenia, liver disease, and thalassemia.  \nAnswer E is incorrect . Teardrop cells are abnormal RBCs seen in the setting of myeloid metaplasia with myelofibrosis. Some have posited that the teardrop morphology results from the RBCs trying to squeeze out of fibrotic bone marrow.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

The first is avoidance of medications or conditions that predispose to bone loss (smoking cessation， reduc-tion of systemic steroid use， and attention to nutrition). Adequate calcium intake，1000 mg/d for premenopausal women and adult men and 1200 mg with 400 to800 IU of vitamin D per day for postmenopausal women， leads to decreased frac-tures. Steroid estrogen receptor modulators such as raloxifene can increase bone density and reduce fracture risk， as can the use of bisphosphonates， in combination with both calcium and vitamin D. Bisphosphonates can lead to severe esophagi-tis and must be used with caution in individuals with gastric reflux disease. Oral bisphosphonates should be taken on an empty stomach， with a large quantity of water， and the patient should remain in the upright position for at least 30 minutes. Intravenous bisphosphonates are now available that can be infused quarterly or annually. There is some concern about long-term effects of bisphosphonates， including risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw and paradoxical bone fragility causing atypical subtrochanteric femur fractures.

However, over the past 24 h, she has had fever and difficulty opening her mouth while talking or swallowing. On examination, the patient has a fever of 101°F, with redness of the left submandibular region extending to the left side of her throat. She is sitting up but is anxious and drooling and has some inspiratory stridor.

There is a left submandibular inflammation extending to the left side of the throat. She is sitting but is anxious and drooling and has some inspiratory stridor. This infection may track from the mouth to the neck to the chest.\n\n【8】• Most likely diagnosis: Submandibular cellulitis (Ludwig angina)\n\n【9】• Anatomical mechanism for this condition: A dental (molar) abscess that has tracked inferiorly from the submandibular space to impinge on the trachea\n\n【10】### CLINICAL CORRELATION\n\n【11】Dental abscesses are relatively common occurrences and typically are self-limited or easily treated with antibiotics such as penicillin. Occasionally, an infection involving the molar teeth may extend into the submandibular space (Ludwig angina) and affect the trachea or carotid sheath contents. Fever, painful edema, limited neck mobility, drooling, and difficulty opening the mouth are clinical findings. The infection can also extend inferiorly into the mediastinum (mediastinitis). The inspiratory stridor in this case may indicate tracheal compression. In such cases, laryngoscopy may lead to laryngospasm and complete airway obstruction. Lateral neck radiographs or CT imaging are helpful in the diagnosis. The best treatment is intravenous antibiotics, airway protection (intubation if needed), and operative drainage of the abscess.\n\n【12】### APPROACH TO:\n\n【13】#### The Oral Cavity\n\n【14】### OBJECTIVES\n\n【15】1\\.

Deep to the superficial fascia and platysma , the investing fascia (the superficial layer of deep fascia) encircles the neck and splits to enclose the SCM and the trapezius muscles and attaches to the ligamentum nuchae posteriorly. Superiorly, it attaches to the hyoid bone, mandible, and base of the skull; inferiorly, it attaches to the acromion, clavicle, and manubrium of the sternum. The prevertebral fascia surrounds the cervical vertebral column, the spinal cord, and the pre- and paravertebral musculatures. It attaches to the base of the skull superiorly and the ligamentum nuchae posteriorly, and blends with the anterior longitudinal ligament of the vertebral column in the thorax. The pretracheal fascia surrounds the larynx, trachea, esophagus, thyroid, and parathyroid glands and splits to enclose the infrahyoid (strap) muscles of the neck. It is attached superiorly to the hyoid bone and inferiorly blends with the fibrous pericardium in the thorax. Posteriorly and superiorly, it is continuous with the buccopharyngeal fascia. The carotid sheath is usually described as having originated in the investing, prevertebral, and pretracheal layers.\n\n【25】Between the prevertebral and buccopharyngeal fasciae lies the retropharyngeal space (“danger space”). This space is a pathway for spread of infection to the thorax, possibly resulting in cardiac tamponade. Within the pretracheal fascia is a potential space filled with loose areolar connective tissue called the visceral space 删除33：<u></u>.\n\n【26】删除3：<u>Figure 52-1. Compartments of the neck: 1 = investing fascia, 2 = sternocleidomastoid muscle, 3 = infrahyoid muscle, 4 = trapezius muscle, 5 = visceral (pretracheal) fascia, 6 = thyroid gland, 7 = trachea, 8 = recurrent laryngeal nerve, 9 = esophagus, 10 = buccopharyngeal fascia, 11 = alar fascia (present only in upper pharynx), 12 = retropharyngeal (retroesophageal) space, 13 = neurovascular (carotid) sheath, 14 = common carotid artery, 15 = internal jugular vein, 16 = vagus nerve, 17 = prevertebral fascia, 18 = phrenic nerve, 19 = sympathetic trunk, 20 = roots of the brachial plexus, 21 = vertebral artery.

The root of the tongue lies medially, and the inner surface of the mandible lies laterally. The space contains the sublingual gland and ducts , a portion of the submandibular gland and its duct, and the lingual and hypoglossal nerves. A cleft exists between the mylohyoid and hyoglossus muscles, through which the submandibular gland wraps around the posterior border of the mylohyoid muscle. The roots of the posterior molar teeth are close to the inner surface of the mandible, thus increasing the risk for dental abscesses spreading into the submandibular space. Infectious material can thus spread inferiorly into the visceral space through the cleft between the mylohyoid and hyoglossus muscles.\n\n【28】###", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Cell-mediated immunity is intact， and patients' T cells recognize M leprae (positive lepromin skin test). Lepromatous leprosy holds a much worse prognosis because patients have ineffective cell-mediated immunity (negative lepromin skin test). Skin lesions and nerve involvement are much more extensive than in the tuberculoid form， and there may be involvement of the testes， upper respiratory tract， and anterior chamber of the eye.\n\n【6】What is the appropriate treatment for this condition?\n\n【7】Both tuberculoid and lepromatous leprosy can be treated with a course of oral dapsone. The tuberculoid form is reliably cured by a short course of this medication. Patients with lepromatous leprosy have an exceptionally high bacterial load and may require an extended or even lifelong course of chemotherapy. Alternate therapies for leprosy include rifampin or a combination of clofazimine and dapsone.\n\n【8】What are the side effects of treatment?\n\n【9】Dapsone can cause agranulocytosis， so patients should be monitored initially with weekly or biweekly complete blood counts.\n\n【10】Rifampin can turn body fluids such as sweat， tears， and urine a red-orange color.

Up until about 6 months  删除换行1 ago she was doing well in school with a good group of friends. She used to be actively involved  删除换行1 in school activities but this has now fallen away as have social activities with friends at the  删除换行1 weekend. Sometimes she will force herself to spend time with friends because she feels guilty  删除换行1 about letting people down, but does not enjoy the activity and feels even worse after it.\n\n【4】She does not sleep well. She lies in bed worrying about everything that has happened and  删除换行1 worrying about what she has done wrong. When she does fall asleep she will wake after a  删除换行1 short time.

Features of depression include  删除换行1 biological symptoms. Look for marked loss of interest or pleasure in usually pleasurable  删除换行1 activities, lack of emotional responses to situations that usually would evoke a response, diurnal mood variation, sleep disturbance (young people may not get the early morning waking  删除换行1 associated with depression in adults, and often find that they sleep more but still do not  删除换行1 feel rested), poor appetite and/or weight loss (again young people may eat more), psychomotor retardation and agitation. Biological symptoms are less consistent in young people.\nAssociated with these will be low mood and inability to concentrate. The young person may  删除换行1 experience lack of confidence, poor self-esteem, negative feelings (such as worthlessness,  删除换行1 guilt) and self-harm ideation. Moderate depression has greater severity and often a greater  删除换行1 number of symptoms. Mild and moderate depression do not have psychotic features 删除25：<u></u>.\n\n【13】Everybody learns lists in different ways. The symptoms of depression can be thought of as  删除换行1 computer MAC GAMES, with letters standing for the 12 main symptoms mentioned in \n\n【14】International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10): depressed mood for at least  删除换行1 2 weeks, anhedonia, poor concentration, guilty feelings, appetite disturbance, abnormal  删除换行1 movements, low energy and then the 5 S’s of low self-esteem, thoughts of suicide/self-harm,  删除换行1 sleep disturbance, reduced sex drive and somatization.\n\n【15】Depression is more common in girls but it may be that it presents with more aggressive  删除换行1 and hostile behaviour in males. It is less common before adolescence. There is some genetic  删除换行1 loading, but in many cases the social disadvantage that is experienced by parents leading to  删除换行1 depression is also experienced by their children.\n\n【16】An initial assessment which includes a detailed risk assessment is necessary. This girl is at  删除换行1 moderate risk of harming herself given the feelings of being a burden and not having shared  删除换行1 how bad she has felt. It would also be useful to get a parental history as they may provide  删除换行1 some useful insights into her pre-morbid personality.\n\n【17】She would best be managed by individual counselling and medication. Medication is not as  删除换行1 efficacious in adolescents. Certain serotonin reuptake inhibitors such as fluoxetine have the  删除换行1 best evidence base. Once her mood has lifted and she is more amenable, cognitive behaviour  删除换行1 therapy (CBT) or interpersonal therapy would be useful to help her manage both her negative  删除换行1 feelings and feelings of guilt. Given her age it is also important to engage her parents so that  删除换行1 they can provide appropriate support and also another perspective.\n\n【18】ICD-10 categories of non-psychotic depression\n\n【19】• F33 Recurrent Depressive Disorder\n\n【20】• F32 Depressive Episode\n\n【21】• F32.0 Mild Depressive Episode (4 from 12 symptoms)\n\n【22】• F32.1 Moderate Depressive Episode (6 from 12 symptoms)\n\n【23】• F32.2 Severe Depressive Episode (8 from 12) Without Psychotic Symptoms225\n\n【24】Case 81: Feelings of guilt\n\n【25】Key Points\n\n【26】• Depression is relatively common in adolescents.\n\n【27】• A high proportion of depression in adolescence abates with time and change in  删除换行1 circumstances.\n\n【28】• Mild and moderate depression may be effectively treated with CBT and/or interpersonal therapy.\n\n【29】• Severe depression may need to be managed using the serotonin reuptake inhibitor, fluoxetine.\n\n【30】删除29：<u>Case 82: Intense feelings of worthlessness\n\n【31】</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Fortu-nately， John had an HLA-identical 11-year-old brother who could be the bone mar-row donor. John was admitted to the Children’s Hospital and given a course of horse anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG)， fludarabine， and cyclophosphamide to eradicate his own lymphocytes. He was then given 2×108 nucleated bone marrow cells per kg body weight obtained from his brother's iliac crests. He was also started on cyclo-sporin A (CsA) to prevent GVHD.\n\n【9】John did well for 3 weeks after the bone marrow transplant. However， in spite of GVHD prophylaxis with CsA， on the 24th day after the transplant he developed a skin rash and watery diarrhea consistent with acute GVHD. He had a patchy red rash on palms and soles， scalp， and neck. He had no fever and was not jaundiced. His lungs were clear and the heartbeat normal. The liver and spleen were not enlarged.\n\n【10】John was treated with corticosteroids. His skin rash faded， but the intestinal symp- toms did not abate and the diarrhea became more profuse. He was given rabbit ATG for two consecutive days. This brought about a 90% decrease in the volume of his stool and the intestinal bleeding stopped. Two weeks later， John was sent home， with continuing treatment with low doses of corticosteroid， and his GVHD remained under control.\n\n【11】Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).\n\n【12】Graft-versus-host disease was first described more than 30 years ago by Billingham， Brent， and Medawar， who gave allogeneic lymphocytes to newborn mice. The mice became runted (their growth was retarded)， lymphoid tissue was destroyed， and they developed diarrhea and necrosis of the liver. GVHD was first recognized in human infants with severe combined immunodeficiency disease who inadvert-ently received allogeneic lymphocytes contained in a blood transfusion 删除33：<u></u>. For a recipient to develop GVHD， the graft must contain immunocompetent cells， the recipient must express major or minor histocompatibility molecules that are lacking in the graft donor and the recipient must be incapable of rejecting the graft.\n\n【13】The first clinical manifestation of GVHD is a bright red rash that usually begins on the face and neck and progresses to involve the trunk and limbs， particularly the 删除换行4 palms and soles. The rash may itch a great deal， and its onset may be accompanied by fever. After the skin manifestations appear 删除33：<u></u>， the gastrointestinal tract becomes involved 删除33：<u></u> and profuse watery diarrhea is produced.\n删除3：<u>Fig. 11.3 GVHD in the skin.

Eventually， other tissues such as the lungs and bone marrow become sites of GVHD inflammation. The only satisfactory therapy at present for GVHD is elimination of the T cells that initiate the reaction， either by immunosuppressive drugs or， as in John's case， by T-cell-depleting agents.\n\n【15】Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation from a haploidentical (that is， half-matched) donor (typically， one of the two parents) carries a very high risk of GVHD. For this reason， the bone marrow from haploidentical donors is manipu-lated to deplete the mature T lymphocytes (or to purify the stem cells only) before attempting the transplant. Transplantation from Matched Unrelated Donors(MUDs) has also become current practice at many centers； however， with this type of transplant， there is also a significant risk of GVHD. A minority of bone marrow transplant centers use T-cell depletion for transplantation from MUDs. Transplantation with unmanipulated bone marrow from MUDs is associated with a higher rate of engraftment and may provide a \"graft-versus-leukemia reaction， in which donor-derived mature T cells may kill the residual leukemic cells of the recipient， making relapse less likely in the case of bone marrow transplants for the treatment of leukemia.\n\n【16】7-year--old boy with seveerfe amemi ta.

Some endosymbionts can be found either inside cells (intracellular), while others attach to the surface of cells (extracellular). Symbiotic relationships are ones in which both parties benefit. In the example of corals, the host animal is a multicellular cnidarian, and the endosymbiont is a unicellular alga called a dinoflagellate. The host animal serves as a protected environment, providing the alga with a constant supply of nutrients in the form of nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur. In turn, the alga provides the host with glucose. Another important example of a beneficial relationship between a host and an endosymbiont is found in the roots of bean and pea plants. Bacteria called rhizobia colonize the root cells of plants forming nodules. Rhizobia bacteria convert atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia that the plant can use to build biological molecules. The conversion of nitrogen gas into ammonium, requires large amounts of ATP. Plants supply the bacteria with carbohydrates to help drive the reaction.\n\n【4】▪ Explain how an alga endosymbiont could provide a host organism with glucose.\n\n【5】▪ Describe how a symbiotic relationship might alter an organism’s phenotype.\n\n【6】▪ What biological molecules require nitrogen?\n\n【7】▪ Connect the activity of nitrogen-fixing rhizobia bacteria to the global nitrogen cycle.\n\n【8】▪ The endosymbiotic theory explains the origin of mitochondria and chloroplasts.

She reported that she had an acute onset of fever, nonproductive cough, and fatigue two weeks ago. Then, she received treatments with Moxifloxacin, Oseltamivir, and Lian Hua Qing Wen Capsules. Next, she visited the Manchun Street Community Health Service Center in Wuhan City on 01/30 because the symptoms continued without change. The complete blood count reported the following: WBC 3.0 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L, NEU% 59.7%, LYM 0.7 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L. Chest CT reported the following: There were multiple infectious lesions in both the lungs. Aortosclerosis could be found. Then, she took chest CT again at the Hubei Provincial Hospital of Integrated Chinese and Western Medicine on 01/30. The second chest CT showed that there were multiple ground-glass opacities in both the lungs and multiple micronodules in the middle lobe of the right lung. Thus, she was isolated at home by herself. And, the symptoms continued without change. Then, she was admitted to the Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital on 02/09/2020 because of COVID-19.\n\n【10】Since onset, the patient had poor energy, poor appetite, poor sleep, dry cough, a bitter taste in the mouth, shortness of breath, dry stools, normal urination, and weight loss. The patient has half a year history of diabetes, which was being treated with Metformin. She had no history of operations or trauma, and no known contact with the Huanan Seafood Market. There was no pneumonia among her family members recently. She had no allergy history of drugs.\n\n【11】### Patient’s Condition on Admission\n\n【12】At the time of admission, the patient was alert and her energy was poor. The symptoms included pharyngeal hyperemia, dry cough, frequent urination, and urgent urination. She had no symptoms of fever, wheezing, and shortness of breath. The tip of the tongue was slightly red with scanty fluid and no coating; the middle of tongue coating was white and slightly greasy 删除33：<u></u>. The pulse was slippery and thready.\n\n【13】Physical examination: T 36.7ºC, HR 101/min, RR 22/min, BP 137/73 mmHg, oxygen saturation (while the patient was breathing ambient air) 87%.\n\n【14】### Admission Diagnosis\n\n【15】① COVID-19 (severe type). ② Type 2 Diabetes.\n\n【16】### Treatment Plan\n\n【17】On 02/09/2020, the patient was alert and her energy was poor. The symptoms included pharyngeal hyperemia, dry cough, frequent urination, and urgent urination. The tip of the tongue was slightly red with scanty fluid and no coating, the middle of tongue coating was white and slightly greasy. The pulse was slippery and thready. Oxygen saturation was 87% while the patient was breathing ambient air. According to the ward round on 02/10, the patient had clear consciousness and her energy was fair. The symptoms included pharyngeal hyperemia, dry cough without sputum, frequent urination, and urgent urination. The tongue and the pulse were the same as before. Lab results reported the following: WBC 4.28 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L, HB 101 g/L, NEU% 79.2%, ANC 3.39 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L, LYMPH% 7.9%, LYM 0.34 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L, PCT 0.33 ng/mL, ESR 67 mm/h, CRP 145.8 mg/L, ALB 23.7 g/L, LDH 304 U/L, BNP 98.8 pg/mL, D-dimmer 1.10 μg/mL, FER 438.11 ng/mL. The COVID-19 nucleic acid test was positive. Chest CT on 02/10 reported the following: There were multiple infectious lesions in both the lungs, which can be considered as viral pneumonia. There was bilateral pleural adhesion. It was found to have aortic calcification. It showed a low-density shadow of the liver 删除33：<u></u>.\n\n【18】删除3：<u>Figure 2-19-1. Tongue manifestation at admission.</u>\n\n【19】### Western Medicine Treatment Strategies\n\n【20】First, the diagnosis of COVID-19 was clear on the basis of the clinical symptom (cough) and auxiliary examinations (the chest CT in the other hospital reported viral pneumonia and the COVID-19 nucleic acid test was positive after admission).\n\n【21】删除3：<u>Figure 2-19-2. The first chest CT on hospital day 2 (02/10).</u>\n\n【22】Note : There were multiple patchy and strip-like shadow images in both the lungs. The density of these images which showed a dim border was different. The decreased transparency, increased and obscured lung markings can be seen in both the lungs. The lesions were ground-glass opacities.\n\n【23】Second, it was necessary to evaluate the severity of diseases: according to the clinical classification standard of Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol for COVID-19 (Trial Version 5) implemented at that time, the patient met the criterion of severe type which is oxygen saturation ≤93% at rest. Meanwhile, we informed the patient of the severe condition.\n\n【24】Third, the results of NEU% and ESR were increased, LYMPH% was decreased. Besides, the patient had frequent urination and urgent urination. Therefore, it was considered that the patient had urinary tract infection. Moxifloxacin Hydrochloride Tablet 0.4 g (administered orally once a day) was given for anti-infection. In addition, Human Immunoglobulin 15 g for injection (administered intravenously once a day) was given for enhancing immune function. Human Blood Albumin 10 g for injection (administered intravenously once a day) was given as a supplement.\n\n【25】### TCM Treatment Strategies\n\n【26】#### 02/09/2020\n\n【27】According to the clinical manifestations (including dry cough without sputum, slightly red with scanty fluid and no coating on the tip of the tongue, a white and slightly greasy coating, and slippery and thready pulse), it was considered that the patient had retention of damp-heat and deficiency of both Qi and Yin. Retention of damp-heat extracted Yin fluid, which caused consumption of Yin and Body Fluid. Then, it led to phlegm retention. Thus, the sputum was too viscous to cough. Hyperactivity of heat can also result in insufficient Yin fluid. Thus, it can be seen that the tip of the tongue was slightly red with scanty fluid and no coating. The therapeutic principles in TCM included clearing away heat and toxic material, resolving dampness, strengthening the spleen, invigorating Qi, and nourishing Yin. Therefore, the COVID-19 Fifth Prescription, which was created by Professor Yang Zhixu, was given for treatment. In this prescription, Jin Yin Hua ( Lonicera japonica Thunb ), Lian Qiao ( Forsythiae Fructus ), and Guan Zhong ( Cyrtomii Rhizoma ), which aim at plague Qi, can enhance the effects of heat-clearing and detoxifying together. Di Gu Pi ( Lycium Chinese Mill ) works internally and Bai Zhi ( Angelicae Dahurica ) works for expelling toxic factors externally. Taking the ratio that the dosage of purging is more than astringent can expel toxic factors externally together and prolong the effect. Lu Lu Tong ( Fructus Liquidambaris ) can dispel stagnated toxins by channel. At the same time, the effect of unblocking collaterals is beneficial to prevent secondary pulmonary fibrosis. Zhi Huang Qi ( Astragali Radix ) is able to invigorate Qi dynamically, which removes upward and outward. Bai He ( Lilium ) works for invigorating Qi and nourishing Yin. Fu Xiao Mai ( Triticum Aesitivum ) can nourish the Heart-Yin. Furthermore, they can complement each other as mutual supplements of Yin and Yang to have better effects of invigorating Qi and nourishing Yin. As Zhang Jingyue put it, “those who know how to tonify Yang are able to obtain Yang from Yin, because gaining Yang promotes Yin for further production and transformation; those who know how to tonify Yin are able to obtain Yin from Yang, because gaining Yin strengthens Yang for constant generation of Water and Fluid.” Da Huang ( Rhubard stir-fried with wine ) has the purgative and active effects. Cang Zhu ( Atractylodis Rhizoma ) and Yi Yi Ren ( Coicis Semen ) can strengthen the spleen, resolve dampness, and regulate the spleen and stomach. All of these herbs have the effects of clearing away toxic material, invigorating Qi, nourishing Yin, strengthening the spleen, and resolving dampness. The prescription was as follows:\n\n【28】Di Gu Pi ( Lycium Chinese Mill ) 25 g, Bai Zhi ( Angelicae Dahurica ) 15 g, Guan Zhong ( Cyrtomii Rhizoma ) 10 g, Jin Yin Hua ( Lonicera japonica Thunb ) 12 g, Lian Qiao ( Forsythiae Fructus ) 12 g, Zhi Huang Qi ( Astragali Radix ) 30 g, Bai He ( Lilium ) 25 g, Fu Xiao Mai ( Triticum Aesitivum ) 25 g, Lu Lu Tong ( Fructus Liquidambaris ) 12 g, Jiu Da Huang ( Rhubard stir-fried with wine ) 6 g, Cang Zhu ( Atractylodis Rhizoma ) 15 g, Yi Yi Ren ( Coicis Semen ) 20 g.\n\n【29】Three doses of granules, equally divided into three parts in the morning, afternoon, and evening, were given (from hospital day 2 to day 3).\n\n【30】Meanwhile, 0.9% sodium chloride injection 250 ml with Xi Yan Ping injection 100 mg (administered intravenously twice a day) was taken for clearing away heat and toxic material because hyperactivity of heat resulted in insufficient Yin fluid. In addition, cold-dampness and plague Qi’s incursions in the lungs resulted in obstruction of lung Qi. It can change into blood-stasis in the developing process of disease. In order to prevent the disease from further development and taking a reverse turn (the meaning in Chinese is “Jie Duan Niu Zhuan”), 0.9% sodium chloride injection 100 ml with Xue Bi Jing injection 50 ml (administered intravenously twice a day) was given for dissolving blood stasis and detoxification.\n\n【31】#### 02/12/2020\n\n【32】On hospital day 4, the patient had clear consciousness and her energy was good. The symptoms included pharyngeal hyperemia, dry cough without sputum, frequent urination, and urgent urination. The tongue color was light red at the tip and the coating was white and slightly greasy. The pulse was slippery and thready. Oxygen saturation was 94% while the patient was breathing ambient air. Lab results reported the following: LYM 0.46 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L, ESR 64 mm/h, CRP 99.0 mg/L, FER 319.27 ng/mL. The COVID-19 nucleic acid test was positive. Treatment with the COVID-19 Fifth Prescription was continued because drugs were taking effect. The prescription was the same as last time. Six doses of granules, equally divided into three parts in the morning, afternoon, and evening, were given (from hospital day 4 to day 7).\n\n【33】#### 02/13/2020\n\n【34】On hospital day 5, the patient had clear consciousness and her energy was good. The symptoms included pharyngeal hyperemia and dry cough without sputum. Besides, frequent urination and urgent urination were better than before. The tip of the tongue was light red and the coating was white and slightly greasy. The pulse was slippery and thready. Oxygen saturation was 95% while the patient was breathing ambient air. We observed her closely.\n\n【35】#### 02/16/2020\n\n【36】On hospital day 8, the patient had clear consciousness and her energy was good. The symptoms included pharyngeal hyperemia and dry cough without sputum. Besides, frequent urination and urgent urination were better than before. The tongue and the pulse were the same as before. Oxygen saturation was 95% while the patient was breathing ambient air. Lab results reported the following: CRP 29.8 mg/L, PCT 0.06 ng/mL, IL-6 10.81 pg/mL, LYM 0.69 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L, D-dimmer 1.73 μ g/mL, FER 300.55 ng/mL, ALB 31.1 g/L. Chest CT on 02/16 reported the following: There were some infectious lesions in both the lungs, which can be considered as viral pneumonia. There was a bit of bilateral pleural effusion and pleural thickening; it was found to have aortic calcification. It showed a low-density shadow of the liver. It was recommended that we combine these results with the relative examination. There were more lesions in the lower lobe of the left lung and the upper lobe of the right lung than on 02/10; the rest of the lesions were the same. There were some new pleural effusions in both the lungs. Although the lesions in the lungs were more than before, the inflammatory factors were decreased obviously. Therefore, it was considered that inflammation was improved. Treatment with the COVID-19 Fifth Prescription was continued. The prescription was the same as the last time. Three doses of granules, equally divided into three parts in the morning, afternoon, and evening were given (from hospital day 8 to day 9).\n\n【37】#### 02/17/2020\n\n【38】On hospital day 9, the patient had clear consciousness and her energy was good. The symptoms included pharyngeal hyperemia and dry cough without sputum. Frequent urination and urgent urination disappeared. The tongue was light red with a little coating 删除33：<u></u>. The pulse was slippery and thready. Oxygen saturation was 95% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The symptoms of frequent urination and urgent urination disappeared; therefore, treatment with Moxifloxacin Hydrochloride Tablets was discontinued. The light red tongue indicated reducing heat. The little coating and thready pulse indicated deficiency of both Qi and Yin. As a result, treatment with Xi Yan Ping injection was discontinued. Besides, 5% glucose injection 250 ml with Shen Mai injection 60 ml was taken for invigorating Qi and nourishing Yin.\n\n【39】删除3：<u>Figure 2-19-3. Tongue manifestation (02/17).</u>\n\n【40】#### 02/18/2020\n\n【41】On hospital day 10, the patient had clear consciousness and her energy was good. The symptoms included pharyngeal hyperemia and dry cough without sputum. She reported that she might have non-productive cough caused by cold. The tongue and the pulse were the same as before. Oxygen saturation was 95% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The patient’s condition remained stable. It indicated deficiency of both Qi and Yin according to the tongue and pulse. And, cold-caused cough suggested obvious deficiency of Wei-Qi. Therefore, treatment with modified prescription in accordance with different symptoms was given. It can enhance effects of invigorating Qi and nourishing Yin on the basis of detoxification. In this prescription, Sheng Huang Qi ( Astragali Radix ) has an influence on strengthening the spleen and tonifying the lungs. Sheng Di Huang ( Rehmanniae Radix ) can nourish Yin and promote the production of body fluid. Shu Di Huang ( Rehmannia glutinosa ) has the effect of invigorating kidney-yin. Yi Zhi Ren ( Alpinia oxyphylla ) is able to warm and tonify the spleen and kidneys. Bai Guo ( Ginkgo Seed ) can work for warming the lungs and relieving asthma. Bai He ( Lilium ) can nourish Yin and moisten the lungs. These five herbs can invigorate the lungs, spleen, and kidneys to consolidate the body resistance. Sheng Ma Huang ( Ephedrae Herba ) works in dispersing the lung-qi, relieving asthma, and expelling evil Qi externally. Xing Ren ( Armeniacae Semen ) can descend Qi and relieve cough. Di Gu Pi ( Lycium Chinese Mill ) can have the effect of clearing away asthenic heat. Jin Yin Hua ( Lonicera japonica Thunb ) and Guan Zhong ( Cyrtomii Rhizoma ) are pretty heat-clearing and detoxifying herbs. Pi Pa Ye ( Loquat Leaf ) and Gua Lou ( Trichosanthes kirilowii Maxim ) can eliminate phlegm, clear away heat, and relieve cough. Lu Lu Tong ( Fructus Liquidambaris ) has the effects of unblocking collaterals and expelling evil Qi. These herbs can work for enhancing the effects in eliminating evil Qi together with herbs which have the effects of clearing up heat, clearing away toxic material, eliminating phlegm, and unblocking collaterals. The essential principles of this prescription were consolidating body resistance and eliminating evil Qi. The prescription was as follows:\n\n【42】Sheng Di Huang ( Rehmanniae Radix ) 15 g, Shu Di Huang ( Rehmannia glutinosa ) 10 g, Yi Zhi Ren ( Alpinia oxyphylla ) 12 g, Sheng Ma Huang ( Ephedrae Herba ) 6 g, Xing Ren ( Armeniacae Semen ) 10 g, Di Gu Pi ( Lycium Chinese Mill ) 12 g, Jin Yin Hua ( Lonicera japonica Thunb ) 10 g, Guan Zhong ( Cyrtomii Rhizoma ) 12 g, Sheng Huang Qi ( Astragali Radix ) 35 g, Bai He ( Lilium ) 25 g, Gua Lou ( Trichosanthes kirilowii Maxim ) 15 g, Lu Lu Tong ( Fructus Liquidambaris ) 10 g, Bai Guo ( Ginkgo Seed ) 10 g, Pi Pa Ye ( Loquat Leaf ) 12 g.\n\n【43】Six doses of granules, equally divided into three parts in the morning, afternoon, and evening, were given (from hospital day 10 to day 13).\n\n【44】#### 02/22/2020\n\n【45】On hospital day 14, the patient had clear consciousness and her energy was good. She reported that non-productive cough was better than before. The tongue and the pulse were the same as before. Oxygen saturation was 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air.

The COVID-19 nucleic acid test was negative. Because the coating was thin and white with scanty fluid and the patient had shortness of breath with minimal exertion, it was considered important to strengthen the effects of invigorating Qi and nourishing Yin on the basis of detoxification. Therefore, treatment with the modified prescription was continued. In addition, Shu Di Huang ( Rehmannia glutinosa ), Yi Zhi Ren ( Alpinia oxyphylla ), Lu Lu Tong ( Fructus Liquidambaris ), and Di Gu Pi ( Lycium Chinese Mill ) were removed. Wu Wei Zi ( Schisandrae Fructus ) was added for promoting the production of body fluid and relieving cough.

Oxygen saturation was at least 95% while the patient was breathing ambient air. Three consecutive COVID-19 nucleic acid tests were negative. The inflammatory indexes were improved apparently. And, the Chest CT on 02/25 reported the following: The lesions in the lungs were more absorbed than before. On the basis of the above, the patient met the discharge criteria. So, the patient was allowed to discharge on 02/29. It was suggested that she isolate herself in the appointed place for 2 weeks, take re-examinations in a month, and follow up if uncomfortable.\n\n【71】### Case Analysis\n\n【72】The patient’s cough improved on the 14th day after admission. Frequent urination and urgent urination changed for the better on the 5th day after admission and disappeared on the 9th day after admission. The changes showed that the symptoms were apparently improved by TCM.\n\n【73】Table 2-19-1. Inflammatory factor changes.\n\n【74】The treatment effects (like anti-bacterial and antiviral infection) were not clear prior to admission. Then, she was isolated at home by herself. She was admitted to hospital because the symptoms continued without change. According to the clinical manifestations (including dry cough with no sputum, slightly red with scanty fluid and no coating on the tip of the tongue, a white and slightly greasy coating, and slippery and thready pulse), it was considered that the patient had retention of damp-heat and deficiency of both Qi and Yin. The therapeutic principles in TCM included clearing away heat and toxic material, resolving dampness, strengthening the spleen, invigorating Qi, and nourishing Yin. Therefore, the COVID-19 Fifth Prescription was given for treatment. Then, with the changes of the patient’s condition, modifying the prescription in accordance with different symptoms was significant. However, the core therapeutic principles remained to consolidate the body’s resistance and eliminate evil Qi. It indicated the advantage of consolidating the body’s resistance and eliminating evil Qi.\n\n【75】The treatment process is supposed to integrate whole cognition of COVID-19 with case treatments. In this case, cold-dampness and plague Qi’s incursions in the lungs caused obstruction of lung Qi. It can change into blood-stasis in the developing process of the disease. In order to prevent the disease from further development and taking a reverse turn (the meaning in Chinese is “Jie Duan Niu Zhuan”), Xue Bi Jing injection was taken as early as possible. This drug can dissolve blood stasis and clear away toxic material according to its progress in modern pharmacological research.\n\n【76】After identifying the pathogenesis, achieving the goal of no need for oxygen inhalation was rapid by taking the COVID-19 Fifth Prescription, which was cooperated with Xue Bi Jing injection and Xi Yan Ping injection. This suggested that Traditional Chinese Medicine herbs can play an important role in treatment after identifying the pathogenesis correctly.\n\n【77】删除32：<u>(Zhixu Yang, Tiebing Fan, Yongyue Xian, Haoning Zhu, Anlu Wang, Jinlin Tong)</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

It is convenient  删除换行1 to remember the 'rule of tens'. According to this rule  删除换行1 this operation is carried out when the weight of the  删除换行1 baby is 10 lbs, is 10 weeks old and has haemoglobin  删除换行1 more than 10 gm%. This is always performed before the  删除换行1 time for primary dentition, to avoid defective dentition.\nIf the patient comes late, operation should be performed, 删除换行1 advantage to the parents, but long term results are not  删除换行1 so satisfactory.\n\n【2】The operation is preferred to carry out at the age of 3 删除换行1 months as :\n\n【3】(i) The lip is larger and thick at this age, so  删除换行1 that technically repair will be easier.\n\n【4】(ii) The baby is sufficient to accept general  删除换行1 anaesthesia and operative assault.\n\n【5】(iii) Feeding with dropper in the post-operative  删除换行1 period is not difficult.\n\n【6】Advantages of choosing this time are :\n\n【7】(i) It facilitates sucking.\n\n【8】(ii) It helps in developing of the alveolus. In case  删除换行1 of cleft alveolus early operation helps in closure of the  删除换行1 alveolar gap.\n\n【9】(iii) Defective speech is avoided.\n\n【10】(iv) When cleft lip is associated with cleft palate,  删除换行1 early reconstruction of the lip will reduce the gap in the  删除换行1 palate.\n\n【11】Technique of operation.— There are numerous  删除换行1 techniques by which this defect can be closed by plastic  删除换行1 surgery. The operation, advocated by Mirault, which has  删除换行1 been modified by Blair, is widely practised for unilateral  删除换行1 cleft lip and will be described here. Another technique,CLEFT LIP AND CLEFT PALATE 63 删除换行1 which was advocated by Millard, is a popular alternative  删除换行1 method.\n\n【12】MIRAULT-BLAIR OPERATION.— This operation is  删除换行1 performed in 3 stages — In the first stage, adequate  删除换行1 mobilisation of the lip, lateral to the cleft, the ala of the  删除换行1 affected nostril and a considerable part of the cheek is  删除换行1 performed. This is done to avoid tension on the suture  删除换行1 line after plastic repair. The lip is everted and an incision  删除换行1 is made in the groove between the lip and the maxilla.\nThe flap is dissected off the maxilla for a considerable  删除换行1 distance. Bleeding is checked by firm pressure with gauze.\n\n【13】In the second stage, the margins are made raw by  删除换行1 cutting the whole thickness of the lip. The margins are  删除换行1 cut in a fashion, which is shown in Fig. 14.1 in author's \n\n【14】'A Practical Guide To Operative Surgery'. To facilitate  删除换行1 this cutting in particular fashion, for proper plastic repair,  删除换行1 an ink mark is first made on the lip.\n\n【15】In the third or the last stage, the skin flaps are  删除换行1 sutured in such a manner that the continuity of the red  删除换行1 margin of the lip is properly maintained. A rubber tube  删除换行1 of proper size is introduced through the nostril first and  删除换行1 then the repair is started. The mucous membrane and  删除换行1 the muscle are sutured separately with chromic catgut.\nThe skin is sutured with fine silk or nylon.\n\n【16】The gap of the floor of the nostril must be repaired.\nCorrection of the deformity of the nostril should also be  删除换行1 done.\n\n【17】If there is associated alveolar cleft it need not be  删除换行1 repaired, as orbicularis oris if effectively reconstructed,  删除换行1 obliterates the alveolar gap spontaneously.\nPOST-OPERATIVE CARE.—\n\n【18】After the operation is completed, the suture line is  删除换行1 smeared with collodium and a Logan's bow is fixed to  删除换行1 relieve the tension on the suture line. The sutures are  删除换行1 removed on the 5th postoperative day. The patient's hands  删除换行1 should be fixed in splints, so that he will not be able to  删除换行1 touch the operation site.\n\n【19】Operation for bilateral cleft lip.— Sometimes both  删除换行1 the maxillary processes fail to fuse with the medial nasal  删除换行1 process, which forms the philtrum. This philtrum with  删除换行1 the premaxilla then projects forwards for a little distance.\nIn this case, the premaxilla has to be pushed back to fix  删除换行1 with the notch in the anterior aspect of the nasal septum.\nThe repair of the cleft is performed in the same way as  删除换行1 the unilateral cleft.\n\n【20】EMBRYOLOGY\n\n【21】Palate is developed from three components — (i) 删除换行1 the premaxilla, developing from the medial nasal process  删除换行1 (M.N.P.) and it bears the incisor teeth and (ii) the two  删除换行1 palatine processes one from each maxillary process. The 删除换行1 line of fusion is in the form of Y 删除33：<u></u>.\n\n【22】Cleft palate is due to failure of fusion of these three  删除换行1 processes. Cleft palate may be :\n\n【23】(i) Complete.— There is a gap between the two  删除换行1 halves of the palate in its entire length. So that nose  删除换行1 and mouth become interconnected. In front, this gap may  删除换行1 pass on one side of the premaxilla or on both sides. In  删除换行1 the latter case the premaxilla is not attached to the palate,  删除换行1 but hangs down from the septum of the nose some  删除换行1 distance in front of (anterior to) where it ought to be.\n\n【24】(ii) Incomplete.— The two halves of the palate fuse  删除换行1 together from before backwards. The last parts to fuse  删除换行1 are the two halves of the uvula. Incomplete fusion  删除换行1 therefore may be :\n\n【25】(a) Bifid uvula.\n\n【26】(b) The whole length of the soft palate.\n\n【27】(c) The whole length of the soft palate and the  删除换行1 posterior part of the hard palate.\n\n【28】In incomplete cleft palate, the anterior part of the  删除换行1 palate is always normally formed.\n\n【29】The palate is divided into two parts — (a) primary 删除换行1 palate which extends from the alveolar margin to the  删除换行1 incisive foramen and (b) the secondary palate extends from  删除换行1 incisive foramen to uvula. The two palatine processes  删除换行1 fuse in the midline between 7th and 12th weeks of  删除换行1 embryonic life separating the oral and nasal cavities. Prior  删除换行1 to fusion the 2 palatine processes hang downward  删除换行1 alongside the tongue. During the 7th week as the tongue  删除换行1 descends into the oral cavity, they begin to fuse from  删除换行1 anterior to posterior. Primary palate is mainly formed by  删除换行1 fusion of these palatine processes, whereas the secondary  删除换行1 palate is formed by mesodermal growth posteriorly from  删除换行1 the posterior margin of the primary palate as well as  删除换行1 fusion in the midline. The soft palate starts forming in  删除换行1 the 9 th week and the uvula is completed by the 12th  删除换行1 week. Besides the obvious cleft palate, there may be occult  删除换行1 submucosal cleft of the palate, where there is an intact  删除换行1 mucous membrane but lack of fusion of muscle masses  删除换行1 in the midline. Such submucosal cleft may cause the  删除换行1 child to have a typical 'cleft palate speech'. Clefts of the  删除换行1 lip and palate are more common on the left side, probably  删除换行1 because this palatal process is the last to assume a  删除换行1 horizontal position. Bifid uvula is the most common form  删除换行1 of cleft palate. This occurs in approximately 2% of the  删除换行1 population. The incidence of cleft palate alone in the  删除换行1 general population is approximately 1 : 2000. The  删除换行1 premaxilla contains 4 incisor teeth.\n\n【30】Aetiology.— Aetiology of this congenital defect has  删除换行1 remained totally unknown. Vitamin A and corticosteroids,  删除换行1 given during pregnancy, have produced cleft palate in the  删除换行1 newly born in case of animals.\n\n【31】删除3：<u>Fig.4.6.— Shows different types of cleft palate. A — shows bifid uvula. B — shows bifid whole length soft palate.</u>\nC — Cleft extends into the hard palate. D — Complete cleft palate extending into one side of the premaxilla.\nE — shows complete cleft palate with failure of fusion of the premaxilla so that the cleft has taken the shape of  删除换行1 y and the premaxilla is not attached to the palate but hangs down from the septum of the nose.\n\n【32】CLEFT LIP\n\n【33】1. Difficulties in sucking.— The negative pressure  删除换行1 which is required for sucking cannot be produced. So  删除换行1 spoon feeding is to be restored to.\n\n【34】2. Difficulty in eating.— Regurgitation of food into  删除换行1 the nose makes eating difficult. But adults are seen with  删除换行1 cleft palate who have grown up without surgery and are  删除换行1 well nourished.\n3. Difficulty in speech.— A person with cleft palate  删除换行1 is unable to pronounce the palatal consonants. These are 删除换行5 B, D, K, P, T. There will be nasal intonation. This is  删除换行1 due to the fact that air comes out through the nose  删除换行1 while talking. During speech and swallowing the palate  删除换行1 moves both superiorly and posteriorly against the posterior  删除换行1 pharyngeal wall to separate the oropharynx from  删除换行1 nasopharynx. This is known as 'velopharyngeal closure'.\nSuch closure allows increased intraoral pressure for release  删除换行1 with certain sounds in speech. In case of cleft palate  删除换行1 such closure is not possible, so air escapes into the  删除换行1 nasopharynx during speech to cause hypernasal speech.\n\n【35】4. Difficulty in hearing.— If a palatal repair is not  删除换行1 done, acute and chronic otitis media may develop.\nInflammatory oedema of the pharyngeal mucosa and  删除换行1 defective muscular activity will impede the ventilation and  删除换行1 drainage of the middle ear through the Eustachian tube.\nThis may lead to accumulation of inflammatory exudate  删除换行1 and deafness.\n\n【36】5. Dental problems.— Various problems of dentition  删除换行1 may be due to irregular development of the alveolus.\nThe alveolar cleft interferes with the dental lamina and  删除换行1 the upper lateral incisor may be small, absent or even  删除换行1 duplicated. All the incisors are badly displaced in bilateral  删除换行1 cleft. Relative mandibular prognathism may also result.\n\n【37】6. Defect in smelling.— This is due to contamination  删除换行1 of the nasal mucous membrane with the oral organisms  删除换行1 through the cleft palate.\n\n【38】7. Repeated respiratory tract infection.\n\n【39】8. There may be chance of aspiration 删除换行1 bronchopneumonia.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

This patient demonstrates several characteristics classic for neurofibromatosis type 1 (also known as von Recklinghausen disease). Potential findings include café au lait spots, two or more neurofibromas, optic glioma, iris hamartomas (Lisch nodules), a positive family history (autosomal dominant inheritance), and a distinctive bony lesion such as sphenoid dysplasia or scoliosis. Patients with this disease generally demonstrate 95% of the criteria by age 8 years and all of the criteria by age 20. These patients are also at increased risk for tumors. The gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 17.  \nAnswer A is incorrect. Bilateral acoustic neuromas are characteristic of neurofibromatosis type 2. It is much less common than type 1 and typically manifests with multiple central nervous system tumors. The NF 2 gene is located on chromosome 22.  \nAnswer B is incorrect. Bilateral renal cell carcinoma occurs in von Hippel-Lindau disease, an autosomal dominant disease that is characterized by hemangioblastomas of the retina, cerebellum, and medulla. About half of patients develop bilateral renal cell carcinomas. The disease is associated with the deletion of the VHL gene located on chromosome 3, which is a tumor suppressor gene.  \nAnswer C is incorrect. Cystic medial necrosis of the aorta leading to aortic insufficiency and dissecting aortic aneurysm is associated with Marfan syndrome, a connective tissue disorder caused by the autosomal dominant inheritance of a defective fibrillin gene.  \nAnswer D is incorrect. Leptomeningeal angioma is associated with Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS), which is a rare congenital vascular disorder of unknown etiology affecting capillary-sized blood vessels.

It is rare for liver enzymes to be elevated or for there to be any hepatic sequelae in the mother； however， every patient who is suspected of having cholestasis of pregnancy should have their liver enzymes checked to avoid fetal morbid-ity and mortality. Hepatic enzyme levels are normally <3 U/L； women with intrahepatic cholestasis may have slightly elevated levels but almost never in the thousands. On presentation， no rash typically accompanies the pruritus. Thrombocytopenia is not involved in this disorder； however， it is involved in a life-threatening condition of pregnancy known as HELLP (hemolysis， elevated liver enzymes， low platelets) syndrome.\n\n【31】14.22D D. PUPPP is not thought to be associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. The diagnosis is made presumptively based on clinical presentation， with the rash almost always starting on or near the abdominal striae of the abdomen. They are usually small red\"bumps\"that are intensely pruritic. The treatment is symptom-atic. Interestingly， this condition usually occurs with the first pregnancy and usually does not recur， with the most common onset at 35 to 36 weeks'gestation.\n\n【32】14.3B. Neonatal lesions are sometimes seen with herpes gestationis caused by the IgG antibodies crossing the placenta， and these lesions will resolve. Herpes gestationis is not the same as herpes simplex virus. The latter would necessitate cesarean delivery to avoid infection to the baby.\n\n【33】14.4 4 B. H ypoglycemia is relatively unique to acute fatty liver of pregnancy. Because of the liver insufficiency， glycogen storage is compromised leading to low serum glucose levels， which often require multiple doses of dextrose. Protein-uria is more consistent with preeclampsia， oligohydramnios is nonspecific， and bile acids are more consistent with ICP.\n\n【34】14.5. B. The biophysical profile in this case is 8/10 but with low amniotic fluid volume (oligohydramnios). The oligohydramnios is concerning and is associ-ated with a 20 to 40x increase in fetal death as compared to normal amniotic fluid. Thus， the best management in this setting is induction of labor.

Intensive care settings and/or major surgical procedures are risk factors for delirium， especially for geriatric patients. He also experienced waxing and waning of consciousness and was disoriented. The short-term nature of the event and the fluctuations in attention and awareness observed are consistent with delirium.\n\n【19】APPROACHTO：\n\n【20】DEFINITIONS\n\n【21】ATTENTION： Ability to maintain focus on a particular stimulus or activity.\n\n【22】AWARENESS： Orientation to situation and surroundings.\n\n【23】SUNDOWNING： A phenomenon characterized by worsening of neurocognitive symptoms during the late afternoon or evening hours， usually in elderly and/or cognitively impaired individuals.\n\n【24】CLINICAL APPROACH\n\n【25】Diagnosis and Clinical Presentation\n\n【26】The hallmark of delirium is a fluctuation in the level of attention and awareness over a short period of time. The Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) can be used to evaluate for delirium. Associated symptoms， indicating a disturbance in cognition， include memory deficits， visuospatial dysfunction， and perceptual disturbances， such as visual hallucinations. These can result in behavioral prob-lems that interfere with management， such as agitation， wandering， pulling out intravenous lines， catheters， and so forth. If substance intoxication/withdrawal is present but delirium symptoms predominate， the diagnosis of substance intoxication/withdrawal delirium should be made. Table 46-1 lists the diagnostic criteria for delirium.\n\n【27】Delirium is a medical and psychiatric emergency， often describedaS acute brain failure.\" It should be viewed as akin to failure of other organ systems(ie， heart failure， respiratory failure， or renal failure). Early recognition and treat-ment are essential to prevent progression to stupor， coma， or death. Delirium carries a poor prognosis. Mortality 1 year after diagnosis is estimated to be up to 40%. The prevalence of delirium is highest among hospitalized elderly， with 10% to 30%of the elderly in the emergency department experiencing delirium. It can be seen\n\n【28】Table 46-1·DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA FOR DELIRIUMa\n\n【29】Disturbance in baseline attention and awareness.\n\n【30】The disturbance develops over a short period oftime (hours to days) and fluctuates in severity over 删除换行1 the course of the day. A disturbance in cognition such as memory deficit， language， visuospatial ability， or perception is present. The disturbances are not better explained by a neurocognitive disorder and do not occur in the 删除换行1 context of a severely reduced level of arousal，such as coma.\n\n【31】There is evidence from the history， physical examination， or laboratory findings that the distur-bance is a direct physiologic consequence of another medical condition，substance intoxication or withdrawal，exposure to a toxin， or due to multiple etiologies.\n\n| Table 46-2·PRECIPITANTS OF DELIRIUM  |\n| --- |\n| Acute intermittent porphyria Cardiovascular diseases： arrhythmias， heart failure， myocardial infarction Central nervous system disorders： brain trauma， epilepsy，neoplasm， cerebral vascular accident，subdural hematoma， vasculitis Drugs of abuse (in intoxication or withdrawal)： alcohol，barbiturates， benzodiazepines，narcoticsElectrolyte imbalances Endocrine disorders： adrenal insufficiency， hypoglycemia， parathyroid dysfunction Hepatic encephalopathy Infections： urinary tract infection， pneu monia， sepsis， meningitis， encephalitis Medications： anticholinergics，anticonvulsants， antihypertensive agents， antiparkinsonian agents，H， blockers， digitalis， corticosteroids， narcotics，benzodiazepines Pulmonary disorders： hypercarbia， hypoxemia Sleep deprivation Uremia Vasculitis Vitamin deficiencies： B， folic acid，thiamine  |\n\n【33】System titles are bolded.\n\n【34】in 15% to 53% of elderly patients postoperatively， and 70% to 87% in the intensive care unit. Delirium occurs in up to 60% of individuals in nursing homes and 83%of all individuals at the end of life.\n\n【35】Risk Factors for Delirium. Any disease process， illicit substance， toxin， or medi-cation that affects the central nervous system can cause delirium. Risk factors include dementia， elderly age， medical illness， polypharmacy， and recent sur-gery. Several causes of delirium may be present simultaneously. Table 46-2 lists many of the causes of delirium. A mnemonic for common contributing factors to the development of delirium in those with preexisting cognitive impairment is PInCH ME： Pain， Infection， Constipation， Hydration status， Medications， Environment.\n\n【36】Evaluation. Evaluation of delirium should include an assessment of potential contributing factors. History and physical examination findings should guide further workup. Mental status exams should include cognitive testing. Bedside testing， such as pulse oximetry， electrocardiography， fingerstick glucose testing， arterial blood gas analysis， and bladder scan， may reveal hypoxemia， hypercapnia， hypo/hyperglycemia， or urinary retention. Laboratory and radiographic studies to consider include a comprehensive metabolic panel with ammonia， complete blood count with leukocyte differential， Band folate levels， urinalysis， urine drug screen， blood and urine cultures， cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis and culture， and chest radiography. Electroencephalography (EEG) has poor sensitivity and specificity for delirium but may help in ruling out nonconvulsive epilepsy. EEG findings sugges-tive of delirium include increased generalized slow-wave activity， which may also be seen in dementia. Delirium seen with alcohol withdrawal is associated with increased fast waves on EEG. Further laboratory testing may be needed as dictated by the clinical condition of the patient.\n\n【37】Table 46-3·CHARACTERISTICS OF DELIRIUM AND NEUROCOGNITIVE\n\n| Table 46-3·CHARACTERISTICS OF DELIRIUM AND NEUROCOGNITIVE DISORDER (NCD)  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Characteristic  | Delirium  | NCD  |\n| Onset  | Short  | Long  |\n| Course  | Fluctuating  | Stable  |\n| Level of alertness  | Hypoactive， hyperactive， mixed  | Stable  |\n| Prognosis  | Reversible  | Irreversible  |\n\n【39】Differential Diagnosis\n\n【40】Major neurocognitive disorder (formerly dementia) increases the risk of developing delirium， but delirium cannot be diagnosed if the condition is better explained by a neurocognitive disorder. This can be clinically challenging because both delirium and neurocognitive disorder can exhibit similar symptoms (eg， memory impair-ment， cognitive disturbances， and behavioral problems). Several characteristics help distinguish between the two， which are compared in Table 46-3. Delirium is typically fluctuating and more acute， whereas neurocognitive disorder is more stable and chronic.\n\n【41】Other diseases in the differential diagnosis for delirium include psychotic dis-orders such as schizophrenia and acute mania. However， individuals with delirium display a fluctuating level of consciousness， and patients with schizophrenia and mania usually maintain an alert level of consciousness. Delirious patients often have visual hallucinations， but primary psychotic disorders more frequently mani-fest as auditory hallucinations and delusions. Delirium associated with fear， anxi-ety， and dissociative symptoms can appear similar to acute stress disorder， which is precipitated by exposure to a severe traumatic event.\n\n【42】Ireatment\n\n【43】Addressing Underlying Issues. The cornerstone of treatment for delirium is identifi-cation and correction of the underlying abnormality. This approach ideally results in reversal of the delirious state， typically over the course of 1 week. However， patients may show subtle signs of delirium for months afterward. Thoroughly review the medication list as a preventive measure. Common iatrogenic causes include sedative-hypnotics (ie， benzodiazepines)， anticholinergics， H -receptor antagonists， corticosteroids， narcotics， and antibiotics (especially fluoroquino-lones). Discontinue or switch medications if this is an option. Consider dexme-detomidine or other agents instead of a benzodiazepine for sedation of critically ill individuals.\n\n【44】Assessing Psycbomotor Activity. The level of psychomotor activity exhibited by the patient helps to guide the treatment approach. Hyperactive delirium is charac-terized by a high level of psychomotor activity that may be accompanied by mood lability， agitation， and refusal to cooperate with care. Hypoactive delirium mani-fests as decreased psychomotor activity that may be associated with sluggishness， lethargy， or stupor. In mixed delirium， one may have a normal level of psychomo-tor activity but altered awareness and alertness. Alternatively， mixed delirium may 删除换行1 present with rapid fluctuation of activity level， similar to the patient described in the case above. It is important to note that hypoactive delirium may go unnoticed due to its less disruptive nature.\n\n【45】Pain Control. Maintain adequate pain control to avoid precipitating delirium. The concept of the “ICU triad， which consists of pain， agitation， and delirium， emphasizes the interrelationship among these conditions. The treatment of one affects the others. Opiates are the medications of choice for treatment of nonneu-ropathic pain. However， opiates can worsen delirium if dosed too high. Meperidine and codeine should in particular be avoided.\n\n【46】Environmental Modification. Environmental modification is another significant aspect of the treatment approach. Hospitalization can be very distressing and disorienting. The presence of family members； items from home (ie， pictures)； and reminders of location， date， and time help maintain patient orientation. Efforts should be made to reduce excess noise， dim the lights at night， and clus-ter care activities to minimize disruption to the patient's sleep-wake cycle. Mini-mize\"tethers， such as IV lines， urinary catheters， telemetry wires， and restraints. Restraints may be indicated， however， if the patient poses a risk to himself or others.\n\n【47】Pbarmacotberapy. If behavioral interventions do not adequately manage agita-tion， pharmacologic intervention may be necessary. Judicious use of antipsychotics can be implemented for delirium not caused by alcohol or benzodiazepine with-drawal. The decision to use antipsychotics should not be taken lightly， as these medications have been linked to an increased risk of mortality in the elderly. Special caution should be exercised when treating patients with known baseline QTc pro-longation， patients receiving other QTc prolonging agents， and individuals with a history of torsade de pointes.\n\n【48】Options for antipsychotics include haloperidol and droperidol. Newer atypical antipsychotics， such as risperidone， olanzapine， and quetiapine， are also increas-ingly used due to favorable side effects. Benzodiazepines should be avoided except when treating alcohol or sedative-hypnotic withdrawal. In patients in sedative-hypnotic withdrawal， vitamin B should be replaced due to the risk of vitamin B deficiency. The Revised Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol (CIWA-Ar) scale can be used in gauging the severity of alcohol with-drawal and determining the dose of benzodiazepines needed. Cholinergics like physostigmine and donepezil can be considered for delirium secondary to anticholinergics. Paralysis and mechanical ventilation may be needed for management. Electroconvulsive therapy may be considered for some cases of delirium caused by neuroleptic malignant syndrome where the benefit outweighs the risk.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "8c88fbea-fc78-4a8d-8835-5d7c481247ce", "title": null, "text": "【0】Session 10\n\n【1】The next session addressed the last core treatment strategy: perceptual mirror retraining. During this session, the therapist introduced mirror retraining as a strategy that targets the detailed manner of examining one’s appearance, which is exacerbated by mirror checking. She asked Carrie whether there were any disadvantages to attending to one’s appearance in this way. Carrie responded that this type of checking only made her overemphasize the importance of her appearance. The therapist also added that a detailed examination of one’s appearance could also lead to an exaggerated distortion of what the body part looks like. She demonstrated the problem of selective attention by having Carrie stare at a small mole on the therapist’s face for 60 s. Afterwards, the therapist asked Carrie what she learned. She stated that the mole seemed to appear bigger the longer she looked at it. The therapist explained that the goal of mirror retraining is to develop a healthy relationship with the mirror, rather than discontinue using the mirror, by learning to use it only during times when it serves a practical function, for example, when getting dressed for work. She further explained that mirror retraining involves a mindfulness component such that it requires to observe and describe each body part objectively, using nonjudgmental language and for equal amounts of time.\n\n【2】The therapist taught Carrie during the session to stand at an arm’s length in front of a full-length mirror and begin by describing her appearance from her head to her toes in neutral, objective, and nonjudgmental terms. Carrie was extremely uneasy about participating in this exercise, so the therapist modeled this briefly using herself as a model, emphasizing the equal amount of time she spent on each body part, and the mindfulness involved in describing qualities of her appearance in terms of color, texture, length, and width. When it was Carrie’s turn to begin the exercise, she stood in front of the mirror looking at her face and immediately began crying. The therapist asked her to identify whether any negative thoughts came up, and Carrie responded that she felt that today was such a bad day to do this exercise because she felt particularly ugly. The therapist helped her evaluate this thought by asking her whether her feelings always reflected facts. She also asked Carrie if it would help her to view this exercise as akin to taking an Advil when she had a bad headache, and that perhaps practicing mirror retraining on a particularly bad day could provide even more relief for her appearance concerns than on other days. These rational responses helped Carrie get through the exercise. The therapist suggested that for homework, she practice generating rational responses for negative thoughts beforehand and to practice mirror retraining at least three times per day.\n\n【3】Sessions 11–20\n\n【4】These sessions provided an opportunity to continue practicing with already learned skills (cognitive restructuring, exposure, ritual prevention, and perceptual retraining), as well as to learn advanced cognitive strategies and to introduce modular components of treatment that were specifically tailored to Carrie. For example, Carrie benefited from an exploration of deeper-level core beliefs through exercises such as the downward arrow technique and self-esteem pie, which helped her understand the negative consequences of holding such beliefs and helped her to evaluate the validity of these beliefs. For example, using the downward arrow technique, Carrie was asked for the meaning of her thoughts repeatedly until she discovered her core negative beliefs about herself 删除33：<u></u>. Then, the therapist asked her about the usefulness of having the core belief “I am unworthy,” and Carrie expressed how it just makes her feel more miserable. When examining the evidence for the intermediate belief that nobody wants to be around her, Carrie reported that even if her boyfriend or her friends initiated plans to spend time with her, she assumed that they were just being nice. Thus, Carrie learned that her core beliefs served as a lens through which all of her interpretations were made, and she had never bothered to check out these automatic assumptions.\n\n【5】删除3：<u>Fig. 18.1\n\n【6】Carrie’s deeper-level beliefs using the downward arrow technique</u>\n\n【7】Using the self-esteem pie exercise, the therapist asked Carrie to first list out all positive and negative components of her self-esteem. Carrie identified the following aspects: appearance, intelligence, personality, her job, and her relationships. She was then asked to draw a large circle and carve out slices for each component of her self-esteem. After this, it was clear that Carrie had placed greatest importance on her appearance, which she believed was a negative component, as her appearance slice took up about 75 % of the pie. The therapist then challenged Carrie to identify some of her strengths and talents and even asked her if she could identify some aspects of her appearance that she liked. Through this discussion, Carrie learned that she believed that she was quite smart and had a very caring personality. She actually quite liked the shape of her legs and her eye color. She was also quite proud of her achievements at work, as her supervisors told her that she was a conscientious worker and had become a resourceful member of her team. After calling upon these experiences that she was initially quick to ignore and dismiss and discussing the advantages and disadvantages of overvaluing appearance, Carrie revised her self-esteem pie with more balanced slices.\n\n【8】Furthermore, sessions were spent on treatment modules that were tailored to Carrie. For example, given that her depression contributed to her avoidance of going to work and social activities, one session was spent on strategies that could specifically target her depression. Carrie learned how to apply her cognitive restructuring skill to her depressogenic negative thoughts and became aware of her common errors in thinking related to depression. She also learned how to plan pleasant or masterful activities into her schedule each week, such as going to a yoga class, joining a book club, and calling her cousin who lived in another state.\n\n【9】Another module that was applicable to Carrie was the cosmetic surgery module, as Carrie expressed strong urges to receive more aggressive dermatological treatment for her acne. The primary approach in addressing her urges was to use motivational interviewing and Socratic questioning techniques to discuss the pros and cons of getting more treatment. The therapist also helped Carrie identify cognitive errors in her thinking by asking her about what she feared would happen if she did not get the treatment. Despite this approach, Carrie was still pretty convinced that another dermatological treatment would resolve the problems she had with dermabrasion and make her feel less ugly. The therapist therefore asked Carrie how she would feel about delaying the treatment for another three months and taking her time thinking it through, given her bad experience with dermabrasion before. Carrie ultimately agreed with this plan because she was concerned about the risks.\n\n【10】Sessions 21–22\n\n【11】These final sessions constituted the relapse prevention and termination sessions. The purpose of these sessions was to transition Carrie’s responsibilities to become her own therapist and provide an opportunity to practice checking in with herself about ways to maintain her progress. In these last two sessions, the therapist assisted in reviewing strategies that Carrie found helpful and in anticipating upcoming challenges where she could begin to practice her skills. For example, Carrie mentioned that she had an upcoming work-related Christmas party, which her boyfriend would be attending with her. She reported anticipatory anxious thoughts about what people would think about her compared to her boyfriend and identified rational responses to begin evaluating the validity of these thoughts.\n\n【12】Posttreatment Assessment Results\n\n【13】By the end of treatment, Carrie scored a 14 on the BDD-YBOCS, which represented a 52 % reduction in BDD symptoms. She reported significantly less time spent preoccupied with thoughts about her appearance and engaging in rituals to relieve her concerns. She had continued to cut down her grooming ritual each morning to 15 min and reported having fewer negative thoughts about herself. She also scored a 10 on the BABS for her belief, “I am ugly,” which reflected a 41 % reduction in delusionality. Her BDD-SS questionnaire further indicated less avoidance of people, places, and activities; improved beliefs about the importance of appearance; and fewer rituals related to grooming and mirror checking.\n\n【14】Complicating Factors\n--------------------\n\n【15】For Carrie, the greatest complicating factor was her delusionality . The problem with delusionality is not just that it makes cognitive restructuring and data gathering more challenging, but it causes a general barrier to motivation for treatment because of a lack of buy-in to the rationale of CBT for BDD. This likely contributed to ambivalence about the efficacy of the CBT program and core treatment techniques, as well as resistance to completing between-session homework assignments. Carrie’s degree of conviction that she was truly ugly and that all of her problems stemmed from this also contributed to her decision to seek nonpsychiatric treatments. Cognitive restructuring was especially difficult for Carrie due to her delusionality , as she was susceptible to confirmation biases when she attempted to seek out new information in her exposure exercises, especially as it related to facial expressions. For example, she often found that even though she met her behavioral goals during exposures, she was convinced that she often received dirty looks from other attractive people and that they were thinking negative thoughts about her appearance, which made it difficult for her to make accurate interpretations about having completed a successful exposure.\n\n【16】Another complicating factor was Carrie’s comorbid depression and suicidality, which was secondary to her BDD, but further contributed to her social avoidance. Indeed, her depression had exacerbated so much at the beginning of treatment that a detailed discussion of safety and suicidal ideation was indicated at each early session. The safety plan that was generated early on in treatment was continually referred to during treatment, and emergency procedures, which represented later steps in the safety plan, were reviewed and defined repeatedly. To further address her depression, session content was applied to examples of her worsened mood during her week. For example, Carrie identified negative thoughts about being a bad friend and girlfriend, which were less related to her appearance concerns but were still amenable to the cognitive restructuring skills.\n\n【17】Conclusions and Key Practice Points\n-----------------------------------\n\n【18】CBT for BDD is similar to CBT for other psychiatric disorders in terms of the basic model and core treatment principles. However, there are important differences. One of the key issues in treatment is that individuals with BDD are overly focused on the importance of appearance. BDD patients are not able to see themselves holistically and instead focus on their perceived flaw, to the exclusion of appreciating almost everything else about them. A large focus of the treatment is therefore to notice all of their features (not just the ones they do not like) when they look in the mirror and to make an effort to notice other, nonappearance related qualities in other people. Finally, they need to learn to base a larger part of their self-esteem on nonappearance qualities.\n\n【19】Another unique clinical feature is that individuals with BDD may exhibit elaborate delusions of reference about others thinking of and mocking their appearance. In some cases, they may develop complex delusions about the social and career advantages of being attractive. Rather than engage the patient in an argument about the validity of his or her beliefs, it is best to adopt a curious approach to his or her interpretations and help the patient consider the usefulness (evaluating pro’s and con’s) of holding these beliefs.\n\n【20】BDD is also associated with particularly high rates of attempted and completed suicide. In general, CBT is efficacious for many patients with suicidal ideation; however, some patients (especially those with active suicidal ideation) may require a higher level of care and some patients may need CBT augmented with psychotropic medication. For patients at a higher risk of suicide , a safety plan 删除10：<u>(American Psychiatric Association 2003 )</u> would be important to generate together at one of the earliest sessions, which would describe a list of steps to take when suicidal ideation worsens and which would list the therapist’s emergency contact and nearest emergency room as the last steps. Ongoing suicide assessment would be required at subsequent sessions using both a depression self-report questionnaire and direct questioning.\n\n【21】Finally, as with all psychological treatments, it is important to begin establishing a strong alliance with the patient early on in treatment. We have found in our experience treating patients with BDD that a common issue involves motivation for treatment and ambivalence about receiving psychological treatment. Addressing their ambivalence from the outset is strongly recommended, as it facilitates the discussion of advantages and disadvantages of CBT, as compared to their past treatment approaches and promotes readiness for change .\nTable 18.2 删除换行 Key practice points for treating BDD\n\n| 1\\.

Our experience, together with empirical data 删除10：<u>(Wilhelm et al. 2011 , 2013 , 2014 )</u>, have shown that CBT is acceptable and efficacious for this patient population. Patients often achieve meaningful reductions in their BDD-related thoughts, avoidance behaviors, and rituals, as well as greater flexibility in their beliefs about the importance of appearance.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

He has a past medical history of exercise- and allergy-induced asthma and growth hormone deficiency, for which he takes growth hormone. He has a significant family history of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Labs unremarkable; VS unremarkable; 50 kg.\n\n【9】Preoperative Evaluation\n-----------------------\n\n【10】Questions\n\n【11】1.  1.\n    What respiratory effects would you expect with a posterior mediastinal mass? Are they always without respiratory effects? Would it matter if it was a left-sided or a right-sided mass? Other considerations for anesthesia and surgery?\n2.  2.\n    What are your recommendations for postoperative analgesia ? Any special considerations for implementing this plan?\n3.  3.\n    Does this patient need an ICU bed to be booked postoperatively?\n\n【12】Answers\n\n【13】1.  1.\n    Masses of the posterior mediastinum are usually of neurogenic origin (neurofibromas, schwannomas, and benign ganglioneuromas) from the sympathetic chain. Tumors derived from the neural crest, such as neuroblastoma and pheochromocytoma, may also, rarely, occur 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. These tumors can grow quite large without significant encroachment on adjacent structures or exerting a mass effect on the middle or superior mediastinum, so it is rare for patients with posterior mediastinal masses to have respiratory distress, unlike patients with an anterior mediastinal mass. A CT scan or MRI will reveal the relevant thoracic relationships. For patients with signs and symptoms suggesting respiratory obstruction such as stridor or even persistent cough, it will be worthwhile to obtain pulmonary function tests in order to anticipate treatment with bronchodilators or postoperative mechanical ventilation. For masses that are large enough, venous drainage from the head and neck may be impaired, more likely with a right-sided rather than left-sided mass, resulting in the superior vena cava syndrome. Such patients may require vascular access below the chest, rather than in the upper extremities.\n2.  2.\n    Adequate postoperative analgesia can be accomplished by a variety of means, including patient-controlled analgesia as well as a few different nerve block strategies. The surgeons could perform intercostal blocks under direct vision through the thoracoscope, although this would be a single-injection technique which would probably last for 6–8 hours. Continuous catheter techniques would provide longer duration analgesia and could be furnished via a unilateral paravertebral approach, an epidural approach, or an erector spinae approach. Each has specific advantages and disadvantages. An important consideration for this specific case is that it would be worth waiting until the end of surgery to make sure that intervertebral foramina were free of tumor before placement of any catheters, regardless of approach. If there is any doubt, local infiltration and PCA remain the reasonable strategies.\n3.  3.\n    In all likelihood the patient will not need an ICU bed unless intraoperative events dictate otherwise.\n\n【14】Intraoperative Course\n---------------------\n\n【15】Questions\n\n【16】1.  1.\n    In addition to routine noninvasive monitors , do you need an arterial line for this case? Central access? Why/why not? What other non-routine monitors might be required?\n2.  2.\n    How can you accomplish one- lung ventilation in this in a 50 kg adolescent? What are the available choices? What effective lumen size will you be dealing with, based on your choices? Why can’t you find a right-sided double-lumen tube in the anesthesia workroom? What ventilatory adjustments will you need to make as you change over from two-lung to one-lung ventilation? Does this changeover affect minute ventilation?\n3.  3.\n    Assume that the patient did have abnormal vital signs preoperatively with a heart rate of 110 and blood pressure of 150/104; what are your considerations for diagnosis of this posterior mediastinal mass? What is your basis for suspecting this diagnosis? Does the case need to be canceled for these vital signs? What if your first blood pressure was 185/122?\n4.  4.\n    In the left lateral position with one- lung ventilation and the surgeons dissecting in the mediastinum, the oxygen saturations have decreased to 89% with an FiO2 of 1.0. Why is this happening? Are there equipment-related causes? Mechanical causes? Pulmonary causes? Cardiac causes? What will likely correct the situation? How would each of these interventions work? No matter what you do, you are not able to get the saturation above 93%; what maneuvers are left?\n5.  5.\n    The SpO2 is now 88% on 100% O2 and the blood pressure 60/40 mmHg; how does this influence your analysis? What would you do? What do you think is going on? Can altering your ventilation affect this situation? Would you ask the surgeons to do anything differently?\n\n【17】Answers\n\n【18】1.  1.\n    The need for an arterial line is influenced by the extent of the tumor and its local and potential systemic effects as well as how much anticipated dissection there will be according to the surgeons. In addition, if there is a component of airway compromise because of the size of the tumor and its mass effect on the middle or superior mediastinum, an arterial line should be considered along with ICU monitoring postoperatively. Adequate vascular access is crucial, and this patient should have (at least) 2 large-bore IVs; if the tumor results in a superior vena cava syndrome, then IV access should probably be in the lower extremities. A CVP might assist with assessing intravascular volume but the absolute number would not be diagnostic nor could it be relied upon intraoperatively as long as intrathoracic pressures were being manipulated and scopes were surrounding it. As the vena cava is dissected, the assessment may become unreliable as a result of mechanical displacement or intrathoracic pressure from insufflation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n2.  2.\n    There are several devices that are useful in small adults. Double-lumen tubes for a 50 kg adolescent boy can be utilized. Depending on the patient’s appearance, a size up to 35 French can be utilized. A 32 French would not be unreasonable if the 35 was felt to be inappropriate.\n    A 28 French would have a very small intraluminal diameter for one-lung ventilation during the case and is not really clinically acceptable. A bronchial blocker technique or Univent or Arndt tube can be utilized and would allow a larger lumen endotracheal tube. Right-sided DLTs are relatively hard to find. Roughly speaking, the total available lung parenchyma will be halved, but the minute ventilation requirements will be the same because the CO2 production will remain the same. Again, roughly speaking, I would decrease the tidal volume by 50% and look at the tidal volume/compliance to determine the volume I could deliver at an acceptable peak airway pressure. At that point, the minute ventilation required (should be the same as with two-lung ventilation) needs to be divided by the (tolerable) tidal volume in order to calculate the respiratory rate.\n3.  3.\n    Posterior mediastinal masses are often neurogenic in origin, commonly arising from derivatives of the neural crest and its caudal migration in fetal life 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. This germ line gives rise to pheochromocytomas, neuroblastomas, and more rarely, ganglioneuromas, ganglioneuroblastomas, and paragangliomas. With an elevation in the resting heart rate and blood pressure, and especially with the significantly increased blood pressure that may occur preoperatively or following anesthetic induction, one has to carefully consider pheochromocytoma or catecholamine-secreting neuroblastoma in the differential. Inasmuch as this is an urgent but not emergent case, it would be very reasonable to not proceed with surgical resection, but retain the lines that were placed, go to the ICU, and spend the next 24 hours restoring blood volume and blocking the patient in order to attenuate the endogenous catecholamine response.\n4.  4.\n    There are several potential causes for hypoxemia with one- lung ventilation , either by themselves or in combination. First of all, the change in position to left lateral decubitus changes ventilation perfusion matching in the lungs, and therefore physiological shunting will contribute to a change in the efficiency of oxygenation. There can be mechanical problems with incomplete location of the left-sided endobronchial tube into the left mainstem bronchus. An increase in airway reactivity may also be associated with lighter anesthesia, underlying reactive airway disease under the influence of a foreign body at the level of the carina. Finally, there may be suboptimal alveolar expansion of the “down” lung, therefore influencing closing capacity as well as adequacy of pulmonary circuit blood flow. All of these may be improved by carefully examining and confirming tube position and adequacy of the left mainstem bronchus seal; optimal ventilatory strategies including “best tidal volume” in relation to lung expansion, oxygen saturation, and capnograph morphology; passive oxygenation of the “up lung” with low flow oxygen (low enough not to provide continuous positive airway pressure of its own to the alveoli in the “up” lung); and clearing of secretions with attentive pulmonary toilet. Airway reactivity may be treated with bronchodilators (inhalation or systemic) and mechanical suctioning of the airway. If all of these maneuvers do not result in improvement, then the tube may have to be pulled back to a mid-tracheal position and used to ventilate both lungs.\n5.  5.\n    There is cardiovascular compromise likely as a result of impaired venous return, mediastinal shifting, and shifting of the interventricular septum (or some combination thereof) because of the influence of pressure in the right chest. I would ask the surgeons to immediately decompress the chest after making sure that there was no immediately obvious surgical injury/vascular injury as a result of the dissection. A lower insufflation pressure will likely help this situation.\n\n【19】Postoperative Course\n--------------------\n\n【20】Questions\n\n【21】1.  1.\n    Because the surgeon had concerns about placement of a regional block before he could fully evaluate the extent of the mass, he requested that any regional blockade be placed at the end of the case. What options are available to you? Which would be most effective for perioperative analgesia? What are the risks and benefits to each of these alternatives?\n\n【22】Answers\n\n【23】1.  1.\n    Regional anesthetic techniques include thoracic epidural anesthesia, thoracic paravertebral blockade, multiple intercostal blocks, interpleural analgesia, erector spinae plane block, and serratus anterior blocks. The current literature is characterized by enthusiastic advocates and often enthusiastic detractors of the various techniques. In addition, the routine use of ultrasound guidance has allowed this proliferation of choices. Thoracic epidural analgesia was long revered as the gold standard for chest wall pain, but myofascial plane blocks (serratus anterior, ES) and PVBs have become alternative options, and all reduce perioperative opioid use. Not all are equally effective with regard to complete analgesia of the chest wall and the specific risks and benefits should be considered when making recommendations to patients.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

This is a very common injury  删除换行1 classically caused by falling onto an outstretched hand breaking a fall.\nWhen taking the history, you should ascertain the dominant hand, premorbid function,  删除换行1 occupational status and hobbies as these may influence management.\nFracture patterns can be variable and hence these injuries need careful evaluation both clinically and radiologically as this guides management. The Frykman classification system is  删除换行1 used by orthopaedic specialists to grade injury (type I–VIII.)\nThis patient has a simple Colles type fracture, which may be treated with closed reduction in  删除换行1 the ED and immobilisation in a plaster of paris backslab. Adequate analgesia is essential for  删除换行1 proper reduction and good patient experience, and there several options:\n\n【12】1. Inhaled analgesia such as Entonox (nitrous oxide and oxygen) or Penthrox (methoxyflurane) may be adequate for minimally displaced fractures requiring the smallest of  删除换行1 interventions to improve position.\n2. Biers’ block is used in certain departments. It is a regional block technique performed by placing an inflated double tourniquet on the arm and then injecting a  删除换行1 measured dose of intravenous local anaesthetic (prilocaine) into the injured side.\n3. Haematoma blockade is probably the most commonly used regional anaesthetic  删除换行1 technique in the United Kingdom for distal radius fractures. Under strict aseptic  删除换行1 conditions with skin prep and sterile drapes, local anaesthetic (lidocaine or bupivacaine) is injected directly into the fracture site. Correct placement is confirmed by  删除换行1 first aspiration of ‘haematoma’. Safe doses of local anaesthetic must be observed with  删除换行1 typically 10–15 mL of 1% lidocaine being used depending on body weight. The block  删除换行1 is allowed to develop for around 20 minutes, after which the reduction may be carried out. Equipment must be on hand in case of local anaesthetic toxicity, but with  删除换行1 proper training and local protocol this is rare.\n\n【13】4. Procedural sedation may also be used but requires a trained operator and the appropriate monitored environment.\n\n【14】Reduction of the fracture is a straightforward process. You will need two assistants – one to  删除换行1 help with the reduction and one to plaster.\n1. Position the patient sitting up, with the shoulder abducted to 90 degrees and the  删除换行1 elbow flexed to 90 degrees and the palm prone. Ask an assistant to gently hold the  删除换行1 arm and provide counter traction. Take care when handling fragile skin in older  删除换行1 patients.\n2. Grasp the hand and slowly apply traction in the long axis of the radius. The key here  删除换行1 is to slowly apply force over 5–10 minutes to overcome the patient’s muscles and  删除换行1 disimpact the fracture.\n\n【15】3. Slightly dorsiflex the distal fragment to unhinge the periosteum whilst maintaining  删除换行1 traction and then bring the distal fragment downwards to restore normal anatomical alignment.\n\n【16】4. Maintain traction and ask your second assistant to apply a plaster of Paris backslab  删除换行1 extending from the metacarpal heads to around 6 cm below the elbow joint. The  删除换行1 wrist should be left either in a neutral position or slightly volar flexed. Gently compress the fracture site as the plaster hardens to provide additional support.\n\n【17】5. Document the neurovascular status post reduction and perform check radiographs.\nCase 48: Fall onto outstretched hand (FOOSH)\n\n【18】The patient should be assessed by physiotherapists and occupational therapists prior to discharge, and should be given a sling for support and written instructions for plaster care and  删除换行1 follow-up in the local fracture clinic.\n\n【19】These fractures do have a significant rate of movement, and the patient should be counselled  删除换行1 regarding this. If the reduction is not adequate, the fracture may need re-manipulation either  删除换行1 in the ED or in theatre and specialist help should be enlisted. Some fractures, particularly  删除换行1 multi-fragmentary ones, are inherently unstable and may be better suited to operative methods of fixation.\n\n【20】Key Points\n\n【21】• Take a comprehensive history including mechanism of injury, hand dominance,  删除换行1 pre-morbid functional status, occupation and history.\n• Always assess the joints above and below as there may be associated radial head  删除换行1 fractures and carpal bone injury.\n\n【22】• Closed reduction should be performed in a strict protocolised manner in accordance to local guidelines.\n\n【23】• Seek specialist advice with complex fracture patterns, intra-articular fractures,  删除换行1 inadequate reductions, open fractures and concomitant neurovascular injury.删除9：<u>http://taylorandfrancis.com171</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

TEN is characterized by widespread sloughing of the skin and the mucosa. Drug-induced CD8 cell activation is highly specific for particular HLA allotypes, placing certain populations at a greater risk for developing TEN 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\nThe majority of cases of toxic epidermal necrosis are the result of a hypersensitivity reaction to a drug. Other causative agents include Mycoplasma pneumonia, dengue virus, cytomegalovirus, and contrast medium 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. According to the 2008 Euro-SCAR study 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>, drugs associated with confirmed high risk of SJS/TEN includes nevirapine, lamotrigine, carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, cotrimoxazole, other anti-infective sulphonamides, sulphasalazine, allopurinol, oxicam-non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; 删除换行5 TEN most often begin with a prodrome of fever, malaise, anorexia, pharyngitis, headache, and rash, A painful macular exanthem appears in a symmetrical distribution on the face and trunk, spreading to the extremities. The skin develops the Nikolsky sign, whereby gentle lateral pressure causes the epidermis to slide over the basal layer. Blisters evolve and large sheets of epidermis slough off, leaving an exposed, weeping dermis. Ocular involvement with adhesions and ulceration can result in photophobia, pain, and loss of vision. TEN is more commonly seen with HIV, systemic lupus erythematosus collagen vascular diseases and malignancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Histologically, sections of skin from TEN exhibit widespread keratinocyte apoptosis. There is separation at the dermoepidermal junction and a mild mononuclear infiltrate is seen in the dermis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【34】TEN is considered part of a group of cutaneous hypersensitivity reactions with a spectrum of severity; erythema multiforme, followed by Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and TEN. SJS involves less than 10 % of the total body surface area, whereas TEN involves more than 30 % of the total body surface area. Total body surface area involvement between 10 and 30 % is known as SJS-TEN overlap 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【35】Infection is the most common cause of death in TEN. Other fatal complications include pulmonary embolism, adult respiratory distress syndrome, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, as well as cardiac and renal failure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【36】Distinguishing TEN syndrome from the other major potentially life-threatening cutaneous drug reactions with similar clinical features—Drug reactions with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), and erythroderma (exfoliative dermatitis)—is an important concern because treatment varies among these conditions. Clinically, the onset of eruption of SJS/TEN, AGEP, and erythroderma after drug ingestion is shorter and subsides sooner than in DRESS syndrome.\n\n【37】DRESS syndrome is characterized by facial edema, morbilliform eruption, pustules, exfoliative dermatitis, tense bullae, and possible target lesions. Lymph node enlargement, hepatitis and eosinophilia are also found 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【38】AGEP is first evident as an edematous erythema in the body folds and face before generalizing to widespread nonfollicular sterile pustules. It is associated with fever and neutrophilia, and spontaneously resolves in a few days. Like TEN and DRESS syndrome, it may result from a medication, often antibiotics or anticonvulsants, although it may be caused by a viral infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【39】Erythroderma, also referred to as generalized exfoliative dermatitis, is characterized by erythema and scaling of 90 % of the body surface area. It is classified as being caused by one of four etiologies: a flare of a preexisting skin disorder, such as psoriasis or atopic dermatitis; a drug eruption; a lymphoma/leukemia, such as mycosis fungoides; or idiopathic. Allopurinol is one of the most common causes of drug-induced erythroderma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【40】Treatment of TEN: Patients have to be admitted to intensive care or special burns units if they have significant skin necrosis and detachment. If the patient is conscious and able to sit/stand he can be treated in the high dependency unit (HDU). The cornerstone of TEN treatment is early cessation of the causative drug, meticulous skin care, fluid management, nutritional support, and surveillance as well as treatment of infections. General supportive measures include increasing the room temperature to 30–32 °C to reduce caloric loss through the skin, and anticoagulation with subcutaneous heparin or low molecular weight heparin to prevent deep vein thrombosis in immobile patients for the duration of their hospital stay. Pulmonary care is instituted via the use of aerosols, bronchial aspiration and physiotherapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【41】Skin care: Regular fluid release from fresh bullae using sterile needles, leaving the epidermis intact as its own dressing 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. Various biological dressings have also been suggested, as well as silver dressings due to their inherent antimicrobial properties. There are some reports of success with skin allotransplantation and hyperbaric oxygen 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. Daniel et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u> advocated easy cleaning with a spray-on bacteriologically pure thermal spring water spray (ATSW, Avene, France) and non-stick silicone dressings to areas where the skin had sloughed. A well skin healing occurred without infection or scarring.\n\n【42】Eye care: It is especially important in TEN. It was found that those given ocular topical steroids at disease onset had a statistically significantly better visual outcome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. The use of preservative-free lubricant eyedrops is recommended as preservatives cause ocular surface damage. Furthermore, eyedrops containing non-steroidal anti-inflammatories are to be avoided due to iatrogenic effects in this group of patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>.\n\n【43】Adjuvant medication controversy: No established standard or specific medical treatment for TEN. Neither Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) nor corticosteroids had any significant effect on mortality in comparison with supportive care only, although a trend for a beneficial effect of corticosteroids was noted 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. IVIG has been used as an off label treatment for TEN. A prospective, open study conducted in 34 patients given 2.0 g/kg of IVIG within 2 days showed no benefit in mortality or progression 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>.\n\n【44】Mycophenolate mofetil, ciclosporin, plasmapheresis, thalidomide and dapsone have all been tried with varying success in small case series, and mostly in conjunction with corticosteroids 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 , 10 , 18 \\]</u>.\n\n【45】Recently, HLA genotype testing, to prevent the administration of drugs to susceptible individuals, has proven to be an important tool in the prevention of TEN.

She had fever up to 39 °C, without shivering and convulsion, fever twice a day. She took ibuprofen and roxithromycin for 10 days. Intramuscular injections of unknown antipyretic medication were given twice on Day 2 and 4 of illness, her body temperature maintained 38.0 °C–39.0 °C. Then she was admitted to a local hospital. Due to significantly elevated WBC and CRP, she was suspected to have sepsis, and was given infusion of third-generation cephalosporin plus vitamin C for 7 days and IVIG 2.5 g for 3 days. She was afebrile for 4 days. On Day 13, her fever reoccurred, and her body temperature was 38.5 °C. She was transferred to our pediatric cardiology ward. Since the onset, she had good appetite and sleep. Physical examination could not find any abnormal signs. Her temperature was 37.0 °C, HR 130 bpm, RR 32 bpm, weight 5 kg.

After talking with her parents we learned that she had transient rashes on her hands when visiting at a local outpatient clinic. AKD was highly suspected, thus echo and BAVEP were ordered and she was given infusion of compound glycyrrhizin. On Day 18, she was afebrile for 36 h, diarrhea was reduced to three times per day.

On Day 22, body temperature up to 38.4 °C, accompanied with pharyngeal congestion. She took bufferin. On Day 23, her fever settled. Retested blood work revealed hs-cTnT 0.027 ng/mL, ALT 48 U/L, AST 50 U/L, CRP 15.90 mg/L, and ESR 47 mm/h.

We hypothesized that, at the early stage of her fever, the intramuscular injection of antipyretic medication she received was glucocorticoid. Thus, symptoms of KD were masked. Fortunately, she was given IVIG treatment for having sepsis before it was too late in a local hospital, which was the main reason of thrombocytosis when she was admitted in our ward, and she was in the subclinical stage of KD, platelets usually elevated. Because she was very young, had a persistent fever, had a poor response to antibiotic treatment, and her CRP was significantly increased, we suspected that she had KD. Echo test revealed coronary artery dilation, and then AKD was diagnosed. Though the doses of IVIG did not reach 2 g/kg, it was 18 days of illness, and fever retreated for more than 36 h. The inflammatory index was close to normal, so we did not continue to make up for it.\n2.  2.\n    When applying glucocorticoid (GC) to KD patients, the chance and the medication compatibility were important. Studies have shown that an initial treatment using combination of GC and IVIG can reduce the incidence of CAL and of unresponsiveness to initial treatment, and shorten fever duration. Also the combined treatment increases neither recurrence of KD nor incidence of adverse events 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 9 \\]</u>. A moderate-quality evidence shows that use of steroids in the acute phase of KD can improve coronary artery abnormalities, reduce hospitalization time, and decrease duration of clinical symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 , 11 \\]</u>. But single glucocorticoid is not recommended, indeed. Some doctors said single glucocorticoid treatment in KD was independent risk factor of coronary artery dilatation or CAA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. Most clinicians concern about that glucocorticoid usage at the early stage may mask typical symptoms in KD including conjunctival congestion, rashes, strikingly red lips, edema in hands and feet. She received two intramuscular injections of unidentified antipyretic reagents at the early stage of fever. They were very possible GCs.\n3.  3.\n    KD patient with coronary artery dilatation needs to take aspirin for a long period of time. Most coronary artery dilatation can be recovered within 2 years if patients continue to take aspirin. CAA remained stationary even after 2 years of onset similar with this case. However, some patients do develop thrombosis and coronary calcification in CAA 2 years later, even though they continue to take warfarin, aspirin, and dipyridamole .\n\n【25】Hong Wang", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

C： Repeat serum ferritin in 2 weeks\n\n【27】Here are the blood results with normal values in brackets：\n\n【28】CRP 20mg/I(<10)\n\n【29】These results support the clinical diagnosis of a viral illness. However， this child also has anaemia with low MCV， MCH， and MCHC. All these are suggestive of iron deficiency anaemia. The reticulocyte count is low， also supporting the diagnosis.\n\n【30】The history is not consistent with leukaemia， and the platelet count is normal.Haemoglobinopathies can show similar blood results， but are rare in Caucasians， and the serum ferritin can be high (rather than near the lower end of the range as in this child). Anaemia secondary to infection is usually a normocytic， normochromic anaemia. There is no history of blood loss in this child， and the platelet count is normal (a high platelet count， when present， may indicate ongoing occult blood loss).\n\n【31】Serum ferritin is a non-specific inflammatory marker， and can be elevated in the presence of any systemic infection， including viral illnesses. So the near normal serum ferritin value in this child does not preclude the diagnosis of iron deficiency.\n\n【32】The most common cause of a microcytic， hypochromic anaemia is iron deficiency， generally secondary to the poor dietary intake of iron (Box 5.1). However， malabsorption (as in coeliac disease) can present similarly； hence， it would be advisable to arrange a blood test for a coeliac screen for this child.

At hirth and during early infancy， the haemoglobin level falls and the iron content of the body is sufficient-meet the ongoing requirements. However， by the age of 4 months， neonatal iron stores are reduced eyhalf， and exogenous iron is required to maintain haemoglobin concentration during the rapid phase of srowth between 4 and 12 months.\n\n【40】Tme early introduction of unmodified cow's milk as the major milk source at around 6 months of age is me most common dietary characteristic of infants found to have iron deficiency anaemia at 1 year. In the Kiron deficiency is more common in those children consuming over 1 litre of cow’s milk daily and in  mose in whom unmodified cow’s milk was introduced before 8 months of age 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u>. Cow's milk is low in on， but the existing evidence suggests that other causes， including weaning foods， when not adequate miron content， are at least as important in causing iron deficiency. Deficiency of iron manifests initially as a fall in serum ferritin， and later on as a reduction in the haemoglobin concentration of the blood.\n\n【41】Host affected infants are asymptomatic. However， the deficiency can be associated with many systemic aonormalities： blue sclerae， koilonychia，impaired exercise capacity， and an increased susceptibility to mfection. Abnormal developmental performance and poor growth have also been reported.\n\n【42】Once diagnosed， management consists of iron supplementation that is to be continued until at least5months after the haemoglobin level reaches the normal value for the age. Attention to the diet and advice on improvement (including sufficient iron containing foods) will help to sustain the benefit of iron merapy (Box 5.2).\n\n【43】Box 5.2： Foods rich in iron\n\n| ●  | Apricots， prunes and raisins  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  | Beans and lentils  |\n|  | Eggs  |\n| ●  | Fish  |\n| ●  | Leafy green vegetables  |\n|  | Meat  |\n| ●  | Oatmeal  |\n|  | Tuna  |\n\n【45】Primary prevention can be achieved by ensuring sufficient dietary iron from 4 months of age and throughout the weaning period.

She could initially walk for 2–3 miles without any symptoms, but she had to gradually decrease this distance due to dyspnea and fatigue. Her symptoms were initially attributed to her aging and she did not seek further attention, however they continued to worsen. She eventually started feeling lightheaded and having chest pressure with exertion, at which point she went to the emergency department. A computed tomogram (CT) pulmonary angiography was performed showing large central pulmonary artery filling defects 删除33：<u></u>. Based on this she was diagnosed with an acute pulmonary embolus for which she was treated with catheter directed thrombolysis using tPA. Based on hospital reports, pulmonary artery pressures and angiographic imaging did not improve significantly after this procedure. Although lower extremity ultrasound did not exhibit any evidence of deep vein thrombosis, due to the size of the filling defects within the pulmonary vasculature on CT it was decided to proceed with an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter placement. During placement, venography revealed a duplicated IVC, therefore dual IVC filters were deployed. She was started on a heparin drip after conclusion of the above procedures, switched to rivaroxaban, and eventually discharged home.\n\n【19】删除3：<u>Figure 9.1\n\n【20】Selected images from computed tomography pulmonary angiography </u>\n\n【21】Past medical history included osteopenia, systemic hypertension, anxiety, gastro-esophageal reflux disease, and cataracts for which she had right eye surgery a few years prior. Her only other surgery was a total abdominal hysterectomy and oophorectomy more than 15 years before her current presentation. She had no known allergies, and no history of prior deep vein thrombosis, or pulmonary emboli. She also denied any prior estrogen use.\n\n【22】Social history disclosed no alcohol, tobacco, diet pill or illicit drug use. She worked as a flight attendant prior to retiring and was widowed. Her family history did not include any clotting disorder or any relatives with prior blood clots. She noted a rash with penicillin and some pruritus with enoxaparin and with clindamycin.\n\n【23】A few weeks after her discharge, she followed up as an outpatient with a pulmonologist due to continued shortness of breath and decreased exercise tolerance. Not only had she not returned to her baseline, but she occasionally experienced exertional chest tightness and palpitations that were alleviated with rest. On one occasion, after pushing herself to walk approximately 200 ft at a brisk pace, she felt dizzy and pre-syncopal. Her pulmonologist ordered an echocardiogram that showed a normal left ventricular size and systolic function, with mild diastolic dysfunction. Abnormal ventricular septal motion and position were noted, suggesting the presence or right ventricular pressure overload. The right ventricle was moderately enlarged and hypertrophied with reduced systolic function and the right ventricular systolic pressure was reported at 67 mmHg with a TAPSE measured at 1.32 cm. The left atrium was normal, the right atrium was moderately dilated and a trivial pericardial effusion was noted in addition to some moderate tricuspid regurgitation. The main pulmonary artery was enlarged and a large mass was seen within it.\n\n【24】Based on these findings and in the context of her more chronic and progressive symptoms with poor response to anticoagulation, chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension was suspected and she was referred to a CTEPH center for pulmonary thromboendarterectomy (PTE) surgery evaluation.\n\n【25】During her evaluation for PTE surgery her vital signs were notable for elevated systemic blood pressure at 150/73, a temperature of 97 °F, a respiratory rate of 16, and a SpO2 of 98% on room air. Her height was 5′ 4″ and her weight was 60.5 kg. On exam, she had mild JVD and an accentuated P2 heart sound. Although her lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally, a loud flow murmur was heard over her right lung zones during breath hold. Her only other finding were some lower extremity varicose veins.\n\n【26】At that time a chest x-ray showed two IVC filters in place, some blunting of the left costophrenic angle, enlarged pulmonary arteries, and a prominent right ventricle 删除33：<u></u>.\n\n【27】删除3：<u>Figure 9.2</u>\n\n【28】Chest radiograph\n\n【29】Moreover a ventilation perfusion lung scintigraphy scan showed lack of perfusion to the entire left lung and a wedge defect of the superior segment of the right middle lobe 删除33：<u>通用删除1(英):<u>(selected views in Fig. 9.3 )</u></u>.\n\n【30】删除3：<u>Figure 9.3\n\n【31】Ventilation perfusion scintigraphy (RAO: right anterior oblique, Lat: lateral)</u>\n\n【32】After the above preliminary testing she underwent a left heart catheterization to rule out any coronary artery disease prior to possible PTE surgery that was unremarkable. Based on her imaging findings and her clinical history it was suspected that CTEPH was a less likely diagnosis. Therefore, right heart catheterization and digital subtraction pulmonary angiography were deferred and felt to be of excessive risk given the degree of proximal vessel occlusion by CT. As part of her evaluation, she did however undergo a positron emission tomography scan with fusion computed tomography images 删除33：<u></u>.\n\n【33】删除3：<u>Figure 9.4\n\n【34】Fusion PET CT images of the chest </u>\n\n【35】Following these studies she was admitted to the hospital, and placed on continuous intravenous heparin drip in anticipation of endarterectomy surgery. This was performed a few days later including pulmonary valve repair and PFO closure. The surgery was complicated by left lower lobe airway bleeding requiring a bronchial blocker that resolved within a few days 删除33：<u>通用删除1(英):<u>(specimen shown in Fig. 9.5 )</u></u>.\n\n【36】删除3：<u>Figure 9.5\n\n【37】Surgical specimen removed at time of endarterectomy</u>\n\n【38】Although her post-operative course was complicated by airway bleeding, an episode of aspiration and retained secretions, a small posterior cerebral artery stroke, and persisting dysphagia requiring a gastric tube placement, she was eventually discharged home approximately 4 weeks after her operation. Her final pathology noted high grade intimal sarcoma with PD-L1 positive staining. She is now being followed by radiation oncology and medical oncology and undergoing treatment for residual/metastatic pulmonary artery sarcoma.\n\n【39】Radiographic Interpretation\n---------------------------\n\n【40】From the outset, CT images in this case were very suggestive of a vascular tumor. The selected images from CT pulmonary angiography 删除33：<u></u> demonstrated an expansile mass within the main and left pulmonary artery (block arrow). The lesion extends to the level of the pulmonary valve and is of uniformly low attenuation with no calcification. Careful review reveals breach of the pulmonary artery wall (thin arrow) with extension of soft tissue in to the mediastinum. The loss of the integrity of the vascular wall is highly suspicious for an aggressive lesion such as a sarcoma. Chronic thromboembolic disease can involve the main pulmonary arteries, but the CT features were not typical of thrombus.\n\n【41】The chest radiograph 删除33：<u></u> demonstrated enlargement of the main pulmonary artery with reduced vascular markings in the left lung with few tiny foci of parenchymal scarring.\n\n【42】On VQ scintigraphy 删除33：<u></u> there was complete absence of perfusion to the left lung. Surprisingly, there was also a segmental wedge shaped mismatched perfusion defect in the right lung; this could be due to tumor “thrombus” or vascular metastases.\n\n【43】The positron emission tomography (PET) CT 删除33：<u></u> confirmed high FDG uptake in the soft tissue within the pulmonary arteries in keeping with a metabolically active intra-vascular malignancy.\n\n【44】Clinical Comments\n-----------------\n\n【45】This case is a dramatic illustration that proximal pulmonary intra-arterial filling defects are not universally thromboembolic in nature. In fact, there are a number of historical and radiographic hints, particularly on CT, that push the differential away from this being a large proximal vessel thromboembolus. That this patient experienced a decline in exercise capabilities over the months prior to presentation suggests a more chronic and progressive process. An acute saddle embolus of this size would not typically present in this manner. Additionally, a thromboembolus would not be expected to simply “halt” in the proximal main pulmonary artery, with contrast seen to completely opacify a normal sized vessel beyond the globular shaped lesion 删除33：<u></u>. Other features that might suggest a pulmonary vascular tumor include “eclipsing” or “breach” of the pulmonary arterial wall from the mass like lesion 删除10：<u></u>, extension of the mass involving the right ventricular outflow tract and pulmonic valve, size progression of the mass despite anticoagulation, and the presence of nodular lesions “within the parenchyma” following the course of the pulmonary arteries. Moreover, the presence of radiographic and/or echocardiographic signs of pulmonary hypertension with such a large burden of occlusive vascular disease would not be anticipated with an acute massive pulmonary embolus, where cardiogenic shock might be expected at the time of presentation.\n\n【46】An appreciation of some of the clinical and radiographic aspects of pulmonary vascular tumors can reduce the time interval to appropriate therapeutic intervention, including surgical endarterectomy and adjuvant modalities appropriate to the patient’s tumor type and clinical condition. A clinical suspicion of this unusual tumor might also prevent ineffectual and potentially life threatening attempts at reperfusion therapy.\n\n【47】Points of Emphasis\n------------------\n\n【48】The differential for major pulmonary arterial mass lesions includes vascular neoplasm. The clinical history and distinctive radiographic findings, particularly with CT and metabolic imaging, can be helpful in making this important distinction from acute or chronic thromboembolic disease.\n\n【49】Diagnosis\n---------\n\n【50】1.  1.\n    Pulmonary artery sarcoma.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Which of the following statements is most appropriate?\n\n【1】A. Bupropion is pregnancy category C and relatively safe in pregnancy.\n\n【2】B. Varenicline is pregnancy category B and relatively safe in pregnancy.\n\n【3】C. Nicotine gum delivers a lower and safer dose of nicotine than the nasal spray.\n\n【4】D. The use of smoking cessation products during pregnancy frequently leads to adverse outcomes.\n\n【5】Answer: 7.1 A . Bupropion and varenicline are both pregnancy category C. Pregnant smokers should be encouraged to quit without the use of any pharmacologic agents. However, pharmacologic aids to increase the rate of smoking cessation during pregnancy can be used, after discussion with the patient of the risks and benefits of the medications and of continued smoking. Cessation of smoking at any time during the pregnancy is likely to provide health benefits for the mother and fetus. Nicotine gum delivers higher doses of nicotine than its nasal spray counterpart.\n\n【6】Question: 7.2 Which of the following statements regarding available treatments for smoking cessation is accurate?\n\n【7】A. Bupropion can be used in combination with nicotine supplements.\n\n【8】B. Nicotine gum is most effective if chewed continuously, to promote a constant release of the nicotine.\n\n【9】C. Nicotine supplements are most effective when used as needed for withdrawal symptoms.\n\n【10】D. All of the available agents are more effective when used in combinations with each other.\n\n【11】Answer: 7.2 A . Bupropion can be used in combination with any of the nicotine supplementation products. The nicotine products can also be used in combination with each other. Varenicline has not been studied for use with other smoking cessation agents. Two common pitfalls in using nicotine supplementation are using supplementation only when having withdrawal symptoms and failing to use nicotine gum correctly. The gum should be chewed briefly and then parked in the cheek. It is less effective if chewed continuously.\n\n【12】Question: 7.3 Which of the following counseling strategies is most likely to enhance your patients’ smoking cessation rates?\n\n【13】A. Discuss smoking cessation techniques only with patients who ask for your advice, as others will resent your suggestions.\n\n【14】B. Emphasize primarily the health risks of smoking.\n\n【15】C. Note in each patient’s chart that you have discussed cessation, so that you don’t repeat the message to the same patient at subsequent visits.\n\n【16】D. Ask about smoking cessation at each encounter.\nAnswer: 7.3 D . Asking patients about tobacco use is a key to promoting cessation. It is important to ask each patient at each visit and to be prepared to provide advice and assistance at any time.\n\n【17】CLINICAL PEARLS\n\n【18】 Most smokers require multiple attempts before successfully quitting for good. Remind your patients of this if they become discouraged in their efforts.\n\n【19】 Use the five As—Ask, Advise, Assess, Assist, and Arrange follow-up—to help your patients quit smoking.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

A 22-year-old man， who was stabbed with a 3-in knife in the third inter-costal space， lateral to the right nipple， BP 128/78 mm Hg， HR 82 beats/minute， RR 12 breaths/minute.\n\n【23】6.11 D.“Real-time”imaging of the internal jugular vein while it is being cannulated has been shown to be the safest approach when compared to the anatomic land-mark technique and when compared to pre-procedure vein location marking.\n\n【24】6.2 C. Chest Radiograph is most appropriate. Although thoracic computed tomog raphy can give valuable information on chest pathophysiology， the patient presented with acute respiratory decompensation and signs worrisome for right pneumothorax. Transport to the CT scanner in such a tenuous patient would invite catastrophe. Modalities such as bedside thoracic ultrasound to evaluate presence or absence of pleural sliding and portable chest radiograph (performed in a timely manner) could both identify a clinically significant pneumothorax. Right needle thoracostomy can be performed in patients in whom you have a high index of suspicion for pneumothorax. This procedure， when performed appropriately， is of relatively low risk and transient therapeutic benefit. Repeat-ing auscultation once a room quiets down is quick， easy， and can help confirm presence or absence of breath sounds. The important point here is if a patient is unstable and diagnosis can be made at the bedside， it is safest not to transport the patient elsewhere for diagnostics.\n\n【25】6.3 C. The patient presents in shock with no available history. Clinical findings suggest cardiac dysfunction with severe malperfusion and distended neck veins. Although an ECG can give some information that can help rule in or out a potential infarction， a bedside echocardiogram can quickly identify anatomic and functional abnormalities such as pericardial tamponade， papillary muscle rupture， severe wall motion abnormalities， septal rupture， and so on. With echo-cardiography， the patient's volume status can also be estimated， as can the pres-ence of increase pulmonary vascular pressures. In the instance of tamponade， echocardiography can be used real-time for a safer method of pericardiocentesis.\n\n【26】6.4 B. Of the patients listed， the obese man with subcutaneous emphysema will likely be technically challenging for bedside ultrasound guided drainage of his subhepatic abscess. His body habitus and the subcutaneous air will increase artifacts and lessen the safety of the ultrasound guided technique. CT-guided abscess drainage offers a much safer route for patients who have limited ultra-sound views. Patients “A， C， and E” all have suspected pulmonary diagnoses that can be evaluated with either portable radiographs or thoracic ultrasound. Patient “D\"has a likely cardiac source for her symptoms and can be evaluated with bedside echocardiography.\n删除20：<u>Beaulieu Y， Marik PE. Bedside ultrasound in the ICU： Part 1.

She was in her 11th week of pregnancy. On examination, her gynecologist observed facial plethora, dorsocervical and supraclavicular fat pads, purple striae on the thighs, bruises in the lower limbs, and a gravid uterus consistent with gestational age. Her body mass index (BMI) was 29 kg/m <sup>2 </sup> , blood pressure was 160/100 mmHg, and fasting glucose was 112 mg/dL. Her urinary free cortisol (UFC) was 394 μg/24 h (normal range, 70–270). Her gynecologist considered these findings to be related to the gestation. Monitoring of glycemic values and treatment with methyldopa were started. Two weeks later, at the 13th week of gestation, she was referred to an endocrinologist due to worsening of glycemic values. Cushing’s syndrome (CS) was suspected. UFC (average of three consecutive measurements) was 1008 mcg/24 h; late-night salivary cortisol (LNSC) was 12.6 mmol/L and 13.2 mmol/L on 2 consecutive days (normal range, 2–6.5 mmol/L); serum cortisol did not suppress after high-dose dexamethasone suppression (HDDST) (21% suppression from baseline serum cortisol of 36 μg/dL); and Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) was 11 pg/mL (5–46 pg/mL). An adrenal ultrasound showed a right adrenal adenoma of 31 × 28 mm.\n\n【15】Glycemic control was difficult despite high doses of insulin, and hypertension was resistant to treatment. Fetal growth restriction was documented. At 15 weeks of pregnancy, metyrapone (250 up-titrated to 1500 mg/day) was started, which decreased the hypercortisolemia (UFC 384 μg/24 h). Glycemic control improved, and insulin was rapidly down-titrated, while blood pressure decreased but did not fully normalize. In the 24th week of gestation, laparoscopic right adrenalectomy was performed, after which LNSC normalized, hypertension was controlled with low doses of methyldopa, and glycemic values improved, leading to further reductions in insulin. Hydrocortisone replacement was started (20 mg/day divided in three doses). Despite her clinical improvement, the fetal size and growth velocity remained below the 10th percentile, and she developed preeclampsia in the 33rd week. Labor was induced at 35 weeks, and an intravenous stress dose of hydrocortisone was administered. A female infant weighing 1855 g was delivered. The newborn initially developed respiratory distress which was successfully treated in the neonatal intensive care unit.\n\n【16】Pathophysiology\n---------------\n\n【17】CS in pregnancy is extremely rare, due to the negative effects of hypercortisolism on the gonadal axis. CS women frequently present with hyperandrogenism, oligo- or amenorrhea, and, in severe cases, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and infertility secondary to impaired follicular development and ovulation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. A recent systematic review collected information on 263 pregnancies published between 1952 and 2015, of which 81% occurred in women with active CS and 19% after remission. CS was diagnosed during gestation in 65% of cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【18】To diagnose new-onset or recurrent CS in a pregnant woman is challenging due to the physiological and transient hyperactivation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis occurring during normal gestation, which may mask underlying pathological cortisol excess 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Similarities between clinical features commonly associated with CS and typical physical/emotional changes of normal gestation may further complicate recognition of CS in pregnancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. A key point is that extra-abdominal purple striae, easy bruising, thin skin, proximal myopathy, and spontaneous fractures are specific features of CS which rarely occur in normal pregnancy. Their appearance in a pregnant woman is highly suggestive of cortisol excess.\n\n【19】Physiological Changes of the HPA Axis in Normal Pregnancy 删除33：<u></u>\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【20】Placental corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) exponentially increases from the 8th week until the third trimester, peaking around 4000 pg/mL at the 40th week 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. It is secreted in a noncircadian, nonpulsatile fashion, and plays a prominent role as modulator of maternal and fetal HPA axes in pregnancy, as well as a regulatory clock of the length of gestation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. While the concomitant rise of CRH-binding protein prevents the HPA axis from being exposed to excessive CRH in the first two trimesters, bioavailable CRH rises in the last weeks of pregnancy, due to the late decline of its binding protein 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Increased placental production of CRH in the third trimester is the main stimulus for hyperactivation of the HPA axis and is a contributor to parturition and fetal lung maturation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【21】A graph of H P A hormone change in normal pregnancy. The horizontal and vertical axis are divided into 3 sections labeled first trimester, second trimester, and third trimester and non-pregnant values, 2-fold, and 3- fold respectively. It is plotted for the following hormones C R H, U F C, C B C, L N S C, Total cortisol, A C T H, and C R H B F.\n\n【22】删除3：<u>Fig. 16.1\n\n【23】Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis hormone and binding protein changes during normal pregnancy.

The rise of placental ACTH, dose-dependently modulated by CRH, contributes to cortisol hypersecretion observed in pregnancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【25】Plasma cortisol concentrations rise two- to threefold throughout gestation, starting from the 11th week until the delivery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. This increment is not only due to the elevation of placental CRH and ACTH but also to the stimulatory effect of estrogens on hepatic production of corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Indeed, CBG levels increase progressively and reach a threefold peak in the third trimester, leading to an overestimation of total serum cortisol measurements during normal pregnancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Free cortisol concentrations also increase from the first and second trimester and remain subsequently stable 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Hyperactivation of the HPA axis and glucocorticoid resistance associated with high levels of progesterone have been suggested as the mechanisms leading to free cortisol elevation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【26】As a consequence, UFC concentrations rise 1.4- to 1.6-fold starting from the second trimester, and the suppressibility of both plasma cortisol and UFC after 1 mg dexamethasone is lost in most healthy pregnant women throughout the second half of gestation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 , 12 \\]</u>. Elevation of UFC in the 10th week, as described in the clinical case, is not usual and therefore should have raised the suspicion of abnormal secretion of cortisol.\n\n【27】Circadian, pulsatile secretion of cortisol is maintained across pregnancy, although a slight alteration may be observed during the third trimester when cortisol production is maximal 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Indeed, despite the increase of morning serum cortisol concentrations in the second and third trimester, LNSC was not different in most pregnant women at any time across gestation compared with nonpregnant, healthy controls 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>.\n\n【28】The fetus is protected from maternal hypercortisolism in early gestation due to the placental expression of 11-β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 2 (11β-HSD 2) which converts cortisol to cortisone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Aldosterone levels progressively increase across pregnancy reaching a peaking eight- to tenfold above the normal range by the third trimester, due to hyperestrogenism and elevated placental production of renin. Plasma renin also increases fourfold by the 20th week 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>. While increased progesterone may lead to partial resistance to aldosterone, potassium levels may be low in normal pregnancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>.\n\n【29】In summary , during normal pregnancy, the hyperactivation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis occurs, as reflected by the physiological rise in plasma concentrations of CRH, ACTH, cortisol, and CBG and up to threefold elevation of UFC levels. Circadian rhythm of salivary cortisol usually is maintained in normal pregnancy.\n\n【30】Causes of CS in Pregnancy\n-------------------------\n\n【31】Whereas Cushing’s disease (CD) is the commonest cause of CS in nonpregnant women, an adrenal source is more frequent in pregnant women with confirmed hypercortisolism, accounting for 40–60% of cases, in contrast to 15% in nonpregnant patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Of 263 cases described up to 2015, an adrenal adenoma was found in 44% of women with active CS, a pituitary adenoma in 28%, an adrenal carcinoma in 9%, an ectopic ACTH-dependent syndrome (EAS) in 3.8%, and reversible pregnancy-induced CS in 13% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【32】Maternal and Fetal Morbidity and Mortality\n------------------------------------------\n\n【33】CS in pregnancy is a severe condition, associated with elevated prevalence of potentially lethal complications in both the mother and the fetus. Hypertension and diabetes have been described in 68% and 25% of pregnant CS women, respectively. The prevalence of preeclampsia in CS patients is 13%, sixfold greater than in healthy pregnant women, while the prevalence of spontaneous abortion and fetal loss are 35% and 10%, respectively, two- and tenfold higher than in women without CS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Prematurity has been reported in 43% of cases, while intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) is reported in 21% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. In the case described above, the patient developed preeclampsia 9 weeks after successful removal of the adrenal source of cortisol excess. Of note, IUGR persisted despite control of hypercortisolism since the 15th week, initially using metyrapone and subsequently after adrenalectomy.\n\n【34】Other maternal complications include osteoporosis and fractures, cardiac failure, psychiatric disorders, and wound infections 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. Maternal mortality in pregnant women with uncontrolled CS is 1257/100,000 live births, significantly higher than that reported in 2013 both worldwide (209/100,000) and in Southern Sudan, where it is the highest (956.8/100,000) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Moreover, pregnant women with active CS present with a greater risk of hypertension, gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, and fetal loss as compared with their counterparts in remission 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Fetal mortality in cured CS patients is similar to that described in healthy women, indicating that correction of cortisol excess may increase the probability of having a successful gestation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【35】Although cortisol normalization improves maternal and fetal outcomes, the prevalence of preterm birth and low birth weight in CS women who underwent surgery during pregnancy remains elevated even in those who reached remission 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Overall, the prevalence of fetal loss and overall morbidity is higher in pregnant women with active CS as compared with that reported in pregnant women with CS in remission.\n\n【36】Diagnostic Tests and Monitoring\n-------------------------------\n\n【37】### Biochemical Testing \n\n【38】The differential diagnosis between CS and normal pregnancy is difficult on a clinical basis, and CS is often recognized after the second trimester 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Hypertension, diabetes, striae, and mood disorders may be observed in both conditions, although the presence of extra-abdominal, purple, larger striae, easy bruising, muscle weakness, and osteoporosis are important clues of the underlying CS in pregnancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Give vitamin K.\n\n【17】C. Give fresh frozen plasma\n\n【18】D. Hold warfarin.\n\n【19】8.5 A 45-year-old woman is noted to have dizziness， a pounding feeling in her chest， and fatigue of 3 hours’duration. On examination， she is noted to have a blood pressure of 110/70 mm Hg and a heart rate of 180 bpm. On ECG， she has AF， and a prior baseline ECG showed delta waves. The emergency depart-ment provider counsels the patient regarding cardioversion， but the patient declines. Which of the following is the best therapy for her condition?\n\n【20】A. Digoxin\n\n【21】B. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor\n\n【22】C.(Calcium channel blocker\n\n【23】D. Procainamide\n\n【24】ANSWERS\n\n【25】8.1 A. A diastolic rumble at the cardiac apex suggests mitral stenosis. The early diastolic decrescendo murmur (answer B) is typical of aortic regurgitation； holosystolic murmur at the apex (answer C) is typical of mitral regurgitation； and late-peaking systolic murmur at the upper sternal border (answer D) is typical of aortic stenosis.\n\n【26】8.2 B. This individual has significant symptoms and hypotension caused by the AF and rapid ventricular rate； this is an unstable patient， and thus DC cardiover-sion is the treatment of choice. The other answer choices (answer A， digoxin， and answer D， diltiazem) would take time to work， and additionally answer C(vagal maneuvers) could potentially compromise cerebral blood flow if carotid massage is used.\n\n【27】8.33 F A. Clinical factors associated with a higher risk for embolic stroke include con-gestive heart failure， hypertension， age > 65， diabetes， or prior stroke. Echo-cardiographic factors include dilated left atrium or the presence of an atrial thrombus. The man in answer A has\"lone AF” with a CHADS. score < 2and has a low risk for stroke； thus， he would not benefit from anticoagulation. The other answer choices have high CHADS， scores based on age and other comorbidities.\n\n【28】8.4D. The target INR with warfarin is 2 to 3； thus， 5.8 is markedly elevated. How-ever， because this patient has no overt bleeding and is asymptomatic， hold-ing the warfarin until the INR reaches the acceptable range is a reasonable approach. Answer A (transfusion) is not indicated since the patient did not 删除换行1 have bleeding. Patients with overt bleeding require more urgent intervention， such as administration of vitamin K (answer B)， FFP (answer C)， or prothrom-bin complex concentrate to replenish clotting factors.\n\n【29】8.5D. This patient has AF with WPW， as indicated by the delta wave. In this set-ting， the typical agents (answer A， digoxin； answer B， angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor； and answer C， calcium channel blocker) used to treat AF that slow the AV node are contraindicated since the conduction through the accessory pathway could accelerate， leading to ventricular tachycardia. DC car-dioversion is an option； however， in a hemodynamically stable patient，procain-amide may be used since it will slow propagation through the accessory pathway. Because this patient declines cardioversion， procainamide is the best choice.\n\n【30】CLINICAL PEARLS\n\n【31】The most common causes of AF are hypertension， atherosclerotic heart disease， pericardial or pulmonary disease， and hyperthyroidism.\n\n【32】Acute AF is treated with direct current cardioversion if the patient is unstable. If the patient is stable， initial management is ventricular rate control with an AV nodal-blocking agent， such as beta-blockers， diltia-zem， or verapamil.\n\n【33】Patients with chronic AF generally require long-term anticoagulation to prevent embolic strokes. An exception is \"lone AF\"\n\n【34】CHA，DS，-VASc score can help with risk stratification for both thrombo-embolic events and need for long-term anticoagulation.\n\n【35】WPW syndrome is a ventricular pre-excitation syndrome with a delta wave， short PR interval (<0.12 seconds)， and prolonged QRS interval(> 0.12 seconds).\n\n【36】WPW syndrome is associated with paroxysmal tachycardias， including AF. AF in WPW syndrome is treated with DC cardioversion or with procain-amide. AV nodal-blocking agents can， paradoxically， increase the ven-tricular rate.\n\n【37】Auscultatory findings in mitral stenosis include a loud S， and an opening snap following the second heart sound (S，). The interval between S， and the opening snap varies inversely with the severity of the stenosis.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

A resident on duty considered she had KD and requested tests on the NT pro-BNP and ESR. But she was in PICU, where residents shift frequently and are very busy in PICU of China. The next resident on duty neglected the note and missed her red conjunctiva, and transferred the patient to respiratory ward as severe pneumonia patient. If he reviewed her chest CT scan results with care, he would have found her pneumonia was not so severe, but her ALT was up to 437 U/L and she had hands/feet edema (on Day 5 of illness her albumen was normal).

As a result of this edema, indigitation is developed and will need warm saline clysis to be relieved (case 25). However, if it is not identified on time, the complication can lead to intestinal obstruction, and then the necrosis segment need to be surgically removed. This girl had incomplete indigitation, and the inflammation regressed after IVIG and oral aspirin treatment, and then edema in intestine settled subsequently.\n5.  5.\n    The most common complication in KD is digestive system symptoms.

Specify if： With perceptual disturbances： hallucinations with intact reality testing  |\n\n【19】available history， it is unlikely that the patient has developed a cannabis use dis-order， but a more detailed history from other sources would help to quantify can-nabis use. When hallucinations occur in the absence of intact reality testing， or the symptoms persist beyond the physiologic effects of the drug， a diagnosis of substance-induced psychotic disorder should be considered. Education about the risks of cannabis use is recommended， as studies have shown that there is a rapid transition from cannabis use to cannabis use disorder in adolescents， which per-sists to young adulthood. The effects of cannabis intoxication should usually clear， and no specific medications are indicated.Medications may sometimes be used for symptomatic relief.\n\n【20】APPROACHTO：\n\n【21】Cannabis Intoxication and Cannabis Use Disorder\n\n【22】DEFINITIONS\n\n【23】CANNABIS： A genus of flowering plant that is thought to have originated in central Asia. Some strains contain tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) as the principal psychoactive component.\n\n【24】CANNABIDIOL (CBD)： A phytocannabinoid that can be extracted from the hemp plant and is not psychoactive. It has some medicinal purposes， such as for resistant seizure disorders.\n\n【25】CANNAINOID： A family of more than 80 different terpenophenolic compounds， some of which are psychoactive.\n\n【26】CLINICAL APPROACH\n\n【27】Development of Cannabinoid Substances\n\n【28】Cannabis use disorder and other cannabis-related disorders include problems that are associated with substances derived from the cannabis plant and chemi-cally similar synthetic compounds. Over time， this plant material has accumulated many names (eg， weed， pot， herb， grass， reefer， Mary Jane， dagga， dope， bhang， skunk， boom， gangster， kif， and ganja). Synthetic oral formulations of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) are available by prescription for several approved medical indications (eg， for nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy； for anorexia and weight loss in individuals with AIDS). Other synthetic cannabinoid compounds have been manufactured and distributed for nonmedical use in the form of plant material that has been sprayed with a cannabinoid formula-tion (eg， K2 or spice). The potency of cannabis ranges from 1% to approximately15% in typical cannabis plant material and 10% to 20% in hashish， which is a con-centrated extraction of the cannabis plant. During the past two decades， a steady increase in the potency of seized cannabis has been observed.\n\n【29】Epidemiology\n\n【30】Cannabinoids， especially cannabis， are the most widely used illicit psychoactive substance in the United States and the world. Cannabis use disorder is more com-monly observed in males， although the magnitude of this gender difference is less among adolescents. Twelve-month prevalence of cannabis use disorder among adults decreases with age， with rates highest among 18- to 29-year-old subjects(4.4%) and lowest among individuals 65 years and older (0.01%). The high preva-lence of cannabis use disorder likely reflects the much more widespread use of can-nabis relative to other illicit drugs rather than greater addictive potential.\n\n【31】Cannabis use disorder usually begins during adolescence or young adulthood. Cannabis use is perceived by many people as less harmful than alcohol or tobacco use. Also， cannabis intoxication does not usually cause as visible a dysfunction as alcohol intoxication. These factors likely contribute to the common rapid transition from cannabis use to a cannabis use disorder， due to a pattern of using throughout the day. Early onset of cannabis use， that is， prior to age 15 years， is a robust predic-tor of the development of cannabis use disorder and other types of substance use disorders and mental disorders during young adulthood.\n\n【32】Diagnostic Criteria of Cannabis Withdrawal Syndrome\n\n【33】The DSM-5 includes， for the first time， a cannabis withdrawal syndrome 删除25：<u></u>. Common symptoms of withdrawal include irritabil-ity， anger or aggression， anxiety， depressed mood， restlessness， sleep difficulty， and decreased appetite or weight loss. Cannabis withdrawal symptoms are typically not as severe as alcohol or opiate withdrawal but can cause significant distress， leading to continued use or relapse in those trying to achieve abstinence.\n\n【34】Clinical Presentation\n\n【35】In adolescent users， changes in mood stability， energy level， and eating patterns are commonly observed. The signs and symptoms are likely due to the direct effects of cannabis intoxication， cannabis withdrawal， and attempts to conceal use from others. A dramatic drop in grades， truancy， and reduced interest in general school\n\n| Table 45-2·CANNABIS WITHDRAWAL  |\n| --- |\n| Cessation of heavy and prolonged cannabis use Three or more of the following developing within 1 wk of cessation： 1\\. At least one of： abdominal pain，shakiness/tremors，sweating， fever， chills， or headache 2\\. Decreased appetite or weight loss 3\\. Depressed mood 4\\. Irritability， anger， or aggression 5\\. Nervousness or anxiety 6\\. Restlessness 7\\. Sleep difficulty The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment. The symptoms are not attributable to another medical condition or another mental disorder including another substance.  |\n\n【37】activities and outcomes is common. Cannabis use disorder among adults typically involves well-established patterns of daily cannabis use that continue despite clear psychosocial or medical problems.\n\n【38】Intoxication typically begins with the subject feeling \"high， followed by symptoms that include inappropriate laughter and grandiosity， sedation， leth-argy， impairment in short-term memory， difficulty with complex mental pro-cesses， impaired judgment， distorted sensory perceptions， impaired motor performance， and the sensation that time is passing slowly. Occasionally， anxiety， dysphoria， or social withdrawal can occur. The psychoactive effects are accompa-nied by conjunctival injection， increased appetite， dry mouth， and tachycardia. Intoxication develops within minutes if the cannabis is smoked but may take a few hours to develop if it is consumed orally. The effects usually last 3 to 4 hours， with the duration being somewhat longer after oral use. The magnitude of the behav-ioral and physiologic changes depends on the dose， the method of administra-tion， and the characteristics of the individual using the substance. Because most cannabinoids are fat soluble， the effects of cannabis may occasionally persist or recur for 12 to 24 hours.\n\n【39】Signs of acute and chronic use include red eyes (conjunctival injection)， cannabis odor on clothing， yellowing of fingertips from smoking joints， chronic cough， burn-ing of incense to hide the odor， and exaggerated craving and impulse for specific foods， sometimes at unusual times of the day or night. Often individuals using cannabis state that they use it to help them with their mood， sleep， pain， or other physiologic or psychological problems. However， cannabis use disorder frequently occurs together with other mental disorders. Upon assessment， a clinician will usu-ally find cannabis use causing a worsening of the same symptoms that individuals say they are using it for.\n\n【40】Sequelae of Cannabis Use\n\n【41】Cannabis smoke contains high levels of carcinogens and carries a similar risk for respiratory illness as tobacco use. Chronic cannabis use may contribute to the onset or exacerbation of other mental disorders.Concern has been raised about cannabis use as a causal factor in schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. Cannabis use can contribute to the onset of an acute psychotic episode， can exacerbate some symptoms， and can adversely affect the treatment of a major psychotic illness. Can-nabis use has been associated with poor life satisfaction； increased mental health treatment and hospitalization； and high rates of depression， anxiety disorders， sui-cide attempts， and conduct disorder.\n\n【42】Differential Diagnosis\n\n【43】Cannabis use disorder is difficult to distinguish from nonproblematic cannabis use. This can be teased out by determining if the person is using cannabis despite there being a clear evidence of negative consequences like problems with school， work， sports activity， or relationships.\n\n【44】Acute adverse reactions to cannabis should be differentiated from the symptoms of panic disorder， major depressive disorder， delusional disorder， bipolar disorder， or schizophrenia， paranoid type. Physical examination will usually show tachycardia 删除换行1 and conjunctival injection. Urine toxicologic testing can be helpful in making a diagnosis. Cannabis-induced anxiety disorder may mimic generalized anxiety dis-order， while chronic intake of cannabis may produce an \"amotivational syndrome”that may appear similar to a persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia).\n\n【45】In contrast to cannabis intoxication， alcohol intoxication and sedative， hypnotic， or anxiolytic intoxication frequently decrease appetite， increase aggressive behavior， and produce nystagmus or ataxia. Hallucinogens in low doses may resemble can-nabis intoxication. Phencyclidine intoxication is much more likely to cause ataxia and aggressive behavior. Other cannabis-induced disorders such as cannabis-induced psychotic disorder， cannabis-induced anxiety disorder， or cannabis intoxi-cation delirium are diagnosed when the symptoms of these disorders predominate the clinical presentation and are severe enough to warrant independent clinical attention.\n\n【46】Treatment\n\n【47】While there are no clearly efficacious medication treatments for cannabis use dis-order， there is some evidence that medications may help in treatment of cannabis withdrawal and reduce cannabis use. The current state of pharmacology research for cannabis use disorder highlights the need to consider particular characteristics of patients， such as gender， impulsivity， and severity of cannabis use when select-ing a medication in the off-label treatment of cannabis use disorder or cannabis withdrawal.\n\n【48】Primary treatment options for cannabis use disorder include cognitive-behavioral and motivational approaches， which identify the importance of the individual or the social environment. These types of treatment approaches are collectively referred to as psychosocial treatments. More specifically， cognitive-behavioral and relapse prevention approaches primarily emphasize identification and management of incremental patterns and thoughts， as well as external triggers， that lead to use. In addition， these approaches teach coping and problem-solving skills and promote substitution of cannabis-related behaviors with healthier alternatives. In contrast， motivational interviewing approaches tend to emphasize the impor-tance of self-efficacy and positive change and attempt to build motivation in an empathic and nonjudgmental environment. This approach is often enhanced by personalized feedback and education regarding the treatment seeker's patterns of cannabis use， becoming motivational enhancement therapy. Both approaches can be delivered in an individual or group format and include family and friends for social support.\n\n【49】Aside from these primary treatments， secondary options include mindfulness-based meditation and drug counseling. Mindfulness-based meditation is an approach that promotes inner reflection and acceptance of experiences and negative affect， thus decreasing the impact of triggers of use by enhancing present-moment awareness. Drug counseling refers to simple fact-based education regard-ing drug use and health risks， along with suggestions for minimizing harm and brief components from cognitive-behavioral and motivational approaches. Finally， given the high frequency of tobacco use among those presenting for cannabis treatment， their shared triggers of use， and the negative impact of tobacco use on 删除换行1 cannabis treatment outcomes， it is suggested that use of both substances should be treated simultaneouslv.\n删除16：<u>CASE CORRELATION\n删除25：<u>See also Cases 6 (Schizophrenia)， Case 7 (Psychosis Due to Another Medical Condition)， and Case 41 (Tobacco Use Disorder).</u>\n</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

She is taking a thiazide diuretic for mild hypertension. Her blood pressure is mildly elevated. The mammogram reveals a small cluster of calcifications around a small mass， which is one of the classic findings of breast cancer. With this mammo-graphic finding， it is of paramount importance to obtain tissue for histologic diag-nosis. Because of the high risk of malignancy， a stereotactic-directed core biopsy is indicated.\n\n【14】APPROACHTO：\n\n【15】The Abnormal Mammogram\n\n【16】DEFINITIONS\n\n【17】SUSPICIOUS MAMMOGRAPHICFINDINGS： A small cluster of calcifications， or masses with ill-defined borders.\n\n【18】NEEDLE LOCALIZATION： Procedure in which a sterile wire is placed via mam-mographic guidance such that the end of the wire is placed in the center of the suspicious area. The surgeon uses this guide to assist in excising breast tissue.\n\n【19】STEREOTACTIC CORE BIOPSY： Procedure in which the patient is prone on the mammographic table and biopsies are taken as directed with computer-assisted techniques.\n\n【20】CLINICAL APPROACH\n\n【21】Although a clinical history and proper clinical breast examinations are important in detecting breast cancer， mammography remains the best method of detecting breast cancer at an early stage.\n\n【22】A mammogram is an x-ray of the breast tissue. Current radiation levels from mammography have been shown to be safe and cause no increased risk in develop-ing breast cancer. The radiation exposure is <10 rad per lifetime if annual mam-mograms begin at age 40 years and continue up to age 90. Both false positives and false negatives of up to 10% have been noted. Hence， a palpable breast mass in the face of a normal mammogram still requires a biopsy. Breast implants can diminish the accuracy of a mammogram， particularly if the implants are in front of the chest muscles. Magnetic resonance imaging has recently been shown to be effective in screening for breast cancer， particularly in younger patients and those at risk for breast cancer such as due to BRCA mutation. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may identify early breast cancers missed by mammography.\n\n【23】Mammographic findings strongly suggestive of breast cancer include a mass， often with spiculated and invasive borders， or an architectural distortion， or an asymmetric increased tissue density when compared with prior studies or a corresponding area in the opposite breast 删除33：<u></u>.

The latter procedure is more time-consuming， carries a comparable 3%to 5% miss rate， but excises more tissue， which is helpful in“borderline\"histologic conditions， such as ductal carcinoma-in-situ.\n\n【24】As compared to conventional film mammography， digital mammography has a slightly higher sensitivity for women less than age 50， premenopausal women，and those with dense breasts.

The upper sac lies superficial to or partly  删除换行1 within the inguinal canal or it may be situated in between  删除换行1 the muscle layers.\n\n【2】Cross fluctuation between the two sacs of the hydrocele  删除换行1 is the most pathognomonic sign of this condition.\n\n【3】HYDROCELE OF THE HERNIAL SAC.— \n\n【4】Sometimes hydrocele may associate with the hernial sac.\nThe reason is that some fluid gets stagnated within the  删除换行1 hernial sac when a tag of omentum blocks the opening of  删除换行1 the sac at the deep inguinal ring 删除33：<u></u>.\n\n【5】HYDROCELE OF THE CANAL OF NUCK.— This 删除换行1 condition is the female counterpart of the previous  删除换行1 condition. It is seen in females in relation to the round  删除换行1 ligament. Both the above conditions are true inguinal  删除换行1 swellings.\n\n【6】Treatment of other types of hydrocele.—\n\n【7】Hydroceles in infants should be left alone as they may  删除换行1 disappear spontaneously.\n\n【8】If they persist, operation is the treatment of choice.\n\n【9】The steps of operation are —\n\n【10】(a) The sac is dissected off the spermatic cord.\n\n【11】(b) The sac is opened and the fluid is drained.\n\n【12】(c) The inside of the sac is inspected.\n\n【13】(d) The sac is ligated at the deep inguinal ring and  删除换行1 divided.\n\n【14】(e) The distal part of the sac is pulled out through the  删除换行1 inguinal incision.\n\n【15】(f) The testis is inspected.\n\n【16】(g) The tunica vaginalis is everted.\n\n【17】(h) The testis is pushed into the scrotum.\n\n【18】(i) The sac i.e. the patent processus vaginalis is excised.\n\n【19】IVearment of encysted hydrocele oi cord.—-\n\n【20】Excision of the cyst.\n\n【21】HISTORY.—\nSecondary hydrocele is an abnormal collection of fluid  删除换行1 into the tunica vaginalis which accompanies disease of  删除换行1 the testis and/or the epididymis. The usual causes  删除换行1 according to frequency are :\n\n【22】(i) Acute epididymo-orchitis.\n\n【23】(ii) Chronic epididymo-orchitis.\n\n【24】(iii) Syphilitic affection of the testis.\n\n【25】(iv) Malignant disease of the testis.\n\n【26】(v) Trauma.\n\n【27】(vi) Lymphatic obstruction. f Rare, 删除换行1 (vii) Post-herniorrhaphy hydrocele. J\n\n【28】In the last condition secondary hydrocele is due to  删除换行1 damage of the lymphatic vessels of the tunica vaginalis,  删除换行1 which pass with those of the testis along the spermatic  删除换行1 cord.\n\n【29】A secondary hydrocele hardly becomes large enough.\nIt is lax, so palpation of the testis and epididymis is not  删除换行1 difficult. If the testis and the epididymis are not palpable  删除换行1 due to excess collection of fluid, diagnosis of secondary  删除换行1 hydrocele is only possible after the fluid of the hydrocele  删除换行1 has been aspirated out.\n\n【30】SYMPTOMS.—\nHaematocele can be divided into two categories — 1. \n\n【31】Recent haematocele and 2. Old haematocele.\n\n【32】The causes are —\n\n【33】(i) Trauma.\n\n【34】(ii) Tapping or aspiration of a hydrocele.\n\n【35】(iii) Neoplasm of the testis (rare).\n\n【36】Recent haematocele is almost always ushered with  删除换行1 recent trauma followed by pain and swelling. In case of  删除换行1 tapping, immediate refilling is complained with.\n\n【37】Whether it is from trauma or from tapping of a  删除换行1 hydrocele, a recent haematocele should always be treated  删除换行1 with urgent operation and exploration. The blood clots  删除换行1 are evacuated. The tunica vaginalis if damaged, should  删除换行1 be excised. Otherwise everion of the sac is performed. If  删除换行1 rupture of the testis has occurred, a linear rupture should  删除换行1 be carefully sutured. When a segment of the testis has  删除换行1 been damaged, that segment is wedge resected and the 删除换行1 tunica albuginea at the margins of the wedge are sutured  删除换行1 carefully.\n\n【38】Slow haemorrhage into the tunica  删除换行1 vaginalis gives rise to such condition. The patient remains  删除换行1 completely ignorant about the condition. Gradually he  删除换行1 notices swelling of the one side of the scrotum. History  删除换行1 of trauma cannot be elicited. It is sometimes difficult to  删除换行1 differentiate this condition from neoplasm of the testis  删除换行1 unless exposed.\n\n【39】Treatment.— Surgical exposure is the treatment of  删除换行1 choice to detect the innocent nature of the swelling. The  删除换行1 testis is often disorganised and damaged and  删除换行1 orchidectomy should be called for in these cases. Often  删除换行1 the testis becomes small and atrophic due to pressure of  删除换行1 the haematoma.\n\n【40】LOCAL EXAMINATIONS.—\nTumours of the testis are uncommon and few clinicians  删除换行1 outside special centres will encounter, with any frequency  删除换行1 and the problems they pose in management. The  删除换行1 importance of testicular tumour are :—\n\n【41】1. These tumours occur in a predominantly young  删除换行1 population.\n\n【42】2. About 99% of these tumours are malignant.\n\n【43】3. These tumours comprise slightly more than 1% of  删除换行1 all malignant tumours in the male. But these tumours are 删除换行1 the commonest form of malignancy encountered in males 删除换行1 between 25 and 35 years of age.\n\n【44】As with majority of neoplasms,  删除换行1 little is known about the cause of such tumours. However  删除换行1 several predisposing influences have been noticed.\n\n【45】1. UNDESCENDED TESTIS.— Approximately 10%  删除换行1 of tumours occur in testes that are or have been  删除换行1 maldescended, indicating that males with cryptorchidism  删除换行1 have a chance of developing testicular malignancy which  删除换行1 is increased about 30 times compared with normal  删除换行1 population. The risk is 6 times greater for intra-abdominal  删除换行1 testes than for lower-lying testes. Another peculiar feature  删除换行1 which has been noticed is that a person with a  删除换行1 cryptorchidism testis is more liable to have a tumour in  删除换行1 the opposite normal testis than in a person without  删除换行1 cryptorchidism. Approximately one in five tumours  删除换行1 occurring in patients with unilateral maldescence appear  删除换行1 in a normally descended testis.\n\n【46】Orchidopexy if performed after 6 years of age has no  删除换行1 influence in minimising development of tumours in testis. If orchidopexy is done before the age of 6 years, opinions vary. According to some chance of malignancy is  删除换行1 less. According to the others the risk remains the same  删除换行1 and that age of orchidopexy has no effect on the risk of  删除换行1 cancer.\n\n【47】Bilateral cryptorchidism is associated with the  删除换行1 secretion of excessive quantities of gonadotrophins and  删除换行1 that the undescended testis functions abnormally and  删除换行1 reacts in a peculiar fashion to androgens and  删除换行1 gonadotrophins. This may give some clue as to the cause  删除换行1 of more chance of testicular tumours in maldescended  删除换行1 testis.\n\n【48】2. There may be the possibility that these neoplasms  删除换行1 arise in dysgenetic testis, particularly those having  删除换行1 chromosomal aberrations.\n\n【49】3. TRAUMA is often suggested as a causative factor  删除换行1 though there are no grounds for support of this view.\nTrauma merely draws the patient’s attention to the lesion.\nIt may be possible that in some cases it may hasten the  删除换行1 growth of a pre-existing tumour.\n\n【50】Classification of testicular tumours.—\n\n【51】There are numerous classifications, but the most  删除换行1 accepted one is that described by the Testicular Tumour\n\n【52】Panel of Great Britain —\n\n【53】(a) Seminoma — 40%.\n\n【54】(b) Teratoma — 32%.\n\n【55】(i) Teratoma differentiated (TD).\n\n【56】(ii) Malignant teratoma, intermediate (MTI) (Teratocarcinoma).\n\n【57】(iii) Malignant teratoma, undifferentiated (MTU) 删除换行1 (Embryonal carcinoma).\n\n【58】(iv) Malignant teratoma, trophoblastic (MTT) 删除换行1 (Choriocarcinoma).\n\n【59】(c) Combined tumour consisting of seminoma and teratoma — 14%.\n\n【60】(d) Interstitial tumours — 1.5%.\n\n【61】(e) Lymphoma — 7%.\n\n【62】(f) Other tumours — 5.5%.\n\n【63】The pick incidence of teratoma is between 25 and 30  删除换行1 years of age and that for seminoma is between 35 and 45  删除换行1 years of age and combined tumours occupy an intermediate  删除换行1 age distribution.\n\n【64】Testicular tumours can be broadly classified into 2 删除换行1 main divisions :\n\n【65】1. Germinal tumours constituting nearly 98% of the  删除换行1 total and are presumed to arise from primordial sex or  删除换行1 germ cells.\n\n【66】2. Non-germinal tumours, constituting the remaining  删除换行1 2% of cases which take origin from the non-germinal  删除换行1 elements of testis. The non-germinal testicular tumours are 删除换行1 almost always benign.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

She states that her periods started when she was 12 years old, and they have been fairly regular ever since, coming once every 28 to 30 days. She has had three previous uncomplicated pregnancies and deliveries. However, approximately 9 months ago, her cycles seemed to lengthen, and for the last 3 months she has not had a period at all. She stopped breast-feeding 3 years ago, but over the last 3 months she noticed that she could express a small amount of milky fluid from her breasts. She had a bilateral tubal ligation after her last pregnancy, and she has no other medical or surgical history. She takes no medications except multivitamins. Over the last year or so, she thinks she has gained about 10 lb, and she feels as if she has no energy despite adequate sleep. She has noticed some mild thinning of her hair and slightly more coarse skin texture. She denies headaches or visual changes. Her physical examination, including pelvic and breast examinations, are normal. She is not obese or hirsute. Slight whitish nipple discharge is elicited from her breasts. Her pregnancy test is negative.\n\n【3】 What is the most likely diagnosis?\n\n【4】 What is the most likely etiology for the condition?\n\n【5】### ANSWERS TO CASE 12:\n\n【6】#### Oligomenorrhea Caused by Hypothyroidism and Hyperprolactinemia\n\n【7】Summary: A 38-year-old woman complains of oligomenorrhea and now secondary amenorrhea, along with galactorrhea. She previously had regular menses and three uncomplicated pregnancies and deliveries. She had a bilateral tubal ligation after her last pregnancy, but she has no other medical or surgical history, and she takes no medications that might cause galactorrhea. She has experienced weight gain, fatigue, mild thinning of her hair, and slightly more coarse skin. She denies headaches or visual changes, which might suggest a pituitary adenoma. Her physical examination, including pelvic and breast examinations, are normal. She is not obese or hirsute. You can elicit slight whitish nipple discharge.\n\n【8】 Most likely diagnosis: Oligomenorrhea and galactorrhea due to hypothyroidism.\n\n【9】 Most likely etiology: In this patient with symptoms of weight gain, fatigue, thinning hair, and galactorrhea in the setting of previously normal menses, hypothyroidism is the most likely diagnosis.\n\n【10】#### ANALYSIS\n\n【11】##### Objectives\n\n【12】1\\. Understand the differential diagnosis of secondary amenorrhea and the approach to the investigation of possible hormonal causes.\n\n【13】2\\. Understand the interactions of the hormones involved in the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis.\n\n【14】3\\. Recognize the clinical features and diagnostic evaluation of hypothyroidism.\n\n【15】4\\. Be familiar with the treatment of hypothyroidism.\n\n【16】##### Considerations\n\n【17】This 38-year-old woman presents with secondary amenorrhea, weight gain, fatigue, and galactorrhea despite having previously normal menses and discontinuing breastfeeding 3 years ago. Her history of fatigue, weight gain, and hair loss suggest a systemic cause of her symptoms, possibly hypothyroidism. However, her normal physical examination with lack of myxedema or bradycardia, normal reflexes, normal cognition, and nondisplaced point of maximal impulse suggest mild hypothyroidism. Lack of virilization or obesity does not exclude polycystic ovarian syndrome, but their absence makes this diagnosis less likely. Hypothyroidism alone could attribute to galactorrhea, because hypothyroidism can be associated with hyperprolactinemia. Prolactinomas can also cause galactorrhea as well as secondary amenorrhea, however, and should be excluded.\n\n【18】### APPROACH TO:\n\n【19】#### Oligomenorrhea\n\n【20】#### DEFINITIONS\n\n【21】AMENORRHEA: Primary —Absence of menarche by the age of 16 years regardless of the presence or absence of secondary sex characteristics. Secondary —Absence of menstruation for 3 or more months in women with normal past menses.\n\n【22】GALACTORRHEA: Any discharge of milk-containing fluid from the breast, may be unilateral or bilateral, and may appear clear, milky, or bloody.\n\n【23】OLIGOMENORRHEA: Menses occurring at infrequent intervals of more than 40 days or fewer than nine menses per year.\n\n【24】POLYCYSTIC OVARIAN SYNDROME: Syndrome characterized by infertility, hirsutism, obesity, and amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea, and often clinically significant insulin resistance.\n\n【25】#### CLINICAL APPROACH\n\n【26】The assessment of oligomenorrhea is similar to the workup for secondary amenorrhea with the understanding that secondary amenorrhea is present when a normally menstruating woman stops having periods for 3 consecutive months or more. The most common cause of both symptoms, and the easiest to exclude in the clinic, is pregnancy. A negative in-clinic pregnancy test should be confirmed with a serum beta–human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). Primary amenorrhea is present when the first menses has not appeared in a girl by the age of 16 years and is generally caused by a variety of genetic or congenital defects and is commonly associated with disorders of puberty. Given this patient’s age and history, primary amenorrhea is not a consideration; thus, a diagnostic pathway for secondary amenorrhea/oligomenorrhea should be undertaken.\n\n【27】### PROBLEMS OF THE HYPOTHALAMIC-PITUITARY-OVARIAN AXIS\n\n【28】Excluding pregnancy and problems in the genital outflow tract, disorders of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis account for the largest number of cases of oligomenorrhea and amenorrhea. Disorders of the hypothalamus account for the largest percentage of abnormality (>45%); these include problems of nutrition (rapid weight loss/anorexia), excessive exercise, stress, and infiltrative diseases (eg, craniopharyngioma, sarcoidosis, histiocytosis). The largest single cause of oligomenorrhea is polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), accounting for 30% of all cases. PCOS was once thought to be a disease originating in the ovary; however, it now is known that PCOS is a much more complicated neuroendocrine disorder with evidence of estrogenization, as well as insulin resistance . Other important causes of amenorrhea include diseases of the pituitary, specifically neoplasms (eg, prolactinomas, functioning or nonfunctioning adenomas), which account for 18% of cases. Empty sella syndrome, caused by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) herniation into the pituitary fossa, and Sheehan syndrome, caused by severe obstetric hemorrhage and/or maternal hypotension at delivery, are important causes of atrophy and ischemia of the pituitary. If suspected, they should be investigated by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Finally, disorders such as premature ovarian failure (loss of all functional ovarian follicles before the age of 40 years), diseases of the thyroid, and adult-onset adrenal hyperplasia should be considered and investigated if supported by history and physical examination with the appropriate laboratory studies .\n删除4：<u>Table 12–1 • DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS OF OLIGOMENORRHEA <sup>a</sup></u>\n\n【29】The history and physical examination will narrow the range of possible causes. In this patient, the history of fatigue, weight gain, and galactorrhea, along with previously normal menses and a normal physical examination, place hypothyroidism at the top of the list. In primary hypothyroidism, the hypothalamus increases thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), which also stimulates prolactin secretion. Measurement of both thyroid hormone and prolactin levels would be indicated in this case. Prolactinomas are the most common functional pituitary tumors in both men and women, and should be suspected if the prolactin level is markedly elevated, >200 μg/L. If prolactin levels are markedly elevated, pituitary imaging with MRI is indicated. Hyperprolactinemia from any cause inhibits hypothalamic GNrH secretion, leading to amenorrhea in women, and infertility and diminished libido in men. In the workup of secondary amenorrhea, these two diagnoses are the easiest to start with because the tests are noninvasive and relatively inexpensive.\n\n【30】### HYPOTHYROIDISM\n\n【31】Hypothyroidism is defined as the insufficient production of thyroid hormone. Secondary hypothyroidism as a result of dysfunction of hypothalamic and pituitary hormone secretion is much less common but should be suspected in a patient with a history suggestive of Sheehan syndrome or with symptoms or signs of a tumor in the region of the sella. Ninety-five percent of cases of hypothyroidism are caused by primary thyroid gland failure , resulting in insufficient thyroid hormone production. In the United States, the most common cause of hypothyroidism is lymphocytic (Hashimoto) thyroiditis , in which cytotoxic antibodies are produced, which leads to thyroid atrophy and fibrosis. The next most common cause is surgical or radioactive iodine treatment for hyperthyroidism, or Graves disease. Worldwide, iodine deficiency is the most common cause of goitrous (enlarged thyroid) hypothyroidism , but in the United States, this is rare.\n\n【32】Most hypothyroid patients present with vague and nonspecific symptoms. Elderly individuals may be suspected of having dementia or depression when the cause is really hypothyroidism. In general, symptoms of fatigue, weight gain, muscle cramping, cold intolerance, hair thinning, menstrual changes, or carpal tunnel syndrome are common and should prompt an investigation of thyroid function. In severe, prolonged hypothyroidism, a syndrome termed myxedema may develop. These patients present with dull facies, swollen eyes, and doughy extremities from the accumulation of hydrophilic polysaccharides in the dermis, sparse hair, and a thickened tongue. They may have an enlarged heart, nonmechanical intestinal obstruction (ileus), and a delayed relaxation phase of their deep tendon reflexes. Without treatment, they may become stuporous and hypothermic, especially if challenged with an intercurrent illness. This is a life-threatening emergency with a high mortality, even when managed aggressively with intravenous levothyroxine.\n\n【33】When testing outpatients for hypothyroidism, measurement of the serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level is the most sensitive and useful test. Because almost all cases of hypothyroidism are caused by thyroid gland failure, the normal pituitary response is to markedly increase the TSH levels in an attempt to stimulate the failing gland. Falling levels of thyroid hormone produce logarithmic increases in the TSH concentration. Measurement of TSH alone would be insufficient in suspected cases of pituitary disease , so measurement of the thyroid hormone level can also be performed. One should remember that almost all thyroxine (T <sub>4 </sub> ) circulates bound to protein, but it is the free or unbound fraction that is able to diffuse into cells and become active. Most laboratories can now measure free T <sub>4 </sub> directly, or it can be estimated by using the free thyroxine index (FTI). The FTI is calculated from measurements of total T <sub>4 </sub> and the T <sub>3 </sub> resin uptake test. When there is excess thyroid-binding globulin (TBG), as in pregnancy or oral contraceptive use, T <sub>4 </sub> levels will be high (as a consequence of the large amount of carrier protein), but T <sub>3 </sub> uptake will be low (value varies inversely with amount of TBG present). Conversely, when there is a low level of TBG, as in a hypoproteinemic patient with nephrotic syndrome, the T <sub>4 </sub> level will necessarily also be low (not much carrier protein), but the T <sub>3 </sub> uptake will be high. If both total T <sub>4 </sub> and T <sub>3 </sub> uptake are low, the FTI is low, and the patient is hypothyroid.\n\n【34】In mild cases, or subclinical hypothyroidism , the TSH level is mildly elevated (4–10 mU/L), but the free T <sub>4 </sub> or FTI is within the normal range. Patients may be asymptomatic or report the vague and subtle symptoms of hypothyroidism, such as fatigue. About half of such patients will progress to overt hypothyroidism within 5 years. They often have some derangement of cholesterol metabolism, such as elevated total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol . Thyroid hormone replacement can be prescribed in an attempt to relieve symptoms or possibly to reduce cardiovascular risk, or if positive antithyroid antibodies are present.\n\n【35】In clinical hypothyroidism, the TSH level is markedly elevated, and the free T <sub>4 </sub> or FTI is low. The overwhelming majority of patients with hypothyroidism can be treated with once-daily dosing of synthetic levothyroxine, which is biochemically identical to the natural hormone. Levothyroxine is relatively inexpensive, has a long half-life (6–7 days), allowing once-daily dosing, and gives a predictable response. Older thyroid preparations, such as desiccated thyroid extract, are available but are not favored because they have a high content of T <sub>3 </sub> , which is rapidly absorbed and can produce tachyarrhythmias, and the T <sub>4 </sub> content is less predictable.\n\n【36】If there is no residual thyroid function, the daily replacement dose of levothyroxine is 1.6 μg/kg, or typically 100 to 150 μg. In older patients and in those with known cardiovascular disease, dosing should start at a lower level, such as 25 to 50 μg/d, and be increased at similar increments once every 4 to 6 weeks until the patient achieves a euthyroid state. Overly rapid replacement with the sudden increase in metabolic rate can overwhelm the coronary or cardiac reserve. The goal of treatment is normalized TSH, ideally in the lower half of the reference range. The TSH level will take 6 to 8 weeks to readjust to a new dosing level , so follow-up laboratory testing should be scheduled accordingly. Patients may not experience full relief of symptoms until 3 to 6 months after normal TSH is achieved.\n\n【37】###", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

This is a relatively common skin eruption that can occur at any age. The asymptomatic lesions characteristically appear symmetrically on the dorsi of the hands and feet  删除换行1 and over the flexor surfaces of the wrists and ankles.

The patient’s presentation is consistent with ruptured esophageal varices, a dangerous complication of portal hypertension. When the liver becomes extremely fibrotic, as it does with years of exposure to alcohol (note the jaundice and ascites in this patient), there is an increase in resistance in blood flow through the liver, causing portal hypertension. When the pressure in the portal system is greater than the systemic venous pressure, blood will find alternate routes to return to the heart. One of those alternate routes is from the left gastric vein into the azygos vein, which leads to esophageal varices.  \nAnswer A is incorrect . The portal system is a system of veins that drain the GI tract and deliver the blood to the liver. The left gastric artery is upstream of the portal system, and an anastomosis between the left gastric artery and vein would bypass the portal system altogether and therefore would not contribute to the formation of esophageal varices.  \nAnswer C is incorrect . Anastomoses between the paraumbilical vein and the inferior epigastric vein lead to the formation of caput medusae, the spokes-of-a-wheel veins that radiate from the umbilicus in patients with portal hypertension.  \nAnswer D is incorrect . There is no natural route for blood to flow from the portal vein to the inferior vena cava. Creating a portacaval shunt, which is a current treatment option for portal hypertension, can relieve the pressure in the portal system and reduce the risk of bleeding from varices.  \nAnswer E is incorrect . Anastomoses between the splenic vein and the left renal vein are retroperitoneal vessels that are not near the esophagus.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

He is  删除换行1 currently suspended from his studies due to alleged harassment of a female student. He has  删除换行1 been repeatedly sending this student text messages (over 20 per day for the last 6 months) and  删除换行1 spends much of his day loitering around the halls of residence where she lives. He has told  删除换行1 his family that he and the female student are engaged and that when they met, it was ‘love at  删除换行1 first sight’. The female student denies this, saying that she has never had a relationship with  删除换行1 him, has no wish to do so and finds his behaviour towards her extremely upsetting. She has  删除换行1 informed him on numerous occasions that she does not wish to have any contact with him.\nAt the request of his tutor he was seen by the university counselling service. During the initial  删除换行1 assessment he told the counsellor that he and the female student were in love and that he felt  删除换行1 angry that she could not admit this and had reported him to the university. Since she did this  删除换行1 his behaviour towards her has become more intense and he has had thoughts of killing her,  删除换行1 saying that this would be the only way to maintain their ‘pure love’ without the interference  删除换行1 of others.\n\n【3】He has always been a somewhat shy and introverted person and he has never previously had  删除换行1 an intimate relationship. He has no personal or family history of psychiatric disorder. He  删除换行1 is socially isolated and has few friends, preferring to spend his free time playing computer  删除换行1 games. In the last 2 months he has been cautioned by the police regarding his behaviour  删除换行1 towards the female student but has no previous convictions.\n\n【4】Mental state examination\n\n【5】He avoids eye contact and is difficult to engage. He speaks in a monotonous voice and becomes  删除换行1 much more animated when discussing his love for the female student and his hobby of playing computer games. His mood appears normal and there have not been any recent changes  删除换行1 in his sleep pattern or appetite. Throughout the interview he professes his love for the female  删除换行1 student and says that this is mutual but that she cannot show others how she feels because  删除换行1 they would be jealous of their ‘special relationship’. He confirms that he has had intermittent  删除换行1 thoughts of killing the female student as a way of maintaining their ‘pure love’. There is no  删除换行1 abnormality of perception and his cognition is normal.\n\n【6】Questions\n\n【7】• What psychiatric disorders may be associated with this presentation?\n\n【8】• How would you manage the risk he may pose to the female student?\n\n【9】ANSWER 56\n\n【10】This stalking behaviour may be due to erotomania (also known as de Clerambault syndrome) 删除换行1 in which a person falsely believes, with delusional intensity, that another person is in love  删除换行1 with him or her. Erotomania is a descriptive term rather than a diagnosis and some of its  删除换行1 potential causes are as follows:\n\n【11】• Delusional disorder involves the presence of delusions with an absence of other psychopathology (i.e. no evidence of hallucinations or abnormality of mood).\n\n【12】• Schizophrenia will have evidence of hallucinations, thought disorder and delusions.\n\n【13】• Schizoaffective disorder has an equal presentation of schizophrenic and mood  删除换行1 symptomatology.\n\n【14】• Hypomania includes evidence of disinhibited behaviour and grandiose beliefs.\n\n【15】• Organic disorders will show evidence of substance abuse or physical illness on physical examination.\n\n【16】• Schizoid personality disorder shows a long-standing pattern of avoidance of social  删除换行1 situations, emotional coldness and social awkwardness.\n\n【17】• Schizotypal personality disorder has a long-standing pattern of odd behaviour and  删除换行1 ideas with magical thinking and quasi-psychotic experiences.\n\n【18】• Autism spectrum disorder since early childhood evidence of impairment in social  删除换行1 relationships and communication; often accompanied by a narrow, restricted range  删除换行1 of interests and repetitive behaviour. Mind blindness means that they have difficulties understanding the emotions of others and frequently misinterpret their intentions and feelings.\n\n【19】The main management of erotomania is treatment of the underlying disorder. However, in  删除换行1 cases such as these an assessment should be made of the risk that the patient may pose to others. The object of the patient’s affection may be at particular risk and strong feelings of love  删除换行1 may suddenly turn to feelings of frustration, grievance and hate if the patient feels his or her  删除换行1 advances have been unfairly rejected. Other people may be at risk if the patient feels that they  删除换行1 are somehow responsible for the failure of the ‘relationship’.\n\n【20】In order to effectively manage this risk it may sometimes be necessary to involve other services/agencies such as the police, probation service and social services. Given that the patient  删除换行1 may pose a particular risk to an identifiable individual, the issue of warning the person that  删除换行1 he or she is potentially at risk should also be considered. Doing this may be a justifiable (and  删除换行1 necessary) breach of medical confidentiality. This should only be done following discussion  删除换行1 with a senior colleague and careful evaluation of the risks and benefits of disclosure and nondisclosure of this information.\n\n【21】Key Points\n\n【22】• Stalking behaviour may be a symptom of mental illness.\n\n【23】• The management of such individuals may be complex and require the involvement  删除换行1 of several different agencies (e.g. psychiatric services, police, probation services  删除换行1 and social services).\n\n【24】• Where there is evidence that a named individual may be at risk from the patient,  删除换行1 consideration should be given to breaking confidentiality and informing this  删除换行1 person.\n\n【25】删除29：<u>Case 57: An angry man\n\n【26】</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

The signs and symptoms of HF, specifically the resulting volume overload, have been recognized for centuries as “dropsy.” It was not recognized until as late as the 1930s that the heart contributed to this condition. Subsequent studies over the following decades showed reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was a marker of systolic dysfunction and a possible cause 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. In the 1970s to 1990s it was reported that despite similar signs and symptoms of HF, some patients did not manifest reduced LVEF. Therefore, the culprit was believed to be the dysfunction of ventricular diastole, leading to the term “diastolic HF” 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【13】The nomenclature of HF with “preserved ejection fraction” was popularized over the ensuing decades, particularly following the report of the CHARM-Preserved study in 2003; this found that candesartan lowered hospital admissions but did not impact mortality in patients with HFpEF 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. The term HFpEF is also preferred over “diastolic HF” due to the frequent presence of abnormal systolic mechanics seen by strain and tissue Doppler imaging, indicating HFpEF is not due to isolated abnormalities in diastolic function 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【14】With greater recognition of the syndrome of HFpEF, as well as population-wide increases in risk factors for HFpEF, its prevalence has been increasing. Nevertheless, HFpEF remains a challenge to diagnose and treat, which has been attributed to heterogeneity in both etiology and presentation. In this chapter, the epidemiology and diverse etiologies of HFpEF, strategies for diagnosis and ruling out clinical mimics, and to date, limited treatment strategies will be reviewed.\n\n【15】7.2 Definition\n--------------\n\n【16】The American Heart Association, American College of Cardiology, and European Society of Cardiology all generally define HFpEF as the presence of symptoms and signs of HF with an LVEF equal to or exceeding 50% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【17】Diastolic dysfunction defined by echocardiography is helpful but not sufficient for diagnosis in the absence of HF symptoms and signs. Grade 1 diastolic dysfunction without features of the HF syndrome is not diagnostic of HFpEF; however, it is a marker of increased risk of progression to overt HF. Grade 2 and 3 diastolic dysfunction, however, typically indicate increased filling pressure and are more likely to signal the presence of HF in the appropriate clinical context 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【18】HF with recovered ejection fraction, in which the LVEF was previously documented to be reduced but has since recovered, is thought to be a distinct entity with different pathophysiology 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Additionally, HFpEF is thought to be related to primarily left-sided dysfunction and is also distinct from isolated right HF with preserved LVEF, as can be seen in pulmonary arterial hypertension, chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension, and other pulmonary and systemic disorders 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【19】7.3 Epidemiology\n----------------\n\n【20】HFpEF is an increasingly common form of HF, accounting for approximately 50% of all patients with HF 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 8 \\]</u>. This estimate is expected to rise with the aging population in the United States and the increasing prevalence of comorbidities that contribute to its development, e.g. hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and obesity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【21】Outcomes in patients with HFpEF remain poor. Hospitalized patients with HFpEF have a markedly reduced median survival compared with the general population. For example, hospitalized patients with HFpEF between the ages of 65 and 69 years have a median survival of 4 years compared with 18.7 years in the general population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. The dismal 75.7% 5-year mortality of hospitalized HFpEF patients is similar to survival in HFrEF patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Patients with HFpEF compared with HFrEF, however, have a higher rate of noncardiac causes of death 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【22】Patients with HFpEF also have a high rate of 30-day readmission following HF hospitalization. In a 2018 study of Medicare beneficiaries, the 30-day readmission rate among HFpEF subjects was 22.3%. Similar to the mortality discussion above, there was a higher rate of noncardiac causes for readmission compared with individuals with HFrEF 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>.\n\n【23】7.4 Etiology\n------------\n\n【24】HFpEF is a syndrome and not a discrete disease such that multiple etiologies for HFpEF exist. The clinical evaluation of a patient with HFpEF requires consideration of underlying contributors to the syndrome, which may involve the exclusion of diagnoses, including amyloidosis, other myocardial deposition diseases, sarcoidosis, and Fabry’s disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【25】Most cases of HFpEF can be attributed to a constellation of traditional cardiometabolic risk factors, such as hypertension, obesity, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease. Although these are common in patients with HFrEF as well, obesity and insulin resistance may be relatively stronger contributors to the onset of HFpEF compared with HFrEF, based on data from epidemiologic cohort studies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>.\n\n【26】Several risk factors for the development of HFpEF have been identified. Prior studies have established that the incidence of HFpEF increases with age 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Additionally, compared with HFrEF, there is a high proportion of women among patients with HFpEF; this may also be a factor of age, however 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a common comorbidity in HFpEF and is associated with increased mortality and deterioration of LVEF over time 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. Whether CAD is causative in this subset of patients is unclear but diastolic dysfunction can certainly be caused by myocardial ischemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. Hypertension has also been linked to the development of HFpEF in numerous studies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>.\n\n【27】Obesity is also an important risk factor for the development of HFpEF. Among patients with HFpEF in the United States, over 80% are overweight or obese 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. There is debate on causality, but evidence suggests that HFpEF patients with increased abdominal adiposity may be at a higher risk of mortality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>.\n\n【28】The etiology of HF, regardless of LVEF, is heterogenous but results in common pathophysiologic outcomes; the primary clinical insult (or insults) results in myocardial dysfunction leading to increased intracardiac filling pressures and exertional symptoms. The heterogeneity of etiology, phenotypes, and neurohormonal activation appears to differ between HFpEF compared with HFrEF, which may underlie the discordant results for clinical trials of medications with proven efficacy to improve outcomes in HFrEF, but not HFpEF 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u>.\n\n【29】HFpEF was traditionally thought to be a sequelae of systemic hypertension chronically increasing afterload, resulting in left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). LVH would eventually result in myocardial stiffness and impaired diastolic relaxation and compliance. It has been observed, however, that HFpEF can develop without convincing hypertrophy or diastolic dysfunction on an echocardiogram. Moreover, echocardiogram findings of hypertrophy or abnormal myocardial relaxation could be found in patients without clinical HF 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 \\]</u>.\n\n【30】Over the last decade, further studies have led to a paradigm shift in thinking about the etiology and pathophysiology of HFpEF. A prospective study by Shah et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 \\]</u> utilized machine learning techniques to identify three primary phenotypes of patients with HFpEF:\n\n【31】1.  1.\n    Younger patients with normal B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and moderate diastolic dysfunction.\n2.  2.\n    Diabetic, obese patients with severe diastolic dysfunction.\n3.  3.\n    Older patients with chronic kidney disease, arrhythmias, pulmonary hypertension, and RV dysfunction.\n\n【32】These three groups differed substantially in clinical features, hemodynamics, cardiac structure, and outcomes. The third group above fared the worst over time when examining survival free of cardiovascular hospitalization and death 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 \\]</u>. A study by Cohen et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 20 \\]</u> used latent class analysis to similarly classify subjects enrolled in the Treatment of Preserved Cardiac Function Heart Failure with an Aldosterone Antagonist (TOPCAT) study into three clinical phenogroups similar to those found by Shah et al. Importantly, there were significant differences in circulating biomarkers, cardiovascular characteristics, prognosis, and responses to spironolactone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 20 \\]</u>. These data reinforce the impact of etiologic and phenotypic heterogeneity on attempts to effectively study, diagnose, and treat patients with this complex syndrome.\n\n【33】In addition to macrovascular CAD described above, coronary microvascular dysfunction has been proposed as a possible mechanism underlying HFpEF pathology. This is thought to be a downstream result of systemic inflammation caused by diabetes, obesity, and other common comorbidities in HFpEF. In a study of 151 HFpEF patients without revascularizable macrovascular CAD, 75% had coronary microvascular dysfunction defined as reduced coronary flow reserve by stress echocardiography 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 21 \\]</u>. Patients with microvascular dysfunction were more likely to have a history of current or prior smoking suggesting this is a possible risk factor. Interestingly, patients with coronary microvascular dysfunction also had evidence of peripheral endothelial dysfunction defined by reactive hyperemia index measured using arterial tonometry. This suggests, as have numerous studies, that systemic vascular dysfunction is an important aspect of etiology and pathophysiology in HFpEF 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 22 \\]</u>. Systemic arterial stiffness has been demonstrated in patients with HFpEF and appears to worsen during exercise 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【34】Skeletal muscle abnormalities, including mitochondrial dysfunction, have also been identified in patients with HFpEF. Therefore, exercise intolerance in patients with HFpEF may be mediated by both cardiac and noncardiac systemic causes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 23 \\]</u>.\n\n【35】7.5 Prevention\n--------------\n\n【36】Prevention of HFpEF largely focuses on the management of the most common modifiable risk factors in this population: hypertension, obesity, and diabetes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 24 \\]</u>. In 2016, the AHA launched a campaign called “Life’s Simple 7” centered around cardiovascular prevention that provides a useful framework that can be applied here as well. The “Simple 7” includes smoking cessation, weight loss, exercise, dietary control, improvement of blood pressure, lowering cholesterol, and improved glucose control 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 25 \\]</u>.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

B： Admit her to the hospital for a psychosocial assessment within 24 hours Q2. C： Overdose was planned and she had left messages for friends and family\n\n【20】The topic area of child and adolescent mental health forms an important part of the syllabus for the Applied Knowledge paper . Self-harm is defined as any form of behaviour that leads to self-injury， including cutting， burning， overdosing on medicines， preventing wound healing or hanging. Often the behaviour is a way of reducing emotional pain and distracting the young person from suicidal thoughts. It is important to consider the language used when discussing self-harm with adolescents； the young person should not feel judged regarding their behaviour and their emotional distress needs to be recognised and taken seriously. Self-harm is a serious public health problem and the rates of self-harm are a proxy indicator of the extent of mental health illness in young people within society通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u>. Approximately 25，000 adolescents present to hospitals in the UK each year following non-fatal self-harm， although it is estimated that only 1 in 10 children who do self-harm are seen by hospital services 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u>.\n\n【21】The first question is nuanced， and typifies some of the difficulties with the Applied Knowledge paper， and， indeed， some of those encountered as a more senior paediatrician. The knowledge that this young woman has undetectable paracetamol levels makes this question more testing. In deciding the best course of action it is helpful to consider which options would be unsafe. It would not be appropriate or safe to admit this patient to a side room until a full risk assessment of suicidal intention has been completed， as the patient needs to be easily observed at all times. A safeguarding assessment should take place at the time of admission， as this adds to the initial risk assessment； safeguarding issues may also be an underlying reason for self-harm behaviours. An outpatient referral is generally not advisable， as a full risk assessment by CAMHS should be undertaken promptly to assess the risk of further self-harm and the risk of suicidal intent. Advice given now about the risks of injury or harm as a result of inappropriate paracetamol ingestion may make the situation worse.\n\n【22】The second question requires an understanding of the evidence base concerning self-harm in young adults. Premeditated， rather than impulsive， self-harm is suggested by planning and consideration for events after death， and is an indicator for increased risk of true suicidal intent. There is no evidence to support a link between the number of tablets taken and the degree of suicidal intent. Similarly， evidence of other self-harm behaviour， such as cutting (also see below) does not help stratify suicidal intent. While parental separation may be a reason for emotional distress and self-harm behaviours， it does not have a direct link to suicidal intent. There is an association between mental health difficulties and premature death linked to risk behaviours such as smoking and alcohol， but it does not clearly inform suicide risk.\n\n【23】Adolescents may present to the emergency department with a range of self-harm thoughts or behaviours. These would range from discussing such thoughts through to completed suicide. Patients may appear aggressive or passive， agitated or withdrawn， and may express fear， anxiety or remorse. Most young people who self-harm do not have suicidal intent， but it is difficult to ascertain this at presentation when levels of distress are high. Cutting is the most common form of self-harm and is often impulsive. It usually indicates a maladaptation of the coping mechanism aimed at reducing emotional distress or anxiety. Girls are more likely to attempt self-harm than boys， but boys are at higher risk of completed suicide.\n\n【24】eri assessing a person who presents with self-harm， it is important to consider the level of planning and intent， and the frequency of thoughts and actions that relate to self-harm or suicide. Other symptoms or signs that might suggest the presence of an underlying mental health illness are relevant， and would include a history of substance abuse and self-harm or suicidal behaviour in family members or the peer group.\n\n【25】i is helpful to consider the 4 Ps when assessing the patient： predisposing factors， precipitating factors， perpetuating or maintaining factors， and protective factors or resilience.\n\n【26】Psychosocial assessments such as the HEADSSS framework can be used to encourage adolescents to discuss difficulties. This structured assessment starts by asking simple questions about the young person's home life， education and activities before moving on to more sensitive topics such as drugs and alcohol， sex and relationships， self-harm behaviours and safety 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u>. In any such discussion with the young person， it is usually more helpful to focus on how the young person is feeling and what led to the self-harm behaviour rather than what the behaviour is itself.\n\n【27】Examples of safeguarding issues that might be revealed during a psychosocial assessment for self-narm include a young person who is worried she is pregnant， who may be the subject of child sexual exploitation， or who may have been raped. A much older ‘partner' should always lead to more detailed enquiries. The possibility of a safeguarding risk should be seriously considered if a young person presents to the emergency department without a responsible adult， or if a parent or carer has not shown concern for the whereabouts of the young person.\n\n【28】There are recognised risk factors for suicidal behaviours， and these include depression and coexisting mental health issues such as anxiety. Previous suicide attempts， the use of drugs or alcohol when upset， and detailed planning on how to avoid discovery after the suicide attempt are all indicators of the risk of completed suicide or repetition of self-harm. A history of a relative or friend having committed suicide recently should be taken seriously. There has been relatively little research into factors that are protective against suicidal ideation and intent， but enhancing social skills， problem-solving abilities and the capacity of family and carers to offer emotional support are thought to be beneficial.\n\n【29】The care and management of young people who present with self-harm involves addressing any immediate medical needs， such as the treatment of the drug overdose to minimise any adverse effect. The medical management of a paracetamol overdose is a common topic in both the Foundation of Practice and Theory and Science examinations. The care and safety of the young person is paramount and it is usual practice to admit them for a more detailed psychosocial assessment by adolescent mental health professionals. This must take place promptly while the young person is in hospital. The young person should be cared for on an open ward in view of the nursing staff so that safety can be monitored. Ongoing management is targeted towards addressing the underlying difficulties of the young person. It is important to ensure that they are given alternative mechanisms for coping with the pressures that make them consider self-harm.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

According to the paramedics at the scene， the victim was found unconscious in an upstairs bedroom of the house. His past medical history is unknown. His pulse rate is 115 beats/minute， blood pressure is 150/85 mm Hg， and respiratory rate is 30 breaths/minute. The pulse oximeter registers91% oxygen saturation with oxygen by face mask.

Learn the initial assessment and treatment of patients with thermal injuries.\n\n【5】2\\. Learn the assessment and management of burn wounds.\n\n【6】3\\. Be familiar with the prognosis associated with thermal injuries.A 63-year-old man is found unconscious inside a burning house with an approxi-mately 40% TBSA burn injury and is brought to the emergency center. A burn patient found unconscious in a house fire has extremely high likelihood of hav-ing suffered smoke inhalation. Based on our initial assessment of his injury， the burn wound size is approximately 40%TBSA. Given the size of the wound， he will need to receive large volume of crystalloid fluids during the initial 48 hours ofhos-pitalization. With the combination of smoke inhalation and fluid administration. his airway will become edematous and compromised. In addition， the combina-tion of the patient's older age and large burn size are factors likely to contribute to pneumonia， acute lung injury and respiratory insufficiency. For all of these reasons， intubation and the initiation of mechanical ventilation are the most critical interventions during his initial management.\n\n【7】Once the airway is secured， we will need to start his fluid resuscitation with the infusion of Lactated Ringer solution. The initial infusion rate and volume can be estimated based on the formula of 2 to 4mL/kgx% burn size. If the patient is not already at a facility with the capacity to provide specialized burn care， immediate arrangement should be made to transfer him to a specialized burn unit. The com-bination of this patient’s age， burn wound size， and potential inhalation injuries are poor outcome prognosticators.PARTIAL-THICKNESS BURN WOUNDS： (Formerly known as second-degree burns) These are burns that extend beyond the epidermis and are classified as superficial or deep. Superficial partial-thickness wound appear as painful， pink wounds with blisters. With topical wound care such as silver sulfadiazine， superfi-cial partial-thickness wounds often heal within 2 weeks without much impairment or scarring. Deep partial-thickness wounds are often dried， mottled， and variably painful. These wounds can also be healed with topical wound care； however， spon-taneous healing is often associated with scarring and functional impairment； there-fore， deep partial thickness wounds are often treated by excision and skin-grafting.PARKLAND FORMULA：One of the most commonly applied strategies for initial burn resuscitation. This formula calculates the volume and rate of fluid adminis-tration for the first 24 hours for adults with major burns. (Affected TBSA%)×(4 mL of Lactated Ringer)x (weight of patient in kg). One-half of the calculated volume is given over the first 8 hours and the remainder given over the subsequent16 hours. The rate and volume of administration are adjusted to keep urine output between 0.5 and 1.0mL/kg/h.\n\nMODIFIED BROOKE FORMULA： The main difference between this approach and the Parkland formula is the use of colloid solution during the second 24 hours. This formula can be applied for adults with burns and children weighing more than 10 kg， and the formula utilizes lactated Ringer 2 to 4 mL/kgx%TBSA during the first 24 hours， with one-half of the volume given in the first 8 hours and the remaining fluid in the subsequent 16 hours. During the second 24 hours， colloid fluid (5% albumin in lactated ringer) is given at 0.3 to 0.5 mL/kgx%TBSA titrated to maintain urine output of>0.5mL/kg/h.Burn injuries account for over 600，000 emergency department visits and approxi-mately 50，000 hospital admissions in the United States each year. In the United States， more than 60% of the patients hospitalized for burn-related injuries are admitted to 125 specialized burn centers. Between 4% and 22% of burn patients require early admissions to the ICU. Major burn wounds are generally defined as injuries with>20%TBSA involvement. The skin is the largest organ ofthe body， and it is responsible for maintenance of fluid balance， temperature regulation， protein regulation， and serves as a barrier against bacteria and fungus. Patients with major burns require inpatient care； whereas， some patients with minor burn wounds can be managed in the outpatient setting with appropriate input and follow-up from practitioners who are knowledgeable about burn care.The hospital care of patients with major burn wounds can be viewed as three sepa-rate phases. The first phase encompasses day 1 to day 3， when complete evaluation of the patient and accurate fluid resuscitation are the primary goals. During the second phase， the main goals are initial wound excision and biologic wound cover-age to prevent/minimize wound sepsis， systemic inflammation and sepsis. Ideally， second phase goals should be accomplished immediately following phase 1 treat-ments. The third phase priorities include definitive wound closure/ coverage and 删除换行1 treatment of injuries to complex anatomic regions such as the hands， face， and geni-talia.Rehabilitation and some reconstructive processes are also undertaken during phase 3. It is important to bear in mind that the primary objectives in the care of hospitalized burn patients are to help patients return to work， school， community activities， and normal life.The initial assessment of a burn patient is the same as for any other trauma patient(with attention to airway， breathing， and circulation-the ABCs). It is important to remember that many patients with burn injuries also suffer from injuries due to other mechanisms including blunt and penetrating trauma (examples include fires associated with explosions， fires following automobile crashes， and falls from height following electrical burns from power lines). Overall， concomitant injuries are encountered in roughly 10% of the burn victims.Carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning is a cause of hypoxia in burn patients who sustain their injuries in enclosed-space fires. The inhalation of CO causes hypoxia， as CO has a 240-fold great affinity than oxygen (O，) for binding to hemoglobin， thus shifting the oxyhemoglobin curve to the left. All victims rescued from the scene of closed-space fires should have their carboxyhemoglobin (COHgb) levels measured. A COH gb level of greater than 30% can produce permanent central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction， and a COH gb level greater than 60% can pro-duce coma and death. It is important to be aware that a victim trapped in a smoky， house fire can develop COH gb level of 30% within 3 minutes. When inhalation injury is found in a patient with a burn that is greater than 20%TBSA， the patient has a 90% chance of requiring ventilator support. Oxygen therapy can help reduce the CO in blood. The half-life of CO in the blood in a patient receiving room air is250 minutes； whereas， the half-life of CO in a patient receives 100% oxygen deliv-ered through an endotracheal tube by a ventilator， is reduced to 40 to 60 minutes. The severity of CO associated injury can be underestimated because of the drop in level of COH gb associated with time elapse and oxygen therapy. To best determine the extent of the CO injury， we need to estimate the elapsed time between theCutaneous burns produce accelerated fluid losses into interstitialtissue in the burned and unburned areas. Inflammatory mediators such as prostaglandins， thromboxane A2， and reactive oxygen radicals are released from injured tissues， which produce local edema， increased capillary permeability， decreased tissue perfusion， and end-organ dysfunction. Burn size exceeding 20% TBSA will produce systemic inflam-matory responses and interstitial edema in tissues and organs away from the injured areas. With large burns， an initial decrease in cardiac output occurs and is later fol-lowed by hypermetabolic responses. Because of the tissue fluid losses and perfu-sion changes， burn resuscitation a key component in patient management.Organs， including the skin， can progress from a hypoperfusion state to permanent damage if resuscitation is not accomplished in a timely and appropriate manner.The “rule of nines”is a useful guide in estimating the extent of a person’s burn(Table10-1). This approach divides the body into anatomic regions that represent9% or multiples of 9% of the TBSA. Another method of estimation is using the palm of the patient's hand (excluding the fingers) which represents approximately1% of the adult patient's total body surface.| Table 10-1·RULE OFNINES  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Location  | Adult (%)  | Infant (%)  |\n| Front of head with neck  | 4.5  | 9  |\n| Back of head with neck  | 4.5  | 9  |\n| Front of torso  | 18  | 18  |\n| Back of torso  | 18  | 18  |\n| Front of one arm  | 4.5  | 4.5  |\n| Back ofone arm  | 4.5  | 4.5  |\n| Front ofone leg (full leng th)  | 9  | 7  |\n| Back ofone leg (full length)  | 9  | 7  |\n\n| Table 10-2·BURN DEPTH  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | LocationAffected  | Characteristics  | Course  | Treatment  |\n| First-deg ree  | Epidermis  | Erythema andpain  | Heals in 3-4 d without scarring.

As burns marginate， the assessment of depth may change from those estimated during the initial assessment， and this is particularly true of scald burns that often do not appear to be as deeply involved during the initial assessments. Fourth-degree burns are wounds that extend through the skin， subcutaneous fat， and deeper soft tissue structures.Most adults with burns involving less than 15%TBSA can be resuscitated with oral fluids. For patients with larger wounds， isotonic solution such as lactated ringer(LR) solution is preferred over normal saline (NS) because NS given in large volumes causes hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis. Fluid resuscitation require-ments are estimated based on burn wound size. The Parkland formula for adults and children over 10 kg in weight is calculated using 4mL/kgx%TBSA burn， with half of the fluid given during the first 8 hours and remainder given over the sub-sequent 16 hours. The Modified Brooke Formula is calculated to given LR at 2mL/kgx%TBSA burn， with half of the volume given during the first 8 hours and remainder given during the subsequent 16 hours. During the second 24 hours，5%albumin in LR is given to help compensate for the increase in capillary permeability and protein leakage. The various formulas that have been developed help to guide initial fluid administration， and all patients need close monitoring for responses to the resuscitation. It is important to keep in mind that inhalation injury， deep burn， and delayed presentation are factors that cause greater fluid requirements than the volume calculated based on burn sizes alone. It is important to keep in mind that insufficient fluid administration as well as excess fluid administrationUrine output measurement (UOP) is a generally useful method of assessing the adequacy of burn resuscitation. For most adults， UOP of 0.5 mL/kg/h is consid-ered sufficient， for children an UOP of 0.5 to 1.0 mL/kg/ h is desirable， and UOP of 1 to 2 mL/kg/h is strived for in the resuscitation of infants. Generally， UOPs are averaged over every 2 to 3 hours before changes in fluid resuscitation are made. Excess urine output should be avoided unless the patient is being intentionally treated for myoglobinuria. It is important to keep in mind that urine output can be falsely elevated when the patient has hyperglycemia associated with a large amount of glucose in the urine.\n\n【11】Compartment syndromes ofthe abdomen and extremities are unintended byprod-ucts of volume resuscitation for burns. Bladder pressure monitoring is important in patients receiving large-volume fluid resuscitations. Bladder pressures>20 mm Hg plus at least one additional organ dysfunction are indications of abdominal com-partment syndrome and are potential indications for abdominal decompression. Impaired capillary refill， increasing pain， and paresthesias in the extremities are signs of extremity hypoperfusion and suggest the need for decompressive proce-dures such as escharotomies and/ or fasciotomies.The skin is a vital structure in temperature regulation and in the defense against bacterial and fungal infections. Care must be taken to prevent hypothermia and burn wound infections in burn patients. Burn site infections can lead to systemic infections and sepsis. The use of steroids and other immunosuppressive agents should be limited when treating patients with burn wounds greater than 10%TBSA. Prophylactic intravenous antibiotics are not recommended because of their association with infections by resistant organisms. Several topical agents are used in the care of burn wounds， and these agents typically have local broad antimicro-bial activities and are effective in preventing microbial colonization. Silver sulfa-diazine (SS) is one of the most commonly applied topical agents； SS application is generally soothing to the patient and fairly well-tolerated. Wounds with eschars and infections are more effectively treated with sulfamylon based on its ability to penetrate the eschar. Temporary coverage of partial thickness burns and excised nongrafted wounds with biologic dressings are beneficial in preventing heat and fluid loss， reducing pain， and in promoting epithelialization. The coverage of burn wounds with biologic dressings becomes most relevant when dealing with patients who do not have sufficient amount of autologous donor skin for definitive cover-age and in the management of patients with partial thickness burns undergoing spontaneous healing. Porcine or bovine xenografts， cadaver skin， and acellular der-mal matrix are the major types of biologic dressings applied for temporary wound coverage. Study results show that burn wounds treated with biologic dressings epithelialized faster and with less hypertrophic scarring in comparison to wounds treated with topical antimicrobial agents alone. The major limitations associatedSystemic： Burns larger than 20%TBSA are associated with systemic hypermet-abolic responses； this is an indication for transfer to a specialized burn center删除25：<u></u>. These responses include activation of the complement and coag-ulation pathways leading to microvascular thromboses， capillary leak， and intersti-tial edema. The activation of the inflammatory cascade triggers a subsequent coun-ter-regulatory anti-inflammatory response that produces immune-suppression and susceptibility to nosocomial infections and sepsis.Cardiovascular： Myocardial depression often occurs transiently following major burns， and this is caused by vasoactive and inflammatory mediators that are released by the injured tissue. In selective patients， inotropic agents may be indi-cated to help support end-organ perfusion during the first 24 to 48 hours following the injury. Venous thromoembolic events occur in 1% to 23% of the hospitalized burn patients， and the chemoprophylaxis should be administered to reduce the risk of this complication.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

The mucosa of the proventriculus was pale, rough in texture, and proliferative with prominent irregular folds.\n\n【16】Histopathologic examination revealed patchy congestion of the spleen, marked autolysis of the duodenum, cloacal, and lower gastrointestinal tract. The liver exhibited diffuse congestion. Multiple 0.5 to 1.0 mm tubular nematode parasites were present in the submucosa of the proventriculus. These parasites had a distinct body cavity with prominent reproductive organs and a thick connective tissue outer capsule. They were surrounded by a keratinizing proventricular epithelial layer. The proven-triculus exhibited a mild hyperkeratosis. The pathological diagnosis was proventricular mucosal hyperplasia, associated with nematodiasis and severe feather picking. The proventricular nematodes were likely to be either a Spiroptera sp. or a Dispharynx sp.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

She presented to the student health service with a chief complaint of SOB, left-sided chest pain, and exertion-related episodes of presyncope, with one episode of frank syncope, promptly regaining consciousness after becoming supine on the ground. She was referred to an electrophysiologist at a nearby hospital for a same day evaluation of the syncopal episode and persistent tachycardia at 100 bpm (usual heart rate 60 bpm).\n\n【18】Her detailed clinical history included the onset of symptoms 6 weeks prior to presentation for medical evaluation. Although she was in a good state of physical fitness, she was unable to walk more than one block and developed lightheadedness and presyncope with stair climbing and with any of her ROTC activities. The syncopal episode occurred during ROTC exercises, two weeks before her clinic presentation, and she was suspended from any further military training until cleared medically. She denied any history of similar symptoms, surgical procedures, pregnancy, history of DVT/PE, chronic lower extremity edema, or injury. She did take a plane flight and went on a cruise 6 weeks before the onset of her symptoms. She did report starting estrogen-containing oral contraceptives 17 months before the onset of her first clinical symptoms, for the purpose of birth control and premenstrual dysphoric syndrome.\n\n【19】She had an unremarkable past medical history.\n\n【20】Her family history was notable for her father having experienced a deep venous thrombosis (DVT) without a known clotting disorder.\n\n【21】The physical examination was unremarkable, except for a resting heart rate of 120 bpm and respiratory rate of 20 per minute. The blood pressure was 100/70 mmHg. The resting pulse oximetry showed an O <sub>2 </sub> saturation of 99% on room air. A 12-lead electrocardiogram demonstrated normal findings with a sinus tachycardia. Laboratory studies were normal except for a mild elevation of the ALT at 50 U (normal range 5–35 U). A urine pregnancy test was negative.\n\n【22】Initial assessment included an echocardiogram which demonstrated a low normal LV ejection fraction at 50%, a severely increased RV size with severely decreased function, significant shift of the intraventricular septum into the LV cavity, a severely enlarged right atrium, mild tricuspid regurgitation with a RVSP estimated at 68 mmHg, and a small pericardial effusion.

The clinical history related was consistent with a possible pulmonary embolic event as long as 6 weeks prior; however her presentation was prompted by worsening symptoms that were hemodynamically significant.\n\n【30】She was transferred to a tertiary hospital as the patient and parents requested additional consults prior to moving forward with thrombolysis given lack of consensus in the treatment plan. Hematology and Pulmonary Hypertension/Cardiology consults were obtained and achieved consensus was to withhold lytic therapy for concern that she had acute on chronic pulmonary emboli.\n\n【31】A lung ventilation-perfusion scan was recommended.

She was at a therapeutic level on warfarin therapy (patient refused Eliquis). She was hemodynamically stable and ambulatory. Thrombolytic therapy was never given, as the consensus of opinions was that she had acute pulmonary emboli on top of significant chronic thrombi. The oral contraceptive (OCP) drugs were discontinued on admission.\n\n【39】Six weeks after hospital discharge the patient was working full-time in a restaurant in her hometown, was increasing her activities and doing well. She was stable on 8 mg of warfarin daily. By eleven weeks after hospital discharge, the patient was feeling fine with no complaints. She was participating in a yoga class and sailing. She also underwent a HAST study for a planned vacation trip to San Diego and did not require oxygen for the flight. She denied dyspnea with her activities, though still had not regained her usual physical activity level yet. Her physical examination was unremarkable. Hypercoagulable lab studies all came back negative.

She discontinued her warfarin without recurrence of any concerning symptoms (WHO Functional Class I). Echocardiogram findings: normal RV size and function; PASP 21 mmHg, TAPSE 26 mm, normal IVC, and no effusion.\n\n【43】Radiographic Interpretation\n---------------------------\n\n【44】CTPA demonstrates acute and subacute pulmonary embolism. There are central filling defects surrounded by rim of contrast medium in multiple segmental pulmonary artery branches, characteristic of acute emboli. Clot retraction to the periphery of the vessel in the distal right main pulmonary artery is likely due to clot reorganisation and recanalization and is indicative of the subacute nature of the process. There is near complete occlusion of left lower lobe and right upper lobe arteries. Whilst this can be seen with both acute and chronic thromboembolic disease, the vessel is typically distended in acute PE and becomes fibrosed and attenuated with progression to CTEPH. Other angiographic features of CTEPH include pouch defects, intravascular webs and stenosis with or without post-stenotic dilatation (Castañer et al.). Systemic collaterals also take time to develop and are therefore not a feature of acute PE. Another useful clue to the chronicity of the disease on CT is the presence of geographical variation in lung parenchymal attenuation, termed as ‘mosaic attenuation’.\n\n【45】It is possible to evaluate the cardiac chambers even on a non-ECG gated CTPA. The diameter ratio of right to left ventricle on transverse CT sections has the strongest predictive value and most robust evidence base for adverse clinical outcomes in acute PE. A RV/LV ratio ≥1.0 has been shown to have a 2.5-fold risk for all-cause mortality and a fivefold risk for PE–related mortality (Meinel at al.). On this study, there is dilatation of the right ventricle, under-filled small left ventricular cavity size (RV:LV > 1.5) with flattening of interventricular septum.\n\n【46】The appearances of catheter pulmonary angiography mirror that of CTPA with multifocal, predominantly central filling defects bilaterally associated with large wedge shaped perfusion defects. Similar bilateral wedge shaped segmental mismatched perfusion defects are also seen on the VQ scintigraphy. Unlike CTPA, it is difficult to differentiate acute and chronic thromboembolic disease solely using scintigraphy as both can produce similar defects. A baseline VQ at presentation can be very useful to follow the temporal evolution of the disease but perfusion deficits can be persistent for up to 12 months after the initial event and do not necessarily equate to CTEPH (Nijkeuter et al.). Happily in this case, the follow-up VQ shows complete resolution of the perfusion defects, effectively excluding progression to CTEPH.\n\n【47】A small proportion of patients labelled as acute PE at the time of initial presentation actually have acute on chronic thromboembolic disease (Guérin et al.). This is an important distinction to make as they have very different therapeutic options. Of the various imaging modalities, CTPA is the non-invasive method of choice for differentiating the two conditions, particularly in an emergency setting.\n\n【48】Clinical Comments\n-----------------\n\n【49】Though this patient was initially referred for pulmonary thromboendarterectomy surgery, there were a number of considerations that supported a more conservative approach. Available information does suggest that when cardiopulmonary symptoms are presented for greater than 2 weeks at the time of initial presentation, that there’s a higher likelihood that some component of chronic thromboembolic disease may be present. Though the presence of RV enlargement and strain are concerning, this in itself is not a distinguishing feature between an acute pulmonary embolic event versus the presence of chronic thromboembolic disease. The absence of RVH, the CT appearance of the thrombus, the absence of pulmonary vascular changes that are associated with organized, recanalized thrombus as described by Dr. Gopalan, and the absence of other findings that might suggest long-time pulmonary arterial obstruction, such as bronchial arterial collateral blood vessels—as was the situation in this case—makes acute or subacute pulmonary emboli the most likely diagnosis. The pulmonary hemodynamic profile as well supported the diagnosis of a more acute pulmonary embolic event. The classic findings of Sutton and colleagues in the 1970s established that with an acute PE, a modest rise in pulmonary pressures are to be expected given the limitations of a “unconditioned” RV presented with an abrupt rise in vascular resistance. For those with chronic thromboembolic disease, however, the right ventricle has been able to compensate for the longstanding elevation in RV afterload, and pulmonary pressures at presentation can be significantly elevated.\n\n【50】Points of Emphasis\n------------------\n\n【51】With the availability of numerous interventional modalities to treat acute and chronic thromboembolic disease, especially for clinically decompensating patients, it becomes increasingly important to be able to distinguish between clinical entities.\n\n【52】Diagnosis\n---------\n\n【53】1.  1.\n    Acute pulmonary emboli with right heart strain.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Answer B (clonidine) would not be good maintenance therapy given questions regarding his compli-ance with treatment and the risk of rebound hypertension. Answer D (refer to social worker and do not prescribe antihypertensives) is incorrect because it is unethical not to treat this patient with critically high blood pressures. While the patient’s nonadherence should be explored and addressed， it is imperative to get the blood pressure controlled first.\n\n【19】7.2 B. Elevated blood pressure without symptoms may occur acutely after sur-gery， particularly because of postoperative pain. Answer C (starting beta-blocker therapy) would be appropriate only if the patient had critically elevated blood pressures (systolic blood pressure > 180 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure > 110 mm Hg) or symptoms of end-organ damage. Blood pressure medications are usually not indicated when the pressures are below the malignant range； rather， pain control is the primary treatment. Lowering the blood pressure excessively can lead to orthostatic hypotension when the patient gets out of bed. Answer A (admitting to the ICU and obtaining cardiac enzymes) is not necessary in an asymptomatic patient whose increased blood pressure can be explained by postoperative pain. Answer D (restrict visitors， limit noise) would not treat the patient’s underlying pain.\n\n【20】7.33D. Elevated blood pressures may exacerbate congestive heart failure and must be treated. Both ACE inhibitors and oral nitrates or intravenous nitroglycer-ine are used to treat acute heart failure. ACE inhibition reduces afterload，and oral nitrates or intravenous nitroglycerine reduce preload. Answer A (prescrib-ing beta-blockers) would be inappropriate for this patient； beta-blockers are generally avoided when patients are volume overloaded because beta-block-ers decrease myocardial contractility and can thus worsen acute heart failure. Answer B (treatment with intravenous dopamine) would be inappropriate for this patient because the dopamine may exacerbate the increased blood pres-sure and peripheral resistance. Answer C (observe the clinical status) is not appropriate with a blood pressure so high.\n\n【21】7.4D. In general， blood pressure should not be acutely decreased (unless systolic blood pressure > 220 mm Hg) in an individual suspected of having an isch-emic stroke because of the concern for cerebral hypoperfusion and worsening brain ischemia. If thrombolytic therapy is considered， blood pressure should be controlled to <185/100 mm Hg， but this patient's symptom duration pre-cludes that consideration. In contrast， patients with intracerebral hemorrhage require urgent blood pressure decrease to values of 140 mm Hg systolic or less to decrease the propagation of the hemorrhage.

This rare variant of pemphigus shows no gender predilection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 , 17 , 24 \\]</u>, and is predominantly observed in adults 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 22 \\]</u>. PH exhibits clinical features similar to dermatitis herpetiformis and immunological findings of pemphigus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Since Jablonska et al. first described PH in 1975, nearly 100 cases have been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【31】Clinical presentation consists of pruritic vesicles, papules and bullae over erythematous background, arranged in a herpetiform distribution. Some lesions may centrifugally spread, originating annular and polycyclic plaques 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 22 \\]</u>. Usual sites of involvement are the thorax, torso, and proximal limbs; mucous membranes are usually spared 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 , 22 \\]</u>.

Santi et al. reported seven cases of PH in which two patients developed lesions before pemphigus foliaceus (n = 1) and pemphigus vulgaris (n = 1) diagnosis, and five patients who presented lesions consistent with PH during PF (n = 4) and PV treatment (n = 1). Therefore, PH could be a transient, clinical presentation of classical pemphigus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 24 \\]</u>.\n\n【35】Current evidence suggests the occurrence of an epitope-spreading phenomenon: autoantibodies anti-desmoglein 1 and 3 bind to different antigen sites. Kubo et al. proposed that in pemphigus foliaceus and pemphigus vulgaris, pathogenic IgG autoantibodies disrupt adhesive properties of desmogleins and activate proteinases signaling and release, causing acantholysis. Meanwhile, acantholysis is rarely observed in PH because keratinocyte adhesion mediated by desmogleins is preserved 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. O’Toole et al. demonstrated that in PH patients, IgG autoantibodies upregulate IL-8 production by keratinocytes, which attracts neutrophils 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 20 \\]</u>. After recruitment and activation mediated by the Fc portion of IgG, neutrophils secrete proteases leading to spongiosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【36】IgG subclasses might be another determinant of disease profile. IgG1 and IgG3 are predominant during remission or preclinical asympthomatic pemphigus vulgaris, while IgG4 is a marker of disease activity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 25 \\]</u>. Nevertheless, in PH, IgG1 and IgG3, but not IgG4 are able to induce eosinophilic activation and degranulation with release of mediators that promote spongiosis and possibly mild acantholysis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【37】Since neutrophils and eosinophils play an important role in the pathogenesis of PH, dapsone is the first line treatment. Sulphonamide reduces polymorphonuclear chemotaxis, and inhibits tissue damage mediated by lysosomal enzymes and toxic oxygen species 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 7 \\]</u>. Dosages vary from 100 to 300 mg/day in monotherapy or combined with low dose systemic corticosteroid 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【38】PH has a good prognosis with rapid response to therapy in about two thirds of the patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>, especially when antibody serum titers are low or absent, and eosinophilic spongiosis is observed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 5 \\]</u>.

The mother has noticed her daughter scratching and rubbing her anal area frequently for the past few days. Her anal area has been getting red and raw from all the scratching. Her mother has used some petrolatum (petroleum jelly) and hydrocortisone cream, but it has not helped much. The child has not had any obvious skin rashes and is not scratching any other part of her body. She has not had diarrhea. She takes no medications and has no significant medical history. She attends day care 4 days a week. On examination, she is a well-appearing child. Her vital signs and general examination are normal. Examination of her perianal area reveals some erythema and excoriation from scratching. You perform a microscopic examination of a sample collected by touching the perianal region with a piece of clear cellophane tape.\n\n【3】 What diagnostic finding are you likely to see on this microscopic examination?\n\n【4】 What is the organism responsible for this infection?\n\n【5】### ANSWERS TO CASE 47:\n\n【6】#### Enterobiasis or Pinworm Infection\n\n【7】Summary: A 4-year-old girl has perianal pruritus. The diagnosis is made by microscopic examination of a sample collected by touching the perianal region with a piece of clear cellophane tape.\n\n【8】• Diagnostic finding likely to see on this microscopic examination: Thin-walled, ovoid eggs flattened on one side and contain a nematode larva.\n\n【9】• Organism responsible for this infection: Enterobius vermicularis .\n\n【10】### CLINICAL CORRELATION\n\n【11】E. vermicularis , commonly called the pinworm, is the most common cause of helminthic infections in the United States and is endemic around the world. Humans are the only known host for E. vermicularis , but other vertebrates can be infected with different species of this nematode. Adult worms, approximately 1 cm in length, white and thread-like in appearance, inhabit the large intestine. Gravid females migrate to the perianal and perineal regions at night to lay eggs that are immediately infective. Infection is more common in children than adults and is often asymptomatic. However, a variety of symptoms are ascribed to pinworms. Atypically, worms are sometimes found in an inflamed appendix, and there are rare reports of worms reaching the genital tract and producing vaginitis. By far the most common signs of infection occur in children and include restless sleep and tiredness during the day. However, more common symptoms consist of anal or perianal itching because of the adult worms crawling on the skin. The eggs can also cause local itching, which may be more intense in secondary infections as a result of allergic reactions to their antigenic coating. Frequent scratching results in transfer to the hands and areas under the fingernails. Eggs are frequently transferred to clothing, bedding, toys, and dust, where they can survive for several weeks. Through hand-to-mouth transmission, the eggs are ingested and hatch in the duodenum. Larvae released from eggs reside in the cecum and reach adult stage in about a month. Infections are acute, generally lasting 4 to 8 weeks. Considering the relatively short duration of a single infection, chronic enterobiasis is caused by reinfection.\n\n【12】### APPROACH TO:\n\n【13】#### The Suspected Enterobius Infection\n\n【14】### OBJECTIVES\n\n【15】1\\. Learn the life cycle of E. vermicularis and the epidemiology and clinical course of infection.\n\n【16】2\\. Describe 3 basic aspects of infection: transmission, diagnosis, and treatment/prevention.\n\n【17】### DEFINITIONS\n\n【18】PINWORM: Common name for E. vermicularis\n\n【19】CERVICAL ALAE: An extension of a lateral cuticular protuberance or lateral line on the body surface of the pinworm that extends to the head region and appears microscopically as a “flared” region or collar. Adult worms are identified, in part, by the presence of cervical alae, which are prominent structures when examined microscopically\n\n【20】NOCTURNAL MIGRATION: Refers to the tendency of pinworms to migrate at night from the colon, out the anus, to the perianal and perineal regions to deposit eggs\n\n【21】LARVATED EGG: Refers to eggs that contain a larval stage and are deposited by pinworms on the skin\n\n【22】### DISCUSSION\n\n【23】Characteristics of Enterobiasis That Impact Transmission\n\n【24】A patient acquires infection by ingesting the pinworm eggs containing infective larvae. Ingested eggs hatch in the small intestine, releasing larvae that migrate to the cecal area and mature into adult male and female worms that are free or insecurely attached to the mucosa. The period between ingestion of eggs to maturation takes approximately 3 to 4 weeks. Following copulation, the female pinworms produce eggs. Rather than release eggs in the bowel, the female worms migrate out the anus onto the surrounding skin and release eggs. Worm migration usually occurs at night. Each female will lay thousands of microscopic, larvated eggs. Pinworm eggs are infective within a few hours after being deposited on the skin. They can survive up to 2 weeks on clothing, bedding, or other objects. Individuals can become infected after accidentally swallowing infective pinworm eggs from contaminated surfaces or fingers. The duration of a single infection is 4 to 8 weeks.\n\n【25】### DIAGNOSIS\n\n【26】Although Enterobius is an intestinal parasite, eggs are rarely found during laboratory examinations of stools. If a person is suspected of having pinworms, then the so-called “scotch tape test” should be used to identify the parasite. Transparent adhesive tape, sometime attached to the end of tongue depressor or “pinworm paddle,” is pressed in the anal region. This procedure involves the help of a patient or parents of suspected children. The tape is then transferred to a glass slide, sticky side down. The slide should then be examined microscopically for eggs. Pinworm eggs are approximately 20 × 50 μm and are characteristically flattened on one side and usually contain an active larva. Because bathing or having a bowel movement may remove eggs, the scotch tape impression should be made on awakening in the morning. In children, samples taken from under the fingernails may also contain eggs because scratching of the anal area is common.\n\n【27】A definitive diagnosis may also be made on recovery and identification of adult worms seen directly in bed sheets or around the anal area. The female pinworm has a sharply pointed tail and anterior cervical alae that form a collar-like structure around the mouth. The female worm is about 1 cm long with a diameter of approximately 0.5 mm. In female worms that are gravid, the uterus filled with easily identifiable eggs is a common feature.\n\n【28】### TREATMENT AND PREVENTION\n\n【29】Highly effective drugs in the treatment of enterobiasis are mebendazole (first line) and pyrantel pamoate, which is preferred in pregnancy, given as a single dose, with a repeat dose administered 2 weeks later. Mebendazole is a broad-spectrum antinematode agent with a high therapeutic index. Close family contacts of infected individuals should also be treated. If reinfection occurs, then the source of the infection should be identified. Therefore, playmates, schoolmates, close contacts outside the house, and household members should be considered. Each infected person should receive the 2-dose treatment and, if necessary, more than 2 doses. In short, the importance of determining infection in the entire family and contacts should be explained in terms of the life cycle of the worm. Personal and group hygiene should be stressed.\n\n【30】### SYNPNOSIS\n\n【31】The synopsis of enterobiasis is presented in Table 47-1 .\n删除4：<u>Table 47-1 • SYNOPSIS OF ENTEROBIASIS</u>\n\n【32】###", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

In the waiting room he is belligerent and uncooperative. A physical examination reveals fever, tachycardia, horizontal nystagmus, hyperacusis, and pupils that are 3 mm in diameter bilaterally. Which of the following substances is most likely causing the behavioral changes and physical findings exhibited by this patient?\n\n【1】> (A) Alcohol\n\n【2】> (B) Amphetamines\n\n【3】> (C) Cocaine\n\n【4】> (D) Lysergic acid diethylamide\n\n【5】> (E) Nicotine\n\n【6】> (F) Phencyclidine\n\n【7】 Answer: The correct answer is F. This patient has taken phencyclidine, or PCP. Patients with PCP intoxication show signs of belligerence, impulsiveness, fever, psychomotor agitation, vertical and horizontal nystagmus, tachycardia, ataxia, homicidality, psychosis, and delirium. On withdrawal, patients may demonstrate a recurrence of intoxication when the PCP, which was trapped in an ionized form in the acidic gastric lumen, is reabsorbed in the alkaline duodenum. PCP users will have normal or small pupils. Death can result from a variety of causes, including respiratory depression and violent behavior.  \nAnswer A is incorrect. Patients presenting with acute alcohol intoxication will show symptoms of disinhibition, emotional lability, slurred speech, ataxia, coma, and blackouts. On withdrawal, they will demonstrate a tremor, tachycardia, hypertension, malaise, nausea, seizures, delirium tremens, tremulousness, agitation, and hallucinations.  \nAnswer B is incorrect. Patients presenting with amphetamine intoxication will display psychomotor agitation, impaired judgment, pupillary dilation, hypertension, tachycardia, euphoria, prolonged wakefulness and attention, cardiac arrhythmias, delusions, hallucinations, and fever. On withdrawal, they will show a post-use “crash” that includes depression, lethargy, headache, stomach cramps, hunger, and hyper-somnolence.  \nAnswer C is incorrect. Patients presenting with acute cocaine intoxication will show symptoms of euphoria, psychomotor agitation, impaired judgment, tachycardia, pupillary dilation, hypertension, hallucinations, paranoid ideations, angina, and sudden cardiac death. On withdrawal, they will show a post-use “crash” that includes severe depression, hyper-somnolence, fatigue, malaise, and severe psychological craving.  \nAnswer D is incorrect. Patients presenting with acute lysergic acid diethylamide intoxication will display marked anxiety or depression, delusions, visual hallucinations, flashbacks, and pupillary dilation.  \nAnswer E is incorrect. Patients presenting with acute nicotine intoxication will show symptoms of restlessness, insomnia, anxiety, and arrhythmias. On withdrawal, they will have symptoms of irritability, headache, anxiety, weight gain, craving, and tachycardia.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}
