It is defined as the presence of air in the epidural， subdural， or subarachnoid space， within the brain parenchyma or ventricular cavities. Several cases of air compressor-induced pneumocephalus have been described in literature， including few cases in the pediatric age.\n\n【2】We describe the case of a child with extended pneumocephalus caused by an air compressor gun and review the available literature on this topic. Our aim is to suggest a management strategy in clinical practice for pediatricians and neurosurgeons.\n\n【3】Keywords： Pneumocephalus； Air compressor； IPneumocephalus management； Pediatric neurosurgery\n\n【4】Introduction\n\n【5】The term pneumocephalus defines the presence of gas within any of the intracranial compartments (intraventricular， intraparenchymal， subarachnoid， subdural， and epidural) and commonly is a consequence of skull base， sinus， or open skull fractures due to head traumas. Other causes could be post intrathecal procedure， congenital skull defect，neoplasm， gas-producing organism (meningitis， ventriculitis， chronic otitis media and sinusitis)， barotrauma， post invasive procedures (i.e.， lumbar puncture， ventriculostomy， spinal anesthesia)， mask or nasal continuous positive-airwaypressure and can rarely occur spontaneously . Few case reports of air compressor-induced pneumocephalus are described in literature.\n\n【6】In this article， we present the case of a child with extended pneumocephalus caused by air compressor gun and review the available literature on this topic， with the aim to suggest a management strategy to apply in clinical practice.\n\n【7】Case Presentation\n\n【8】A previously healthy 7-year-old boy was admitted to our emergency department with chemosis of the left eye due to ocular trauma caused by an air compressor gun. The child hit his eye while he was trying to “brush his hair with the air\". On physical examination he was conscious (GCS15/15)， collaborating， afebrile and in good clinical condition. Painful left palpebral extensive oedema， proptosis and periorbital swelling with mild crepitations on palpation characterized his left eye. No neurological deficits or meningeal signs were detectable. Ophthalmological examination described intact ocular motility， visual acuity and pupillary light reflex. An orbital and brain Computed Tomography (CT) revealed air in the left frontal area， Willis polygonus， ponto-cerebellar and quadrigemina cisterns without midline cerebral shift . There were no detectable skull base or facial fractures. The child was admitted in the neurosurgical department for clinical observation. Topical antibiotic eye drops and endovenous antibiotics were started (vancomycin 15mg/kg TID plus ceftazidime 50 mg/kg TID). In addition，pneumococcal vaccine was recommended to complete the vaccination schedule. After 5 days， a brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) revealed resolution of endocrine pneumocephalus and reduction of the air component also in the orbital area and retrobulbar adipose tissue. Endovenous antibiotics were carried on until day 14from admission.\n\n【9】Table 1： Characteristics of reported cases of air compressor-induced pneumocephalus，including our case (NA： Not Available).\n\n| Date[referencel  | Age(Year)  | Associatedfracture  | Radiologicalinvestigation  | Conservative therapy  | Antibiotic prophylaxis  | Length ofhospitalization  | Neurological/ophthalmiccomplication  | Infectiouscomplication  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2006  | 4  | No  | Skull X-ray andCT  | Yes  | Yes (topical and systemic)  | NA  | No  | No  |\n| 2014  | 9  | No  | CT/Orbital MRI  | Yes  | Yes (topical and parental)  | 7 days  | No  | No  |\n| 2002  | 16  | No  | CT  | Yes  | NA  | NA  | No  | No  |\n| 2020| 18  | No  | CT  | Yes  | Yes (topical antibiotic)  | 24 hours  | No  | No  |\n| 2007   | 22  | No  | CT  | Yes (Suture of conjunctival laceration)  | Yes (topical and systemic)  | NA  | No  | No  |\n| 1999  | 47  | No  | CT  | Yes firrigation and debridement of conjunctival wound)  | Yes (topical and oral)  | NA  | No  | No  |\n| 2016  | 62  | No  | CT  | Yes (closure on the evelid Lacerations and canalicular repair)  | Yes  | 4 days  | Yes (Optic nerveinjury)  | No  |\n| 2020 (Current case)  | 7  | No  | CT  | Yes  | Yes (topical and parental)  | 15 days  | No  | No  |\n\n【11】Discussion\n\n【12】Pneumocephalus (PN) is defined as the presence of air in the epidural， subdural， or subarachnoid space， within the brain parenchyma or ventricular cavities. It can be congenital， traumatic(the most common cause)， infectious， neoplastic， iatrogenic or spontaneous. It is classified as simple or， more rarely，tension PN .\n\n【13】The CT is the gold standard investigation in the diagnosis of PN， as it can detect as little as 0.55 mL of air in the brain. MRI may also be useful， but not as sensitive as CT scan .\n\n【14】There are few case reports of unusual facial injuries as a cause for PN， secondary to accidental air compressor injury . These data are summarized in Table 1. Interestingly， all the previous case reports included compressor tip injuries to one or both eyes without any documented skull fractures.\n\n【15】Given the lack of bony fractures， we agree that the most likely explanation is air entry to the cranial cavity via dissection beneath the Tenon fascia， around the optic nerve， and through the optic canal into the subarachnoid space， as firstly postulated by Williams and Frankel in.\n\n【16】High-pressure injury to the orbit could be responsible of direct contusion to the orbital contents (as in our case)， traumatic optic atrophy with subsequent poor vision， injection of foreign bodies inside the conjunctiva with risk of infection and inflammation， displacement of the orbital contents with proptosis and fractures.\n\n【17】In the majority of cases PN is asymptomatic， because intracerebral air is generally well tolerated . Similarly， to our patient， also in previous studies patients with air compressor-induced PN presented severe pain and swelling of the eyelids and face， without neurological deficits or meningeal signs.\n\n【18】Despite this， on rare occasions PN might result in tension PN， a neurosurgical emergency that might lead to brainstem herniation and death .\n\n【19】Twenty cases of post-traumatic tension PN are reported in literature， mostly associated with severe craniofacial fractures. The imaging appearance of tension PN should be correlated with clinical signs of deterioration or visual symptoms and may require emergent treatment (decompression such as with a burr hole and/or with needle aspiration) .\n\n【20】Seizures can sometimes occur by irritating the cerebral cortex； moreover， the risk of meningitis and brain abscesses deserves to be mentioned.\n\n【21】PN secondary to air compressor injury is a rare event and no guidelines on its management are currently available.\n\n【22】Our case， as well as the other similar ones reported in literature， has been treated conservatively. Conservative management includes bed rest， maintaining a supine position， the use of normobaric oxygenation， the avoidance of Valsalva maneuver (like nose-blowing， coughing， and sneezing)， analgesics， antipyretics and administration of prophylactic antibiotics. The use of hyperbaric oxygenation may be useful in the management of symptomatic persistent PN .\n\n【23】It is important to report that， to date， there is no evidence supporting the prophylactic use of antibiotics in patients with basilar skull fractures， with or without PN .\n\n【24】However， our concern was that， although we know that high pressure in the compressor could affect microorganisms gene expression and protein synthesis and could induce enzyme denaturation ， the air entered intracranially through a non-sterilepassage. Gram-positive bacteria are more resistant to pressure than Gram-negative bacteria . As we believed that early antibiotic prophylaxis should be started， we decided to use broad-spectrum antibiotics， particularly effective against Gram-positive microorganisms. Almost all previous reported patients received prophylactic antibiotics， but in the majority of cases authors did not specify which molecules and timing they choose. Even if our approach is not supported by specific literature， the significantly extended not sterile intracranial air allowed us to use aggressive antibiotic prophylaxis with centrally active antibiotics. We decided to continue this antibiotic treatment until the complete reabsorption of PN. No adverse reactions to antibiotics have developed as well as any infectious complications. Considering pneumococcus as one of the most common infecting organisms in PN secondary to trauma， we also suggest an anti-pneumococcal vaccine.\n\n【25】To the best of our knowledge， this is the first mini-review of air compressor-induced PN currently available. Despite this injury being rare， some cases have been reported， especially in the pediatric age.1LIN Prognosis is usually good， as in our case. Few simple steps should be followed to conservatively treat PN and prevent its possible complications.\n\n【26】Conclusion\n\n【27】Despite air compressor induced-pneumocephalus is usually a rare event， it could be useful for pediatricians and neurosurgeons to follow a few simple steps for better management.\n\n【28】We suggest conservative management including clinical observation， bed rest， maintaining a supine position and avoidance of Valsalva maneuver. Depending on clinical status， remember to consider normobaric or hyperbaric oxygenation； in the rare case of tension PN， urgent neurosurgery could be considered. We also recommend the use of broad-spectrum antibiotic prophylaxis in addition to anti-pneumococcal and anti-tetanic vaccine， in order to complete vaccination schedule. An infectious disease consultation could be indicated. Finally， not forget to remember to avoid diving and air travelling at the time of the discharge.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 11:12:48", "endTime": "2024/09/24 11:12:59", "cost": 10.882}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:36", "update_time": "2024-09-23 19:12:59", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 19:12:48"}

However， not any user friendly methods have been presented yet to score the snoring severity of subjects in home conditions. Sleep applications (apps)， which is claimed to score snoring severity of the patients， have been came into use with technological opportunities provided by smart phones. Nevertheless， there are not any reports in the literature about the usage of these apps yet.\n\n【2】This report describes the utilization of a sleep app in the short-term follow-up of Mandibular Advancement Device(MAD) therapy applied for a moderate Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) patient with habitual snoring. Initially Epworth Sleepiness Scale (EPSS) of the patient was determined and sleep app recordings were performed simultaneously with PO at three different nights. The mean snore score and Oxygen Desaturation Index (ODI) were calculated. A custom MAD was fabricated and all recordings were repeated at the end of the 6 months usage.\n\n【3】The initial EPSS value of the patient was decreased from 16 to 3 with MAD therapy.

Using a sleep app in the scoring of snore severity seems like a promising innovation for the future home-based sleep studies.\n\n【4】Keywords： Snoring； Obstructive sleep apnea； Mandibular advancement device；Sleep application； Pulse oximetry\n\n【5】Introduction\n\n【6】Overnight， technician-attended，in-laboratory Polysomnography (PSG) is considered as a gold standard for definitive diagnosis of Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) . However， these PSG studies require high costs withal long waiting time for appointments due to the limited number of sleep laboratories despite the presence of increasing demand . In addition， some patients tend to prefer home-based studies rather than hospitalization required methods because of the higher comfort afforded by natural sleep environment. Pulse Oximetry (PO)which hasbeen successfully used in medicine for the last 40 years have become an effective home-based screening technique for OSA patients . Respiratory stability of subjects can be easily monitorized and recorded with overnight PO in home conditions. Thus， apneic and hypopneic episodes which indicate fluctuating arterial oxygen saturation can be safely detected and crucial events such as Oxygen Desaturation Index(ODI) and Heart Rate Variability (HRV) may be predicted from PO records . However， predicting the snoring severity can be more challenging than detecting the respiratory stability in home conditions， due to the absence of approved medical devices . Fortunately， it seems that a new promising opportunity arises with the wide usage of Smartphone's (SP) and their applications(apps) . Recently， program creators have presented several SP apps to record snoring sounds during sleep.Some of these apps can convert the recorded data to the numerical values and provide a snore score using a special algorithm . Despite the wide availability and ease of usage， only one in vitro study has been published about sleep apps yet . The present case report was aimed to describe utilization of a novel home-based evaluation technique that was consisted of sleep app and PO in short-term follow-up of Mandibular Advancement Device (MAD) therapy applied for a moderate OSA patient with habitual snoring.\n\n【7】Case Presentation\n\n【8】A 43 year-old Caucasian male patient was referred to the otolaryngology， head and neck surgery clinic ofour hospital with the complaint of severe snoring， witnessed apnea and excessive daytime sleepiness. In clinical interview， he reported he had a serious traffic accident one year ago caused by daytime sleepiness. The patient’s history did not contain any systemic disorders， cigarette smoking and alcohol or drug abuse.\n\n【9】On the physical examination， the waist and neck circumferences and body mass index of the patient were 108 cm， 42 cm， and 29.8kg/m²respectively. Not any signs were detected during temporomandibular joint examination. On intraoral examination， presence of elongated soft palate， moderate macroglossia and slightly narrowed oropharynx were noted. Oropharengeal relationship of the patient was classified as Class 4 according to the Mallampati scale. His Epworth Sleepiness Scale (EPSS) was 16 and the provisional diagnosis was OSA. Thus， overnight PSG evaluation was required for definitive diagnosis.\n\n【10】According to the medical history， the patient had been referred to a sleep laboratory by a chest physician two years ago. However， having had difficulty in falling asleep and felt discomfort arising from cables and electrodes he had left the test unfinished. Therefore， it was decided to perform overnight PO recording at home in order to check his cardiorespiratory stability during sleep. In addition， snoring monitorization was planned concurrent with the PO recordings. Thus， a sleep app (SnoreLab， Reviva Soft works Ltd， London， UK) was downloaded and set as the creators'instructions. To obtain the most accurate data， the noise level of the patients' bedroom was checked with a sound level meter (LM-8102， Lutron Ltd， Taipei， Taiwan) and conveniences of the room conditions were confirmed. The patient was informed in detail about the working principals of the PO and the app. The Smartphone (IPhone 4S， Apple， CA， USA) was switched and the app was activated before sleep. Finally， the PO (Beurer PO80， Beurer Medical， Ulm， Germany) was inserted by a sleep technician and overnight recordings were performed at the patient’s home. In total， three recordings were executed in order to minimize the error margin. While the PO data were scored by an experienced chest physician and snore score values were calculated by the algorithm of the app. Results of the first snoring evaluation were given at the Figure1. PO and sleep app values of three overnight Diagnostic Recordings(DRs) were given at the Table 1.\n\n【11】According to DRs， the patient was diagnosed with moderate OSA and habitual snoring. The final treatment decision was to snore score 23 19 27 23\n\n【12】Table 1： The diagnostic results of the PO and sleep app recordings.\n\n| Results of the diagnostic PO recordings  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Results of the 1st DR  |  | Results of the 2nd DR  |  | Results of the 3rd DR  |  | The mean values of DRs  |  |\n|  | SpO2  | Pulse  | SpO2  | Pulse  | SpO2  | Pulse  | SpO2  | Pulse  |\n| Total events  | 199  | 158  | 138  | 82  | 126  | 119  | 154  | 119  |\n| Time in events  | 105.8  | 61.2  | 87.8  | 31.9  | 76.6  | 45.4  | 90  | 46.1  |\n| Average event duration  | 31.9  | 23.2  | 37.9  | 23.3  | 36.5  | 22.9  | 35.4  | 23.1  |\n| % Artifact  | 18.1  | 18.1  | 20  | 20  | 0.3  | 0.3  | 12.8  | 12.8  |\n| ODI  | 21.6  | 17.1  | 20.7  | 12.2  | 20.1  | 19  | 20.8  | 16.1  |\n| Basal SpO2  | 91  |  | 91.3  |  | 90.5  |  | 90.9  |  |\n| Minimum SpO2 (%)  | 78  |  | 81  |  | 81  |  | 80  |  |\n| Average pulse rate (bpm)  |  | 66.8  |  | 62.4  |  | 68.3  |  | 65.8  |\n| Lowest pulse rate (bpm)  |  | 55  |  | 54  |  | 58  |  | 55.6  |\n| Results of the diagnostics snoring recordings  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | Results of the 1th DR  | Results of the 2nd DR  |  | Results of the 3rd DR  |  | The mean values of DRs  |  |  |\n| Time monitoring (min)  | 423  | 386  |  | 362  |  | 390，3  |  |  |\n| Time snoring (min)  | 99  | 49  |  | 62  |  | 70  |  |  |\n\n【14】Table 2： The follow-up results of the PO and sleep app recordings.\n\n【15】Results of the follow-up PO recordings fabricate an individual Mandibular Advancement Device (MAD) to increase the volume of the patient’s upper airway. Impressions were made with irreversible hydrocolloid material (CA37， Cavex， Haarlem， Holland) and the master casts were obtained from Type III dental stone (Moldano， Heraeus Kulzer， Hanau， Germany). Maxillary and mandibular occlusal splints were manufactured with Autopolymerising Clear Acrylic Resin Material (ACARM) (Ortocryl， Dentaurum， Ispringen， Germany) on isolated master models such as to cover occlusal and incisal surfaces of the existing dentition. Prepared splints were inserted in the mouth and adjusted on dental arches. Afterwards，intermaxillary relationship was recorded at 75% of maximal mandibular protrusion and intraoral records were mounted on a semi-adjustable articulator (Artex Type NK， Amann Girrbach， Pforzheim，Deutschland). The vertical openingamount was increased up to 10 mm，approximately. Maxillary and mandibular splints were attached to each other using ACARM and finishing procedures were performed. After intraoral adjustments， the MAD was delivered to the patient with recommendations. Three Follow-Up Recordings(FRs) were performed at the end of the 6th month of the MAD treatment. The same recording procedure applied in the DRs was also performed during Frs. Insertion of the MAD during sleep was the only difference between DRs and FRs protocols. The results of the last snoring recording were shown in the Figure 1.\n\n|  | Results of the 1t FR  |  | Results of the 2nd FR  |  | Results of the 3dFR  |  | The mean values of FRs  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | SpO2  | Pulse  | SpO2  | Pulse  | SpO2  | Pulse  | SpO2  | Pulse  |\n| Total events  | 57  | 89  | 63  | 134  | 15  | 49  | 45  | 90.6  |\n| Time in events  | 28.3  | 38.7  | 36.3  | 47.3  | 6.3  | 13.3  | 23.6  | 33.1  |\n| Average event duration  | 29.8  | 26.1  | 34.5  | 21.2  | 25.3  | 16.9  | 29.8  | 21.4  |\n| % Artifact  | 11.8  | 11.8  | 4.7  | 4.7  | 19.7  | 19.7  | 11.9  | 11.9  |\n| ODI  | 9.6  | 15  | 9.7  | 20.7  | 6.7  | 21.8  | 8.6  | 19.1  |\n| Basal SpO2  | 90.7  |  | 90.3  |  | 89.6  |  | 90.2  |  |\n| Minimum SpO2 (%)  | 83  |  | 75  |  | 84  |  | 80.6  |  |\n| Average pulse rate (bpm)  |  | 67  |  | 68  |  | 82  |  | 72.3  |\n| Lowest pulse rate (bpm)  |  | 55  |  | 57  |  | 70  |  | 60.6  |\n| Results of the follow-up snoring recordings  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n\n|  | Results of the 1th FR  | Results of the 2nd FR  |  | Results of the 3rd FR  |  | The mean values of FRs  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Time monitoring (min)  | 370  | 389  |  | 409  |  | 389.3  |  |\n| Time snoring (min)  | 34  | 19  |  | 22  |  | 25  |  |\n| snore score  | 8  | 2  |  | 2  |  | 4  |  |\n\n【18】At the end of the six months follow-up period， the EPSS of the patient dramatically decreased at 3. The mean ODI of the patient was improved significantly with the MAD therapy. In addition， significant improvement in HRV was observed with the MAD therapy. Moreover， therapeutic effect of the MAD was recorded successfully with the sleep app. All snore scores obtained by the sleep app showed highly compatible alterations both with EPSS and PO values. Not any serious complaints were reported by the patient except dry mouth that generally occurred in mornings.\n\n【19】Discussion\n\n【20】According to our knowledge， this is the first report describing the utilization of a sleep app and PO in the management of a moderate OSA patient with habitual snoring. Gradually increasing usage of the PO in sleep studies can be observed from the current literature， and its diagnostic value has been qualified by previous studies . However， there exist some studies notifying the variable sensitivity of PO according to the severity of the OSA. Chung et al.  stated that PO recordings could be more sensitive for the patients having ODI above 10 (93%). The reason of the highly coherent ODI values obtained from three DRs could be arisen from the moderate severity of the OSA in the present case. In fact， three ODI values obtained from the DRs was extremely close to each other. However， a little less proximity was detected among ODI values obtained from FRS Nevertheless； strong and coherent relations was seen among EPSS， PO and sleep app values in terms of DRs and FRS Moreover， EPSS， PO and sleep app values dramatically decreased in chorus at the end of six months.\n\n【21】As seen in the present case， snoring may be the foremost signs of OSA directing the patients to seek a medical assistance. However， there is no agreement in the literature on the accuracy of snoring severity predicted with the provided information by bed partners. In fact， objective findings may affect the treatment planning of patients or have an importance for avoiding elective surgical interventions. In the present case， simultaneous decrease in EPSS， IDO， HRV and snoring scores displayed not only treatment efficiency of the MAD therapy for a moderate OSA patients， but also problem solving capacity of sleep apps on the existence of an objective method to score the snoring severity of subjects in home conditions. Thus，using a sleep app in the scoring of snoring severity may be an option for the home based sleep studies at the foreseeable future. However， some unknown titles should be made clear to take yet another turn， as previously stated by Stipping et al. Numerous brand of SP with different hardware and software have been presented in market up to now. Thus， structural properties of the Smartphone's can be quite varied from each other’s and their recording quality may be affected from these variations. In addition， some of them may record human snoring sounds more effectively than the others. However， there are not any comprehensive studies in the literature which responds to these queries， yet. Therefore， absence of data about the reliability and repeatability of sleep apps algorithms should be fulfilled.\n\n【22】Unfortunately， an in vivo study about the usage of sleep apps has not been published yet. Thus， impossibility of making a comparison is one of the most important limitations of the present case study. However， absence of any PSG data， which can be enabled the verification of obtained results， is the major limitation of the present case. Additionally， findings of this single case cannot be extended to all related population. Therefore， present findings need to be verified by further studies conducted with inclusion of more participants. Moreover， not only sufficiency of widely used SPs but also accuracy and repeatability of existing sleep apps should be evaluated with further studies. More preferably， standard PSG evaluations can be used to constitute a reference point to compare accuracy and repeatability of both SPs and sleep apps. Despite it is as yet too early to make a definite decision， using a sleep app in the scoring of snore sounds seems like a promising innovation for the future sleep studies to be executed in home conditions.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 10:39:37", "endTime": "2024/09/24 10:40:00", "cost": 23.72}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:36", "update_time": "2024-09-23 18:40:00", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 18:39:36"}

In the current study we analyzed the level of seminal zinc concentration in various group of infertile males and to link it with sperm concentrations， inactive， active and immotile fractions of seminal constraints， with an obiective to begin the role of zinc. The present five years descriptive study was conceded in the Public Health Laboratory， Department of Reproductive Health， National Institute of Health， and Islamabad， Pakistan from 2006 to2010. Outcomes of our study showed that semen zinc was several folds higher in polyzoospermic as compared to other group while lower in Azoo， oligo and oligoasthenozoospermia group. Concentrations of seminal zinc were 598.48±12.54±9.92±10.36±7.87 and762.06±8.99 in oligozoospermic， asthenozoospermic， azoospermic，teratozoospermic and proven father group respectively. The level of semen zinc varied and non-significantly (p>0.05) in proven father with polyzoospermic.

The level of semen zinc varied and non-significantly (p>0.05) in proven father with polyzoospermic.\n\n【14】Discussion\n\n【15】Zinc element is considerably influenced the sperm motility. Hardening of the outer dense fibers by development of Disulfide Bridge through epididymis sperm maturation appears to be an important physiologic phase for the generation of sperm motility particularly progressive motility .Male sterilityand sub sterility has been associated with zinc deficiency. Mc-Graw reported that sperm counts dropped from a mean of 283 million/ml to 45 million/ml with2 to 14 months in zinc limited diet in five middle aged men . Male infertility made by zinc limited diet is not yet fully understood because of complexity of its mechanism， however， zinc is believed to be involved in several assimilated processes linked with reproduction and has been stated seminal zinc concentration was lower in patients with idiopathic sub fertility than in normal control .\n\n【16】In another study， it has been observed that geometric means of the seminal plasma zinc concentration was found to be significantly lower (p<0.05) in the infertile group compared with those in the fertile group . In contrast， other authors had reported normal and even increased seminal plasma zinc levels in infertile males， but such studies are very low in magnitude. The probable explanation could be that zinc in semen is responsible for motility， therefore， it may not effect in both oligozoospermic and azoospermic groups. We also found decrease level of semen zinc in azoospermic， oligozoospermic， asthenozoospermic and oligozoospermic groups.\n\n【17】High zinc content had also been reported in seminal plasma and has been associated with a high degree of sperm cell motility ， it has also been reported that extra cellular zinc performances as an inhibitor of human sperm motility and acrosome reaction . In other study found that zinc content in seminal plasma was associated negatively with progressive sperm motility ， while in contrast to this study others reported no significant correlation of seminal plasma zinc with motility of sperms in oligozoospermic males . Whereas， we in our study found that seminal plasma zinc in those subjects having more than 50% of motility had significant increased concentration than those having decrease (<50%) of motility.\n\n【18】In the present study， we observed significant decrease in seminal plasma zinc level in asthenozoospermic group. These results are in consistent with earlier studies . Our results deferred from another study， who had reported normal and even increased seminal plasma zinc level in oligozoospermic and azoospermic males respectively.\n\n【19】Conclusion\n\n【20】We observed that decreased concentration of seminal plasma zinc do affect the sperm count and sperm motility. So it is important that carefully administration of zinc should be in those patients who have normal sperm motility but having low sperm count. In such cases seminal plasma zinclevel should be measured before treatment， since adequate seminal plasma content of zinc is required for normal sperm function.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 11:44:18", "endTime": "2024/09/24 11:44:42", "cost": 24.67}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:36", "update_time": "2024-09-23 19:44:42", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 19:44:17"}

The disease is divided into two groups： the inherited group and the acquired group. Acquired reactive perforating dermatoses (ARPC) is an uncommon skin disorder seen in patients with diabetesmellitus， chronic kidney disease， or both together. We present the clinicopathological features of ARPC in a patient with diabetic kidney disease and discuss the recent therapy.\n\n【2】Keywords： Reactive perforating collagenosis； Chronic kidney disease； Diabetes mellitus\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】The perforating dermatoses represent a group of skin disorders characterized by the perforation， or elimination， of dermal connective tissue through the epidermis. Although several classifications exist， there are four major primary perforating disorders grouped according to types of epidermal disruption， nature of eliminated material， and clinical features . There are two types of reactive Perforan Collagenosis (RPC)， Acquired RPC (ARPC) and Inherited RPC (IRPC). IRPC is more common in infants and children； while ARPC usually develops in adulthood in association with variety of systemic disorders， such as Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM)， Chronic Kidney Disease(CKD)， hypertension， even malignant neoplasms . Here， we reported a rare case of 57-year-old man who presented ARPC associated with three different systemic diseases including diabetes mellitus， chronic kidney disease and congestive heart failure.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 57-year-old male patient applied to emergency unit with shortness of breath， edema and generalized pruritus. He had a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus for 10 years， congestive heart failure and hypertension. His blood glucose was regulated with insulin at home. At the time of hospital admission her blood glucose was： 160 mg/dL， creatinine： 7.68 mg/dL， CRP： 73.69 mg/L， albumin： 2.84 mg/dL. His calcium and phosphorus results were detected 7.2 mg/dL and 6.6 mg/dL respectively. His ProBNP was>35000 pg/mL. The patient was admitted to nephrology clinic with pre-diagnoses of chronic kidney disease and diabetic nephropathy. The patient’s proteinuria was2.5 g/day and bilateral diabetic retinopathy was detected in fundus examination. The patient had multiple moderately itchy lesions for six years. Dermatologic examination showed disseminated red or brown umbilicated papules， plaques or nodules between 2 mm to 3 cm diameters on extremities and trunk. There were hemorrhagic and necrotic crusts or keratin plug on the centre of these lesions . A punch biopsy was performed by dermatologist from one of the lesions. Histopathologically； neutrophils， basophilic material consisting of keratin material and necrotic debris， and epidermal ulceration were seen. Masson trichromestaining showed transepidermal elimination of collagen fibers . Based on the clinical and histopathological findings， the patient was diagnosed with acquired reactive perforating collagenosis. Narrow-band ultraviolet B three times a week， oral anti-histamine and topical steroid were started as treatment for the patient.\n\n【7】Discussion\n\n【8】Acquired Perforating Dermatosis (APD) is an all-encompassing term that describes the various types of perforating diseases that arise in adults， often related to an underlying systemic disease， most commonly diabetes mellitus and chronic renal failure . APD encompasses acquired ReactiveePerforating Collagenosis (RPC)， Acquired Elastosis Perforans Serpiginosa (EPS)， acquired Perforating Folliculits (PF)， and classically described Kyrle disease， though among authors the classification is debated . Reactive perforating collagenosis was first described in 1967， though the prevalence and incidence of RPC are unknown， scattered cases have been reported .\n\n【9】Itching， which was also seen in our patient， was the most common symptom. The severity of pruritus was shown to be correlated with the severity of illness， response to therapy， and may be aggravated by coexisting secondary hyperparathyroidism .\n\n【10】Pathophysiology is still uncertain， but it is believed that chronic pruritus in predisposed patients may cause the rupture of collagen fibers with consequent elimination . Diabetic microangiopathy may contribute to collagen damage and to the microdeposition of substances that are not removed by dialysis， causing local inflammatory reactions .\n\n【11】Extremities were the most commonly involved site， followed by the back. The lesions were distributed mostly on trauma-prone areas， with some unusual sites like the scalp and the nape of the neck . As we saw in our patient， in many patients had evidence ofco-existing microvascular and macrovascular disease .\n\n【12】The therapy involves measures to reduce itchinglike antihistaminics， topical retinoids， glucocorticoids， and keratolytic agents. Systemic therapy includes retinoids， glucocorticoids， and phototherapy. Narrow-band ultraviolet B phototherapy is effective because of the frequent concomitant uremic pruritus .\n\n【13】Conclusion\n\n【14】Acquired perforating dermatoses should be considered when papules， plaques or nodules with necrotic crusts or keratin plug are found in patients with predisposing diseases like diabetes and kidney disease， or both together.

Diabetes mellitus plays a vital role in both severe COVID-19 and mucormycosis. Our aim is to review a literature to find out the patient's characteristics having mucormycosis and COVID-19with the source of electronic database of Google Scholar and PubMed for the search of review. We have analyzed the data and characteristics of post COVID patients with mucormycosis Overall， we have collected 288 cases from 50 articles and analyzed. We additionally reviewed why this mucormycosis maiorly affects India and mentioned what are all the causes that affect in post COVID patients. The post-COVID patients with uncontrolled diabetes must be altered and aware with disease mucormycosis.\n\n【2】Keywords： Diabetes mellitus； Mucormycosis； Post-COVID patients； Electronic database\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Mucormycosis is a rare type of fungal infection that occurs through exposure to fungi called mucormycetes.These groups of fungi are commonly occurring in the environment， particularly in all plant surfaces， soil， compost and animal dung. The infection caused by fungi belonging to the order Mucorales. Mucormycetes can enter the body through breathing， inhaling and exposed wounds in the skin. Fungi that most commonly cause mucormycosis are Rhizopus sp， Mucor sp， Rhizomucor sp， Syncephalastrum sp， Cunninghamella Bertholletia， Apophysomyces sp and Lichtheimia sp. There are five types of mucormycosis， such as rhinocerebral (sinus and brain) infection in the sinuses that can spread to the brain. This is most common in people with uncontrolled diabetes and in people who have had a kidney transplant， pulmonary (lung) infection is the most common type of mucormycosis in people with cancer and in people who have had an organ transplant or a stem cell transplant， gastrointestinal mucormycosis is more common among young children than adults， especially premature and low birth weight infants less than 1 month of age， who had antibiotics， surgery or medications that lower the body's ability to fight germs and sickness， cutaneous (skin) mucormycosis occurs after the fungi enter the body through a break in the skin (after surgery， a burn， or other type of skin trauma). This is the most common form of mucormycosis among people who do not have weakened immune systems and disseminated mucormycosis occurs when the infection spreads through the bloodstream to affect other part of the body. The infection most commonly affects the brain， but also can affect other organs such as the spleen， heart and skin. For mucormycosis， precautions are debatable with respect to their efficacy in preventing these infections. But the main goal is prevention， which will require ensuring a good immune system， especially in those who are post-COVID-19. However strict monitoring of diabetes and avoiding dead/decaying organic matter will helps .\n\n【5】The major risk factors for mucormycosis include uncontrolled diabetes mellitus in ketoacidosis， other forms of metabolic acidosis， treatment with corticosteroids， organ or bone marrow transplantation， neutropenia， trauma and burns， malignant hematologic disorders， and deferoxamine therapy in patients receiving hemodialysis . Higher rates of mucormycosis cases in India are due to a combination of COVID-19 and diabetes mellitus. For instance， more than 30million people in India have a diabetes diagnosis. While the country is still dealing with COVID-19pandemic， cases ofblack fungus or mucormycosis are on the rise in the country. Meanwhile， cases of white fungus and yellow fungus have also been reported from some parts of the country .\n\n【6】However steroids reduce inflammation in the lungs for COVID-19 and appear to help stop some of the damage that can happen when the body's immune system goes into overdrive to fight off coronavirus. But they also reduce immunity and push up blood sugar levels in both diabetics and non-diabetic COVID-19 patients. It's thought that this drop in immunity could be triggering these cases of mucormycosis. Unchecked level of blood sugar， abuse of steroids during COVID treatment is being considered as the reasons for this outbreak. Fighting the coronavirus can leave people's immune systems compromised or weakened， which means they may have a higher chance of developing mucormycosis .\n\n【7】Black fungus is Mucor fungus Occiirs， when the immunocompromised patient comes in contact with the Mucor fungus， which spreads to the eyes， nose，lungs and skull cavity. Though non-contiguous， it can be deadly if not treated on time. It mainly affects lungs， respiratory system and digestive tract. White fungus is Candida fungus which begins from the tongue or private parts， it makes the patchy tongue white， and then it spreads to other parts like the lungs， brain and food pipes. It also affects face， nose， and eye orbit and skull tissue. The yellow fungus starts internally， causes pus leakage and leads to slow healing of wounds. In severe cases， it could further lead to organ failure and serious necrosis . The primary reason that appears to be facilitating Mucorales spores to germinate in people with COVID-19 is an ideal environment oflow oxygen，high glucose， acidic medium， high iron levels and decreased phagocytic activity of white blood cells due to immunosuppression (SARS-CoV-2 mediated， steroid-mediated or background comorbidities) coupled with several other shared risk factors including prolonged hospitalization with or without mechanical ventilators. Globally，the prevalence of mucormycosis varied from 0.005 to 1.7 per million populations， while its prevalence is nearly 80 times higher (0.14 per1000) in India compared to other developing countries， in a recent estimate of year 2019 to 2020. In other words， India has highest cases of the mucormycosis in the world . These prompted us to conduct a systematic review of published case reports of mucormycosis in people with COVID-19， to know overall characteristics of patients with its outcome. We additionally reported why this cause largely in India.\n\n【8】Diabetes Mellitus Impact on Mucormycosis\n\n【9】The lethal combination of high COVID-19 caseload in a country with around 70 million diabetes patients in India and when as part of dealing with COVID-19 steroids are administered. India is already having second largest population with diabetes mellitus and was the diabetes capital of the world， until recently. The probable reasons include a delay in diagnosis and the high cost of managing mucormycosis. Importantly， diabetes mellitus has been the most common risk factor linked with mucormycosis in India， with an overall mortality of 46% . The reason we are seeing such large number of mucormycosis than in any other country is because of the high number of diabetic patients， that too with uncontrolled diabetes， record number of COVID cases， large doses of steroids being administered for too long bordering onto indiscriminate use of steroids. To cause infection， these fungal spores will typically enter the respiratory tract through inhalation； however，they can also enter host cells through the skin as a result of trauma or through accidental ingestion. As previously mentioned， patients with diabetes mellitus are at the highest risk of developing mucormycosis .\n\n【10】More specifically， the most frequent presentation of this fungal infection in patients with diabetes mellitus is rhino-orbital-cerebral mucormycosis. First and foremost， patients with diabetes mellitus often exhibit impaired innate and adaptive immunity， which increases their susceptibility to anytype ofinfection，particularly mucormycosis， as this infection is rarely seen in non-immunocompromised hosts. Upon exposure to Mucorales spores， a competent immune system will send macrophages to engulf spores and prevent their germination. Comparatively， diabetes mellitus patients often have altered phagocytic pathways， thus rendering macrophages unable to phagocytize these spores. As a result， the free spores swell and form buds throughout the blood vessels of the respiratory tract. Although polymorph nuclear cells are recruited to these areas， these cells often exhibit an impaired function in diabetes mellitus patients， which limits their ability to prevent the proliferation of Mucorales. As a result， the fungal spores are able to extensively invade tissues and large blood vessels. In addition to the altered immune system in diabetes mellitus patients that allows for the proliferation of Mucorales fungi， both the iron and pH levels of diabetes mellitus patients can also contribute to the development of mucormycosis. When the pH of human serum is reduced， which often occurs in ketoacidosis， mucorales can disrupt the iron-binding capacity of transferrin. This disrupted function in transferrin， therefore， allows for free iron to be released into the serum， which can be readily used by the Mucorales spore to thrive in these environments.\n\n【11】In addition， oxygen support for people with severe COVID-19can cause drying of the nasal cavity and further increase the risk of infection. The lack of immunity allows the fungus to spread， invade and destroy tissue. The recent pandemic of COVID-19 infection has led to a large number of people suffering severe illness， which has left them to have the following issues prolonged ICU stay， high blood sugars and prolonged oxygen use. Previously the patients were getting inflicted with these diseases. Amongst the diabetic patients， poorly controlled type II diabetes mellitus is the most common risk factor for mucormycosis， mainly from north to south India， with nearly half of them exhibiting ketoacidosis. It should be noted， however， that as confounding factors， renal failure and alcoholism related chronic liver disease have also been detected in patients along with diabetes in India. The probable reasons include a delay in diagnosis and the high cost of managing mucormycosis. Post coved patients with uncontrolled diabetes must be altered and aware with disease mucormycosis .\n\n【12】Methods\n\n【13】A systematic literature survey was conducted through electronic database of Google Scholar and PubMed until November 194，2021 using keyword COVID-19， and Mucormycosis， Zygomycosis， Mucorales， Mucor and Rhizopus.Details of all the cases that reported mucormycosis in people with COVID-19 so far were retrieved. Characteristics of each patient was collected on excel sheet and analyzed .\n\n【14】Results\n\n【15】Overall， we have collected 38 articles from the database of PubMed (30/50) and Google Scholar (20/50). A total of 288 cases of mucormycosis in people with confirmed COVID-19 were retrieved. Largely， 172 cases (59.72%) of mucormycosis in patients with COVID-19 were reported from India， followed by 52 cases (18.05%) from USA and 22 cases (7.63%) from Iran. Only 37 (12.84%) cases were reported from other parts of the world as shown in Table 1. Data from this study showed mucormycosis was predominantly seen in 209 male cases (72.56%)， and in female 79 cases (27.43%). Majority of the cases were recorder with diabetes mellitus and hypertension.\n\n【16】Table 1： Mucormycosis and COVID-19 cases reported in selected countries.\n\n| S.No  | Countries  | No. of Cases  | Percentage of cases (%)  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1  | India  | 172  | 59.72  |\n| 2  | USA  | 52  | 18.05  |\n| 3  | Iran  | 22  | 7.63  |\n| 4  | Egypt  | 16  | 5.55  |\n| 5  | Turkey  | 12  | 4.16  |\n| 6  | Europe  | 4  | 1.38  |\n|  | Spain  | 4  | 1.38  |\n| 8  | Pakistan  | 1  | 0.34  |\n\n【18】History of diabetes mellitus and intake of steroid for COVID-19 are the major reason for mucormycosis . Number of mortality was reported as 73 cases (25.34%) and case reports were shown in Table 2.\n\n【19】Discussion number of cases in India seems to be alarmingly high， with uncontrolled diabetes being the most important risk factor. The risk factors for mucormycosis differ significantly amongst the developed and developing countries. Nearly 60% of the mucormycosis cases reported from India are in patients with uncontrolled diabetes， with or without Ketoacidosis. The distribution of risk factors varies across geographical regions， as uncontrolled diabetes is the most common underlying disease found in India studies. Mortality associated with mucormycosis in India is considerably high due to delays in seeking medical attention and diagnosing the disease， and challenges in managing the advanced stage of infection. The diagnosis is thus often delayed， which result in poor outcomes despite the availability of better diagnostic and therapeutic tools. Multidisciplinary approach is essential for prompt diagnosis and management of mucormycosis. It is necessary to study the role of newer antifungal agents such in the treatment of mucormycosis.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 11:03:02", "endTime": "2024/09/24 11:03:13", "cost": 11.649}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:36", "update_time": "2024-09-23 19:03:11", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 19:02:59"}

Anamnestically， she reported 4 miscarriages， 2 stillbirths， and previous cholecystectomy for stones. The EnS had started at the age of 20 years. At 22 years of age， the patient had performed an Electroencephalogram (EEG) following a generalized tonic-clonic seizure， which showed the presence of modest irritative signs with diffuse projection prevailing over the anterior regions； marked tendency to drowsiness was also reported on that occasion. These EEG changes persisted for about 20 days and then disappeared in subsequent control tracings. At the time she was placed on antiepileptic treatment with Carbamazepine (CBZ) 200 mg 3 times/day，continued for 7 years. During drug treatment the EnS disappeared to reappear upon discontinuation of CBZ.\n\n【2】The patient then performed neurologic re-evaluation and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ofthe brain，both of which were negative. A subsequent video-EEG was normal except documenting an episode of enuresis upon reaching stage 1 of non-REM sleep and failure to reach the deeper stages of sleep. Epileptic genesis of the enuresis was therefore ruled out. Various antimuscarinics and Amitriptyline were prescribed sequentially， all ofwhich were ineffective on enuresis.\n\n【3】When the patient came to our observation， she reported stably using nighttime diapers. The4-day bladder diaries documented constant enuresis (350 cc to 550 cc by wipe weighing) and 4 to5 daytime voiding’s with average bladder capacity about 250 cc and average micturition urgency of grade 1.5 (range 0-2) according to the \"Patient’s Perception of Intensity of Urgency Scale\"(PPIUS)， which describes the degree of micturition urgency on a scale from 0 (no urgency) to 4 (urge urinary incontinence). Post-void residual was not detected. On urodynamic study， reduced cytometric maximal bladder capacity was detected， and the micturition phase occurred with detrusor contraction . Normality of anemia， plasma and urinary osmolarity excluded possible endocrine causes of enuresis such as diabetes insipidus or syndrome of inappropriate secretion of anti-diuretic hormone. Thus， a picture of overactive bladder  associated with sleep disturbance was diagnosed.\n\n【4】All proposed behavioral and pharmacological treatments (reduced evening water intake， desmopressin， night alarm， antimuscarinics such as oxybutynin and solifenacin， mirabegron) were ineffective even in combination. Therefore， the patient resumed low-dose CBZ intake (200 mg/day)， with significant reduction of enuresis episodes (1 wet night every 9-10)， with no changes in bladder diaries and in post-void residual. During treatment anemia， urinary osmolality and serum osmolality remained in the normal range. After 6 months， the patient preferred to discontinue therapy due to side effects such as sensory dulling and drowsiness.\n\n【5】Discussion\n\n【6】Primary nocturnal enuresis (EnP)， a common condition that affects 5% to 10% of children up to 7 years of age， appears to depend to varying degrees on 3 factors： bladder dysfunction， nocturnal polyuria， and failure to awaken to the sensation of bladder filling . In EnS， on the other hand， it is believed that the underlying causes of the disorder are predominantly overactive bladder-as reported by Madhu et al. in 201r analysis of 12，795 women undergoing comprehensive evaluation including urodynamic study  -or bladder dysfunction associated with sedative drugs use  or obesity . There is also believed to be a relationship between some types of focal epilepsy and enuresis 71.\n\n【7】Few studies in the literature， most of them quite dated and with unambiguous conclusions， have investigated the possible involvement of sleep disturbances among the pathogenetic mechanisms of EnP. Through polysomnographic recording of 25 enuretic subjects aged 7 to 17 years， Neveeus et al. showed that enuresis occurred predominantly during non-REM sleep ， a finding confirmed by other authors . In addition， a systematic review on the possible role of sleep and arousal activation mechanisms in the pathogenesis of enuresis found that enuretics have a higher arousal threshold with deeper sleep .\n\n【8】Al-Waili et al. evaluated the use of CBZ in EnP： In a randomized trial of 26 subjects， he found that CBZ 200 mg was significantly effective compared to placebo in the treatment of EnP (mean number of dry nights/months 18.8±8.8vs.3.9±5.2 with placebo). In2006， the same author observed in 8 patients that CBZ produced a marked reduction in daytime and nighttime diuresis and an average increase in 24-h urinary osmolality of 43% ， suggesting an antidiuretic effect of CBZ.\n\n【9】Another interesting finding regarding CBZ comes from a couple of case-reports in which its prolonged intake had caused chronic urine retention that resolved with discontinuation . These cases suggest that CBZ can facilitate urine storage in susceptible people through 2 different mechanisms： The anticholinergic effect with reduction of bladder contractility and the increase of bladder outlet resistance due to hypertone of the internal urethral sphincter.\n\n【10】In the case we described， an epileptic genesis of EnS was ruled out， whereas thanks to Polysomnography， an episode of enuresis was detected during phase 1 of non-REM sleep-that is， the transitional phase from wakefulness to the onset of falling asleep， during which all muscular activity is lost. Therefore， we believe that the causes of EnS in the present case are due to the concomitance of a sleep disorder， with defective awakening mechanisms to the micturition stimulus， and overactive bladder syndrome with good adaptation to bladder symptoms during the waking state. Given that only CBZ has been able to control enuresis， which was refractory to all the treatments included antimuscarinics licensed for overactive bladder， its action on bladder overactivity as well as modulating effect in the central nervous system are conceivable.\n\n【11】Conclusion\n\n【12】In EnS refractoryto conventional treatments， CBZ may be a viable therapeutic option probably mainly due to its anticholinergic effect on bladder contraction. However， CBZ is not tolerated by all subiects and its use necessitates careful clinical and biohumoral monitoring(CBZ blood dosage， natremia and liver function).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 10:28:51", "endTime": "2024/09/24 10:29:16", "cost": 25.231}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:36", "update_time": "2024-09-23 18:29:14", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 18:28:48"}

Careful and meticulous examination is crucial before embarking on any surgical interventions. Numerous differential diagnoses is possible for any neck mass and it differs between adult and pediatric patient. The final diagnosis will depend on the patient’s age， the location of the mass， the detail characteristic of the mass as well as the associated symptoms exhibited by the patients. We describe a case of suspicious of branchial cyst which turn out to be a recurrent thyroid tumor.\n\n【2】Keywords： Neck mass； Thyroid tumor； Branchial cyst\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Neck masses are frequently encountered by surgeons. They are subdivided into midline and lateral neck masses. Cystic neck lesion in adults has to be carefully evaluated to obtain accurate diagnosis and to offer the correct treatment. The commonest midline neck mass in adults is of thyroid gland origin. Thyroid masses are under the subdivision of lower midline neck masses. Examples of thyroid masses are solitary thyroid nodules， multinodular goitre and diffuse thyroid masses. Ultrasound is an excellent technique for imaging the thyroid gland. Solid and cystic lumps can be distinguished and nodules can be characterized with a high degree of accuracy .\n\n【5】Branchial Cyst (BC) is one of the commonest examples oflateral cystic neck lesion. It appears as a developmental failure of the branchial apparatus. They often manifest in young adults with an incidence peak in the third decade. Few theories have been suggested to explain the origin of BC， such as the inclusion theory and the branchial apparatus theory. Inclusion theory postulates that BC is epithelial inclusions within a lymph node. This theory is supported by the fact that most BC has lymphoid tissue in their wall. Branchial apparatus theory suggests that branchial cysts represent the remains of pharyngeal pouches or branchial cysts or both and that cysts should be present at birth with peak incidence at the second to third decades . BC mostly， about 60% located in the upper third of the neck at the anterior margin of the Sternocleidomastoid (SCM) muscle. It is usually persistent and 70% are clinically cystic. Ultrasonography is the modality of choice in cysts .\n\n【6】We would like to share our experience of managing a patient presented with left sided neck mass， clinically appeared as branchial cyst but further investigations and final histopathological result was ofthyroid nodular hyperplasia.\n\n【7】Case Presentation\n\n【8】A 33-year old， Malay lady with history thyroid surgery 20 years ago for multinodular goitre， presented to Otorhinolaryngology clinic in September 2017 with complaints of a left anterolateral neck swelling. The swelling is painless and gradually creasing in size for more than 14 years of duration. The patient was asymptomatic. She had no obstructive symptoms， voice changes， hypo or hyperthyroid symptoms or any constitutional symptoms.\n\n【9】Examination of neck revealed a huge left anterolateral cystic lesion， measuring about 15.0cm x 10.0 cm， extending superiorly to the lower border of the left mandible， inferiorly to just above the clavicle . Laterally， the mass extends up to the posterior border of the left sternocleidomastoid muscle and medially， it encroaching the midline. There was also surgical scar which most probably could be due to previous thyroidectomy scar. Nasal， ear， laryngeal， cranial nerves and other systemic examinations were unremarkable.\n\n【10】The patient was treated as having branchial cysts until the Fine Needle Aspiration and Cytology(FNAC) findings were reported as colloid nodule with cystic degeneration.Ultrasonography of neck interpreted that features are of multinodular goitre. Blood tests such as the thyroid function test and the serum calcium levels were within normal range. Patient was then planned for computer tomography in order to ascertain the origin of the mass and to rule out features of malignancy in view of it is long standing nature. The CT scan reported as the thyroid gland was grossly enlarged with multiple well defined cystic and solid lesions， predominantly cystic lesions. The largest lesion was in the left thyroid gland， measuring 9.1 cmx9.1 cm x8.8 cm without retrosternal extension. The lesion caused mass effect to the airway where it compressed and displaced the trachea postero-laterally， and the surrounding structures involving supraglottic， glottic and subglottic region， seen at the level of C2/C3 cervical body till T1/T2 level .\n\n【11】Subsequently， she underwent completion thyroidectomy in January 2018 which revealed a cystic mass overlying the carotid sheath . The mass was excised leaving the carotid sheath content intact . Her histopathological report was nodular hyperplasia of thyroid. Eight months postoperative，the patient is well with no complication and she was pleased with the surgery as her aesthetic has significantly improved.\n\n【12】Discussion\n\n【13】The aim of presenting this case is to show the diversity of the differential diagnosis of the neck mass in our patient. Initially with the location and examination of neck mass， a provisional diagnosis of branchial cyst was speculated but after further investigation like FNAC， ultrasonography and CT scan of the neck， the provisional diagnosis was directed towards multinodular goitre. The location of neck mass and imaging appearances gives surgeon the gross idea on the provisional and differential diagnosis. The initial examination of this patient which revealed a very cystic and fluctuant mass giving the impression it could be a branchial cyst. This were supported by its typical location at lateral neck region overlying the sternocleidomastoid， the patient's age as well as presence of extensive surgical scar which could be due to total thyroidectomy.\n\n【14】A differential diagnosis of midline neck masses are numerous and includes subcutaneous lesions (epidermoid cysts， dermoid cysts， teratoid cysts and lipoma)， thyroglossal ducts cysts， lymph nodes and thyroid masses. Differential diagnosis for lateral neck masses on the other hand， is divided into skin and subcutaneous lesions (epidermoid cysts， dermoid cysts， teratoid cysts and lipoma)， developmental masses (lymphangiomas and branchial cysts)， lymph nodes (infectious， inflammatory and neoplastic)， neurogenic tumors(neurofibromas and schwannomas)， vascular tumors (carotid body tumors) and salivary glands.\n\n【15】In view of wide differential diagnoses， meticulous examination and complete work up is necessary in managing any patients who presented with neck mass. This is crucial in order to come to a correct final diagnosis and proper treatment can be instituted. Sixty percent of BC is located in the upper third of the neck， anterior to the sternocleidomastoid muscle， but they may appear anywhere in neck or even in the parotid gland. Detection of a cystic mass in the lateral neck region should always raise a possibility of thyroid nodule. Seventy percent are cystic， although up to 30% may be solid. Regional lymph node metastasis from the Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC) of the upper aerodigestive tract might mimic BC in imaging if it undergoes cystic degeneration. Cystic degeneration in cervical metastasis from Waldeyer’s ring is estimated to be 33% to 62%.\n\n【16】Imaging commonly used for neck masses are Ultrasound (US)， Computer Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging(MRI). US is the initial method of imaging， as it is relatively cheap， well tolerated， absence of ionizing radiation and provides excellent resolution and contrast of the extra cranial head and neck . US is very useful in cases where Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology (FNAC) is needed and it displays the intracystic architecture and vascularity. In older patients with cystic lateral neck lesions， ultrasound with CT or MRI is the best investigation modality .\n\n【17】In BC， US display various echogenicities without intrinsic vascularity on color Doppler. The typical snowstorm' appearance is seen on pressing the transducer against the tissue. This is due to the movement of the cholesterol crystals . The role of US-guided FNAC is questionable when assessing cystic lesions because FNAC has a high false-negative rate (38% to 63%) . However， BC is differentiated from HNSCC metastasis by evaluating the cell ploidy using flow cytometry DNA analysis of the FNAC samples . The simple cyst depicts thin， smooth rim and mucoid content of low density in CT， whereas in MRI， uncomplicated BC has low T1-Weighted (T1W) and high T2W signal intensity. An infected cyst will possess thick， irregular， enhancing and maybe septated rim in CT. In MRI an infected cyst will show high signal intensity in both T1W and T2W images. Contrasted images will display an enhanced cystic wall.\n\n【18】The commonest midline neck lump in adult is of thyroid gland origin. Thyroid cysts commonly appear as a solitary thyroid nodule of variable size， are painless unless have a hemorrhagic component within. Thyroid cysts usually are fluctuant or tense and on the contrary， adenomas are usually solid. True epithelial thyroid cysts are rare. Cystic thyroid lesions are mostly due to haemorrhage or degeneration within a hyperplastic nodule (part of a multinodular goitre). Toxic and non-toxic multinodular goitres are painless too and have multiple nodules of variable size and shape. In cases of thyroid masses， ultrasound is an excellent choice ofimaging and they appear as well-defined，heterogeneous nodules with cystic component and internal septa. The comet tail sign is occasionally seen and it suggests the presence of colloid within . Multinodular thyroid is diagnosed when multiple cystic nodules are present. Ultrasound with fine-needle aspiration cytology is the first-line investigation in cases with solitary thyroid nodule. The presence of punctuate calcifications and chaotic intranodular vascularity on Doppler will raise suspicion of malignancy， hence ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration is advocated . CT scan is usually performed in thyroid mass to look for the retrosternal extension， to assess any compression on adjacent structures like the trachea and the major neck vessels (internal and external carotid artery and internal jugular vein) as well as suspicious features of malignancy such as presence of metastatic lymph nodes and area of central necrosis.\n\n【19】Conclusion\n\n【20】It is imperative to investigate for a correct diagnosis of any neck mass as the subsequent surgical plan will depends on the final pathology diagnosis. This will avoid unnecessary surgical morbidities and improve patient's post-operative outcomes.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 10:18:18", "endTime": "2024/09/24 10:18:42", "cost": 24.461}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:36", "update_time": "2024-09-23 18:18:43", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 18:18:18"}

A severe human herpesvirus-6 infection was detected after a CD45RA T cell-depleted fully matched unrelated donor HSCT for an adult patient with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia with t(9；22)(q34.1；q11.2). Despite combined treatment with ganciclovir and foscarnet， a rapid multi-organ failure set in and was fatal.\n\n【2】Keywords： Human herpesvirus-6； CD45 RA T-cell depletion； Matched unrelated donor； Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation； B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT) is a curative therapy in adult and pediatric patients with high-risk hematologic malignancies . However， despite a high percentage of graft success ， the development of Graft Versus Host Disease (GVHD)  and the appearance of serious infections secondary to delayed immune reconstitution continue to be the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in this type of therapeutic procedure .\n\n【5】The development of graft manipulation techniques， such as T-cell depletion， has significantly reduced the risk of acute and chronic GVHD in the absence of prophylactic post-transplant immunosuppression . However， they can cause graft failure and delayed immune reconstitution， favoring the appearance of potentially fatal opportunistic infections， especially fungal and viral infections .\n\n【6】Infection or reactivation by Human Herpesvirus-6 (HHV-6) following HSCT is increasingly observed， appearing in the first 2 to 4 weeks after HSCT . Systemic involvement can lead to complications such as exanthema， kidney and liver failure， encephalitis， graft failure or the development of GVHD . Although HHV-6 infection can be life-threatening， there is a lack of strategy in prophylaxis， early detection， and monitoring ofthe virus. Moreover， there is no established treatment for HHV-6 infection， although foscarnet or ganciclovir have been recommended for the treatment of encephalitis .\n\n【7】A case of acute HHV-6 infection following a fully matched unrelated donor myeloablative HSCT with a CD45RA T cell-depletion graft is presented. Despite close monitoring by PCR and early treatment with combined foscarnet and ganciclovir， a rapid and fatal evolution was observed.\n\n【8】Case Presentation\n\n【9】A 42-year-old Caucasian male with no relevant personal medical history was diagnosed with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia with t(9；22) (q34.1；q11.2) in June 2022. He received intensive induction chemotherapy with vincristine， daunorubicin， prednisone plus imatinib (600 mg daily) and standard intrathecal chemotherapy， achieving morphologic complete remission. Afterwards，consolidation chemotherapy was given according to the PET THH1EMA LAL Ph+ 2008 protocol for patients under 55 years ofage . Complete remission was maintained but minimal residual disease(0.04% BCR-ABL/ABL) was detected. Due to the high risk of disease progression an HSCT was indicated，andan unrelated searchinitiated，asthepatient did nothavean HLA matched family donor.\n\n【10】A fully matched unrelated donor peripheral blood HSCT conditioned with total body irradiation (12Gy) and cyclophosphamide (60 mg/Kg for two consecutive days) was performed. For GVHD prophylaxis， a CD34-positive selection followed by a CD45RA naive T cell-depletion was planned. Therefore， 8.71×10 CD34+ cells/kg were infused followed by an infusion of1×10 /kg CD45+ depleted CD3+cells. The total number of residual CD3+CD45RA+ cells infused was5.4 ×10/kg. The patient also received prophylactic antimicrobial treatment with rifaximin，trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole， acyclovir， letermovir， and fluconazole.\n\n【11】Early post-transplant complications were grade 4 mucositis requiring intravenous morphine and total parenteral nutrition and radiodermatitis on face， neck， armpits， and groin， successfully treated with topical silver sulfadiazine. On day +3 post-transplant neutropenic fever of unknown origin appeared and empirical progressive antibiotic treatment with meropenem was started. Fever without microbiological documentation persisted and amikacin， vancomycin and posaconazole were added to the empirical antibiotic treatment. On day +12 post-transplant， an erythematous， non-pruritic skin rash appeared on the arms， legs， and neckline. A skin biopsy was negative for GVHD， implant syndrome or infection. However， all the symptoms subsided with prednisone 1 mg/kg/bid. Granulocyte engraftment (>0.5×10/L， absolute neutrophil count) was achieved at day +11 and platelet engraftment (>20×10/L， without transfusions) by day +8. An early complete donor chimerism was observed on day +15.\n\n【12】On day +13 post-transplant a new onset of persistent fever was detected in parallel with elevated acute phase reactants and progressive cytopenia’s. Extensive and repeated blood， urine and fecal microbiological tests and imaging studies were performed but they were all negative ((bacterial and fungal cultures， multiviral PCR testing including HHV-6 and high-resolution turaco-abdominal scans). However， only three days later， a new PCR for HHV-6 was positive with 164，872 copies/mL. On day +19 post-transplant a bone marrow study detected hemophagocytosis and ruled out leukemic recurrence. Due to the concomitant presence of hypertriglyceridemia(1，241 mg/dl)， increased LDH (14，847IU/L)，elevated ferritin (356，000mg/dl)， thrombocytopenia (36×10/L) and monocytosis (11.3x10/L)， a diagnosis of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis secondary to acute infection by HHV-6 was made. Treatment with intravenous immunoglobulins (30 g/d， two days)， foscarnet (90 mg/Kg/bid， ganciclovir (5 mg/kg/d)， etoposide (100 mg) and anakinra (200 mg/day) was started. Dexamethasone was not included due to the viral infection. After administration ofetoposide， the patient developed an acute renal failure showing creatinine 4.5 mg/dl， hyperuricemia (12.7mg/dl)， hyperphosphatemia (7.3 mg/dl)， hyperkalemia (5.4 mmol/L) and hypocalcemia (5.7 mg/dl) and requiring rasburicase and intensive fluid therapy with electrolytes balance. Despite treatment， the HHV-6 infection reached 5，811，644 copies/ml and the patient worsened clinicaly and analytically， developing SIADH with hyponatremia(119 mmol/L)， Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC)(fibrinogen of 73 mg/dl) and a generalized hemorrhagic rash. Two days later， the HHV-6 levels subsided (1，858，396 copies/ml)， but the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit due to multi-organ failure (renal， hepatic， pulmonary， neurologic， DIC) and died on day +25 post-transplant with a concomitant septic shock from Enterococcus faecium.\n\n【13】Discussion\n\n【14】Transplant related mortality following allogeneic HSCT has been significantly reduced due to better donor selection and improvement in transplant techniques . To prevent the onset of GVHD and the need for long immunosuppressive treatments， new graft manipulation techniques， such as CD45RA or CD3aB/CD19 depletion of lymphocytes， have been developed . These techniques have successfully controlled GVHD， but they induce a delaved immune reconstitution that may increase life-threatening fungal or viral infections. Among these are HHV-6 infections， that can cause exanthema， kidney and liver failure， encephalitis， graft failure， or even the development of GVHD . Therefore， it is important to recognize the variety of initial clinical manifestations that HHV-6 infection may produce， including fever， cutaneous rash， or mild neurological signs and start a diagnostic procedure immediately. Our case illustrates a highly aggressive HHV-6 infection that progressed to multi-organ failure and death after a fully matched unrelated donor myeloablative HSCT whose graft was manipulated with a CD34-positive selection followed by a CD45RA naive T cell-depletion. This is consistent with a recently reported increased incidence of HHV-6 infections and the use of naive T cell-depleted grafts of haploidentical stem cell transplantation in pediatric patients， although， in contrast with our case， the clinical evolution of these patients was not fatal . Moreover， we describe an HHV-6infection in an adult patient and after a different type of transplant， a matched unrelated donor HSCT.\n\n【15】Although there are some preliminary initiatives with the infusion of NK cells immediately posttransplant as a prophylaxis of viral infection ， there is no generally accepted strategy in terms of detection， early monitoring， or prophylactic treatment for HHV-6 in patients undergoing allogeneic HSCT with or without manipulated grafts. However， pre-transplant and post-transplant serial PCR determinations could help to make an accurate diagnosis and， consequently， establish early treatment with ganciclovir or foscarnet. A previous negative HHV-6 PCR does not exclude the need for further PCR tests， especially when symptoms or signs consistent with HHV-6 reactivation appear. Due to the high number of viral copies detected and rapid clinical deterioration， ganciclovir and foscarnet were introduced simultaneously in this case. Despite an initial drop in viral copies， the patient developed a multi-organ failure and died of septic shock from Enterococcus faecium.\n\n【16】It is important to consider that HHV-6 can be integrated in germline， being these subjects strongly positive in PCR  and making diagnosis difficult. A previous negative HHV-6 PCR excluded this possibility in our patient. Another relevant aspect is the rarely described relationship between HHV-6 and the development of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis， mainly in pediatric patients. This HHV-6 related hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis may be a serious and potentially life-threatening complication .\n\n【17】This very severe case reflects that HHV-6 infection must be highly suspected not only in haploidentical HSCT but also in fully matched unrelated donor HSCT， especially when CD45RA T cell-depleted grafts are infused. The clinical evolution may be rapidly fatal even when combined treatment with ganciclovir and foscarnet is used. Therefore， it is important to make the diagnosis and start antiviral treatment as soon as possible， for which serial PCR determination is highly suggested whenever a clinical suspicion of HHV-6 infection appears.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 10:20:10", "endTime": "2024/09/24 10:22:16", "cost": 125.585}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:36", "update_time": "2024-09-23 18:22:15", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 18:20:09"}

We repot six cases of rhino-orbital mucormycosis in COVID-19 patients who presented to the medical emergency of our academic hospital in north India from May 17h through May 24h， 2021. All the patients in this series were COVID-19 positive with nasopharyngeal swab testing. Five out of six cases had severe COVID-19 pneumonia， for which they were receiving steroid treatment， interleukin-6 inhibitors or other immunomodulatory therapy not used in any patient. The typical predisposing comorbid illness was type-2 DM in all patients， with poor glycemic control indicated by high plasma glucose levels and elevated glycated hemoglobin. Further， diabetic ketoacidosis is seen in two patients at admission and diabetic ketosis in one patient.\n\n【1】The first symptoms of the rhino-orbital syndrome were unilateral facial pain or swelling， periorbital swelling， orbital pain， and blurred vision. Two patients had cerebral involvement at presentation. The interval between the onset of symptoms of COVID-19 and the first symptoms of rhino-orbital mucormycosis ranged from 1 to 14 days. Computed tomography of paranasal sinuses and orbit was obtained in four cases. Severe unilateral thickening of the sinonasal mucosa with or without underlying bone erosions had been the most consistent finding . The intraorbital disease was evident in three patients， two patients had bilateral sinus involvement， and intracerebral invasion was presentin two patients. For a prompt diagnosis， microscopic examination of the specimens (scrapings from the nasal cavity or destructive palatal lesion) using the potassium hydroxide-calcofluor white method was performed， which yielded aseptate broad-branched hypha suggestive of mucor in three patients， and in the rest three， remained inconclusive. All the patients treated with intravenous amphotericin， and one patient underwent surgical debridement. Hyperglycemia managed with insulin infusion to achieve a glycemic target of 140 mg/dL to 180mg/dL. Of the six patients， only two patients improved clinically and discharged successfully. Two patients died， and two left against medical advice.\n\n【2】Poorly controlled DM is a common and significant predisposing condition for both severe COVID-19 and mucormycosis . The increased reporting of COVID-19 associated mucormycosis cases from India compared to the rest of the world might reflect a higher prevalence ofDM in India . Moreover，unhygienic practices， including the frequency of changing or washing face masks coupled with a tropical environment with high humidity， might also be a contributing factor. Onlytwo out of six patients used to change or clean their masks daily according to the World Health Organization recommendation .\n\n【3】A potential diabetogenic effect of COVID-19 and the use ofsteroid or other immunosuppressive therapy for treatment exponentially increases the risk of invasive and relentlessly progressive fungal disease . In this case， series， the doses of steroids used were variable； i.e.， the usual recommended dose for COVID-19， higher than recommended， or lower than recommended . These findings support the previous observation that a short course of steroids may predispose to severe fungal infections .\n\n【4】COVID-19 per se postulated to be independently associated with the occurrence of Mucor infection because of direct epithelial cell damage， widespread micro-thrombosis with subsequent stagnantbloodsupply， dysregulated immune response，and lymphopenia . Lymphopenia (absolute lymphocyte counts<1000 per uL) noted in all patients， including five having a count<500 per uL. Elevated serum ferritin associated with the dysregulated inflammatory response in severe COVID-19 disrupts typical iron sequestration， supporting Mucor growth. Serum1ferritinWas available in five cases in our series. All had elevated levels， including a level>1000 ng/ml in four patients. Because the reported incidence of mucormycosis during the current wave is seemingly higher than previously observed， an increased association with the increased circulation of emerging new strains of COVID-19 might also remain possible.\n\n【5】The predisposition with uncontrolled diabetes and first symptoms of mucormycosis are similar to that occurs without COVID-19. Although based on this observational series involving six cases， it is not possible to determine the exact etiopathogenesis of COVID-19-associated mucormycosis， the potentially modifiable risk factors such as strict glycemic control in the diabetic population and improved preventive measures for secondary infection should be urgently addressed.

The patient applied due to palpitations， faintness， and chest pain. Rapid ventricular atrial fibrillation was detected in the ECG.\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Cold flu is one of the most common infections in the community. Symptomatic treatment for symptoms and signs such as rhinitis， postnasal discharge， sorethroat and headache seen in the course of the disease is arranged in the current treatment . Pseudoephedrine Hydrochloride (PEH) is a sympathomimetic agent that stimulates Alfa and Beta-2 adrenergic receptors commonly used in upper respiratory tract infections. Alfa adrenergic effect causes vascular smooth muscle constriction and consequently decreases mucosal edema and inflammation findings； bronchodilator effect by induction of beta 2 adrenergic receptors in bronchial smooth muscle . Due to its effects on the alpha adrenergic system of PEH， it is frequently used by physicians interested in the treatment of colds. In this case report， we aimed to draw attention to the serious cardiac side effects of PEH treatment.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】Apatient with known history ofHypertension (HT) and Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) without known cardiac arrhythmia history was taking the drug containing PEH 3 times a day for 2 days due to cold flu. The patient was referred to the emergency department due to palpitations， faintness，and chest pain. General condition was evaluated as good， anxious， conscious open， oriented， coopered. In vital signs； blood pressure： 170/110 mm Hg， pulse： 170/min. Rapid ventricular atrial fibrillation(velocity： 170-180/min) was detected in the ECG of the patient . The patient’s medical story and hospital records showed that he had never had atrial fibrillation， palpitations， or any arrhythmia. This was evaluated as atrial fibrillation provoked by a drug containing PEH. The patient was given a 25 mg diltiazem slowly and then isotonic sodium hydration was added. The patient whose symptoms were improved and the sinus rhythm were obtained at ECG， and blood tests did not reveal any significant pathology was discharged with the recommendation of cardiology outpatient clinic.\n\n【7】Discussion\n\n【8】Especially in spring and winter， many people use excessive or often over-the-top topical or systemic decongestants to get rid of allergic or infectious nasal congestion. Despite the symptomatic benefits of these drugs， it has been reported that it can cause serious adverse cardiac events in all users，especiallythose withknown cardiac diseases. Ithas been reported in hypertensive patients that it may cause decompensation in patients with heart failure， which may cause myocardial infarction in people with elevated blood pressure， some that trigger many arrhythmias， such as ventricular tachycardia， known coronary artery disease， or normal coronary artery anatomy . In addition， a manuscript published in 2009 reported a case of transient diffuse cardiac transmission due to PEH . There is also a case in which PEH triggers an epileptic event other than cardiac side effects . Apart from all these side effects， PEH， nausea， vomiting， diarrhea， abdominal pain， delirium， urinary retention， dermatitis， toxic epidermal necrolysis， acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis \n\n【9】Conclusion\n\n【10】Despite side effects， PEH-containing preparations can be prescribed very frequently by physicians interested in treating colds for symptomatic treatment. In fact， some patients can obtain these medicines without prescription. Especially in patients with diabetes mellitus， hypertension， hyperthyroidism， epilepsy， coronary artery disease and cardiac disease， PEH-containing medicines can have serious side effects. For this reason， doctors should consider these serious side effects when prescribing PEH-containing medicines.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 10:18:48", "endTime": "2024/09/24 10:19:03", "cost": 14.734}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:36", "update_time": "2024-09-23 18:19:01", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 18:18:46"}

HLH was first reported by the Scottish pediatricians James Farquhar and Albert Clarieaux in 1952， where two infants presented with cytopenia's， unremitting fever and hepatosplenomegaly. However， both infants died after few weeks of initial presentation. There was evidence of widespread infiltration of benign appearing histiocytes with hemophagocytosis in the lymphoreticular system on autopsy. They defined this syndrome as familial hemophagocytic reticulosis， which is currently known as HLH. The estimated incidence is approximately 1.2 cases per 1，000，000 individuals per year .\n\n【2】HLH is due to various pathophysiological pathways： 1) Hyperactivation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and macrophages；2) proliferation and infiltration of macrophages into various organs； and 3) elevated levels of various cytokines， resulting in progressive organ dysfunction .

Biochemical investigations revealed total bilirubin： 0.7 mg/dL (direct 0.2 mg/dL)， raised liver transaminases (3times the upper limit of normal)， reduced total protein levels (5.1 gm/dl) with albumin (2.2 gm/dl) and globulin (2.9gm/dl).\n\n【17】Coagulation profile depicted prolonged prothrombin time sec， control 12 sec， activated partial thromboplastin time (35 sec， control 26 sec)， INR 1.2 and high levels of D-dimer >5250 ng/ml.

Peripheral smear examined showed leucopenia and thrombocytopenia. Bone marrow aspirate smears were partly diluted with peripheral blood and showed no particle.\n\n【19】Bone marrow imprint showed particle with highly cellular trails. Erythroid series showed normoblastic reaction， myeloid showed normal maturation with increased eosinophilic precursors. Megakaryocytes were adequate. There was slight increase in number of mature plasma cells and histiocytes with some showing hemophagocytosis. No atypical cells/parasite or granuloma was identified on imprint smear .\n\n【20】Bone marrow core measuring 1.3 cm in length was examined by Hematoxylin and Eosin staining showed bony trabeculae enclosing marrow spaces with normally maturing myeloid series cells. Erythroid series showed predominantly normoblastic reaction with adequate number of megakaryocytes. A non-caseating epithelioid cell granuloma was seen， however no Langhans type giant cells seen . Furthermore， there was increased number of histiocytes with some showing evidence of hemophagocytosis. However， Ziehl Neelson staining for acid fast bacilli was negative. Thereafter， further investigations and workup for tuberculosis associated HLH was done.\n\n【21】Plasma fibrinogen was within normal levels (233 mg/dl) whereas lipid profile showed raised serum triglyceride levels (193 mg/dl). Hyponatremia and hyperkalemia were present along with raised urea and creatinine. Hyperferritinemia (>1800 ng/mL)， raised lactate dehydrogenase (920IU/L)and elevated ESR (50 mm in 1h) was also present. The Mantoux test was negative. However，real time PCR test with sputum sample was reported to be positive for tuberculosis.\n\n【22】Thus， as per HLH-2004 Protocol  and after correlating with clinical details， radiological and real time PCR positivity on sputum sample， diagnosis of tuberculosiIsSwith secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis was made.\n\n【23】The patient was managed with supportive measures. Later on， he was started on Anti-Tubercular Therapy (ATT) along with steroids. He was discharged in a stable condition but patient did not come for follow up.\n\n【24】Discussion\n\n【25】TB-HLHilsSatype of severe tuberculosis， diagnostically challenging for clinicians as its most common clinical presentation is Pyrexia of Unknown Origin (PUO). This condition was first reported in the 1980s but since last few years there are many cases reported in literature on TB-HLH.\n\n【26】Here， we report a rare case of TB associated HLH in an adult male diagnosed using PCR performed on sputum sample and bone marrow examination. The patient was successfully treated with ATT and corticosteroids. In this case， clinical suspicion of miliary TB was made with the help of history and physical examination. TB is widespread in Asian countries， including India， and is one of the important causes of but due to lack of precise diagnosis and non-specificity of clinical manifestations， early detection is quite difficult.\n\n【27】Mycobacterium TB is an obligate intracellular pathogen which exacerbate macrophage over activity as well as Thl cell mediated cytotoxicity thereby resulting in HLH. It is evidenced by increased serum levels of IFN-y，M CSF， and TNF-a in patients with tuberculosis. Therefore， high TNF-a and IFN-y results in hematopoiesis suppression along with apoptosis thus， resulting in cytopenia. Inhibition of lipoprotein lipase results in hypertriglyceridemia and macrophage over activity leading to excess release of ferritin (an acute phase reactant) in response to inflammatory cytokines； tissue infiltration causes organomegaly， and fever is secondary to release of cytokines like IL 1， IL 6 .\n\n【28】Literature shows that in patients diagnosed with TB complicated with HLH， there is 100% mortality if they did not receive ATT， whereas there is 40% to 60% reduction in mortality rate by combination of ATT and immunotherapy. Suppression of cytokine storm is of utmost importance in patients with HLH for long-term efficacy of ATT and needs to be done by induction of immunotherapy at an early stage of treatment. Thus， it was observed that patients who received immunotherapy alone also experienced significantly higher overall survival rates than patients who did not receive .\n\n【29】Highly elevated level of ferritin is an important prognostic marker and is strongly associated with HLH. Lin et al. concluded in a study that a rapid rate of fall in ferritin levels following therapy initiation was directly proportionate to overall survival and thereby associated with decreased mortality . However， Park et al. in their23 patients of secondary HLH found that the rate of decline in ferritin was not associated with survival whereas high fibrinogen at the time of diagnosis was significantly associated with decreased mortality. Similarly， Padhi et al. found that high serum ferritin (>1000 ng/mL) was an important indicator of disease severity and was associated with decreased survival， but the results were statistically insignificant on univariate analysis .\n\n【30】Inour case， patient wwaass clinically suspectedaass miliary tuberculosis， having fever with organomegaly. Evidence of cytopenia and hemophagocytosis on bone marrow examination led to suspicion of TB-HLH which was confirmed by further biochemical results including hyperferritinemia， hypertriglyceridemia and elevated liver enzymes.\n\n【31】In conclusion， this case illustrates early diagnostic challenges of both HLH and miliary tuberculosis. It provides the need for deep understanding of possible triggers of HLH， with more attention on TB-associated HLH since TB is most common infection in developing countries. In patients with tuberculosis who present with cytopenia(s)， coagulopathy， high triglyceride levels， HLH should be considered as a differential diagnosis. Till date literature highlights the fact that TB HLH have an unpredictable and/or poor outcome with or without ATT. Thus， early diagnosis and initiation of ATT， even in the presence of disseminated disease might alter the final outcome towards favorable in such cases.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [{"text": "a Figure 1： A： Leishman-stained bone marrow imprint showing cellular marrow with fat spaces and normal maturing myeloid series.

Microbiological and serological work up were negative for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)， hepatitis B and C viruses， dengue， malaria； and microbial cultures of blood， urine， sputum were sterile.\n\n【18】Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy were sent for evaluation of miliary tuberculosis. Peripheral smear examined showed leucopenia and thrombocytopenia. Bone marrow aspirate smears were partly diluted with peripheral blood and showed no particle.\n\n【19】Bone marrow imprint showed particle with highly cellular trails. Erythroid series showed normoblastic reaction， myeloid showed normal maturation with increased eosinophilic precursors. Megakaryocytes were adequate. There was slight increase in number of mature plasma cells and histiocytes with some showing hemophagocytosis. No atypical cells/parasite or granuloma was identified on imprint smear .\n\n【20】Bone marrow core measuring 1.3 cm in length was examined by Hematoxylin and Eosin staining showed bony trabeculae enclosing marrow spaces with normally maturing myeloid series cells. Erythroid series showed predominantly normoblastic reaction with adequate number of megakaryocytes. A non-caseating epithelioid cell granuloma was seen， however no Langhans type giant cells seen . Furthermore， there was increased number of histiocytes with some showing evidence of hemophagocytosis. However， Ziehl Neelson staining for acid fast bacilli was negative. Thereafter， further investigations and workup for tuberculosis associated HLH was done.\n\n【21】Plasma fibrinogen was within normal levels (233 mg/dl) whereas lipid profile showed raised serum triglyceride levels (193 mg/dl). Hyponatremia and hyperkalemia were present along with raised urea and creatinine. Hyperferritinemia (>1800 ng/mL)， raised lactate dehydrogenase (920IU/L)and elevated ESR (50 mm in 1h) was also present. The Mantoux test was negative. However，real time PCR test with sputum sample was reported to be positive for tuberculosis.\n\n【22】Thus， as per HLH-2004 Protocol  and after correlating with clinical details， radiological and real time PCR positivity on sputum sample， diagnosis of tuberculosiIsSwith secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis was made.\n\n【23】The patient was managed with supportive measures. Later on， he was started on Anti-Tubercular Therapy (ATT) along with steroids. He was discharged in a stable condition but patient did not come for follow up.\n\n【24】Discussion\n\n【25】TB-HLHilsSatype of severe tuberculosis， diagnostically challenging for clinicians as its most common clinical presentation is Pyrexia of Unknown Origin (PUO). This condition was first reported in the 1980s but since last few years there are many cases reported in literature on TB-HLH.\n\n【26】Here， we report a rare case of TB associated HLH in an adult male diagnosed using PCR performed on sputum sample and bone marrow examination. The patient was successfully treated with ATT and corticosteroids. In this case， clinical suspicion of miliary TB was made with the help of history and physical examination. TB is widespread in Asian countries， including India， and is one of the important causes of but due to lack of precise diagnosis and non-specificity of clinical manifestations， early detection is quite difficult.\n\n【27】Mycobacterium TB is an obligate intracellular pathogen which exacerbate macrophage over activity as well as Thl cell mediated cytotoxicity thereby resulting in HLH. It is evidenced by increased serum levels of IFN-y，M CSF， and TNF-a in patients with tuberculosis. Therefore， high TNF-a and IFN-y results in hematopoiesis suppression along with apoptosis thus， resulting in cytopenia. Inhibition of lipoprotein lipase results in hypertriglyceridemia and macrophage over activity leading to excess release of ferritin (an acute phase reactant) in response to inflammatory cytokines； tissue infiltration causes organomegaly， and fever is secondary to release of cytokines like IL 1， IL 6 .\n\n【28】Literature shows that in patients diagnosed with TB complicated with HLH， there is 100% mortality if they did not receive ATT， whereas there is 40% to 60% reduction in mortality rate by combination of ATT and immunotherapy. Suppression of cytokine storm is of utmost importance in patients with HLH for long-term efficacy of ATT and needs to be done by induction of immunotherapy at an early stage of treatment. Thus， it was observed that patients who received immunotherapy alone also experienced significantly higher overall survival rates than patients who did not receive .\n\n【29】Highly elevated level of ferritin is an important prognostic marker and is strongly associated with HLH. Lin et al. concluded in a study that a rapid rate of fall in ferritin levels following therapy initiation was directly proportionate to overall survival and thereby associated with decreased mortality . However， Park et al. in their23 patients of secondary HLH found that the rate of decline in ferritin was not associated with survival whereas high fibrinogen at the time of diagnosis was significantly associated with decreased mortality. Similarly， Padhi et al. found that high serum ferritin (>1000 ng/mL) was an important indicator of disease severity and was associated with decreased survival， but the results were statistically insignificant on univariate analysis .\n\n【30】Inour case， patient wwaass clinically suspectedaass miliary tuberculosis， having fever with organomegaly. Evidence of cytopenia and hemophagocytosis on bone marrow examination led to suspicion of TB-HLH which was confirmed by further biochemical results including hyperferritinemia， hypertriglyceridemia and elevated liver enzymes.\n\n【31】In conclusion， this case illustrates early diagnostic challenges of both HLH and miliary tuberculosis. It provides the need for deep understanding of possible triggers of HLH， with more attention on TB-associated HLH since TB is most common infection in developing countries. In patients with tuberculosis who present with cytopenia(s)， coagulopathy， high triglyceride levels， HLH should be considered as a differential diagnosis. Till date literature highlights the fact that TB HLH have an unpredictable and/or poor outcome with or without ATT. Thus， early diagnosis and initiation of ATT， even in the presence of disseminated disease might alter the final outcome towards favorable in such cases.", "index": 3596, "show": true, "start": 3596, "end": 3780, "province": ["文本干净度", "无关文本"], "isEdit": false, "comment": "8"}], "startTime": "2024/09/24 11:43:05", "endTime": "2024/09/24 11:43:40", "cost": 34.587}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:36", "update_time": "2024-09-23 19:43:40", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 19:43:05"}

Pseudoporphyria is a related blistering skin condition that shares clinical and histopathologic features of PCT but lacks the enzyme deficiency associated with bullous formation . Anticoagulants， mainly heparin， are known to cause various cutaneous eruptions such as skin necrosis， hematomas， and bullae . Cutaneous reactions secondary to the initiation of newer direct oral anticoagulants (e.g.，apixaban，rivaroxaban) have rarely been reported in the literature . This case report describes an 83-year-old female with stable PCT who presented with acute bullous eruption after recent hospitalization and treatment for extensive bilateral Deep Venous Thromboses (DVT) with apixaban.\n\n【2】Case Presentation\n\n【3】An 83-year-old female with a 10-year history of PCT， in addition to Crohn’s disease and hereditary hemochromatosis presented to her primary care physician with worsening eruption of bullae on her lower extremities. The patient had recently completed a 6-day hospital stay for extensive bilateral lower extremity DVTs and was started on a 7-day course of apixaban 10 mg oral BID. On day 4 of her hospital stay， she developed severallarge， painful， and edematous blisters with seeping serous fluid on her bilateral lower extremities.\n\n【4】A week and a half after hospital discharge， the patient presented to her primary care office in visible distress from her worsening and enlarging bullae， with the largest bulla measuring 10 cmx20 cm. The patient even developed a new serous-filled blister during the visit. Emergency medical services were called， and the patient was taken to a local hospital for better pain control. Further workup revealed full-thickness skin loss with loose skin involving the entire medial aspect of the right calf， a large eschar separating from the deep soft tissues with exposed muscle on the left calf， and additional large serous-filled blisters . The patient was transferred to a high-level burn center for intensive wound care management and surveillance.\n\n【5】During her hospital stay at the burn center， the patient underwent tangential excision and debridement of over 400 cm² of full-thickness lower extremity bullae on two separate occasions. Cultures sent from the wound fluid grew E faecalis， Citrobacter farmeri， and GPR's consistent with diphtheroids， for which the patient was placed on Zosyn. The pathology report of multiple incisional biopsy specimens revealed an entirely denuded epidermis with nonspecific dermal fibrosis and minimal dermal inflammation. Subcutaneous and deep vessel wall calcifications were noted with no evidence of vasculitis. PAS stain with diastase was noncontributory. Thehistopathologic features were compatible with but not specific for porphyria. Immunofluorescence was not performed due to patient preference but was recommended with a repeat biopsy if clinically indicated. The patient underwent two additional debridement procedures the following week with Kerecis fish-skin graft placement to the bilateral lower extremities. At the time of discharge， the patient's Kerecis grafts were dressed in Adaptic dressing and Aquaphor while her skin tears were dressed in Xeroform and Bacitracin. Three weeks post-op，patient had no complications and wounds were slowly healing with Kerecis grafts .\n\n【6】Discussion\n\n【7】Porphyria cutanea tarda is a photodermatosis characterized by fragile， hemorrhagic bullae and erosions with associated milia， hyperpigmentation， and hypertrichosis . PCT typically develops in the 5th or 64h decade of life and risk factors include alcohol use， estrogen use， viral infections， smoking， and iron overload1. Treatment options include frequent therapeutic phlebotomies or low-dose oral hydroxychloroquine .\n\n【8】This study reports a rare case ofpainfulbullae and eschar formation in a patient with a history of well-controlled PCT， Crohn's disease， hereditary hemochromatosis， and recent anticoagulant initiation. Due to the unusual nature of this patient's presentation along with a complex medical history， the etiology behind this eruption was not entirely understood. The differential for this patient included a PCT eruption， bullous hemorrhagic dermatosis， cutaneous Crohn's disease manifestation， autoimmune bullous skin disease， and other subepidermal bullous diseases (e.g.， epidermolysis bullosa acquisita， bullous pemphigoid) .\n\n【9】We hypothesize that the combination of our patient’s lower extremity edema secondary to bilateral DVTs， predisposition to subepidermal bullous formation due to PCT， and initiation of apixaban for DVT treatment contributed to her painful bullous eruption. Thehistopathologic features ofuniformly absent epidermis， nonspecific dermal fibrosis， and minimal dermal inflammation all support the diagnosis of an atypical PCT eruption with the recent initiation of apixaban as a potential trigger. A more extensive dermatologic investigation in the outpatient setting， including a repeat biopsy with immunofluorescence， is necessary to elucidate if one of our patient’s other comorbid conditions contributed to her reaction.

The clinical issues are sensitivity (particularly to cold)， rapid wear and poor aesthetics， all of which can vary depending on the type of AI. Other anomalies with AI include disturbances in eruption， anterior open bite， pulpal calcifications，pathological root or crown resorption and taurodontism，all of which can present in the pediatric patient. This case report describes the preventive strategy of a case with amelogenesis imperfecta in a young patient who has 4-year-old with 18 months follow-up.\n\n【2】Keywords： Amelogenesis imperfecta； Preventive strategy； Primary teeth\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Amelogenesis imperfecta has been defined as a complex group of hereditary enamel defects not associated with evidence of systemic disease. It can affect all or some teeth in deciduous and/or permanent dentition. The prevalence of AI varies according to different studies ranging from1/700 to 1/14.000 . These differences are mainly due to diagnostic or demographic criteria or to mutant genes in the studied population. Different classifications of AI have been reported in literature， usually related to phenotype characteristics (clinical and radiological appearance) or to the description of the mode of inheritance of the disease (autosomal dominant/recessive). Clinically four types of AI have been recognized according to enamel types： Type 1 (hypoplastic with a deficiency in the quantity of enamel)； Type 2 (hypomaturation， with an opaque and chalky enamel)， Type 3 (hypocalcified， characterized by a normal amount of poorly mineralized enamel) and Type 4 (hypoplastic-hypomaturation enamel associated with taurodontism). In some classifications， the type 4 is also related to other dental anomalies such as multiple impacted teeth and congenital missing teeth . The Problems associated with amelogenesis imperfecta include an increased incidence of plaque deposits and consequent gingivitis， dental hypersensitivity， loss of vertical dimension due to a rapid wear of the dentition，poor esthetic appearance and the potential need for lifelong， extensive restorative care. These in addition， psychological problems need to be considered， mainly related to the difficulties that these patients report in their social interaction due to the unesthetic appearance of their smile. The chalenges faced in managing a young patient with Amelogenesis Imperfecta (AI) are numerous and prevention is the most important tool in any clinician'sarmamentarium . It is particularly important when teeth are known to be vulnerable. This report describes the preventive strategy of a case with hypoplastic amelogenesis imperfecta in a young patient who has 4 years old， with 18 moths of follow-up.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 4-vear-old female patientpresented at to the Department of Pediatric Dentistryand Prevention of Rabat University. She was referred with an unsightly appearance affecting all the primary teeth and dental sensitivity . The family history was negative for the disease. Past medical history was reviewed and there was no remarkable report. The initial clinical examination did not reveal any extra-oral pathology signs. Dental examination revealed poor esthetics due to a yellowish aspect of all maxillary and mandibular primary teeth with no dental caries. Radiographic examination showed generalized loss of enamel with high pulp horns and no periodontal defects were present. The occlusal function showed several characteristics typical of a first dental class. On evaluation of the vertical dimension of occlusion using phonetics， interocclusal measurements and facial appearance as guides， it was determined that the vertical dimension of occlusion was maintained. After doing a professional Tooth brushing with fluoride toothpaste， dental discoloration still existed in all maxillary and mandibular primary teeth. Based on the clinical and radiographic findings， easily chipping， with loss of dental structure. a diagnosis of hypoplastic amelogenesis imperfecta was made. After explaining to the patient and her mother this enamel defects， we opted for a preventive strategy to reduce sensitivity， to protect dental structure， to prevent caries， occlusal disorder and periodontal disease. The first aim of our preventive strategy was to confirm diagnosis of this enamel defects. After accomplishing a professional Tooth brushing with fluoride toothpaste to avoid the confusion with an extrinsic-tint， we studied clinical and radiographic signs and we concluded a diagnosis of hypoplastic amelogenesis imperfecta. In order to reduce dental sensitivity， to prevent caries and periodontal disease and to protect dental structure， we used topical fluoride in the form of a varnish to foster the protection of the smooth surfaces of primary teeth and the remineralization of the first carious lesions. It was applied twice every month during our preventive strategy. The enamel alterations， which are characteristic of the disease and observed at maxillary and mandibular anterior teeth  were protected using a direct composite resin. The main goals of this stage were represented by the need to protect the occlusal dental surfaces from the abrasion and provide a satisfactory esthetic result. Dental abrasions particularly in posterior teeth， when if not protected may determine the loss of the vertical dimension as well as a diffuse and marked dentinal hypersensitivity. To prevent the occlusal disorder， we used Performed Metal Crowns (PMCs) restorations on the occlusal surfaces of maxillary and mandibular primary molars. After assessing the tooth shape， contact points/areas and the occlusion， orthodontic separators were used to create space for fitting a performed metal crown at the mesial and distal contacts. The patient was seen 3 days later for removal of the separator and the inter-proximal area of the gingiva was inspected. Different sizes of crowns was selected until we find one which covers all the cusps with no tooth preparation and approached the contact points with a slight feeling of “spring back\". Then， we loaded the crown generously with a glass ionomer luting cement from the base upwards， fitting the crown and we did a first stage seating. After wiping the excess cement away， we checked fit and we did second stage seating. Then we removed excess cement， flossed between the contacts and checked occlusion and discharge. Anecdotally，preformed metal crown placed high in occlusion do not cause problems for children and avoidance of interferences of >1.5 mm are recommended. It has been suggested that interferences <1 mm are well tolerated with dento-alveolar compensation occurring within a few weeks . In summary， young children appear to have an adaptable masticatory system in which changes occur quickly. After finishing and polishing， the crowns restorations were checked radiographically. At last， in order to maintain all results and a high oral health status， the patient was instructed to use Tooth brushing with fluoride toothpaste three times a day (250 to 550 ppmF) and we used topical fluoride in the form of a varnish (10%) twice yearly during our post-preventive strategy ， and the mother was informed about the importance of maintaining meticulous oral hygiene and regularly returning for clinical and radiograph monitoring. The patient was seen every 3 months and she was asymptomatic. After 18 months， clinical and radiographic signs were still stable with a good aesthetics and periodontal health.\n\n【7】Discussion\n\n【8】The term Amelogenesis Imperfecta (AI) refers to a heterogeneous group of genetic disorders characterized by defects in enamel formation of the teeth in the absence of any generalized or systemic diseases. It can affect all or some teeth in deciduous and/or permanent dentition.Recent studies have identified five genes as beingresponsible for AI by mutation or altered expression： AMEL (amelogenin)， ENAM (enamelin)， MMP20 (matrix metalloproteinase-20)， KLK4(Kallikrein-4)， and FAM83H4 . A diagnosis of amelogenesis imperfecta can present challenges for patient and clinician alike. This can be further complicated in a child due to cooperation and the ever-changing dentition. As with all children， initial experience of the dental profession plays a part in their cooperation for the future. Children with AI often require extensive dental treatment throughout their lives， therefore it is essential to ensure the initial experiences are positive . However， this can be hard to achieve when a child may be experiencing sensitivity when brushing their teeth and eating/drinking cold things. Seeing a child as early as possible will enable the clinician to build up a rapport with the child and parents/carers.\n\n【9】In our case， the patient was diagnosed with hhypoplastic amelogenesis imperfecta and an early preventive strategy was realized to reduce sensitivity， to protect dental structure， to prevent caries， occlusal disorder and periodontal disease. Prevention is the most important tool in any clinician's armamentarium. It is particularly important when teeth are known to be vulnerable， as is the case in AI. Oral hygiene can be particularly difficult for this group of patients due to sensitivity when brushing. Advising the use of warm water for tooth brushing will go some way to relieving symptoms when rinsing. Regularuse offluoride mouthwashes can also helpto reduce sensitivity and prevent caries in children old enough to be trusted not to swallow it. However， the discomfort associated with brushing cannot always be overcome and cases where there are significant plaque and calculus deposits are not unusual. In addition， psychological outcomes need to be considered， mainly related to the difficulties that these patients report in their social interaction due to the unesthetic appearance of their smile.\n\n【10】Clinical management may vary according to the type and severity of the disease， the age of the patients， as well as their socioeconomic status. For these reasons， a wide range of possible and different treatments for teeth restoration of patients affected by AI has been reported in literature. With regard to the possible treatments related to the clinical case here reported， the therapies vary from a conservative to a prosthetic approach . In particular， the conservative treatment of the affected teeth may be used during childhood， as transitional treatment， but cannot be used for a longer period because it does not satisfy esthetic needs and it would not prevent the abrasion of posterior occlusal surfaces over time with consequent loss of the vertical dimension. The preventive strategy described in the present case report is reasonably simple. In the anterior teeth， direct composites have the advantage that they can be started as soon as there is sufficient tooth erupted and added to as further eruption occurs. However，the child and parent should be warned that with continuing eruption and gingival maturation， the margins of any restoration will become visible and additional treatment will be required， at intervals， to maintain good aesthetics . In the posterior regions， Preformed Metal Crowns (PMCs) restorations were placed on the occlusal surfaces of primary molars. Orthodontic separators between molars will assist placement of crowns . No tooth preparation is required to undertake this treatment， assuming the dentition is caries free. In an anxious or young child compromise may be necessary， in which case； second deciduous molars are considered to be higher priority to maintain the occlusion and placing aesthetic veneers on anterior teeth may be used as acclimatization and help to motivate the child and family . However， there is always a risk that the child may not return as their primary complaint may be addressing the aesthetics.\n\n【11】As with all dental procedure， following-up is of critical importance. The patient should be seen at 3， 6 and 12 months and yearly at mixed and permanent dentition. Esthetics and periodontal status should be confirmed both clinically and radiographically at these control visits. In this case after 18 months， clinical and X-ray examinations showed satisfactory esthetic and functional outcomes and a good state of periodontal health .\n\n【12】Conclusion\n\n【13】Developmental disturbances such as amelogenesis imperfecta not only impair the function and aesthetics but also have a profound psychological effect on the patient’s self-esteem and confidence especially in childhood. An early preventive strategy is essential to reduce sensitivity， to protect dental structure， to prevent caries， occlusal disorder and periodontal disease.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 11:35:54", "endTime": "2024/09/24 11:36:54", "cost": 59.526}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:36", "update_time": "2024-09-23 19:36:53", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 19:35:54"}

More benign cases of CRS can present in the adulthood with minor abnormalities， such as chronic constipation and congenital anal stenosis . Incidence of CRS varies between 1：20 000 and 1：100 000 . Both sexes are equally affected . First description of the syndrome was given by Duhamel in to 1961 . More than half a century later both CRS remains incompletely understood clinical entity.\n\n【7】Case Presentation\n\n【8】Here we present the case of CRS which could be additional contribution in deepening our understanding of this serious set of anomalies. To the best of our knowledge this is the first case of CRS which developed after IVF.\n\n【9】Female patient age 40， who has previously undergone uterine septum resection， was treated for secondary infertility. She suffered from hyperthyroidism and was taking Propylthiouracil (PTU). According to family history there were no previous fetal malformations. Infertility was treated with in vitro Fertilization (IVF) and Embryonic Transfer (ET) into our patient's uterus. At 134h week of pregnancy， cell free DNA test was performed in order to clarify nuchal translucency measurement of 2.9 mm which was detected. The test result was completely normal. At 18h week of pregnancy sonographic examination revealed multiple fetal anomalies affecting mainly caudal body part. Decrease in fetal movement was detected， with preserved upper extremity movements. Continuity of vertebral bodies was interrupted at lower thoracic/upper lumbar level. Lumbar vertebrae were dysplastic and sacral vertebrae were not observed. There was clear asymmetry of pelvic bones. Lower extremities were immobile and close to Buddha or frog position. Clubfoot was present bilaterally. Intestines were hyperechogenic and imperforate anus was suspected. Single Umbilical Artery (SUA) was detected. Head circumference was normal and no ventriculomegaly was observed. Normal， four-chambered heart was observed. Diaphragm and stomach were normally positioned. Kidneys and filled urinary bladder were visualized.\n\n【10】Altogether theseanomalies were consistent with caudalregression syndrome. Finally， parents chose to terminate the pregnancy at 18h week\n\n【11】Discussion/Conclusion\n\n【12】Number of authors have reported cases of CRS without any remarkable family history or parental consanguinity . Only maternal diabetes has been proposed as risk factor . Some of the well-known consequences of the Assisted Reproductive Technology(ART) are multiple gestations， preterm labor，lower birth weight and chromosomal anomalies. However， it is still debatable if ART causes higher incidence of structural congenital anomalies when compared to general population . Our finding could point into direction of potential relationship between IVF and congenital anomalies.\n\n【13】Two main theories regarding pathogenesis have been developed一vascular steal theory  and caudal mesoderm dysfunction. Kozlowski et al. assume possibility CRS could be part of general bone dysplasia . It remains debatable if sirenomelia and caudal dysgenesis have two different pathogenic pathways or do they represent different stages of the same disorder. Additional theory suggesting malfunctioning of notochord inductive pathways has been proposed . Moreover， case of Junctional Neural Tube Defect(JNTD) has been described in which patient presented with stigmata closely related to those seen in CRS， such as sacral agenesis，hypertonic anal sphincter， bilateral clubfeet， urinary incontinence and atrophy of lower extremities muscles. Consequently，authors suggested impaired secondary neurulation， which is proposed basis for JNTD， could be pathogenic origin of the caudal regression syndrome . We believe that further research of secondary neurulation defects could shed new light on pathogenesis of CRS.\n\n【14】Furthermore， Retinoic Acid (RA) signaling appears to play significant role in the CRS pathogenesis. Retinoic acid， vitamin A derivative， is a signaling molecule that regulates gene transcription， cell cycle and proliferation， differentiation and organogenesis through the interaction with the nuclear receptors， Retinoic Acid Receptor (RAR) and Retinoid X Receptor (RAX) in autocrine， cell autonomous manner and also in non-cell autonomous， paracrine manner by diffusing across cell membranes establishing retinoic acid gradients within and across tissues . In placental species， lipophilic RA is manufactured from maternal diet-derived retinol (vitamin A) during embryogenesis. After entering the cell， retinol is reversibly oxidized to retinal by alcohol dehydrogenase and Retinol Dehydrogenase(RDH)， particularly RDH10. Retinal is then irreversibly converted to RA， particularly all-trans Retinoic Acid (atRA)， which is catalyzed by Retinaldehyde Dehydrogenase (RALDH) enzymes， especially RALDH2 . It has a great impact on both axis formation (anterior and caudal truncations) and neural differentiation. Under normal conditions of embryonic development， embryo is protected against fluctuations of maternal dietary RA concentration. This highlights the importance of CYP26 genes， which when mutated aren't able to degrade dietary RA and as a result abnormal phenotype occurs. Null mutations for CYP26a1 in mouse resulted in missing posterior vertebrae (lumbar， sacral and caudal)， thoracic vertebrae were often deformed， 20% of embryos expressed sirenomelia due to hindlimb fusion， while some exhibited malpositioning of hindlimbs .PTU， as a known hepatotoxic drug， could also interfere with ability of CYP enzymes in the liver to degrade RA and hence expose fetus to higher levels of maternal RA\n\n【15】As far as we know this is the first case of CRS associated with maternal hyperthyroidism and PTU therapy. Question remains whether hyperthyroidism， PTU therapyor iatrogenic hypothyroidism could exert teratogenic effect and lead to CRS development. PTU was shown  to decrease RAR and RXR levels in the mice. If the same mechanism is applicable to humans， then it can be assumed that higher concentrations of unbound retinoic acid in the mother's serum could cross the placenta and cause teratogenic effects in the embryo/fetus.\n\n【16】So far， no serum marker for CRS has been proven as useful， unless it is complicated with open Neural Tube Defect (NTD) in which case higher AFP serum levels can be measured . Ultrasound is a mainstay of antenatal diagnosis. Alongside ultrasound， MRI has proven useful in diagnosing CRS . In the case of CRS associated with NTD， which was described previously ， it is of uttermost importance to diagnose the condition as early as possible. In utero myelomeningocele surgery before 26 week of pregnancy was shown to result in better neurologic outcome when compared to standard postnatal procedure . Same could be true for myelomeningocele associated with CRS. Sonographic evidence of hydrocephalus or specific sonographic signs such as “lemon sign\" and “banana sign”suggest NTD or Chiari malformation is present . CRS without NTD does not usually involve hydrocephalus as was shown in our case Associations of CRS with different kinds of anomalies has been described， such as annular pancreas ， diastematomyelia ， cleft lip  and extrahepatic biliary atresia . It remains to be elucidated if there is pathogenic common ground for all of these malformations. Hence， we propose every patient diagnosed with CRS should be carefully evaluated in order to define full extent of malformation.\n\n【17】It seems likely that still unknown noxious factor affects caudal region of embryo/fetus. Namely， from our case report and all other cases described so far it is evident that tissues from all three germinative layers are affected. Our case adds additional evidence that hypoperfusion theory could be true as fetus was shown to have SUA. Findings in our case disprove previously proposed thesis according to which SUA is abnormality commonly associated with sirenomelia instead of CRS .\n\n【18】Nomenclature in the literature regarding CRS is confusing. Different authors describe syndrome using different names. Some authors discard name “caudal regression syndrome\"， as they do not believe something that has normally developed regresses but development itself is dysfunctional. Terms “sacrococcygeal agenesis”and“sacral agenesis” have also emerged as possible for naming the syndrome . Clear sonographic parameters for diagnosis of CRS would definitely clarify situation. Four-type classification of CRS which correlates with prognosis has been suggested .", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 10:45:23", "endTime": "2024/09/24 10:46:13", "cost": 49.487}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:36", "update_time": "2024-09-23 18:46:11", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 18:45:21"}

Even with immediate supportive care， the sequela can be devastating，especially in those presenting late， accompanied with ingestion of large amounts. A high index of suspicion is needed in cases where patients present late with abdominal signs of guarding and rigidity. We report a rare occurrence of extensive necrosis of the stomach till jejunum in corrosive ingestion.\n\n【2】Case Presentation\n\n【3】A 30-year-old woman presented to the emergency department of All India Institute of Medical Sciences approximately six hours after accidental ingestion oftoilet cleaner. She had no past medical history of suicidal attempts， anxiety， or depression.\n\n【4】On initial examination， her lips and oral cavity had corrosive marks. She complained of burning sensation in her throat， chest， and abdomen. She gradually developed hoarseness of voice over the next 4 h. She also had gradually worsening shortness of breath with stridor. She was tachycardic， tachypneic but normotensive. She had diffuse tenderness over her abdomen with localized guarding in the epigastric region.\n\n【5】Esophagogastroduodenoscopy performed within 12 h of the initial presentation showed diffuse mucosal edema of esophagus， slough with necrosis. Stomach was necrotic with patchy ulceration. Corrosive injury-esophageal Zarger 3b， Stomach Zarger 3a . CECT abdomen with intravenous contrast was done to delineate the extent of injury， which showed loss of uptake in the stomach， D1， D2， D3 with some patchy non-uptake in the proximal jejunum .\n\n【6】Based on the endoscopic and imaging findings， an emergency laparotomy was planned.\n\n【7】Total gastrectomy with pancreaticoduodenectomy Was done. Pancreatic duct could not be visualized hence dunkin procedure was done and reinforced with fibrin glue. Left extended hepaticojejunostomy for biliary drainage was done . Witzel feeding jejunostomy was done 30cm distal to jejunojejunostomy. Left cervical end esophagostomy was done. Esophagectomy was not done as the patient was not hemodynamically stable.\n\n【8】Postoperatively， she was in ICU care for 4 days. She was extubated on Postoperative Day (POD) 4 and was shifted to the surgical ward. She had a prolonged postoperative course. She had high drain output with drain amylase measuring more than 3 times the serum amylase. She developed burst abdomen on POD10 with dislodgment of Feeding Jejunostomy tube (FJ). Intraoperatively， FJ tube was found to be lying freely in the abdomen， leak was noted from the pancreaticojejunostomy site， anastomosis was reinforced with vicryl and fibrin glue. Witzel feeding jejunostomy was redone. Following re-exploration， she developed high output uncontrolled biliary fistula from subhepatic drain and midline wound. She was tested COVID positive on POD32 and was shifted to a designated COVID centre. She later developed grade B post-pancreatic hemorrhage. She received multiple blood transfusions. CT angiography however could not localize the bleed site. Her general condition deteriorated and died in COVID centre due to acute respiratory distress syndrome.\n\n【9】Discussion\n\n【10】The COVID pandemic has resulted in an increasing incidence of suicides world over， owing to the fear of infection， isolation， unemployment， financial crisis， stress， and mass panic . One such incident is the case of a young female who presented with a large amount of ingestion of a caustic substance at her residence. Hemodynamic stabilization and securing the airway are crucial in the initial hours of corrosive injury to prevent early deaths. Early endoscopic assessment and liberal use of CT scans in cases of discordant findings on endoscopy will help in detecting the extent of the injury and plan further management accordingly. In cases of extensive caustic injuries， large duodenal perforations， traumatic injuries to the pancreas and duodenum， it is imperative to perform a pancreaticoduodenectomy although carries a high rate of morbidity (80%) and mortality (40%) . The rate of complications is also high owing to hemodynamic instability， extensive injuries，and unanticipated difficulties at the time of surgery. All injured organs should be identified and resected during the first operation . The reoperation rate in these patients is high one reason being delayed extension of caustic necrosis to other intra abdominal organs ， which could have led to the dislodgement of feeding jejunostomy in this case. The other reasons for reoperations are intra abdominal collections due to anastomotic leaks， pancreatic and biliary fistulas， erosion of other intra abdominal organs， and hemorrhage. Although pancreaticojejunostomy has a high risk ofleakage in the setting of the soft texture of pancreas， small duct size， and the complication rate following pancreaticojejunostomy at the time of primary surgery is lower than with closure of pancreatic duct remnant， although both carry similar morbidity and mortality rates . Although mortality rates are high， surgery may be the only choice for these patients.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 10:40:03", "endTime": "2024/09/24 10:40:15", "cost": 12.48}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:36", "update_time": "2024-09-23 18:40:15", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 18:40:02"}

Once diagnosed， the splenic aneurysms should be treated properly. The majority of patients receive interventional therapy， which is difficult to preserve the spleen. We presented a case of splenic aneurysm resection and splenic artery anastomosis performed completely by laparoscopic surgery. The operation went smoothly with the spleen successfully preserved. The patient reported no discomfort or complications after the surgery. A review of intensive CT at 3 months post-operation revealed a normal spleen size and shape as well as patent blood flow at the anastomosis. Laparoscopic surgery have the advantage of exploring the entire abdominal cavity， clearly observing the situation around the aneurysm， and peeling the tumour from the splenic artery for ligation without damaging the spleen； however， laparoscopic surgery requires a skilful laparoscopic technique.\n\n【2】Keywords： Splenic aneurysm； Laparoscopy； Splenic aneurysm resection； Splenic artery reconstruction\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】The patient， a 37-year-old man， was admitted to the hospital with a left adrenal adenoma discovered by a health examination 6 weeks prior and a splenic aneurysm demonstrated by a Computed Tomography (CT) scan at the same time. He had a history of hypertension for 18 years， withthehighestbloodpressurereaching180/120mmHg(1mmHg=0.133kPa).After administration of controlled-release nifedipine tablets， the blood pressure was stabilized at 140/90 mmHg. He was diagnosed with diabetes for 3 years without systematic treatment， and the blood glucose level varied in the range of 8 mmol/L to 10 mmol/L. Physical examination： General condition with no obvious abnormalities of the heart， lungs or abdomen； bilateral kidneys were not palpated； and no sacral pain in the kidney areas， no bulges in the suprapubic bladder area， and no abnormalities in the external genitalia. Preoperative contrast-enhanced urinary MRI ： There was a left adrenal nodule with a size of 2.3 cmx 1.9 cm， T1WI low signal intensity， in-phase/anti-phase decreased signal intensity，T2WI slightly high signal intensity， and DWI high signal intensity. The post-contrast arterial phase image showed significant enhancement， and the delay phase showed circular enhancement， considered as sebaceous adenoma； local nodular enlargement of the splenic artery near the inside of the spleen was identified， approximately 1.9 cm x1.4 cm in size. The plain scan indicated a flow-shadow signal， and the post-contrast image showed a prominent highlight signal， similar to the splenic artery signal， considered a splenic aneurysm. Preoperative blood tests， blood biochemical tests， and cardiopulmonary function examinations were performed routinely. No obvious abnormalities were reported with a normal level of adrenalin. After the patient was admitted to the hospital， a Multidisciplinary Team (MDT) discussion was organized by the urinary department， interventional department， vascular surgery department， imaging department， and anesthesia department after patient admission. Based on the patient's medical history and auxiliary examination results， the diagnosis of left adrenal adenoma and splenic aneurysm was confirmed， with indications for surgery. Given that the splenic aneurysm was a benign lesion and was on the same side as the left adrenal tumor， a decision was made to perform a surgical operation at the same time， and a spleen-preserving surgical scheme was adopted.\n\n【5】Materials and Methods\n\n【6】A 3D laparoscopic resection of the left adrenal tumour and splenic aneurysm + splenic artery anastomosis was performed under general anesthesia. The patient took a right 70° inclined supine position. Laparoscopic trocar position： 2 cm above the umbilicus for the 12 mm trocar， which was the lens hole； 5 mm and 12 mm trocars were placed as the main knife operation holes below the inferior costal margin of the midline of the left clavicle and at the midpoint of the umbilical and anterior superior iliac spine lines； and a 10 mm trocar was placed on the plane of the axillary midline as an auxiliary hole for the assistant， and the position was diamond-shaped with the other three holes. During the operation， the left adrenal tumor was observed in the lateral branch， was approximately2.5 cm in size， and was slightly adhered to the surrounding tissue. During progressive adenoma resection， no significant fluctuation in blood pressure was observed. Subsequently， the splenic artery was discovered near the renal hilum on the inside of the spleen， combined with preoperative CT positioning. The assistant provoked the spleen through the auxiliary hole. The splenic aneurysm was located 4 cm near the spleen， and the tumour was approximately 2.0 cm in size with obvious vascular fluctuations. The splenic aneurysm and its distal and proximal 2 cm normal splenic arteries were completely separated， and the proximal and distal ends of the splenic artery were blocked with vascular blocking clips. The aneurysm sacs became soft. Incise the tumour wall， the normal splenic artery boundaries were identified under direct vision， and the aneurysm was completely removed with scissors. The normal splenic artery wall was anatomized with 5-0vessel lines， and the vessel cavity was flushed with heparin saline to prevent thrombosis. After the anastomosis， the vascular blocking clip was released， and the splenic artery was filled well without bleeding. The operation time was 2 h and 10 min， the arterial occlusion time was 25 min， and the intraoperative blood loss was 50ml.\n\n【7】Results\n\n【8】Postoperative pathological examination showed  macroscopic observation ： Adrenal glands and surrounding fat， nodular masses within the adrenal gland， approximately 2.3 cm×2.0cm×1.5cm in size； a section of blood vessel， 2.0 cm in length and 0.5 cm in diameter， with a tumour-like bulge on the vessel wall， approximately1.7 cm x0.5 cm x 0.5 cm in size . The tumor cell cytoplasm was mostly transparent with no mitotic images or local protrusion of the capsule observed. There was no necrosis or vascular invasion， which was consistent with the adrenal adenoma； the local blood vessel wall budged locally， considering the gross morphology， which was consistent with the aneurysm. The patient reported no discomfort， no complications， and a normal body temperature. He resumed walking and eating on the first postoperative day and was discharged on the fourth postoperative day. The treatment cost was no more than30，000 Yuan. A review of intensive CT at 3 months post-operation revealed patent blood flow at the anastomosis and a normal spleen size and shape .\n\n【9】Discussion\n\n【10】In August 2019， a case of splenic aneurysm resection with splenic artery anastomosis and reconstruction was completed under laparoscopy in the urology department of our hospital. The spleen was preserved， and the operation was a success. After a literature search， we confirmed it as the first case worldwide. We report the case as above.\n\n【11】Splenic artery aneurysms are the third most prevalent type of visceral aneurysms， only after abdominal aortic aneurysms and iliac aneurysms. The female： male incidence of splenic artery aneurysms is approximately 4：11. In recent years， the incidence of splenic aneurysms has increased substantially， with asymptomatic splenic aneurysms mostly discovered on health examination. However， symptomatic aneurysms are more life-threatening， among which hemorrhagic shock caused by the sudden rupture of the splenic artery is most common and most severe， especially for pregnant patients， with a mortality rate reaching as high as 70% . Once a splenic aneurysm is diagnosed， it should be treated promptly. Indications for the surgical treatment of splenic aneurysms include  acute rupture or threaten of rupture；  a tumor larger than 2 cm in diameter or a progressive increase in tumor volume (reviewed every 2 months)； intentioned pregnancy or has been pregnant；  the diameter is less than 2 cm with a good general condition， while the patient requires treatment；  the tumor compresses adjacent anatomical structures， causing pathophysiological changes and resulting in symptoms； and portal hypertension and regional portal hypertension .\n\n【12】It was the France surgeon Beaussier who first reported splenic aneurysms in 1770 and performed the first open splenic aneurysm resection worldwide . Originally， splenic aneurysms were mostly treated by surgery. Because surgery corrects the hemodynamic abnormality caused by splenic aneurysms and avoids furthertortuous and enlarged consequences， it has a relatively good long-term effect. Although traditional surgery can completely remove the lesion and achieve anastomosis under direct vision， reducing the risk of splenectomy due to the secluded position of the spleen artery and the complex surroundings such as the pancreas， stomach， colon， and adrenal glands， the incision has to be large enough for better exposure， which often leads to problems such as large trauma， a high incidence of complications， and slow recovery after surgery.\n\n【13】With the advancement of science and technology， most splenic aneurysms can currently be treated effectively with interventional embolism. Although interventional surgery is less invasive and the patient recovers quickly， this technique also has certain defects.  Patients undergoing embolization will suffer from different degrees of embolism syndrome， such as low fever， abdominal pain， lower back pain， and gastrointestinal symptoms.  Whether simple tumor lumen coil embolization or stent covering is performed， there is a possibility of insufficient blood supply to the spleen. In severe cases， this technique may even cause a large-scale acute spleen infarction， spleen abscess and major bleeding.  Potential aneurysm neck expansion and postoperative endoleak can lead to stent displacement， followed by failure of vascular lumen isolation and continuous pressure on the tumor wall to increase the risk of rupture.  If the spring coil fails to fulfill the tumor cavity during the operation， blood will enter the tumor cavity constantly， and the effect of complete isolation can hardly be achieved.  For patients with stent implantation， the risk of stent displacement and stent stenosis cannot be ignored， so the long-term application of aspirin and clopidogrel for antiplatelet therapy is essential， which results in higher costs， increased risk of bleeding and reduced quality oflife .\n\n【14】Duringthe last two decades， laparoscopic surgery has gradually become a mature minimally invasive surgical approach， demonstrating advantages such as limited trauma， reduced pain， fast postoperative recovery， few complications， and short hospitalization. Compared with traditional open surgery， it can more clearly and intuitively display the tissue relationship around the aneurysm， with a higher degree of refinement. However， there are few reports on the laparoscopic treatment of splenic aneurysms， which is mainly due to the higher requirements ofthelaparoscopic technique and experience of the surgeon. In 1997， Kawasaik et al.  reported the first case of successful laparoscopic aneurysm repair . Under laparoscopy， a flake intestinal clamp was placed on the base of the splenic aneurysm， and an endovascular stapler was used for repair. The nails were arranged parallel to the longitudinal axis of the splenic artery without tumor incision， as a result of which the cystic cavity was completely separated from the splenic artery. This case was the first domestic and foreign 3D laparoscopic splenic aneurysm resection and splenic artery reconstruction reported. The treatment was precisely the same as that of open surgery， which removed the lesion integrally under the premise of blocking the normal distal splenic artery and then anatomized and reconstructed the splenic arteries under laparoscopy to restore the integrity of the vascular cavity. Finally， the vascular blocking clip was released， and the patency of anastomotic blood flow was assessed directly. Compared with the method reported by Kawasaik， the treatment in this case had more accurate anastomosis of blood vessels under direct vision while avoiding the retention of metal foreign bodies and reducing the cost of surgery. This surgical method is safe and reliable， with the advantages of limited trauma and rapid postoperative recovery， but it has certain challenges. The requirements for the laparoscopic vascular anastomosis technique and the surgical experience of the operator are relatively high， so it should be carried out prudently.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 10:44:52", "endTime": "2024/09/24 10:45:22", "cost": 30.682}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:36", "update_time": "2024-09-23 18:45:22", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 18:44:51"}

One-fifth of all gallbladder cancer cases are reported only from northern part of India. The cases are more prominent in females than males. There were many risk factors associated with gallbladder cancer， but the heavy metals are play crucial roles in induction of gallbladder cancer. Heavy metal may interfere with molecular mechanism and activate mTOR，MAPK，and transcription factor. Hyper activation of cysteine due to arsenic exposure interfere with the function of the mTOR signaling pathway and taurine pathway that causes activation of c-fos，c-myc， and ELK-1leading to enhance cell division causing gallbladder cancer. Lead， Nickel， Zinc， and chromium activate cholic acid which causes formation of gallstones through activated taurine pathway leading to inflammatory gallbladder disease and formation of gall stones. Prolonged inflammation and stones formation in gall bladder may cause loss of contact inhibition in gall bladder cells leading to gall bladder cancer. The combined mechanism of heavy metals activates different pathway leading to gallbladder cancer through activating cell cycle and angiogenesis， it also inhibits tumor- suppressing genes. It was evident that gallbladder cancer is associated with high levels of heavy metal exposure. Differential mechanism associated with different heavy metal leads to gall bladder cancer.\n\n【2】Keywords： mTOR； MAPK； Taurine； Gall stone； Inflammation\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】GBC (Gallbladder Cancer) is the sixth most frequent cancer among all gastrointestinal tract malignancies . GBC have high mortality rate； it accounts for 20h position for death rate among all type of cancers. Mortality rate are very high for gall bladder cancer. In 2020， 115，949 new cases of GBC were reported worldwide， which was 0.6% of overall cancer incidence rate . Differences in GBC incidence rate have been observed in different geographical areas . Asia represents 70.8% of the total gallbladder cancer incidence followed by Europe 10.8%， Latin America and the Caribbean8.6%， Africa 4.7%， and Northern America 4.5% from. 10% of the global burden of GBC contributed by only India . The 10% to 22% of India’s total GBC burden has been contributed by north-east region . In 2020 because of GBC total of 84，695 deaths were reported worldwide including73.6% of the total mortality from Asia， 10.3% from Europe， 7.6% from Latin America and 5% from Caribbean， and 3.1% from Northern America . These variations observed due to dissimilarity in genetic propensity and environmental exposure as well as other conditions such as gallstones， obesity， gender， bacterial infection associated with chronic inflammation that increase the potential for carcinogenesis， as known risk factors .\n\n【5】Heavy metal and gallbladder cancer incidence\n\n【6】Heavy metal as well as trace metal was observed in bile of gall bladder cancer patients . The amount of some heavy metals like Lead (Pb)， Chromium (Cr)， and Cadmium (Cd) was found significantlyhigher in patients diagnosed with GBC . The study conducted in the Gangetic plains of Bihar by Kumar et al.，  found a remarkably high concentration of arsenic (>15 ugL) in the blood of 53.6% of patients with gallbladder cancer. High concentration of Copper (Cu) and Nickel(Ni) were found in serum， Cd and Ni were found in bile and high concentration of Cr was found in gallbladder tissues. While Zinc (Zn) and Selenium (Se) have also been detected in low concentration in gall bladder tissues . Role of heavy metal in induction of biological pathways were shown in Figure 1. It gives detailed idea about tumorigenesis in gall bladder and heavy metal incidence.\n\n【7】Molecular mechanism involved in gallbladder cancer due to heavy metals\n\n【8】Mondal et al.，  conducted a study that provides concrete pieces of evidence in support of heavy metals-induced premalignant and malignant development in gallbladder. It has been reported that the deregulation in antioxidant system plays a major role in carcinogenesis . Heavy metals induce cancer through the generation of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS)， which leads to DNA damage through redox imbalance and by interrupting the repair pathway of damaged DNA . The strong affinity of heavy metals for free sulfhydryl group makes it capable to disturb the metabolism and physiological function of several proteins . Heavy metal exposure such as As， Hg， Cd and Pb compromises with cysteine status， which significantly took a part in the inducible endogenous detoxification system of body  and heavy metal also associated with alteration in function of enzyme involved in antioxidant system， lead to malignancy by DNA damage .\n\n【9】Heavy metal binding with cysteine & its metabolites leading to gallbladder cancer： The semi-essential sulfur-containing amino acid cysteine is carried from extracellular space by a catalytic subunit of the transport system called xCT in exchange for glutamate . In the liver， cysteine decomposed into GSH (glutathione)by hepatic enzyme Y-Glutamyl Cysteine Synthetase (GCS) and disintegrates to cysteine sulfate by another hepatic enzyme Cysteine Dioxygenase (CDO)， cysteine sulfate further catabolized to hypo taurine by the action of enzyme Cysteine Sulfinate Decarboxylase (CSDC)， which later on oxidized to taurine . The free sulfhydryl group of Cysteine binds with heavy metal such as arenite resulting in metabolic alteration and decrease cysteine concentration in intercellular space . Cysteine transportation could also limit by phosphorylation of serine26 present on the cytosolic N terminus of the cystine-glutamate antiporter xCT by mTOR signaling . Decreased level of cysteine leads to disturbance in its physiological role such as protection against inflammatory response and oxidative stress by deregulating GSH synthesis . According to Lewerenz et al. ， the SLC7A11transporter is expressed in the number of malignancies where transporter-assisteddglutathione production decreases oxidative damage and protect cancer cell from death .\n\n【10】Role of GSH and its contribution to GBC due to heavy metal exposure： GSH protects the intracellular environment from oxidative stress and detoxifies cells by acting as a scavenger . GSH reduces the oxidative level through binding its thiol group directly with free radicals， it also functions as a cofactor for enzyme peroxidase， which metabolized H，O， and lipid peroxide . The high affinity of heavy metal for GSH leads to a reduction in intracellular concentration of glutathione by suppressing the action of essential enzyme Y-glutamyl cysteine synthetase required for GSH synthesis . Decreased levels of glutathione lead to elevation in redox imbalance which increases the frequency of damaged DNA  by modifying methylation of DNA or by interfering in the mechanism of DNA repair . Mutated DNA gets accumulated and eventually causes cancer . It has been observed that when ROS generation is high， the antioxidant system loses its ability to maintain equilibrium and results in oxidative stress.\n\n【11】Effect of heavy metal induced oxidative tension on DNA：High oxidative stress could induce either through mitochondrial dysfunction or malfunctioning of the ROS elimination system，heavy metal limits the function of MRCC1 and MRCC2 mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes which enhance the oxidative stress. Free radicals also produced either by stimulation of H.O， production through heavy metal toxicity or feedback inhibition of amino-levulinic acid synthase， which leads to an elevated level of heme precursor Amino-Levulinic Acid (ALA)， enolization of ALA followed by autoxidation generated free radicals . Increased level of free radical by inhibition of antioxidant system has been observed in fishes when exposed to metal toxicity by Zheng et al. Effects of increased oxidative stress on DNA impairment is complex and pleomorphic. Increased oxidative stress caused by heavy metal leads to DNA damage and it can initiate cancer processes as well as participate in its progression . Oxidative DNA damage has also been identified in the lymphocytes of the person exposed to the heavy metal environment . Chromosomal aberration and DNA strand break has been well demonstrated in cultured mammalian cells even at the minute deposition of heavy metal . Simultaneously ROS causes DNA damage by oxidizing nucleoside bases such as8-oxoguanine， which if left unpaired， it may cause G-T and G-A transversion . Moreover， heavy metal exposure can produce intrastrand bifunctional adducts through covalent binding with the N-atom of guanine and adenine present at 7th position of DNA residue leading to the destabilization of the DNA helix .\n\n【12】Suppression of DNA repair mechanism and genotoxicity due to oxidative stress caused by heavy metal： Giaginis et al.  has reported about suppression of mismatch repair， nucleotide excision， and base excision DNA repairs mechanisms due to heavy metal toxicity， either by binding to residues of negatively charged surface on DNA repair protein or by replacing Zn-atom in their Zn finger motif. Inhibition of repair mechanism result into conformational changes and disturbance in DNA protein interaction required for DNA repair process and preservation of genomic integrity. Substantiation of aberration in chromosome， micronuclei， and high sister chromatids exchange due to heavy metal has observed by Valverde et al.，  in person exposed to heavy metal environment. Heavy metal compounds alter expression of tumor suppressor gene and oncogene through deregulation in DNA methylation pattern . Which may be cause hypomethylation leading to oncogene activation through suppression of DNA methyl transferase  or transcriptional inactivation due to hypermethylation of the p53 gene at the promoter region by heavy metal . Heavy metal also reduces the levels of S-Adenosyl-L-Methionine (SAM) and methyltransferase gene which encode for enzyme that transfer a methyl group to nucleotides residue of DNA. Dysregulation in methylation processes due to heavy metal exposure has also observed in rats model . Methylation at promoter region of tumors suppressor gene family CDH1，CDKN2A， p16 and REpRIMO is responsible for apoptosis and inhibition of angiogenesis in gallbladder malignancy. Methylation of p73， MGMT， DCL1 were also observed in cell of gallbladder malignancy . Modification in promoter region and remodeling in process of methylation of DNA have a tumor-encouraging effect and enhance the up regulation of the proto-oncogene pool out-turn into mutation and accumulated mutation with time results in tumor formation.\n\n【13】Role of heavy metals on the physiological role of taurine responsible for galbladdertumorigenesis： Cysteine derived Taurine(2-aminoethane sulphonic acid) freely present in intracellular space play a key role in the reduction of oxidative tension induced by heavy metal toxicity . It has been observed that taurine reduces superoxide synthesis by elevating electron transport chain activity of mitochondria . Toxicity of heavy metal leads to a consequential reduction in taurine accumulation and falloff of the membrane protected by taurine . Taurine is critical for gallstone formation， which induces inflammation in inner lining of gallbladder tissues and eventually turns into a malignant mass of cells through mutation . Taurine also has been spotted in mt-tRNAs as a modified component of 5-taurine methyluridine and 5-taurine methyl-2-thiouridine . Increased ROS level due to reduction in GSHleads to enlargement and malfunctioning of mitochondria . Mitochondrial malfunctioning and high susceptibility of mt-DNA to ROS leads to alteration in mt-tRNA ， and mutated mt-tRNAs leads to several metabolic diseases as well as cancer .Disintegration of the inner membrane of mitochondria by modified mt-tRNA results in a remarkable reduction in CYP27A1 protein expression in taurine-depleted liver ， which further inhibits bile acid formation in addition to deterioration in the flow of bile， results in reduction of conjugation of taurine with bile acid . Accumulation of un-conjugated bile acid leads to the formation of gallstones， which cause irritation and turn into cancer in the long run. Modification due to heavy metals in MDR3， a gene involved in bile formation， and CYP27A regulates cholesterol metabolism in the liver， play critical role in gallstone formation.\n\n【14】Signaling expressed in gallbladder carcinoma\n\n【15】Cell signaling is necessary for sustaining critical cellular functions like development， differentiation， migration， and cell growth. Activation of ERK/MAPK  and mTOR signaling pathways  due to heavy metal toxicityhas been reported in gallbladder cell lines， which incite circumstances that fuel cancer progression .\n\n【16】MAPK signaling pathway activation in gall bladder cancer due to heavy metal exposure： Activation of the MAPK signaling pathway in presence of excess heavy metal through generation of ROS was extensively studied . Nanomolar concentration of Cd also activates MAPK signaling . MAP kinase activates different downstream substrate such as transcription factors Elk-1， c-jun， c-fos， c-myc， stress-activated protein kinase (MSK) and Ribosomal S6 Kinase 1 (RSK1) in gallbladder carcinoma . Which stimulate cancer regulatory processes： Angiogenesis， cell proliferation ， cell differentiation ， cell cycle progression ， growth， metastasis， invasiveness  in GBC celllines .\n\n【17】Role of heavy metals in mTOR activation leading to gallbladder cancer： mTOR activation occurs early in the development of GBC. Activation of PI3K kinase， which stimulate mTOR pathway and phosphorylation of mTOR， S6K1 and 4E-BP1 by heavy metal has reported in GBC . The PI3K/AKT signaling pathway activate mTOR by phosphorylate Ser 2448， which further activates the eukaryotic Translation Factor 4E (eIF4E) by inactivating its inhibitor 4E-BP1.35 . An element PI3K of the mTOR signaling pathway stimulates different tumorigenic cellular processes such as angiogenesis， cell survival， cell proliferation， adhesion， and motility. Riener et al.  found a missense mutation in PI3KCA，which contributes to gallbladder carcinogenesis . Outcomes of immunohistochemical analysis of phosphorylated p70S6K has been shown a high prevalence (>80%) of up-regulated p70S6K in gallbladder cell lines ， which have the potential to rearrange the actin cytoskeleton through its actin filament cross-linking Rac1/cdc42 and leads to cell migration .\n\n【18】Other transcription factors up-regulated by heavy metal in gall bladder cancer： Besides mTOR and MAPK signaling hyper activation of other transcription factors MTF1 (Metal Regulatory Transcriptional Factor1)， USF (Upstream Stimulator Factor)， Nuclear Factor kB (NF-KB) and NF-E2 Related Factor (NRF2) has also been observed in gallbladder carcinoma which is stimulated by heavy metals as well . Cd-induced tumorigenesis demonstrated through differential display analysis of transformed BALB/C-3T3cells due to CdCl2 exposure shows over expression of translation initiation factor-3 and translation elimination factor 1 delta . All these factors induced cellproliferation and cell survival， which is a key step in tumor formation. Nuclear Factor NF-kB regulate downstream target， modulate viability， and boost cell division of gallbladder cancer cells during chemotherapy . The result of an experimental study by Shibata et al. ， supports the regulation of NrF2 activity by alters the inhibitory function of Keaplgene in gallbladder cancer cell lines .\n\n【19】Conclusion\n\n【20】It was evident that gall bladder cancer is multistep process induced by activation of cascades of genes. Heavy metal enhances formation of gall stones which may be converted into gall bladder cancer with time. Taurine-cysteine pathway regulates formation of gall stones on activation due to increased concentration of heavy metal. MAPK， mTOR and transcription factor activation through different heavy metal finally leads to gall bladder malignancy through different pathways. NF kB， Rac1， elF4E and Cdc42 play critical role in cell migration and excessive protein synthesis required for proliferating gall bladder cells. Heavy metal toxicity causes increased chances of gall stone formation and gall bladder cancer through alteration of regulatory genes.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 11:37:26", "endTime": "2024/09/24 11:37:42", "cost": 15.769}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:36", "update_time": "2024-09-23 19:37:41", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 19:37:25"}

In patient with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) and the nephrotic syndrome， the two most common renal biopsy findings are diffuse proliferative lupus nephritis [World Health Organization (WHO) class IV] and membranous lupus nephritis (WHO class V). Lupus nephritis is divided into 6 distinct morphologic classes according to WHO. On the other hand non-lupus nephritis in patient with confirmed SLE is rarely reported. The relevant glomeruler lesions most frequently defined are amyloidois and Focal Segmental Glomerulo Sclerosis (FSGS). Thirty-six year-old female patients admitted with acute renal damage and nephrotic syndrome clinical findings. She fulfilled the following criteria of the American College of Rheumatology for SLE diagnosis： positive anti-dsDNA and ANA，leukopenia and cutaneous maculea. FSGS was detected in kidney biopsy. We believe that the patient had SLE and developed FSGS and we believe that lupus nephritis needs new classification.\n\n【2】Keywords： Acute kidney damage； Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis； Systemic lupus erythematosus\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Nephrotic Syndrome (NS) is a common presentation of Lupus Nephritis (LN). LN is divided into 6 distinct morphologic classes according to World Health Organization (WHO). LN is disunited 6 distinct morphologic classes according to the WHO classification： I-normal， II-mesangial proliferative， III-focal proliferative， IV-diffuse proliferative， V-membranous VI-advanced sclerosing glomerulonephritis . Beyond these lesions， renal biopsies from patients with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) may show pathogenic and morphologically non-SLE-related changes . Some of these cases have been described including several different renallesions in which amyloidosis and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis predominate. It is important that other nephritic diagnosis in SLE patients may have different prognosis and treatment. Morphology， behavior and the best treatment approach for non-LN cases in SLE patients are not well known.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】We report on the case of a 36 year-old， Arabic woman. She fulfilled the following criteria of the American College of Rheumatology for SLE diagnosis： positive anti-dsDNA and ANA，leukopenia and cutaneous maculea. She reported three weeks history of edema of lower extremities that progressedanasarca， dyspnea and cough，nighturination and decrease ofurinaryvolume. Thepatient had no chronic illness， no drug or substance use. At the initial physical examination， blood pressure was 100/80 mmHg， body temperature 36.8°C， and heart rate 92 beats/min and rhythmic. It was observed edema of evelid and 3+ edema of pretibial. Laboratory tests revealed serum creatinine： 1.6(0.1)mg/dL，urea： 110 mg/dL，sodium：137  mmol/L，potassium： 5.0 (3.5)mmol/L， hemoglobin： 9.38  g/L， ESR： 66 mL/h， C-RP： 10.5  mg/L， WBC： 3.71 (.5)10^9， platelets： 259  10^9 /L， serum albumin： 1.8 (3.1)g/dL. Anti-dsDNA：>300.00 U /mL， pozitif ANA： 1.5 ， Comp leman C3：42.9  mg/dL， Comp leman C4： 6.1 mg/dL， IgA： 181  mg/dL，IgG： 1390  mg/dL， IgM： 158  mg/dL. Sediment microscopy of urine showed 10-15 RBCs/HPF (high power field) and 5-10 WBCs/hpf，proteinuria was detected at 3.8 g/day. Ultrasonographic evaluation revealed normal kidney size， increased to grade 1 echogenicity. In the following days， urine output fell below 400 cc. Serum creatinine varied from 1.6 mg/dl to 5.7 mg/dl and patient was hipervolemic. Immediately started treatment with hemodialysis and kidney biopsy was performed. We thought she was diffuse proliferative lupus nephritis of SLE. Immediately we treated the patient with intravenous prednisolone 1000 mg three days. After she was treated with 48 mg oral methylprednisolone. As she was followed in our service during 25 days， her renal function was normally and proteinuria within 25 days went down to 1.8 g/day. She had no edema anywhere， and did not need hemodialized. She was treated with methylprednisolone (1 mg/kg/day) and miklofenat mofetil (2 g/day). FSGS was detected in kidney biopsy. Endothelial tubuloreticular inclusions were also seen. Pathology was consistent with FSGS. Renal biopsy did not reveal glom ruler lesions by the immunofluorescense was negative for C1q， IgG， IgM and IgA， but 3positive for C3 . Two months after discharge from hospital laboratory test revealed： serum creatinine： 0.5 mg/dl， iirea： 33 mg/dL， albumin： 3.9 g/dL， urinary microscopy is normal and protein excretion is 200 mg/day.\n\n【7】Discussion and Conclusion\n\n【8】Our patient presented at least four American College of Rheumatology criteria for diagnosis of SLE (leukopenia， cutaneous maculae， positive ANA， positive anti-dsDNA) and other clinical findings consistent with this diagnosis (hypocomplementemia and arthralgia). It is generally believed that renal abnormalities are caused by LN in well-documented SLE patients. Thus， renal biopsy in SLE is usually recommended not for diagnostic purposes， but rather to determine the type and extent of renal involvement ， as well as to evaluate the activity and chronicity indices. Interestingly， in rare cases， clinically significant renal diseases not associated with LN have been described in patients with SLE. There are only a few reports that this association is often isolated.\n\n【9】In SLE patients， a wide variety of renallesions not associated with LN may be seen. Renal biopsy plays an important role in determining glomerular disease associated with SLE. SLE patients clinically presenting with nephrotic syndrome indicating Minimal Change Disease (MCD)， Mesangial Proliferation (MsP) or FSGS， while on electronic microscopy， diffuse podocyte foot process removal in absence of sub-epithelial or sub-endothelial deposition is the only morphological feature and now diagnosed as lupus podocytopathy. There are 17 previous reports of FSGS in SLE . All reported patients presented with NS， normal or more frequently decreased renal function and hypertension. FSGS was preceded 3 to 18 years by renal abnormalities， which were related mostly to a previous LN. How the non-LN develops in patients with SLE is still poorly understood. The association between SLE and some diseases， such asthin-membrane disease， hypertensive nephrosclerosis，1IgA nephropathy and infection-related GN is probably coincident. On the other hand， the more frequentassociation with FSGS and amyloidosis may be pathogenetically concerned to SLE . Our patient had the histological diagnosis of FSGS.\n\n【10】Lupus podocytopia is susceptible to glucocorticoid therapy. SLs However， the relapse rate can reach up to 90% in treatment with glucocorticoid alone. Glucocorticoid plus other immunosuppressive agents can significantly reduce the relapse rate. Lupus podocytopathy with FSGS offers higher sensitivity to acute renal damage and less sensitivity to glucocorticoid treatment . We treated for FSGS after the biopsy； the patient experienced a full remission during the course of the disease. When non-LN was diagnosed， it was treated with myclofenate mofetil in addition to corticosteroids for FSGS.\n\n【11】Finaly， non-LN may be seen in SLE patients regardless of clinical or serological disease activity. Renal biopsy is an important tool in the identification of these lesions. These kidney lesions have a broad morphological spectrum； one of the most common is FSGS. The combination of corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive agents in SLE patients with acute renal damage and FSGS has increased the success oftreatment.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 10:40:17", "endTime": "2024/09/24 10:41:25", "cost": 68.305}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:36", "update_time": "2024-09-23 18:41:26", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 18:40:17"}

Majority of case reports on brain abscess either as a complication of stroke， or as a stroke mimic are in adults. Here， we present a case of a brain abscess in a child who presented with stroke.\n\n【2】Case Presentation\n\n【3】We report the case of a 12-year old boy who was admitted to our institution for sudden onset of right-sided weakness. Four days prior to admission he started to have low to moderate grade intermittent fever associated with occasional non-paroxysmal unproductive cough. He was prescribed with Clarithromycin， antihistamine， and B2-agonist medications， with resolution of symptoms. The fever recurred 1 day prior to admission associated with 2 episodes of non projectile vomiting of previously ingested food， and a throbbing frontal mild to moderate headache. About12 h prior to admission， the patient could no longer move his right upper and lower extremities， prompting transport to the hospital where he had an episode of generalized tonic clonic seizures lasting for 10 sec.\n\n【4】The past medical history revealed that the patient had a bout of fever and cough about 3 weeks prior to admission， for which he was prescribed Amoxicillin-clavulanic and Salbutamol， with subsequent improvement.\n\n【5】In the emergency room， the patient was examined conscious， coherent， oriented to 3 spheres， verbal but unable to move his right upper and lower extremities， and febrile at 38.6C. The systemic physical examination findings were generally normal. However， the neurologicexamination revealed a flattened right nasolabial fold， inability to lift his right shoulder， and deviation of the tongue to the right on protrusion. There was 0/5 motor strength of the right upper and lower extremities. Babinski sign present at the right. Hyporeflexia was noted on the right upper and lower extremities.\n\n【6】The patient was initially admitted as childhood stroke， and was worked up along this impression. There was neutrophilia seen in the complete blood count. This， together with the fever prompted administration of antibiotics. Hyponatremia at 127.5 mEq/L was seen. The prothrombin time was prolonged with an activity of 57.4% while the activated partial thromboplastin time was normal. The lipid profile showed low High Density Lipoproteins (HDL). The urinalysis was normal. The chest radiograph and the 2-dimensional echocardiography were normal.\n\n【7】The initial non-contrast cranial CT scan only showed focal brain atropy at the right frontallobe area without any sign of hemorrhage or infarction .\n\n【8】The fever resolved on the third day of hospitalization while on the antibiotics， but the motor deficits did not improve. Physical therapy was started.\n\n【9】By the sixth day of hospitalization， the patient’s motor strength on the right upper and lower extremity was seen to be 2/5， which further improved to 3/5 the next day. Rehabilitation therapy and the antibiotics were continued.\n\n【10】The patient's condition was progressively improving， when on the 17 hospital day there was note of sudden regression of the motor strength of the affected side to 0/5. Anisocoria was also noted. A re-stroke was considered so a repeat non contrast brain CT scan was performed； this time， multiple defined masses on the left frontal lobe were seen with vasogenic edema and mass effect， consistent with a brain abscess .\n\n【11】A neurosurgery referral was made， and a contrast-enhanced brain CT scan was preceded， revealing multiple enhancing complex masses， with subfalcine herniation to the right . Medical and surgical decompression was done. Antibiotics were shifted to Metronidazole， Amikacin， and Meropenem per brain abscess guidelines. Post-operatively， the patient's pupils became isocoric； the motor strength in the right lower extremity was 1/5 while the motor strength in the right upper extremity was 0/5.\n\n【12】With the medications and rehabilitation， his condition gradually improved. By the 8h post-op day， he was already able to gain full motor strength in the right leg while the right arm strength improved to 2/5.\n\n【13】A repeat contrast-enhanced cranial CT scan done on the 37hospital day showed interval enlargement of the rim-enhancing fluid density in the left frontal lobe， surrounding vasogenic edema and expansile effect， right subfalcine herniation and left frontal craniotomy defect .\n\n【14】Aspiration of the abscess was performed. Culture of the abscess fluid did not yield any growth. Antibiotics were continued.\n\n【15】A repeat cranial CT scan on the 42n hospital day showed interval decrease in size of rim-enhancing fluid density in the left frontal lobe and interval decrease in rightward subfalcine herniation， still with vasogenic edema. Medications were continued and further clinical improvement was noted .\n\n【16】Patient was discharged on the 45h hospital day already isocoric， with full strength in both lower extremities and left upper extremity， and residual weakness in the right upper extremity.\n\n【17】Discussion\n\n【18】Childhood stroke is defined similarly as adult stroke： an acute onset neurological sign or symptom attributable to a focal brain infarction or hemorrhage . Just like in adults， childhood stroke can be divided into hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke.\n\n【19】Hemorrhagic stroke may be intra parenchymal or spontaneous non traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage. Focal brain damage results from hemorrhage through localized mass effect and ischemia of adjacent tissues. Cerebral infarction or ischemic stroke may result from Arterial Ischemic Stroke (AIS)， venous infarction， or Cerebral Sinovenous Thrombosis (CSVT). Focal brain damage from ischemic stroke results when there is a loss of blood flow or oxygenation to an area of brain tissue .\n\n【20】Stroke in children is reported to be common. It affects 1 in 1，600to 4，000 neonates ， and 2.3 to 13 per 100，000 older children annually . Hemorrhagic stroke accounts for 50% of pediatric stroke， with an annual incidence of approximately 1 to 1.7 in 100，000children . The remaining 50% of pediatric stroke is accounted for by ischemic stroke， with a slightly higher annual incidence of 1 to 2 per100，000 children in developed countries . In the Philippines， the registry of childhood diseases of the Philippine Pediatric Society， Inc.， shows that there is a total of 701 reported cases of stroke in children from January 1，2006 to December. In a country with roughly 42，311，222 children ，the annual incidence rate of stroke is approximately 0.12 per 100，000 Filipino children. This number is much lower than that was reported for developed Western countries. However， this may not be a true reflection of the incidence of stroke among Filipino children as the PPS registry collects data only from their accredited training hospitals.\n\n【21】The most common symptoms of acute stroke in children are similar to those in adults. These include hemiparesis and hemi facial weakness (67% to 90%)， speech or language disturbance (20% to50%)， vision disturbance (10% to 15%)， and ataxia (8% to 10%).Non-localizing symptoms like headache and altered mental status may also be present. Seizures manifest in 15% to 25% of children with stroke. Seizure serves as a sentinel sign of acute stroke in children， occurring in 31% to 46% of younger children with stroke . Our patient presented with headache， vomiting， right-sided hemiparesis， and seizures. Clearly， our patient’s clinical manifestations are compatible with acute stroke.\n\n【22】The nature of the stroke-like manifestations of the patient on presentation was a dilemma for a time because aside from the absence of an infarcted area in the brain on the initial cranial CT scan， the search for the more common etiologies like sickle cell disease，cardiac disorders， or prothrombotic conditions were negative. A suspicion for yet undetermined infection was considered based on the presence of fever and neutrophilia in the complete blood count.\n\n【23】Literatures show that only approximately 50% of patients with ischemic stroke will have known risk factors predisposing to stroke at the time of diagnosis. However， after thorough evaluation， 40% of children with ischemic stroke are found to have 1 risk factor， 50%have 2 or more factors， and 10% have no identified risk factor for stroke. These risk factors include arteriopathies， cardiac disorders， infection， acute head and neck disorders， acute systemic conditions， chronic systemic conditions， prothrombic states， chronic head and neck disorders， atherosclerosis-related risk factors， and others .\n\n【24】The path physiology of the stroke in our patient was made clearer when a repeat cranial tomography showed multiple defined masses on the left frontal lobe with vasogenic edema and mass effect， which showed enhancement with contrast. This finding was compatible with brain abscess.\n\n【25】Brain abscess is a focal infection in the brain parenchyma consisting of encapsulated d ous andpyogenic bacteria. Less commonly， fungi， mycobacteria or protozoa cause brain abscess. Brain abscesses are reportedly rare in children， but they can cause significant morbidity and mortality . They occur in 0.4 per100，000 children annually but may range from 0.3 to 1.3 per 100，000children . The registry of childhood diseases of the Philippine Pediatric Society (PPS)， Inc. shows that there are 1，206 cases of intracranial abscess over 14 years . This translates to an annual incidence of 0.20 per 100，000 Filipino children. This number is lower than the reported incidence and contrasts with the report by Gaskill and Marlin  which said that there is a higher incidence of brain abscess in underdeveloped countries . They more common in males in the first two decades of life . Children 4 to 7 years old have the highest incidence of brain abscess . The locations of abscesses in the brain， in decreasing frequency， are frontotemporal， frontoparietal，parietal，cerebellar， and occipital areas .\n\n【26】Eighty percent of children with brain abscess have predisposing factors while 20% of cases are cryptogenic . Among children with predisposing factors， 30% to 50% result from contiguous focus of infection like otitis media， mastoiditis， sinusitis， orbital cellulitis， or dental infections . Approximately 10% of cases occur in cases where the body's natural barriers are disrupted like in cases of neurosurgical procedures or head trauma . Hematogenous spread associated with上bacteremia andimmunosuppressive conditions accounts for 40% of cases of brain abscess in children . Direct spread of the organism from a contiguous focus of infection usually causes solitary brain abscess  while bacteremic spread typically causes multiple brain abscesses . Based on the history and the physical exam which did not show evidence of probable contiguous foci of infection， neurosurgical procedure or head trauma， and the multiple abscess lesions seen in the cranial tomogram， the brain abscesses in our patient must have resulted from a bacteremic route. However， despite work-up， there was no underlying condition that was identified. This absence of an underlying condition or a primary site of infection has been reported in 20% to 40% of patients with brain abscess.\n\n【27】The signs and symptoms of brain abscess are initially nonspecific. Headache is the most common symptom， occurring in 69%of cases. Fever occurs in 45% to 53% of patients， seizures in 25%，and focal neurologic deficits in up to 50% of children with brain abscess.Individually， each of these signs and symptoms is not a reliable basis for the diagnosis of brain abscess. Even the classic triad of fever， headache， and focal neurologic deficits that suggests brain abscess is present in only 20% of cases . Thus， a high index of suspicion is recommended. Our patient presented with fever， headache， and hemiparesis. This should have alerted us to the possibility of brain abscess on admission； however， in the absence of abscess lesions on the initial cranial tomogram， the diagnosis of brain abscess was not considered on admission.\n\n【28】Hemiparesis in cases of brain abscess is reported to be more common in children than in adults. In a review of literatures on brain abscesses in children， the incidence ofhemiparesis ranged from19.2% to 44.06% . This high incidence was demonstrated to result from the involvement of the eloquent areas of the brain with seeding of metastatic abscesses .\n\n【29】The question that we asked ourselves in the management of this patient was that is this a case of the brain abscess being a stroke mimic or is the brain abscess a complication of stroke. Unfortunately， there is a dearth of literatures related to this topic in pediatrics. However， there have been reports of brain abscess as complication of stroke in adults. To date， there are 20 case reports of brain abscess after stroke that were published . All of these are reported in adults. The abscess is reported to develop 12 days to 14 months after the stroke incident . Our patient was diagnosed with brain abscess 17days after the stroke.\n\n【30】The pathogenesis of brain abscess after a stroke involves the disruption and loss of integrity of the blood brain barrier around the ischemic area ， making it vulnerable to microbial seeding when bacteremia occurs during a systemic infection .\n\n【31】However， brain abscess as a complication of the ischemic stroke could not be explained by the afebrile state of our patient at the time of or immediately before the diagnosis of brain abscess was made. This made us consider an alternative scenario where the developing brain abscess acted as a stroke mimic.\n\n【32】There have also been reports of brain abscesses as stroke mimics.Unfortunately again all these reports are in adults. The exact mechanism how a brain abscess presents with stroke-like symptoms is still unclear. One hypothesis is the development of paroxysmal septic emboli that causes embolic infarction which becomes the nidus for the abscess formation . However， the septic work-up in our patient did not reveal any focus of infection that could have thrown a septic embolus to the brain. The authors hypothesize that the stroke-like manifestations in our patient， not accompanied by an apparent infarct in the cranial tomogram， may be due to the cerebritis stage of abscess formation and its accompanying inflammatory vasculitis or in-situ thrombus formation， and that the brain abscess in our patient could have been cryptogenic in nature. It has been reported that the cranial tomography of the brain may be negative or may show only subtle nonspecific findings during the early stages of evolution of a brain abscess . It could have been better if a magnetic resonance imaging of the brain was done as it is the preferred imaging method in the initial examination. Sadly， our institution lacks this technology for now.\n\n【33】The most important lesson that this patient taught us， regardless of whether the brain abscess is a complication of a stroke or is a stroke mimic， is that a high index of suspicion for the possibility of a brain abscess in a patient with stroke-like manifestations is quite necessary for early diagnosis and treatment to prevent significant morbidity and mortality.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 11:01:23", "endTime": "2024/09/24 11:01:56", "cost": 33.354}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:36", "update_time": "2024-09-23 19:01:54", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 19:01:21"}

Her symptoms began in May 2020， with dyspnea and orthopnea， secondary left massive pleural effusion， and abdominal perimeter growing， both clinical situations progressive. She denied abnormal genital bleeding. ECOG 3， clinicalleft pleural effusion， ascites without tension， gynecological exploration negative. We made approach with CT scan thorax and abdomen， with the findings of pleural effusion without parenchymal lung metastases， without pleural thickening， and peritoneal carcinomatosis with uterine enlargement. Transvaginal echography shows endometrial thickness with 18.5 mm associated with free fluid in abdominal cavity . Thoracentesis， paracentesis and endometrial office biopsy were done， revealing papillary serous adenocarcinoma. With multidisciplinary tumor board (surgicaloncologist，medicaloncologist，pneumologist， thoracic surgeon) we decided to make Video Assisted Thoracic Surgery (VATS) for histologic confirmatory diagnosis and as palliative procedure for her respiratory symptoms with systematic pleurectomy， physical， surgical and chemical pleurodesis， and the findings were only pleural effusion， no lung entrapment or lung parenchymal metastases， no visceral and no parietal pleura involvement.\n\n【8】Pathology report\n\n【9】Pleural biopsy without tumoral activity with inflammation， cytologic analysis with metastatic papillary adenocarcinoma cells (CK7+/PAX8+/WT1+/CA125+) .

Tumor board consider her surgical candidate， she took to debulking surgery with optimal cytoreduction (total abdominal hysterectomy， bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy，peritoneal washing， retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy， and omentectomy)； pathology showed： Uterine serous papillary adenocarcinoma without myometrial invasion， lympho vascular infiltration present， both ovaries with stromal infiltration of serous papillary adenocarcinoma， greater omentum and peritoneal washing with malignant cells of serous papillary adenocarcinoma. No lymphatic nodules involvement. The plan is to continue adjuvant chemotherapy for 2 additional cycles to complete 6 cycles. We consider the relevance to this communication for the concurrent presentation with unilateral pleural effusion without pleural involvement (parietal and visceral) and without lung parenchymal affection， with peritoneal carcinomatosis， in a stage IV endometrial carcinoma with aggressive subtype.\n\n【10】Discussion\n\n【11】Endometrial Carcinoma (EC) is the most common malignant tumor of the female tract， and only 2% to 4% are disseminated at the diagnosis (mostly aggressive subtypes， as clear cell and serous papillary). Usually the EC has a lymphatic involvement with pelvic and para-portico nodules affection， and hematogenous spread to distant organs. There are few studies with the full description of pleural and/or lung metastases incidence. Bristow et al. reported 45%of cases with EC and extra-abdominal disease， with pleural cytology positive and previously Bransheid et al.  in 414 patients found2.2% of uterine and ovarian primary tumors . Several years ago， it was believed that the metastatic carcinoma to the pleura， in more than 50% of the cases were of endobronchial tumoral emboli in the pulmonary artery， suggesting terminal disease， even it was thought that bilateral affection was related to hepatic metastases .\n\n【12】The pleural fluid is produced about 0.26 ml/kg/day body weight， and when there is an imbalance between production and absorption， results in pleural effusion， for example in the cases of metastatic disease， there are carcinosis， with malignant cells on the parietal and visceral pleura， encouraging the abnormal production of pleural fluid， often with lung parenchymal metastases in the elderly stages of the malignant disease with dismal prognosis. It has been estimated the 15% of malignant neoplasm can develop pleural effusion as a resultant pleural and/or pulmonary invasion for cancers of the thorax and extra thoracic sources as colorectal， kidney， gastric， pancreatic， prostate， and genital tract . It is important to mention， that， it is most common to find lung metastases than only pleural affection， obviously with pleural effusion， so， the malignant cells can reach this location by direct extension or systemic spread or， even through lymphatic channels in the diaphragm， and they have several types of presentation： a. Solitary pulmonary nodule b. Multiple pulmonary nodules c. Tumoral emboli d.Endobronchial metastases e. Pleural effusion.\n\n【13】These lung metastases are the principal location of extra pelvic dissemination in EC， with 2.3% to 4.6%， or even 25% of the other gynecological cancers， and the parenchymal nodules are the most common finding (30% to 60% by uterine tumors) in the metastatic lung disease， tending to be peripheral， multiple， basal location， in high blood flow areas， or even， there can be cavitation. But the only pleural affection with pleural effusion， nodularity or thickness is an infrequent finding .\n\n【14】The peritoneal cavity has a dynamic state of the peritoneal fluid， with circulation thanks to the breathing movements， peristalsis and abdominal pressure fluctuation， and absorption through the lymphatics channels on the right diaphragm； its oncologic relevance data from 961， with Morton et al.， being the first to report malignant cells in peritoneal washings .\n\n【15】There is no consensus (respect a que?) in patients with concurrent malignant pleural effusion and malignant ascites in the metastatic settings， however， the management of the present case， is according with the palliative procedures like pleurodesis， pleurectomy， etc. and the use of cytotoxic systemic therapy with chemotherapy .\n\n【16】Conclusion\n\n【17】EC is the most common gynecological neoplasm and the mostly affected in the metastatic context， the thoracic cavity， with lung and pleural disease， with parenchymal invasion (mainly aggressive subtypes).\n\n【18】The most interesting finding in this case was the absence of pleural and parenchymal lung affection， having only cytologic as thoracic as abdominal metastases confirmation， considering the possibility of spread through lymphatic channels on the left side diaphragm， another important issue， with only one pleural cavity affected. There would be necessary to implement pleural biopsy (parietal and visceral) and cytologic examination to rule out or confirm ser， for its optimal management.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 11:19:00", "endTime": "2024/09/24 11:19:11", "cost": 11.069}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:36", "update_time": "2024-09-23 19:19:10", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 19:18:59"}

Both radiologists and physicians should be familiar with the spectrum of pathologies affecting the AC joint and should be able to ask for the proper imaging modality.\n\n【3】This is a single center retrospective study done at king Hussein medical center in Amman Jordan， in this study we will try to highlight the prevalence of different pathologies affecting the AC joint in Jordanian population.\n\n【4】Methods\n\n【5】After ethical committee approval， Revision of 480 shoulder MRI studies done between January2016 and January 2017 for patients aged 28 to 72 years with variable clinical presentation to orthopedic or rheumatology clinic.\n\n【6】All studies were done on 3 tesla MRI machines， Philips Ingenia or Siemens Skyra machine with routine shoulder protocol and dedicated shoulder coil.\n\n【7】All studies were reviewed by senior radiologists and results were analyzed using simple statistical methods.\n\n【8】Results\n\n【9】The presenting symptoms were variable and were presented in the following Table 1.\n\n【10】All studies were reviewed for AC joint pathologies only and other findings in shoulder MRI were not emphasized， the findings we were looking for include bone marrow edema， synovial hypertrophy.\n\n【11】Erosions， callus formation and sclerosis， subarticular cysts， acromion shape， widening of AC joint space， subacromial bursitis， synovial cysts or collections， ligamentous or muscle injury， most patients have more than one imaging finding， the findings were as following Table 2.\n\n【12】The shape of acromion were assessed and the results were as shown in the following chart (Chart1).\n\n【13】Discussion\n\n【14】The AC joint is the joint between the lateral end of the clavicle and the medial acromion ， it is synovial joint with vertically oriented articular disc . It has both static and dynamic stabilizers.\n\n【15】Ligaments provide static stability， the acromioclavicular ligaments prevent anterior and posterior AC joint dislocations while the coracoclavicular ligament prevent superior displacement， the coracoacromial ligament prevent the humerus from superior subluxation.\n\n【16】The dynamic stabilizers ofthe AC joint are all the muscular attachments \n\n【17】Imaging of the AC joint start with simple X-Rays which is in spite of all advances in shoulder imaging still play an important role in assessment of traumatic AC joint dislocations， in grading of osteoarthritis and is mandatory in evaluation of bony lesions affecting the acromion process or the clavicle .\n\n【18】Table 1： The presenting symptoms were variable.\n\n| Chief complaint  | Number  | Percentage  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Chronic pain/Discomfort  | 182  | 38%  |\n| Limitation of movement  | 110  | 23%  |\n| Acute pain  | 68  | 14%  |\n| Trauma  | 53  | 11%  |\n| Combination  | 67  | 14%  |\n\n| Finding  | Number  | Percentage  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Bone marrow edema  | 260  | 54%  |\n| Synovial hypertrophy  | 204  | 42.50%  |\n| Erosions  | 42  | 8.70%  |\n| Joint effusion  | 150  | 31.20%  |\n| Synovial cysts or collection  | 60  | 12.50%  |\n| Subacromial bursitis  | 248  | 51%  |\n| Callus/Sclerosis  | 180  | 37.50%  |\n| Ligamentous or ligament injury  | 24  | 5%  |\n| Subarticular cysts  | 142  | 29.50%  |\n| Os Acromiale  | 39  | 8%  |\n|  |  |  |\n\n【21】Many spaces should be evaluated when evaluating AC joint on plain film， the AC and coracoclavicular distances . The acromiohumeral space should be evaluated as narrowing of this space might be indicative of full thickness rotator cuff tear with retraction and muscle atrophy .\n\n【22】Plain film has limited value in evaluation of bony edema， subtle erosions， occult fractures and ligament and muscle injuries  which account for a significant positive finding in our study.\n\n【23】Another simple non-invasive widely available imaging modality is US and this particularlyimportant in US guided interventions such as joint aspirations and analgesia either direct to the AC joint or the adjacent spaces .\n\n【24】MRI is now widely accepted as the modality of choice for assessment of the AC joint. It's particularly superior is assessment of articular cartilage， capsule， ligaments integrity， muscles and bony edematous changes .\n\n【25】Bone marrow edema might be the only and early positive MRI finding and help in diagnosing traumatic AC injuries， arthropathies and inflammation  and this finding can only be confidently depicted on MRI imaging.\n\n【26】MRI is superior modality because of its multiplanar nature so you can evaluate the AC joint in any plane and subtle changes can be detected.\n\n【27】Combination of MRI findings is seen in high percentage in same patient. In the other hand combination of imaging modalities might be needed for better evaluation.\n\n【28】The shape of acromion is important imaging finding because it might bethe cause of patient’s symptoms， as we can see in Figure 1 type III or hooked acromion with impingement on the musculotendinous junction of the supraspinatus tendon the shape of the acromion was assessed in this study and results were as in the pie chart in the results section where type I and II were around 90% of cases while type III was seen in 7 percent of cases and type IV only seen in minority.\n\n【29】Another important imaging finding was the presence of Os acromiale which in this study was seen in around 8% of the study sample. Os acromiale is an accessory bone seen at the acromion process due to unfused ossification center. It is best assessed in superior images of axial MRI of the shoulder as seen in Figure 2. It might be a cause of rotator cuff impingement and resultant tear.\n\n【30】Degenerative changes with synovial hypertrophy and callus formation are the most common abnormality encountered in imaging of AC joint as shown in next Figure 3.\n\n【31】A common imaging finding is the presence of subacromial bursitis often with extension to subdeltoid space as shown in next Figure 4.\n\n【32】Sometimes the fluid extends upwards to the subcutaneous tissues to present as palpable mass overlying the AC joint which is known as geyser sign as shown in the next Figure 5.\n\n【33】MRI is important in assessing muscle and ligamentous injury which may be seen as only alteration in MRI signal characteristics and may not be evident in other imaging modalities as seen in the next image where we can see edema and injury to the coracoclavicular ligament with bony edema of the AC joint and this is important finding in cases of AC joint dislocation as it will upgrade the AC joint dislocation to grade III and this will affect the management. An example shown in Figure 6.\n\n【34】And below Figure 7 is another example of muscle injury depicted on MRI and may be difficult to assess in other imaging modalities.\n\n【35】We should not forget that AC joint is synovial joint and might be affected by synovial based pathologies and affected by all types of arthritis and the bony structures might be involved in any type of bone pathologies.\n\n【36】Next is a case of involvement of Acromion and clavicle by enchondromas in patient of Ollier disease as shown in Figure 8.\n\n【37】Conclusion\n\n【38】AC joint is important joint affected by different pathologies and present with variable clinical presentations and should be examined carefully when assessing images ofthe shoulder.\n\n【39】MRI is the superior modality for assessing AC joint pathologies.\n\n【40】Knowing the anatomy， the variants and normal appearances of AC joint is important for proper assessment of different pathologies.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 10:18:22", "endTime": "2024/09/24 10:18:36", "cost": 13.989}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:36", "update_time": "2024-09-23 18:18:35", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 18:18:21"}

However， some snakes with longer fangs can inject venom directly deep into muscular compartments which are more likely to cause compartment syndromes. This is seen more so in the hand and forearm， where the venom delivery into deep compartments is more likely . It is almost always treated by fasciotomy to release the pressure， preferably within 6 h， to prevent irreversible muscle damage .\n\n【8】However， though controversial， in some cases fasciotomy is deemed not necessary following administration and improvement from anti-venom . In other situations， fasciotomy is only recommended in selected cases where the compartment pressure continues to rise even after anti-venom administration . The point of contention is that the cytotoxic symptoms of the venom can be indistinguishable from compartment syndrome . This ambiguity creates a dilemma for clinicians where management is still unclear.\n\n【9】We present a case of compartment syndrome complicating snakebite where prophylactic fasciotomy was not done following response to ASV. This case suggests the possibility of use of ASV to negate the need for fasciotomies for compartment syndromes complicating snake bites.\n\n【10】An 11-year old previously healthy child presented with a history of snake bite on his left hand index finger complicated with progressive painful swelling of his left upper limb. His parents immediately tried to stop the bleeding by sucking out the venom and applying traditional remedies over the wound， though no cuts were made. The parents noticed bruising， bleeding and gradual swelling then， a tourniquet was tied and the patient was brought to the nearest district hospital which was 2 h away. The swelling had progressed over the left wrist and extended half way up the forearm. The tourniquet was immediately removed at the hospital. Intravenous antibiotics and tetanus prophylaxis were administered. He did not have any bleeding or neurological symptoms. However overnight the swelling had progressed beyond the elbow joint and there was bruising and bullae formation over the bite site Painful finger movements on the left hand with absence of radial pulse were noted. The patient was then referred to the orthopedic surgeon at our hospital for management of compartment syndrome.\n\n【11】On examination there was swelling of the entire left upper limb extending onto the left shoulder joint. There was significant tenderness on palpation of forearm and arm muscles and pain on passive extension. Radial pulse was palpable. Capillary refill time on the finger beds was less than 3 sec. Local examination revealed evidence of severe envenomation including redness， swelling， blistering and underlying ecchymosis.\n\n【12】A diagnosis of compartment syndrome was made. Patient was initially planned for urgent fasciotomy. However， his 20 min Whole Blood Clotting Time (WBCT) was found to be prolonged and he also had prolonged pro thrombin time and International Normalized Ration (INR). In view of the rapidly progressive severe local envenomation signs and deranged coagulation profile， the decision to first administer polyvalent Anti- Snake Venom (ASV) was made， though at that time >24 h had elapsed since the bite. After discussion with the orthopedic surgeon， it was decided to continue ASV and to withhold fasciotomy unless there is no evidence of improvement.\n\n【13】During the course of administration of anti-venom， the patient developed early allergic reaction evidenced by cough， scratchy throat， and urticarial rashes and vomiting with presence of hematemesis. The reaction was immediately managed1 with fluids， oxygen， adrenaline， antihistamines and steroids. ASV was stopped and patient was monitored. With resolution of symptoms， the infusion was further diluted and slowly restarted at a slower infusion rate. Is coagulation profile was normalizing at 6 h. Overnight his swelling over the forearm reduced significantly and pain had reduced. With normalization of coagulation profile and improvement of compartment symptoms fasciotomy was withheld. He responded well despite late administration of ASV. His limb swelling drastically improved and was discharged on day 7 of admission.\n\n【14】Discussion and Conclusion\n\n【15】Epidemiological data on snakebites in Bhutan remain limited.Of what is known and recorded， there are 69 species， of which 15 are venomous snakes belonging to two families， Elapidae and Viperidae6.\n\n【16】The timely administration of ASV remains the mainstay to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with snakebites. A retrospective study in Bhutan reported that around 35% of snake bites developed envenomation signs and symptoms. Polyvalent ASV was found to have excellent outcomes with only 7% mortality .\n\n【17】Compartment syndrome involves the sustained elevation of interstitial tissue pressures within an osteofascial envelope to non-physiologic levels. It causes tissue injury leading to irreversible damage and， therefore， early recognition and treatment is critical for optimal outcomes . Alternatively， fasciotomy performed prophylactically may lead to worsened local myonecrosis . In most cases of snakebite， fasciotomy is not necessary. Once administered， anti-venom helps neutralize the venom， reducing compartment pressure and inhibiting the development of compartment syndrome.\n\n【18】In our case， in view of deranged coagulation profile， a decision was made to defer fasciotomy and observe response to ASV. Gregory et al.， reiterates that fasciotomy should only be performed in patients with clinical signs and symptoms of compartment syndrome that are present despite elevation of the affectedlimb and administration of 20vials of anti-venom . A study by Hall noted that， out of 1，257 cases of extremity bites only two required fasciotomies .\n\n【19】In contrast， a recent study， where intra-compartmental pressures were measured for diagnosis of compartment syndrome， recorded a higher rate fasciotomies at 10.8%. As in the discussed case， the local and systemic envenomation effects of venom closely resemble the signs and symptoms of compartment syndrome. Fasciotomy， in the past， could have been withheld in patients with actual compartment syndrome， attributing the symptoms to the venom .\n\n【20】Initiation of anti-venom should not be held for delayed presentation of snakebites. Prophylactic fasciotomies should be considered after correction of hematological parameters. Though controversial， it is still prudent to start ASV first with closely monitoring and consider surgery only if compartment symptoms persist with failed response to ASV. ASV can， not only reverse coagulopathy， but may also be helpful in reducing symptoms of compartment syndrome， thereby negating the need for fasciotomies.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 11:15:22", "endTime": "2024/09/24 11:15:42", "cost": 19.996}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:35", "update_time": "2024-09-23 19:15:42", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 19:15:22"}

The patient was a 52 year-old male with solitary kidney， after nephrectomy of his left kidney， because of Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC). He was admitted to our hospital，8 months after nephrectomy， because of severe nephrotic syndrome (total urine protein (TPU) >8.5 gr/24h) with normal renal function. Biopsy of the remaining kidney showed AHL systemic amyloidosis， while immunofixation identified fragments ofa-heavy chains in urine and serum， as well as A light-chains in urine. The diagnosis ofprimary amyloidosis in which the amyloid deposits are composed of both light and heavy chains， is an extremely unusual occurrence， while only a few cases are presented in the literature. Various studies have showed a rare association of renal cell carcinoma and amyloidosis， but this is related to secondary (AA type) amyloidosis. On the contrary， there are no data where renal carcinomas relate to systemic amyloidosis. Thus this case report is very interesting for two reasons； first for the concurrence between renal carcinoma and systemic amyloidosis and for the heavy chain fragments in serum and urine.\n\n【2】Keywords： Heavy and light-chain amyloidosis； AHL amyloidosis； Nephrotic syndrome； a-heavy chain； Renal cell carcinoma\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Amyloidosis encompasses a rare group of conditions characterized by extracellular deposition of fibrils， caused by abnormal folding of proteins which exhibits a beta sheet configuration on X-ray diffraction. These amyloid proteins can be histologically confirmed by their characteristic apple green birefringence under polarized light， when stained positively with Congo red dye. There have been identified approximately 15 to 20 precursor proteins of amyloid so far . The most prevalent type of systemic amyloidosis is immunoglobulin (Ig)-related amyloidosis {referred to as primary amyloidosis) and even if it is difficult to document its incidence， it is considered to affect about 5to 13 per million per year in western countries . The most frequent presentation of amyloidosis is renal damage， which is characterized by proteinuria， with or without renal insufficiency. Our knowledge concerning the pathogenesis of primary amyloidosis is scanty， while our data for the infrequent entity of Heavy and Light-chain Amyloidosis (AHL)， in which the amyloid fragments are composed of Ig heavy and light chains are even more limited . Amyloidosis associated with immunoglobulin a-heavy chain has been reported only in few cases . Another thing that is unique， in the present patient， is that he was recently operated for clear cell carcinoma of his left kidney. These types of carcinomas had been correlated with paraneoplastic syndrome which is manifested with a variety of atypical symptoms (i.e. fatigue， anorexia， weight loss， or endocrine(i.e.hypercalcemia etc.) or non-endocrine disorders (i.e. amyloidosis). In these references， it is secondary amyloidosis (type AA amyloidosis) but not primary systemic one that is related to . This report concerns a patient with nephrotic syndrome as a result of AHL amyloidosis (with a heavy chain) which appeared after removal of his left kidney for renal cell carcinoma.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 50-year-old man was admitted to our hospital for investigation of nephrotic syndrome (TPU)>8.5 gr/dl， hypoalbuminemia (albumin=2.5 mg/dl) but normal renal function (Cr=0.9 mg/dl， eGFR=100 ml/min/1.73 m’，CKD-EPI，possible due to hyper filtration ofthe remaining kidney). The patient had a solitary right kidney， because eight months prior to his admission to our hospital he had undergone nephrectomy in his left kidney due to clear cell renal carcinoma (Fuhrman Grade III). On physical examination， he had negligible pitting edema in lower extremities and there were no signs of organomegaly， lymphadenopathy， macroglossia or neuropathy. Laboratory data revealed normal serum IgA (161 mg/dl， normal values 72 mg/dl to 400 mg/dl)， decreased IgG (369 mg/dl， normal values 690 mg/dl to 1，618 mg/dl) and highly increased IgM (457 mg/dl， normal values 40 mg/dl to 235mg/dl). Immunofixation detected a band of a-heavy chain in the serum and urine， as well as A-light chains in urine. Urine analysis showed proteinuria with no hematuria， with the amount ofurine protein at 8.5 gr/day.\n\n【7】Because of his recent malignancy， we suspected that the possible cause of his nephritic syndrome might be secondary (membranous) glomerulonephritis. Thus his underwent methodical investigation with CT scanning of lungs， abdomen， as well as colonoscopy and gastroscopy， while he was subjected to ultrasound guided kidney biopsy. Due to the fact that the patient had a-heavy chains in his immunofixation， gastroscopy that was performed also aimed to take biopsies from second， third， and fourth part of the duodenum and upper jejunum， so as to exclude the Possibility of Immunoproliferative Small Intestine Disease (IPSID) which sometimes accompanies a heavy chain findings . The gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed only mild esophagitis while the gastroduodenal mucosal biopsy was negative for amyloid deposition.\n\n【8】The renal biopsy specimen indicated diffuse and global amyloid deposition both on peritubular spaces and the glomeruli， particularly in the mesangial region and the capillaries of glomeruli and Congo red stain positive . In addition， the mesangium of the glomerulus was expanded .\n\n【9】Immunohistological studies for renal amyloid using numeral antibodies (i.e. β-2 macroglobulin， transthyretin etc.) were not fully available in our laboratory. From the available immunohistological studies， the amyloid deposits on immunofluorescence， stained strongly for A and slightly for K， IgM， IgG and IgA . Bone marrow aspiration biopsy showed a plasma cell count 12% to 15%， without amyloid deposition or any dysplasia as well as normal cellularity with trilinear adequate hematopoiesis . Moreover， monoclonal A light chains expressed strongly in plasma cells with scattered aggregates or nodules whereas k light chains expression was weak . The diagnosis of AL/AHL amyloidosis was determined due to immunofixation findings in serum and urine of monoclonal a heavy chain immunoglobulin， together with A light chain immunoglobulins.\n\n【10】Neither electrocardiogram nor echocardiogram revealed any findings suggestive of amyloid heart disease. There was absence of“granular sparkling myocardium and diastolic-systolic dysfunction， while proBnP， a prognostic factor of cardiac amyloidosis， was within the normal range. Chest and abdominal CT scans showed no enlarged lymph nodes was treated with chemotherapy (Bortezomib1， 3 mg/m’ in days 1， 8and 15， Lenalidomide 10 mg in 1-21 days and dexamethasone 40 mg in days 1， 8， 15 and 22). The whole therapy was administered for a28 day-cycle， repeated 6 times. A dramatical decline in proteinuria as well as improvement of hypoalbuminemia and patient's lipidemic profile was observed after the end of chemotherapy， with complete remission ofhis nephrotic syndrome.\n\n【11】It is markedly important to mention that after the results of the kidney biopsy， we examined the tissue of the resected neoplastic left kidney so as to confirm whether amyloidosis was preexisted or not. Congo red staining and immunohistochemical staining were performed in the non-tumor region of his extracted left kidney and were negative for amyloid deposits. Taking into considerations all these findings， our patient was diagnosed with a clear cell carcinoma which was resected and few months later， he was presented with severe nephrotic syndrome due to a rare type of amyloidosis (AHL amyloidosis with a-heavy chain in serum and urine).\n\n【12】Discussion\n\n【13】AHL amyloidosis is considered to be a rather rare disorder compared to AL amvloidosis. There have been five cases of AHL reported up to now . Light and electron microscopy are not always capable to determine the different types of amyloid. The most potent and sensitive method of distinguishing amyloidogenic fibrils is by Laser Micro Dissection (LMD) or Mass Spectrometry (MS)-based proteomic analysis， a method that can be done in formalin-fixedtissue-embedded paraffin specimens that helps to diagnose amyloidosis easier， even in archival material. However， these techniques have some limitations including the lack of a suitable reagent with the necessary specificity， as well as their unavailability in daily routine. Therefore mentioned methods are indispensable only when the other procedures are not diagnostic and unrevealing. In some problematic cases， where there is absence of immune reactivity for light or heavy chain， the right type of amyloidosis can be indirectly confirm by the demonstration of a monoclonal Ig protein in the blood， urine or in the bone marrow as in the present case .\n\n【14】In summary， the reported case is very interesting due to the concurrentpresence ofrenal cell carcinoma and a raretype of systemic amyloidosis. It is also peculiar how systemic amyloidosis presented after 8 months of his nephrectomy given that the removed kidney was free of deposition of amyloid. To our knowledge， only limited cases of renal cell carcinoma associated with primary amyloidosis have been published and these are referring to the inverse relationship. In other words， there are references in literature where systemic amyloidosis is preceded and RCC appears after a certain period . On the other hand AA amyloidosis can be manifested as a possible consequence of stimulation by the carcinoma .

Due to the limitations of physical experiments such as difficulty in observation， rapid occurrence of phenomena， and dangers， as well as the impact of subjective and objective factors such as school funding， teacher constraints， and students weak experimental awareness， many physical experiments are not convenient to conduct in the classroom or laboratory， such as wave optics， fluid mechanics， particle physics， and nuclear physics experiments. The development of computer and simulation technology has enabled virtual experiments to be realized ， but most of the existing physical experiment simulation software in China is two-dimensional simulation ， such as Zhang Wenmiaoyun et al.， who implemented optical experiment simulation based on Python， and Cao Fujun et al. ，who designed and developed two-dimensional simulated electromagnetic experiments using EWB 5.0. The effect of two-dimensional simulation experiments is not intuitive and visual enough，lacking a sense of immersion  and a sense of restoration， and the teaching effect is limited. The significance of designing the three-dimensional experimental simulation software based on the interest and observability of the experiment . Currently， relevant scholars have developed 3D simulation software， such as Guo Tiezheng et al. ， who implemented cricket system simulation experiments based on Unity3D， Xiong Yanfan et al. ， who discussed the application of VR technology in practical teaching， and Feng Jiao et al. ， who implemented flight simulation systems using the WebGL framework Three.js. Most of these 3D simulation software uses Unity3D，VR， and Three.js， with good results， However， using Unity3D  requires downloading and installation， while VR has a high cost of configuring hardware devices. In view of the application requirements of physical experiment simulation software， Three.js， which is lightweight， plug-in free， and can be directly run in a browser ， has become the best choice for developing physical virtual simulation software.\n\n【5】This article takes the classic experiment of fluid mechanics \"Saxon bowl sinking experiment\"as an example， and uses Three js to design and implement a virtual simulation system for physical experiments. This system breaks through the limitations of two-dimensional planes by constructing three-dimensional models， achieving three-dimensional and visualized full simulation of experimental equipment and experimental processes， truly simulating the interaction between teachers and students offline ， providing a series of interactive animations to complete simulation details， such as smooth control of object placement Error control when measuring inner and outer diameters with vernier calipers， etc.； Adding multiple tools to reduce experimental errors and providing multiple learning methods such as text， speech， and video greatly increases the interest and observability of the experiment， improving and enhancing teaching effectiveness.\n\n【6】Three.js Technology\n\n【7】Technical overview\n\n【8】The Three.js library is a 3D engine packaged and running based on native WebGL ， which is an application programming interface for generating 3D graphics effects on the Web. Three.js not only supports Canvas animation and CSS animation， but also supports more advanced physics-based rendering technology based on general 3D engines . It provides a set of simple solutions and practical built-in objects for creating 3D graphics. At the same time， it can quickly instantiate elements such as Scene， Light， Camera， and Renderer， greatly improving the development efficiency of 3D graphics during COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n【9】Workflow\n\n【10】The workflow of Three.js mainly includes four parts： creating a scene， configuring a scene， creating model objects， and rendering . The five main elements of 3D graphics rendering are： Scene， camera， object，light， and renderer . A scene is a three-dimensional space used to place models， lights， and cameras， which are then rendered using a renderer. Objects need to be presented through a camera to determine the observation position， direction， and angle， and to determine the final scene displayed on the display. Objects are three-dimensional models for display. Simple models can be created through Three.js built-in solutions， while complex models need to be modeled using professional 3D drawing software . Lights provide illumination for the scene， and different light sources and colors can be selected based on the scene effect. The function of the renderer is to render the created scene and the projections of three-dimensional objects observed by the camera on a two-dimensional plane， and present them to the browser .\n\n【11】Introduction to Saxon Bowl and Its Timing Principle\n\n【12】The Saxon bowl is a bowl with a perforated bottom， which is timed by observing the natural sinking of the bowl in water. In this paper， theoretical analysis of the relationship between the Saxon bowl sinking time and related physical parameters is conducted，and experimental simulation is established.\n\n【13】Assume that a bowl with a mass of m。 a thickness ofd， a height of h。 and a cross-sectional area of S holes at the bottom is placed in a liquid with an infinite width and a density of . When t=0， the bottom of the bowl is in contact with the liquid surface； At the time of t=t， the bowl mouth is flush with the outer liquid surface， and the physical process of the Saxon bowl sinking within the time period 0≤tsta is analyzed. By establishing a physical model and combining fluid mechanics processes， it is concluded that the settling time of the Saxon bowl in liquid is ：\n\n【14】Design of Saxon Bowl3DSimulation Experimental System\n\n【15】System architecture design\n\n【16】The simulation experiment platform adopts a hierarchical model： A presentation layer， an application layer， a business logic layer， a data access layer， and a database five-tier structure . The presentation layer is used to display system interfaces and experimental data， display simulation models， and provide interface services for the application layer. The business logic layer processes the system's business logic (rules， workflow， data integrity， etc.). The data access layer provides data.\n\n【17】3D animation design\n\n【18】The Saxon Bowl simulation experiment designed a series ofthree dimensional animations to simulate the real experimental process， and added interactive details of user operations， achieving human-computer interaction beyond the viewing level to enhance the user experience. For example， when measuring mass with a tray balance， the system will determine whether the user has placed items on the tray， and whether they have moved weights or weights， so as to control the left and right swing and placement position of the objects， in order to prevent model overlap and threading The vernier caliper will be opened and closed according to the user's operation； When measuring the density of a liquid with a densitometer， place it in the liquid to be measured and float up and down until it becomes stable； Liquid surface texture in a water tank simulates fluid flow； The Saxon bowl sinks， equipped with a movable bowl rack to ensure that the bowl is in a static state when it first touches the liquid level， and then sinks according to the sinking path simulated by the fitting curve.\n\n【19】During the process， the small hole in the bottom of the bowl flows liquid， and the liquid level in the bowl will rise accordingly.\n\n【20】Implementation of Saxon Bowl 3D Simulation Svstem\n\n【21】Construction of three-dimensional experimental environment\n\n【22】The experimental environment is an important link that affects the visual effect of virtual simulation experiments. In order to enhance the user's experience in experiments and restore the experimental scene of the laboratory Saxon Bowl experiment， it is necessary to build a 3D high-definition rendered virtual scene during COVID-19pandemic.\n\n【23】First， use the three coordinate axes x， y， and z in the scene created by three.js to form a simple virtual simulation experiment three-dimensional space ， laying the foundation for subsequent3D experimental equipment creation and experimental simulation effects. In order for the 3D model in the scene to also present a 3D effect in the human eye rather than a simple planar figure， it is also necessary to create a Perspective Camera that can adjust its own observation range， angle， and distance from the 3D model to make the model present different visual effects. The light sources in the scene can not only enhance the 3D feel of the model， but also highlight the material characteristics of the model. For example， applying a point light source to a tray balance can well highlight its metal texture. In order to meet the requirements similar to those of real experiments， the system strictly sets camera parameters to ensure the effectiveness of experimental equipment measurement data during simulation experiments. In addition， arranging scene lights can also give a three-dimensional sense of the environment. The core code is as follows：\n\n【24】Construction of three-dimensional experimental equipment\n\n【25】Modeling of three-dimensional experimental equipment is the foundation for implementing a three-dimensional simulation system for physical experiments， providing necessary materials for the construction of virtual scenes and the implementation of interactive behaviors20.\n\n【26】Firstly， select an appropriate method to construct 3D model components based on real physical equipment data. Components with regular shapes are constructed using a box (THREE. BoxGeometry)， a cylinder (THREE. CylinderGeometry)， a sphere(THREE. SphereGeometry)， and a cone (THREE. ConeGeometry). Components with irregular shapes need to first obtain data on each vertex of the component， use THREE. Vector3() to store the data， and place it in a vertex array， then， THREE.Face30 stores the triangular faces formed by connecting the vertices of the component， and places them in a triangular face array. Finally， the required components can be constructed using the above two arrays. After all components are built， use the intersection， union， and subtract components in the Three BSP plug-in library to assemble the 3D model. Taking a vernier caliper as an example， the modeling scheme is as follows：\n\n【27】Let scene，camera，ambientLight scene = new THREE.SceneO；//create a scene camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(x， width /height， 1000)；//create a Perspective Camera camera.position.set；//position the camera camera.lookAt(new THREE.Vector3)；//set camera observation point ambientLightt=InewTHREE.AmbientLight(0x606060)；//add light source scene.add(ambientLight)；//Adding Lights to a Scene The vernier caliper mainly consists of a ruler body， a depth ruler， a master ruler， a vernier ruler， an internal measuring claw， an external measuring claw， and fastening screws. The master ruler， ruler body， and depth ruler are selected as cuboids (THREE. BoxGeometry)，and the coordinates are placed or embedded in appropriate positions. For irregular shaped internal and external measuring claws， it is difficult to restore true vernier calipers using traditional geometric graphics. Now， it is possible to obtain the data of each vertex of this part through an array and store it. Then， use the connection function of THREE.Face3() to connect each vertex in the space， and finally combine the two parts of the space. The shape of the fastening screw is similar to the cylinder (THREE. CylinderGeometry) in the three.js library. We use the cylinder to construct its shape and place the figure in the appropriate position on the vernier caliper. The above process completes the basic construction of the vernier caliper equipment model，and then uses the THREE. TextureLoader texture map to add a scale to the vernier caliper .\n\n【28】Other experimental equipment such as tray scales， densitometers， and Saxon bowls all use the above modeling ideas. The parts with regular shapes use simple geometric graphics from the three.jslibrary， while the irregular parts use arrays to obtain vertex coordinates and construct them in space using aline method. Finally，the two parts are combined during COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n【29】Implementation of three-dimensional interactive behavior\n\n【30】Experimental simulation effect is an important factor affecting its practical value. In addition to presenting realistic visual effects and realistic experimental processes， rich and detailed interaction behavior is also a major factor affecting experimental simulation effect .\n\n【31】In the Saxon Bowl simulation experimental platform， the key to achieving interactive behavior is the interaction between a series of behaviors generated during user use and the coordinates of the model in the scene， thereby achieving manipulation of the model behavior. Due to the characteristics of the three.js runtime environment， using a mouse and keyboard is sufficient to change the X， Y，and Z coordinate values of the 3D model， completing all operations such as movingand rotating. By monitoring mouse and keyboard events during use， the model is bound to corresponding events. When the event is monitored and the corresponding event is triggered， the position of the model in three-dimensional space can be changed， achieving corresponding effects. This change in position is not constrained by the movement characteristics on the plane like 2D， and can achieve better 3D effects and experimental simulation effects during COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n【32】In the process of changing the position of a model， other models in the scene monitor their own coordinates and the model coordinates ofthe changed position in real time. Once the relationship between the two coordinates meets the coordinate relationship of the interaction conditions between the pre designed models， the two models will make the specified interaction behavior in time to achieve the ideal interaction effect. For example， during the process of manipulating experimental equipment to move and place it on a pallet balance tray， the system will calculate the distance between the coordinates of the experimental equipment and the monitoring area above the pallet balance tray in real time. When the monitoring area above the pallet is reached， the interaction condition between the experimental equipment and the balance is reached， and the balance and experimental equipment will tilt in the corresponding direction to achieve interaction during COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n【33】In order to present 3D interactive effects and enhance the immersive experience of user experimental operations， the renderer. render() in three.js is used to refresh the position of the models in the scene based on coordinates after a very short period of time， and change the virtual simulation scene in real time. Cooperate with a perspective camera and combine model coordinate changes to present different display effects， giving people a sense of realism and achieving realistic 3D interactive behavior.\n\n【34】Simulation system 3D effects\n\n【35】The Saxon Bowl Physics Experiment System is a software based on the B-S mode ， and its main interface is shown in Figure 4. By selecting the \"Experiment Introduction\"， \"Experiment Principle\"， or \"Start Experiment\" buttons， you can jump to the corresponding interface. The user can complete the experiment preview and operation in the measurement and simulation process display area of the four major parameters of mass， radius， density， and time， and fill in the experimental measurement data in a table to save during COVID-19 pandemic .\n\n【36】Conclusion\n\n【37】Aiming at the problem that the existing domestic physical experiment simulation software iss two-dimensional and lacks three-dimensional simulation software， this article takes the classic fluid mechanics experiment - Saxon bowl sinking experiment as an example， develops a fluid mechanics experiment simulation system based on Three.js， introduces 3D technology to achieve three-dimensional simulation effects， breaks through the limitations of two-dimensional software planarity， and greatly increases the interest and observability of the experiment.

There is reported significant negative association of semen volume， total sperm count， sperm motility， and morphology with advanced male partner’s age. Therefore， combination of the sperm preparation and assisted reproductive treatment were used for a better chance of pregnancy. This study was aimed to evaluate the in fluence of age on the sperm quality and pregnancy outcome in couple with subfertility undergoing Intrauterine Insemination (IUI).\n\n【2】Material and Methods： This retrospective cross-sectional study in vestigating 181 cases of IUI cycles from reproductive clinic of two public universities from January 2019 to December 2020. They were categorized into study group (male partner’s age 40 years and above) and control group (male partner’s age less than 40 years old). Sperm parameter reports were extracted from the patients records. Clinical pregnancy was the criteria for the IUI success.\n\n【3】Results： The mean age of male and female partners were similar in both groups. Sperm parameters showed an improvement after density gradient centrifugation sperm preparation with significant results in grade 1 and grade 3 sperm motility. There was no significant different in the clinical pregnancy between the groups.\n\n【4】Conclusion： There is an improvement in sperm parameters after density gradient centrifugation and the male age is not significantly affect the pregnancy outcome following IUI. Further study with larger sample is needed to confirm these findings.\n\n【5】Keywords： Density gradient centrifugation； Insemination； Paternal age； Pregnancy outcome； Semen analysis\n\n【6】Introduction\n\n【7】Lately， the topic of male infertility has been popularly discussed. A man who failed to produce high quality sperm in terms of density， motility and morphology is considered as infertile male. There are increase rates of infertility and adverse pregnancy outcomes seen after the age of 40 years old (independent of female partner’s age)， thus the male age factor might have some contribution to this matter， even though the spermatogenesis known to continue in elderly men， in contrast to oogenesis . From the literature， contribution to conception by male partner is still occur ev after 40 years of sexual maturity . But， degenerative changes in germinal epithelium occur with aging， causing Leydig cells to reduce in quantity and its function， thus affecting the spermatogenesis process due to decrease testosterone level， in which it starts at 30 years ofage . Studies suggest that male partner's age is associated with diminished semen volume， sperm motility and/or sperm morphology. Increasing seminal ROS levels and changes in epididymal and accessory sex gland function may be possible causative factors for the decline in motility with aging. Emergence idea of intrauterine insemination with sperm preparation has shown some improvement in semen parameters but with conflicting data. In this respect， our objective is to established evidence on influence of age on the sperm quality and effect of density gradient centrifugation on pregnancy outcome in infertile couple undergoing Intrauterine Insemination (IUI).\n\n【8】This was a retrospective cross-sectional study involving two university hospitals in Malaysia with fertility services. Completed one hundred and eighty-one IUI cycles from January 1， 2019 to December 31， 2020 were included in this study.\n\n【9】Couples who underwent IUI during the study period were enrolled in this study. Only the first IUI cycle of the couples were included in the study.\n\n【10】The inclusion criteria were as follow： Men age between 18 to 70years old， with semen analysis results either normal or one， or two of the sperm parameters were below the normal value established by the WHO . The semen parameters are the sperm count， sperm motility with characterized into Grade 1 (rapid and slow linear progressive motility)， Grade 2 (non-progressive motility) and Grade 3 (immotile spermatozoa). The female partner had regular menstrual cycle， normal pelvic ultrasound findings and at least one fallopian tube patent in hysteroscopy or laparoscopy dye insufflation test.\n\n【11】The exclusion criteria were including men with azoospermia， femalepartnerwith endometriosis，polycystic ovarian syndrome，poor ovarian responder， or premature ovarian insufficiency. Incomplete data on pre- and post-processing semen analysis or missing data regarding the pregnancy outcome were also being excluded.\n\n【12】All the data such as age of the couple， duration of infertility， semen analysis parameters before and after sperm processing， and the IUI results were obtained from the patient’s records. Pregnancy was defined as positive serum beta Human Chorionic Gonadotropin(b-HCG) taken at 14 days after IUI followed by presence of the fetal heart activity after 6 weeks period of a menorrhea.\n\n【13】The eligible couple were stratified into two groups according to the male partner’s age - study group (male partner’s age 40 years and above) and control group (male partner's age less than 40 years old). The semen parameters and pregnancy outcome were compared between the groups.\n\n【14】Semen sample collection and preparation for IUI\n\n【15】Semen samples were collected from the male partners following2 to 5 days of sexual abstinence by masturbation in sterile plastic containers at the clinic. Liquefaction was performed at roor temperature for 30 min. The initial analysis of the semen parameters(semen volume， sperm count， and sperm motility) was performed manually according to WHO guidelines  .\n\n【16】Subsequently the semen samples were processed using the density gradient centrifugation to remove seminal fluid and enhance sperm quality for IUI. The total volume of semen was divided so that a 15-ml conical tube marked with patient's identification would contain2 ml of a 90% density lower layer， 2 ml of a 45% density upper layer， and 2 ml of semen upper most layer. A gentle and careful move was required to ensure the layers were not mixed-up at each centrifugal stage. The sample was then centrifuged at 1，500 rpm for 20 min at Room Temperature (RT). After centrifugation， the supernatant was removed and the spermatozoa (pellet) was placed into another 15-ml conical tube， which contained 2.0 ml of sperm rinsing medium and mixed thoroughly； it was then centrifuged at 1，500 rpm for 10 min at room temperature. The supernatant was again removed， and the final pellet was suspended in the same medium solution， obtaining a final volume of 0.5 ml. A 10-ul aliquot was used to perform the analysis of post-processing seminal parameters. The motility of spermatozoa in the sample determined and incubated sample at 37°C until ready for insemination. The Makler counting chamber was used to assess the count and motility and the processed sample in the best possible way. The sample was ensured to maintain its temperature at 37°Cby placing it in a test tube warmer before IUI procedure.\n\n【17】Ovulation induction and insemination\n\n【18】Standard protocol was used involving administration of 100 mg clomiphene citrate from the second day of menstruation for five days and injection of human menopausal gonadotropins (75 IU to 150IU) on day five onwards up to day ten of menstruation， either daily or every other day. When at least one follicle achieved more than 17mm， intramuscular HCG 10，000 IU was given for final maturation. Single insemination was done at thirty-six hours later with 0.5 mL to 1.0 mL of processed sperm from the fresh semen sample， injected intrauterine using a Gynetics catheter. After the insemination the patient was lying in the supine position for 15 min to 30 min. Oral dydrogesterone 10 mg three times daily was prescribed for the luteal phase support.\n\n【19】Statistical analysis\n\n【20】The Statistical Package for Social Sciences for Windows  was used to record and analyzed the data. Quantitative variables were compared using Mann-Whitney test and the results were expressed as mean ± Standard Deviation (SD) and percentage. Categorical variables were evaluated using the Chi-squareand Fisher's exact test. A p-value of less than 0.05 is considered as statistically significant.\n\n【21】Results\n\n【22】A total of 181 of IUI cycles， from January 15， 2019 and December31，2020， were analyzed. The mean (± Standard Deviation， SD) age of male and female partner included in this analysis were similar for each group. Majority of the indication for the IUI was unexplained infertility .\n\n【23】Table 2 showed the results of sperm parameters of the two studied groups. As can be noted， there was no difference of sperm parameters among the male partner with different age groups. There was an improvement in the sperm concentration and Grade 1 sperm motility after the DGC， however not statistically significant. In the study group (male age 40 years and above)， there is significant increment in the grade 1 sperm motility and significant reduction of immotile sperm after GDC as illustrated in Table 3. Regarding the successful pregnancy， there was also no significant difference of the semen parameters between the studied group . The number of pregnancies was higher in group of male partner less than 40years old， compared with older age male partner，however， it was not statistically significant .\n\n【24】Discussion\n\n【25】Semen fluid analysis is the first step in the evaluation of male infertility. Semen characteristics that being evaluated includes the volume， sperm concentration， sperm motility， and sperm morphology. The standard value of semen analysis that is accepted by the World Health Organization (WHO) 2010 is the volume of1.5 mL， pH of 7.2， sperm concentration of 20 million/mL or more， total motility (progressive and non-progressive) of 40%， and normal sperm morphology of 4% .\n\n【26】There was an association between male age and sperm parameters in the literature. Decrease in sperm quantity except for concentration was more compelling among men aged 30 to 50 years old . A similar study by Stone et al. affirmed that decrease in semen parameter starts at the age of 34 and it postulated to affect the pregnancy status . In conjunction， study in Central India by classified age 36 to 42 as under the 3d group in a five-age class (21 to 60 years) that is relates with the decline in semen parameters and it is significant when the individual is after the age of 35. Meanwhile， Gao et al. revealed a significant association between the increasing age and a drop in sperm quantity and quality based on 7-age groups among men aged25 to 51 . The large dispersion also believed to derive this smaller number of groupings to elucidate age as factors in differentiating the sperm counts. This study showed better sperm motility of the younger male compared to the older male who aged more than 40years old. Therefore， testing the subjects with different age level may validate the influence of age on semen parameters at certain degree of comparison.\n\n【27】Table 1： Demographic characteristics.\n\n| Variables  | Male 40 years and above N=31  | Male less than 40 years N=150  | p value  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Age， mean ± SD  |  |  |  |\n| Male  | 43.32±3.15  | 33.60±3.35  | <0.01  |\n| Female  | 38.39±2.79  | 33.08±3.86  | <0.01  |\n| Indication of IUI，N(%)  |  |  |  |\n| Anovulation  | 5(16.13)  | 30(20.00)  |  |\n| Tubal factor  | 6(19.35)  | 8(5.33)  |  |\n| Unexplained infertility  | 11(35.48)  | 68(45.34)  |  |\n| Male factor  | 7(22.58)  | 30(20.00)  |  |\n| Recurrent miscarriage  | 1(3.23)  | 0  |  |\n| Discordant couple  | 0  | 3(2.00)  |  |\n| Others (ED， vaginismus)  | 1(3.23)  | 11(7.33)  |  |\n\n【29】IUl： Intrauterine Insemination； ED： Erectile Dysfunction\n\n【30】Table 2： Sperm parameters of the between two different male age group.\n\n| Sperm parameters  | Male 40 vears and above N=31  | Male less than 40 yearsN=150  | p value  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Sperm concentration (x10)， mean ± SD  | 73.19±46.64  | 69.96±52.23  | 0.75  |\n| Motility G1 (%)， mean ± SD  | 41.12±16.74  | 41.74±21.39  | 0.86  |\n| Motility G2 (%)，mean ± SD  | 17.61±8.28  | 21.44±11.71  | 0.85  |\n| Motility G3 (%)， mean ± SD  | 41.14±18.56  | 36.93±18.92  | 0.26  |\n\n【32】G1： Grade 1 (progressive rapid and slow linear)， G2： Grade 2 (non-progressive linear)， G3： Grade 3 (immotile)\n\n【33】Table 3： The effect of Density Gradient Centrifugation (DGC) on sperm parameters of each group.\n\n| Semen parameters  | Male 40 years and above， N=31  |  |  | Male less than 40 years，N=150  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Semen parameters  | Pre-DGC  | Post-DGC  | p value  | Pre-DGC  | Post-DGC  | p value  |\n| Sperm concentration (x10)， mean ± SD  | 73.19±46.64  | 78.74±61.41  | 0.60  | 69.96±52.23  | 87.47±70.81  | <0.01  |\n| Motility G1 (%)，mean ± SD  | 41.12±16.74  | 77.50±14.41  | <0.01  | 41.74±21.39  | 77.46±19.89  | <0.01  |\n| Motility G2 (%)， mean ± SD  | 17.61±8.28  | 13.11±10.93  | 0.03  | 21.44±11.71  | 13.87±12.60  | <0.01  |\n| Motility G3 (%)， mean ± SD  | 41.14±18.56  | 8.92±5.21  | <0.01  | 36.93±18.92  | 8.64±12.07  | <0.01  |\n\n【35】G1： Grade 1 (progressive rapid and slow linear)， G2： Grade 2 (non-progressive linear)， G3： Grade 3 (immotile)\n\n【36】Table 4： Semen parameters between the groups with successful pregnancy after Density Gradient Centrifugation (DGC).\n\n| sperm parameters  | Male 40 years and aboveN=3  | Male less than 40 yearsN=6  | p value  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Sperm concentration (x109)， mean ±SD  | 64.33±59.80  | 80.47±110.19  | 0.82  |\n| Motility G1， mean ± SD  | 55.43±30.91  | 86.35±16.16  | 0.08  |\n| Motility G2， mean ± SD  | 29.57±28.65  | 3.6±2.10  | 0.26  |\n| Motility G3， mean± SD  | 15.00±3.22  | 8.4±16.38  | 0.53  |\n\n【38】G1： Grade 1 (progressive rapid and slow linear)， G2： Grade 2 (non-progressive linear)， G3： Grade 3 (immotile)\n\n【39】Table 5： Reproductive outcome of intrauterine insemination procedure between the groups.\n\n| Reproductive outcome  | Male 40 vears and above N=31  | Male less than 40 vearsN=150  | p value  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Pregnancy  | 3  | 6  | 0.19  |\n| No pregnancy  | 28  | 144  | 0.19  |\n\n【41】Most of the finding showed an increase of the mean value in the count and motility. The significant difference was obtained in the study mostly in the post DGC for Grade 3 motility (immotile sperm) suggesting positive effect of DGC on semen motility. Density gradient is the preferred technique for sperm processing for ART as it improved sperm motility and quality . This study also highlighted the higher chance of pregnancy in female with the male partner who aged less than 40 years old， control group (3.3%) compared to female with male partner aged more than 40 years old. It showed that as the age of the couple grows older， the likelihood of pregnancy decreases， and most studies link aging to a drop in sperm parameters .\n\n【42】On a separate note， Dong et al. concluded that chances of pregnancy from IUI decreases as semen sample contained lower than 2 million motile sperm . Thus， other studies specified that pregnancy from IUI is more probable with the existing of linear progressive motile among pairings with subfertility male with the higher likelihood of pregnancy from larger counts of post-prepared sperm with greater motility in IUI . In addition， Ajayi et al. suggested than men with lower sperm counts had a 4 times higher likelihood to develop progressive sperm motility than men with normal sperm counts . Somehow， Ombelet et al. reviewed that studies should consider association of sperm parameters with other factors that may determine the success of IUI such as female age and period of subfertility. In addition， they iterate that prediction on pregnancy rate is acceptable yet considered as poor in sensitivity as comparison made with standardized limit sperm counts classing. Perhaps this study may output to different significance if sperm counts categorized in to non-parametric groupings for comparison with the nominal measure of pregnancy status. For the time being， this study suggests that IUI has done effectively in ensuring pregnancy from samples with lower sperm counts from pre-processed total or from post-processed non-progressive spermatozoa that originates from men below 40 years old. On the other side， female may conceive offspring in relation with lower counts of motile sperm or higher counts of immotile sperm after the post wash procedures conducted for semen samples of men aged 40 and above .\n\n【43】Readings of bHCG level recorded pregnancy outcome either pregnant or not were insignificantly correlated with male age group as a result from IUI denoted from Fisher's Exact Test p-value of 0.185. This hypothesis in several manner is consistent with findings from other study with differing fertilization procedures that remarks male age as not a defining factors of pregnancy rates or outcome . On the other hand， Tatsumi et al. described age among men does not correlate with pregnancy outcome， yet simulation from IUI revealed women at the age of 38 to 40 years old as the sole factor influencing chances of pregnancy .\n\n【44】Conclusion\n\n【45】In conclusion， similar semenparameters andcomparable pregnancy outcome was seen among couples with male partner's age below and above 40 years old. There was an improvement in sperm parameters after density gradient centrifugation which may involve in the achievement of pregnancy following IUI. This study is limited to sperm count and motility without analysis of morphology and sperm DNA， therefore further study with these added sperm parameters and larger sample could be considered in the future study.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 11:31:04", "endTime": "2024/09/24 11:31:46", "cost": 41.62}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:35", "update_time": "2024-09-23 19:31:46", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 19:31:04"}

Alzheimer's disease as a frequent neurodegenerative condition of the geriatric population demonstrates an estimated prevalence of 36.5 million in the Western world. Alzheimer's disease chiefly affects the brain although retina is often incriminated and typically displays a significant impairment of retinal neurovascular coupling. Degenerative alterations within the retinal ganglion incumbent to Alzheimer’s disease can be appropriately analyzed in order to categorize the incipient neurodegenerative process. As neuronal modifications are predominant in Alzheimer’s disease and mild cognitive impairment， cogent neuropathology and neuroimaging investigations can be beneficially employed to depict alterations arising within the adjacent， associated cerebral microvasculature .\n\n【4】Mild cognitive impairment depicts an enhanced probable emergence of Alzheimer’s disease. Thus， adequate clinical characterization ofthe disease is crucial with theenunciation of contemporary diagnostic parameters which indicate the transition of mild cognitive impairment to full blown Alzheimer's disease. Alzheimer’s disease is accompanied by minimizing of blood circulation within the deep-seated vascular plexus. Specific criterion of evaluating retinal vasculature can deliver significant information and provide beneficial biomarkers for assessing the preliminary or final diagnosis， monitoring transition of mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer’s disease or to predict disease progression .\n\n【5】Disease characteristics\n\n【6】Vascular alterations， as an intrinsic component or a coexistent pathology， can interrelate with pathogenic manifestations of Alzheimer’s disease such as neurodegeneration along with cognitive impairment in order to constitute the “vascular cognitive impairmentmanifestation. Pathological symptoms of the implicated vasculature are enunciated in around three fourths (75%) subjects with dementia. Vascular alterations are comprised of White Matter Hyper-intensities (WMHs) which appear on account of chronic ischemia of the sub cortical region with incrimination of miniature blood vessels， infarcts within vessels of higher calibre， appearance of lacunar infarcts as in the thalamus， coexistent arteriosclerosis and atherosclerosis and proportionate instances of Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy (CAA) . Intravascular deposition of Amyloid Beta (AB) within the vessel wall is exemplified as cerebral amyloid angiopathy， a process which is accompanied by micro-hemorrhages and micro-infarcts. CAA demonstrates an incidence of roughly 20% to 40% within the non-demented elderly and approximately 50% to 60% in the demented geriatric population. Alzheimer's disease is intensely concurrent with cerebral amyloid angiopathy and can be discerned in a majority (85% to 95%) instances.\n\n【7】Disease pathogenesis\n\n【8】Declining cerebral blood flow and relevant modifications of the blood-brain barrier are incriminated in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer’s disease in association with a probable inopportune clearance of Amyloid Beta (AB) protein. Retina is contemplated as a pertinent generator of vascular biomarkers which can indicate the emergence of Alzheimer's disease. Retinal vasculature can be subjected to noninvasive imaging at miniature， micro-meter levels with various imaging modalities such as fund us photography， assessment of choroidal thickness with Enhanced Depth Imaging Optical Coherence Tomography (EDI-OCT) and Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography(OCTA) . Alzheimer’s disease is a complex disorder and enunciates multifactorial aetiologies. Several factors are implicated in disease pathogenesis and progression and preliminary factors significantly contribute to a continuum of the deteriorative process. Aberrant， entangled Amyloid Beta (AB) protein filaments and hyper-phosphorylated tau protein are aggregated into cogent neurofibrillary tangles. Accumulation of aforesaid debris can initiate a cascade of secondary manifestations such as inflammation， oxidative stress， vascular abnormalities or neuronal decimation. Disorganized miniature vascular structures of the brain are incumbent in the pathological evolution of Alzheimer’s disease and mild cognitive impairment. Aforesaid neurodegenerative conditions are accompanied by preliminary neurovascular dysfunction and a consequently dysregulated vascular flow which contributes to disease pathogenesis. Assessment of vascular density of peripheral ring of the macula along with cogent scoring of white matter hyper-intensities can be achieved with magnetic resonance imaging in Alzheimer’s disease . Functional modifications appear as a preliminary reaction and commonly precede decimation of retinal neurons.\n\n【9】Proportion of Amyloid Beta (AB) protein exemplified in cerebrospinal fluid is concordant to degree of arterial dilatation. Elevatedlevels ofamyloid beta inthe cerebrospinalfluid are concurrent with superior neurovascular coupling. Percentage of vascular amyloid beta in combination with neurofibrillary morphological abnormalities are inversely concordant with Amyloid Beta (AB) and directly interrelated to phosphorylated- tau protein values within the cerebrospinal fluid. Thus， marked protein accumulation in the brain and retina can directly influence neurovascular coupling .\n\n【10】Confirmed instances of Alzheimer's disease can be denominated with specific biomarkers such as amyloid deposits discerned on Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scan. Additionally， Fractal Dimension of arteriolar network (FDa)， Central Retinal Vein Equivalent (CRVE)， Central Retinal Artery Equivalent (CRAE)， fractal dimension of venular network， Curvature Tortuosity of arterioles (cTORTa)， choroidal thickness， vessel density， Foveolar a Vascular Zone (FAZ) and curvature tortuosity of venules can be assessed in Alzheimer’s disease. Instances of primary vascular aetiology or the concurrence of a vascular co-pathology instead of features of Alzheimer's disease require demarcation. Alzheimer's disease contingent to amyloid deposition can depict alterations as detected with clinical， neuroimaging and fluid-based biomarkers. Variable choroidal thinning is cogitated on Enhanced Depth Imaging Optical Coherence Tomography (EDI-OCT) . Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography (OCTA) employed for assessing dimensions of vascular density in amyloid-deposited Alzheimer's disease or within the Foveolar a Vascular Zone (FAZ) is identical in preclinical and clinical disease.\n\n【11】Tortuosity of venules is inversely concurrent with scoring of white matter hyper-intensities as discerned with Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Inverse correlation of macular vessel density and white matter hyper-intensities score in Alzheimer's disease can indicate modifications within the microvasculature as cogitated in chronic cerebral micro-infarctions. However， concurrence of parameters of retinal vascular assessment to indicative biomarkers of cerebrovascular fluid or Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) is lacking .\n\n【12】Clinical elucidation\n\n【13】A transitional phase of variable duration precedes the clinical emergence of symptomatic Alzheimer’s disease. Implicated geriatric individuals display a heterogeneous cognitive andfunctional impairment usually defined as beneath the symptomatic threshold of dementia. Aforesaid manifestation is denominated as“mild cognitive impairment”where incriminated subiects demonstrate an enhanced possible emergence of dementia， particularly Alzheimer’s disease.\n\n【14】The dementia characteristically depicts a severe decline of cognitive functions with ensuing socio-behavioral manifestations. Individuals with Alzheimer's disease can delineate symptoms such as visual impairment， narrowed visual field， dyschromatopsia， deficiency in contrast sensitivity， aberrant eye motility and modifications of visual- evoked potentials .\n\n【15】Histological elucidation\n\n【16】Alzheimer’s disease demonstrates a decline in quantification of retinal ganglion cells and associated axons within the retinal nerve fiber layer. Reduction of retinal ganglion cells are contingent to occurrence of extracellular plaques and accompanying intracellular deposition of Amyloid Beta (AB) as enunciated within the retina of individuals with Alzheimer’s disease. Ganglion cell layer is attenuated within central and temporal regions in Alzheimer’s disease as discerned with Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT). Centric zone of the retina within the dimension of 0 mm to 2 mm is majorly(97%) composed of neurons and residual (3%) is constituted by displaced amacrine cells. Alzheimer’s disease maximally implicates the segment of retinal ganglion cells， designated as M-cells， which are principally aggregated within the temporal macula .\n\n【17】Amyloid Beta (AB) protein is aggregated within and surrounding the cerebral blood vessels， the circulation of which is challenging to investigate in vivo. Thus， evaluation of retinal micro-vasculature as a determinant of Alzheimer's disease is adopted although assessment of disease progression is limited. Retinal vessels can be considered as surrogate indicators of cerebral microcirculation， thus histological elucidation and imaging studies are beneficial.\n\n【18】Functional reaction of retinal vessels， as a component of cognitive impairment， is observed in Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment. Investigation with Dynamic Vessel Analyzer (DVA) demonstrates a characteristic response curve to flicker light impulse on account of primary vasodilation and secondary vasoconstriction， as exemplified in the aforesaid disorders. Vasodilation occurs as a consequence of stimulation of photoreceptors with a subsequently enhanced retinal blood circulation. The process which mediates aforementioned vascular response is denominated as “neurovascular coupling”. Representation and amplitude of the typical biphasic response can categorically indicate the quality of auto-regulation. Comprehensive reduction of vessel response can significantly impact arterial vasodilation. As cerebral and retinal micro-circulation is reduced in Alzheimer’s disease， chronic hypo-perfusion can impair endothelial function along with production of nitric acid， which is critical for vasodilation.Declining vascular response arises on account of enhanced rigidity of retinal arteries and cerebral vasculature in Alzheimer’s disease in addition to a characteristically thickened basement membrane. Diminishing vascular response can also be secondary to neuronal degeneration with a consequently decreased metabolic requirement  .\n\n【19】In vestigative Assay\n\n【20】Although miniature cerebral vessel disease is incriminated in the generation of Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment， assessment of cerebral microcirculation is a challenging task. Cerebral and retinal vasculature is identical in embryology， origin anatomical and physiological properties. Thus， evaluation of retinal vessels can provide insights into the generation of Alzheimer’s disease and mild cognitive impairment. Functional and morphological characteristics of retinal vessels are contemplated as cogent indicators of disease progression. Decisive descriptions are contingent to fund us photography and contemporary techniques which permit pertinent， topographic， qualitative assay and quantitative assessment of magnitude of retinal vessels at varying levels of depth- resolution. Microvascular networks of retina， as discerned with uninvolved and disease-specific state， can be assayed with devices such as Dynamic Vessel Analyzer (DVA) and Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography (OCTA). However， evaluation of extensive functional and morphological characteristics of macular microvasculature in Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment is currently lacking. OpticalCoherenceTomography Angiography(OCTA) delineates adequate morphological characterization of retinal and anterior choroidal blood vessels in the absence of a dye. Employment of OCTA demonstrates a superior depth resolution， superlative visualization of deep-seated vascular layers besides an amplified vascular elucidation of diverse ocular and systemic disorders. A competent Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) can be contemplated as a contemporary biomarker is discerning vascular alterations characteristic of Alzheimer's disease. Vascular alterations can also be assessed with recently elucidated biomarkers which can complement the currently applicable system designated as Amyloid(A)， Tau (T) and Neurodegeneration (N) or the ATN system . Retinal vascular alterations of Alzheimer’s disease， as described with fund us photography， comprise of enhanced venous diameter， reduced arterial diameter and a decline in the fractional dimension. Additionally，choroidal thinning enhanced Foveolar Avascular Zone(FAZ) with a declining vessel density and blood flow is cogitated in clinical and preclinical Alzheimer's disease.\n\n【21】Ophthalmological enuinciation of associated， usually asymptomatic co-morbid conditions can impact retinal vascular magnitude. Thus， a comprehensive ophthalmological screening is recommended. Evaluation of retinal biomarkers in categorical instances of Alzheimer’s disease exemplify as cortical atrophy and occurrence of amyloid and tau protein in the cerebrospinal fluid. Also， application of amyloid Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scan can endorse the clinical diagnosis and permit comparison of contemporary biomarkers to existing “gold standards”. Non invasive retinal vascular biomarkers for assaying Alzheimer's disease are constitutedbyenhanced CentralRetinalArteryEquivalent(CRAE)， reduced Central Retinal Vein Equivalent (CRVE)， diminished fractal dimension， minimal choroidal thickness， minimized vessel density and augmented Foveolar a Vascular Zone (FAZ). Interrelation of retinal vascular parameters with white matter hyper-intensities can also be examined with magnetic resonance imaging. Retinal vascular parameters are evaluated by fund us photography， EDI-OCT and OCTA. Subjects undergo a concurrent， standardized screening comprising of a comprehensive medical history， neuropsychological examination， assessment of Apolipoprotein E e4/e4 (APOE e4/e4) genotype， blood pressure， neuroimaging and lumbar puncture for examining the cerebrospinal fluid . Magnetic Resonance Imaging(MRI) can be visually scored for atrophic changes as cogitated upon T1-weighted images and are denominated as medial temporal lobe atrophy， global cortical atrophy and parietal cortical atrophy. Assessment of retinal vasculature in concurrence with white matter hyper-intensities， lacunar infarcts and micro-bleeds can be discerned.\n\n【22】Evaluation of cerebrospinal1fluidwithhEnzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) for the detection of amyloid beta 1-42(AB1-42)， tau 181 and phosphorylated Tau (pTau) can be achieved. The proportion of tau 181 to amyloid beta 1-42 commonly exceeds0.52 in definitive Alzheimer's disease .\n\n【23】Positron Emission Analysis (PET) scan for vascular deposition of amyloid can be assessed with cogent tracers and visually interpreted as amyloid reactive or amyloid non reactive.\n\n【24】Ophthalmological assessment is required for screening and a subsequentcorrection ofvisualacuity，assayofintraocularpressureand slit lamp examination ofanterior and posterior segment. Occurrence of specific diseases mandate an exclusion from examination such as severe cataract， age-specific macular degeneration， glaucoma and diabetes mellitus .\n\n【25】Vascular imaging of the retina can be achieved with fund us photography， Enhanced Depth Imaging Optical Coherence Tomography (EDI-OCT) and Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography (OCTA). Central Retinal Artery Equivalent (CRAE)， Central Retinal Vein Equivalent (CRVE)， arteriole-to-venule ratio， Fractal Dimensions of arteriolar network (FDa)， fractal dimension ofvenular network， curvature Tortuosity of arterioles (cTORTa) and curvature tortuosity of venules necessitate an appropriate assessment.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 11:24:20", "endTime": "2024/09/24 11:24:46", "cost": 25.649}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:35", "update_time": "2024-09-23 19:24:46", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 19:24:20"}

Simultaneous primary adenoid cystic carcinoma and invasive ductal carcinoma of the unilateral breast are even rarer. We report a case of mammary associated cases in a 66-year-old woman. Pathological findings adenoid cystic carcinoma at 4 points in left breast. Thisis grade 3 infiltrating ductal carcinoma which is the molecular subtype basal-like in the left breast at 2 points. No cancer tissue was found at each incisal margin during intraoperative examination. Thepatient underwent breast conserving surgery on the left side and received postoperative chemotherapy. After 18 months of follow-up visits， there was no evidence of recurrence or new progress. By reviewing related disease literature， summarizing clinicopathological features， combining with characteristic morphological，immunophenotype and molecular genetic characteristics， identification of lesions similar to histomorphology and exploring experience in diagnosis and treatment.\n\n【2】Keywords： Breast cancer； Adenoid cystic carcinoma； Infiltrating ductal carcinoma\n\n【3】Case Presentation\n\n【4】Thepatient， a 66-year-old female， was admitted to the hospital as \"left breast mass was found 20days after physical examination . There was no redness，swelling and pain in the breast， no sunken nipple， no orange skin change， and no nipple discharge. Color Doppler ultrasound showed that there was a 16 mmx11 mmx12 mmhypoechoic nodules (BI-RADS Class of 4C) in the left breast at2 points about 50 mm away from the nipple and11mm away from the skin . Hypoechoic nodules (BI-RADS Class of 3) about 6 mm x 5mmx5 mm in size can be seen at 4 points of the left breast . Ultrasound-guided puncture biopsy is recommended. The patient was treated in the nail milk surgery department， and underwent molybdenum target and other preoperative examinations， followed by left unilateral mammary gland modified radical resection and left axillary lymphatic dissection， meanwhile conducting intraoperative rapid frozen pathological examination.\n\n【5】Pathological Examination\n\n【6】Intraoperative rapid freezing examination：  (4 points of the left breast) a piece of grayish yellow tissue， 2.0 cm x 1.5 cm x 1 cm in size， a gray nodule， 0.8 cm x0.5 cm x 0.5 cm in size， was visible on the section， clearly demarcated from the surrounding tissue， medium texture and a piece was taken by freezing .

He received 8 cycles of AC-T chemotherapy in the early stage of triple negative invasive ductal carcinoma， followed by local radiotherapy. Follow up until Tune 2022 showed no tumor recurrence or metastasis.\n\n【16】Discussion\n\n【17】Adenoid cystic carcinoma of breast is a rare and special type of breast cancer ， the incidence of which accounts for about 0.1% of all breast malignancies ， and the patients are mostly elderly women. In 2012， WHO classification of breast tumors was defined as breast cancer with low malignant potential， morphologically similar to adenoid cystic carcinoma occurring in salivary glands， which can be cured by simple mastectomy . Adenoid cystic carcinoma was classified into rare tumors and salivary gland tumors in the fift edition of WHO classification of breast tumors published in 2019， and its diagnosis was consistent with that of adenoid cystic carcinoma of the salivary gland . Invasive ductal carcinoma is the most common type of invasive breast cancer without specific types. It is extremely rare for both of them to be independently and originally from unilateral breast cancer. In the process of domestic literature review， only a case of bilateral primary breast cancer with unilateral adenoid cystic carcinoma reported by Xiao Xuewen et al. was found ， and a case of mixed adenoid cystic carcinoma and ductal carcinoma of breast cancer reported by Kontos et al. was found in foreign literature search . In addition， individual cases of adenoid cystic carcinoma mixed with small cell carcinoma  and spindle cell melanoma  were reviewed and analyzed. Independent primary adenoid cystic carcinoma and invasive ductal carcinoma of the same breast were rarely reported.\n\n【18】Thehistological characteristics ofbreast adenoid cystic carcinoma in frozen sections are often not obvious， and due to the limitations of frozen material extraction and production， it is often difficul to distinguish it from other benign and malignant breast tumors，leading to misdiagnosis. Among the 8 cases of adenoid cystic carcinoma of the breast reported by Liu Yufei et al. ， 5 cases underwent intraoperative rapid freezing examination，and only 1 case was clearly diagnosed. This case of intraoperative freezing was also a tumor with a descriptive cribriform and trabecular tubular arrangement， which was not clearly diagnosed； when the tumor mainlypresents as a sieve-like structure， the following types need to be identified：  Invasive sieve-like carcinoma： An invasive carcinoma with a significant sieve-like structure， often accompanied by tubular carcinoma components， with mucoprotein secretions and dead bodies visible in the sieve pores. The tumor cells lack neoplastic myoepithelial cells， mainly glandular epithelial cells， with immunohistochemical ER and PR positive， and CD117 and myoepithelial markers negative. Adenoid cystic carcinoma exhibits invasive growth and heterogeneous tissue structure. Tubular， trabecular， and ethmoidal structures， as well as basement membrane like or mucoid substances in the lumen， are important clues for diagnosis. Morphological glandular epithelial cells are mixed with myoepithelial and basal like cells， with typical immunohistochemical ER and PR negative， and positive staining for CD117， myoepithelial Calponin， and p63 are helpful for differential diagnosis；  Sieve shaped ductal carcinoma in situ： Intraductal lesions in which the glandular epithelium exhibits a sieve shaped neoplastic proliferation. The tumor cells are relatively consistent and both ER and PR are diffusely positive. Myoepithelial cells exist around the duct， and myoepithelial cells such as p63，Calponin， and SMA are positive， while CD117 is negative， which is helpful for differential diagnosis.\n\n【19】The main diseases that need to be differentiated from invasive ductal carcinoma include  sclerosing adenopathy： A tubular adenopathy with lobular hyperplasia accompanied by fibrosis and sclerotic interstitial hyperplasia that constitutes a pathological change in the conscience， but its gland/tubule compression is obvious， making it difficul to identify the double layer cellular structure， and its growth pattern is similar to nerve invasion， especially in intraoperative rapid freezing and biopsy of small specimens， which is difficul to distinguish. Diagnosis needs to be very careful， and can be made with the help of calponin immunohistochemical staining of muscle epithelium such as p63 was used to label the remaining lobular structures on the muscle epithelia to assist in diagnosis.  Invasive lobular carcinoma： The classic type often presents a private like or target circular arrangement， and the atypical morphology of the two often overlaps， making it difficul to distinguish. Immunohistochemistry P120 and E-cadherin can be used to assist in the differential diagnosis： Both invasive ductal carcinomas are positive for cell membrane； the cytoplasm of lobular carcinoma P120was positive， while E-cadherin was negative.\n\n【20】In differential diagnosis， it can be seen that immunohistochemical CD117 can be specifically expressed in adenoid cystic carcinoma， mainly related to regulatory genes. Research has found that C-KIT is one of the downstream genes regulated by MYB， and C-KIT mutations can be detected in adenoid cystic carcinoma at different sites such as salivary gland and breast， and their protein products express CD117 . At the same time， the literature suggests that about half of adenoid cystic carcinoma is accompanied by the MYB-NFIB fusion gene， but the use of the C-KIT targeted drug imatinib has poor efficac in treating adenoid cystic carcinoma ， So the treatment is still primarily surgical. The treatment of invasive ductal carcinoma has shifted from surgery+hormone+neoadjuvant treatment to neoadjuvant treatment+surgical treatment， provided that HER2 testing is positive and trastuzumab can be used for targeted treatment.\n\n【21】In summary， simultaneous independent primary adenoid cystic carcinoma and invasive ductal carcinoma of the unilateral breast are extremely rare， with unique histomorphology，immunohistochemical characteristics， and biological behavior. It is necessary to accumulate case summary diagnosis and treatment experience.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 10:41:21", "endTime": "2024/09/24 10:41:57", "cost": 36.421}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:35", "update_time": "2024-09-23 18:41:57", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 18:41:20"}

However，the suitability of RMT for patients with different characteristics and different severity of COPD is unknown. We investigated the effectiveness of home-based RMT in three patients with COPD with different characteristics， including symptoms of respiratory diseases， dynamic hyperinflation， and respiratory muscle weakness， and who presented with varying degrees of COPD severity from COPD Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) grades II to IV. The three patients underwent home-based RMT therapy. They all continued to take existing medication and performed RMT exercises for 8 weeks with a target respiratory muscle training load of 50% of each participant's maximum respiratory muscle strength. Data on dyspnea sensation， Quality of Life (QoL)， respiratory muscle strength， pulmonary function， 6-Min Walk Distance (6MWD)， and diaphragm excursion were collected. The patient with symptoms of respiratory diseases improved the most as indicated by a decrease in dyspnea sensation during activity and an improvement in diaphragm excursion at rest. The patient with dynamic hyperinflation had an increase in the changed of inspiratory capacity and the 6MWD. The patient with respiratory muscle weakness had an improved QoL. Further studies should be performed with larger sample sizes.\n\n【2】Keywords： Respiratory muscle training； Symptoms of respiratory diseases；IDynamic hyperventilation； Respiratory muscle weakness； Diaphragm sonography； COPD\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】COPD has an estimated prevalence rate of 6.1% in the general population in Taiwan . Rochester showed that generalized muscle weakness in patients with COPD contributes to low inspiratory muscle strength next to hyperinflation . Furthermore， Maximum Inspiratory Pressure (MIP) is known to be impaired by hyperinflation due to shortening of the inspiratory muscles . Total Lung Capacity (TLC) is calculated according to lung volume-related physiology as the sum of End-Expiratory Lung Volume (EELV) and Inspiratory Capacity (IC) . Thus， when air trapping during physical activity， EELV increases， IC decreases， and TLC remains constant. This phenomenon is known as dynamic hyperventilation.\n\n【5】We can surmise that hyperventilation leads to diaphragm limitation during exercise. A Min et al. found that the degree of diaphragmatic excursion during deep breathing was lower in patients with COPD and correlated significantly with disease severity .\n\n【6】Alba et al. demonstrated that inspiratory muscles training induces adaptive changes in the structure of the external intercostal muscles . Improvement in inspiratory muscle performance is associated with an increase in 6MWD and the sensation of dyspnea . Furthermore， Chun et al.  reported significant improvements after pulmonary rehabilitation in diaphragmatic motion during full inspiration and expiration in both lungs， indicated by fluoroscopy imaging findings .\n\n【7】Therefore， this case series investigated the effects of RMT in patients with COPD who exhibit classic respiratory symptoms， dynamic hyperinflation， or respiratory muscle weakness. We investigated the effectiveness of RMT in patients with COPD of varying severity who present with various symptoms.\n\n【8】Materials and Methods\n\n【9】Study design and subjects\n\n【10】The study protocol was approved by the ethics committee of the Taipei Medical University Joint Institutional Review Board， Taiwan(Study Code： N201808069). Data collection were performed from October 2018 to June 2019 at Taipei Medical University Hospital Pulmonary Rehabilitation Center， Taipei， Taiwan. A signed consent form has been obtained from all of the patients. The inclusion criteria were the participants who were categorized from moderate (GOLD II) to very severe (GOLD IV) COPD， age from 40 to 90 years old with stable condition. The GOLD strategy for COPD categorization was located in group B. The exclusion criteria were neuromuscular disease， diaphragm paralysis， dementia and COPDAE past 3 months.\n\n【11】Patient 1 exhibited respiratory disease symptoms. Patient 2exhibited dynamic hyperventilation. Patient 3 had respiratory muscle weakness. Participants were permitted to continue taking existing medication. We collected the following information： Health history， dyspnea sensation， Quality of Life (QoL)，respiratory muscle strength， pulmonary function，6MWT，and diaphragm excursion.\n\n【12】Respiratory muscle training with a Dofin breathing trainer\n\n【13】RMT involving both inspiratory and expiratory muscles was performed. The target training load was set individually at 50% ofeach participant's MIP and MEP. After 4 weeks， participants returned to the pulmonary rehabilitation center for a respiratory muscle strength evaluation. Updated MIP and MEP values were used to adjust each participant's target training load. Participants then performed RMT involving 30 breaths per day with a pause of 30s to 60s after every five breaths. The experimentlasted for 8 weeks.\n\n【14】Outcome evaluation\n\n【15】Exercise pulmonary function test： Dynamic hyperinflation used to be indicated by a change in IC (AIC， in liters) of less than or equal to -0.10 L at the peak of exercise ； however， it is more recently indicated by a tidal volume at peak exercise (VT peak) /TLC of less than 0.4 . Pulmonary function test was assessed using a spirometer (Vitalograph model 6800). Participants performed a6MWT to measure their exercise endurance index.\n\n【16】Respiratory muscle strength test： The MIP Lower Limit of Normal (LLN) was 62 - (0.15 ×age)， and the MEP LLN was 117 -(0.83 xage) cmH，O in men . In our analysis， patients with MIP<60 cmH，O were considered to have inspiratory muscle weakness. MIP and MEP were measured with GaleMedGas Pressure Gauge， while participants were in a sitting position.\n\n【17】Quality of life evaluation： QoL was measured using the CAT formulated by from GlaxoSmithKline. A Short Form 12-item (SF-12) survey was used to measure functional health and wellbeing from each participant’s perspective.\n\n【18】Diaphragm excursion measurement： Diaphragm excursion was measured using ultrasound imaging (Hitachi Noblus) of resting deep breath by one thoracic medical physician. The measurement reference lines were the bilateral scapular lines and bilateral posterior axillary lines. We measured the distance moved according to the grid lines on the screen of the ultrasound imaging machine.\n\n【19】Results\n\n【20】Patient 1 was a 78-year-old man presenting with symptoms of a respiratory disease and moderately severe COPD with predicted FEV1 of 54% and an mMRC score of 2. The 6MWD at baseline was147 m， and that after RMT intervention was 244 m. At baseline， the Borg scale at rest was 5 and that after the 6MWT was 7； after the RMT intervention， the Borg scale at rest was 2 and that after the 6MWTwas3， indicating an improvement in the sensation of dyspnea.\n\n【21】QoL also improved considerably. Scores from the SF-12 survey increased from 40% to 63%； specifically， the scores increased from21% to 50% in the physical component and 52% to 71% in the mental component. The CAT score decreased from 20 to 14 points.\n\n【22】MIPincreased from 80 cmHO to 104cmH.O，and MEPincreased from 100 cmH，Oto 120cmH，O. Diaphragm excursion also increased from 4 cm to7cm.\n\n【23】Patient 2 was a 77-year-old man who presented with dynamic hyperventilation and severe COPD with predicted FEV1 of 35% and an mMRC score of 1. The exercise pulmonary function test revealed a AIC of -0.12 L after the 6MWT. At baseline，his 6MWD was 263 m， and post-RMT， his 6MWD was 433 m. Also， it is worth noting that the AIC was from -0.12 improved to 0.09.\n\nThe QoL and CAT scores also improved. Scores from the SF-12survey increased from 74% to 80%， including 71% to 81% for the | Case  | 1  | 2  | 3  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Characteristic  | Symptoms of respiratory disease  | Dynamic hyperinflation  | Respiratory muscle weakness  |\n| Age/Gender  | 78/Male  | 77/Male  | 75/Male  |\n| BMI (kg/m²)  | 30.5  | 17.9  | 15.8  |\n| COPD Group  | B  | B  | B  |\n| FEV1/FVC%  | 63  | 44  | 35  |\n| FEV1%  | 54  | 35  | 11  |\n| FVC%  | 64  | 61  | 24  |\n| mMRC  | 2  | 1  | 4  |\n| 6-min Walk Test  |  |  |  |\n| 6MWT distance(pred%)  | 147 (40%)  | 263 (51%)  | 89(18%)  |\n| AIC(L)  | 0.04  | -0.12  | 0.24  |\n| Lowest SpO%  | 83  | 89  | 70  |\n| Borg  | 5s7  | 12  | 1>2  |\n| Quality of Life  |  |  |  |\n| SF-12(%)  | 40  | 74  | 51  |\n| CAT Score  | 20  | 13  | 21  |\n| Respiratory Muscle Strength  |  |  |  |\n| MIP (cmH，O)  | 80  | 54  | 12  |\n| MEP (cmH，O)  | 100  | 80  | 48  |\n| Diaphragm Excursion (cm)  | 4  | 4  | 1.5  |\n\n【25】Disease； FEV1： Forced Expiratory Volume in One Second； FVC： Forced Vital Ir2Capacity； 6MWT： 6-Min Walk Test； IC： Inspiratory Capacity； SF-12： Short Form12-Item Health Survey； CAT： COPD Assessment Test； MIP： Max Inspiratory Pressure； MEP： Max Expiratory Pressure mental component.

The resting deep breath diaphragm excursion was unchanged at 4cm.\n\n【29】Patient 3 was a 75-year-old man who presented with respiratory muscle weakness and very severe COPD with predicted FEV1 of 11%and an mMRC score of 4. The 6MWD at baseline and that following RMT intervention were 89 and 111 m， respectively. QoL improved considerably. Scores from the SF-12 survey increased from 51% to77%； The CAT score decreased from 21 to 19 points.\n\n【30】His respiratory muscle strength improved slightly. At baseline， his MIP was 12 cmH.O， and MEP was 48 cmH.O. Post-RMT intervention， the MIP was 22 cmH.O and MEP was 54 cmHO. The diaphragm excursion did not change significantly. The distance in the right post-axillary line was 1.5 cm at baseline and 2 cm post-RMT intervention .\n\n【31】We measured diaphragm movement using four lines， which were the scapular line and the post-axillary line on both the right and left sides. The distribution was related. The post-axillary line was slightly longer than the scapular line .\n\n【32】Discussion\n\nThe aim of this case series was to identify characteristics that are associated with favorable outcomes from RMTintervention. Increased breathing difficulty is indicated by a high inspiratory pressure to MIP ratio， which is related to perceived dyspnea sensation . Chuang et al.  revealed that RMT increases MIP， improves 6MWT， reduces sensations of dyspnea， and improves QoL， allowing patients to more easily perform daily activities in patients with moderate to very severe COPD|14.\n\n【34】We found that in patient 1， when symptoms subsided， the QoL improved. Previous research has shown that MIP has a significant negative correlation with diaphragm excursion . His diaphragm excursion increased from 4 cm to 7 cm accompany by increase MIP also noted.\n\n【35】Patient 2 presented MIP， MEP and 6MWD increased after the RMT intervention. A previous study showed that higher inspiratory muscle strength leads to improved exercise capacity and reduces dynamic hyperinflation and breathlessness during exercise . We now have a better understanding of the mechanisms that lead to improved exercise capacity through RMT. QoL also improved with increased exercise tolerance. No change was observed in the diaphragm excursion in patient 2， different results might be observed if the diaphragm is measured in an active state.\n\n【36】Patient 3 presented with very severe COPD and with respiratory muscle weakness. Decreased MEP is common in patients with advanced COPD . His 6MWD increased by only 22 m. But the minimum clinically important difference of the 6MWD suggests approximately 32 m . The increase in diaphragm excursion only 0.5 cm was below the threshold of clinical measurement accuracy. Despite the poor clinical results， this patient’s QoL improved much. The benefits of RMT for patients with very severe COPD remains unknown. Patient 3 did not show significant improvement probably because the training period was too short or because complementary modalities were required. In any case， RMT resulted in maintained muscle strength and increased exercise capacity， thereby improving QoL.\n\n【37】In conclusion， RMT has varying degrees of benefit for patients with COPD. Prolonged RMT or RMT in combination with additional training may provide better results.\n\n【38】Conclusion\n\n【39】Additional RMT increased MIP，MEP， CAT scores and QoL. The participant with symptoms of respiratory diseases had the greatest improvement in diaphragm excursion. The participant with dynamic hyperinflation had an increased AIC， which subsequently improved exercise capacity. The participant with respiratory muscle weakness， which is usually associated with very severe COPD， exhibited improvement in QoL.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 11:43:42", "endTime": "2024/09/24 11:43:59", "cost": 16.916}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:35", "update_time": "2024-09-23 19:43:59", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 19:43:42"}

In this article， a case of a premature infant with a gestational age of 24+1 weeks was successfully treated， but no sequelae were found during follow-up. It is reminded that the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) of tertiary hospitals in China through careful and standardized management， enables children to smoothly pass through the three major barriers of breathing， nutrition， and infection， as well as the subsequent kangaroo care and family participatory management， which can fully realize the Preterm infants aged 24 to 25 weeks survived without obvious defects.\n\n【2】Keywords： Super premature infants； Gestational age 24 weeks； Dyspnea； Sequelae\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Hospital admission\n\n【5】The patient， a female， was admitted to the hospital on September 24h，2019 because of“gestational age of 24+1 weeks and dyspnea for 40 min after birth\". The child is the second child of the second child， and the gestational age is 24+1 weeks. The mothers prenatal measurement of blood pressure is high， urine protein is +， suffering from\" bacterial vaginosis\" and given \"cefoxitin anti-infection and topical vaginal medication\"treatment. Before childbirth，\"dexamethasone needle1 course\" has been given to promote fetal lung maturity. She gave birth naturally and weighed770 g. Amniotic fluid， umbilical cord， and placenta were normal. After birth， the child breathes like breath， weak spontaneous breathing， Apgar score of 1 min， 5 min and 9 points (respiration deduction 1 point)， the gestational age of the child is less than 26 weeks， and requires prophylactic administration of pulmonary surfactant and endotracheal intubation the rewarmed porcine lung phospholipid injection 160 mg was dripped into the tube. After the drug was used up， he still had difficulty breathing and had weak spontaneous breathing. He was transferred to the neonatology department under tracheal intubation and resuscitation balloon positive pressure ventilation. Both mother and father are 32 years old. One brother is 5 years old and healthy. Physical examination：Body temperature 36.6C，heart rate 145 beats/min， breathing 68 beats/min， weight 770 gm. Ultra-premature babies have appearance， poor response， thin and shiny skin， nails not reaching the fingertips， unobvious foot texture， no nodules in the breast， and unobvious areola. The fontanelle is flat and soft， the spontaneous breathing is weak， the mouth is cyanotic， and the three concave signs are positive. Breath sounds in both lungs were low， and no wet rales were heard. The heart sounds are strong， regular and without noise. The abdominal examination was normal. The labia majora does not cover the labia minor. The muscle tone of the limbs is low， and the original reflex is not elicited. Admitted to the hospital for diagnosis of Extremely Preterm Infants (EPI) and ultra-low birth weight infants.\n\n【6】Diagnosis and treatment process\n\n【7】Keep warm in an advanced incubator with a humidity of 90%. Give the ventilator assisted breathing SIMV mode，initial parameters： Peak Inspiratory Pressure PIP 14cmH20 (1cmH，0=0.098kPa)， Positive End Expiratory Pressure PEEP 5 cm H，O， Respiratory frequency (Respiratory Rate RR) 35 times/min， inhaled oxygen concentration (Fraction of Inspired Oxygen FiO，) 30%， Inspiratory time (Inspiratory time Ti) 0.35 S. Blood sugar and blood pressure were normal on admission. No pathogenic bacteria grow in sputum culture. Afterwards， the ventilator parameters were gradually lowered. On the third day of admission， the ventilator parameters were： PIP 12 cm H0， PEEP 4 cm HO， RR 30 times/min， FiO， 23%， Ti 0.35 S. The gestational age was corrected at 26+1 weeks (2 weeks after birth) and mechanical ventilation was stopped. Because ofapnea， a noninvasive ventilator was given bi-level positive pressure ventilation. Corrected the gestational age of 28+3 weeks and stopped the non-invasive ventilator， changed to nasal cannula oxygen inhalation， corrected the gestational age of 29 weeks， changed to incubate oxygen. Correct gestational age and stop oxygen at 31 weeks. After admission， he was given penicillin combined with ceftizoxime for anti-infective treatment， penicillin for 1 week， and ceftizoxime for 10 days. Pulmonary infection occurred at 36 weeks of gestational age was corrected， cefoperazone and sulbactam anti-infective treatment was given for 1 week and the drug was stopped after recovery. Correct gestational age at 37 weeks and start kangaroo care. After birth， he was given umbilical vein catheterization for 14 days， and then PICC catheterization was given for 2 times， which was maintained until drug withdrawal. After 2 weeks of admission， the rat nerve growth factor was used to nourish the nerves. After the condition was stabilized， the premature infants were treated with massage and music. On the second day of admission， caffeine citrate was given to treat apnea， and the maintenance dose was 10 mg/kg until the gestational age was corrected 36 weeks. After birth， give vitamin K and sulfacetamide to prevent bleeding for 3 days， keep quiet， avoid sound and light stimulation， reduce movement， and maintain internal environment stability. Head ultrasound was monitored once a week， and there was no abnormality. Cardiac color Doppler ultrasound examination was performed 2 weeks after birth： Atrial level and left-to-right shunt were recorded， aortic level and small left-to-right shunt were recorded， and the shunt beam width was about1 mm to 2 mm， indicating patent foramen ovale and patent ductus arteriosus. The child had no hemodynamic changes， and the arterial catheter was not given specialtreatment. Correction of gestationalage at 27 weeks and re-examination of cardiac color Doppler ultrasound showed that the foramen ovale was patent and the arterial duct was closed. Reexamination of cardiac color Doppler ultrasound every two weeks afterwards showed that the foramen ovale was patent. After admission， he began to actively support parenteral and parenteral nutrition， monitor height and head circumference every week， and monitor weight gain trends every day. Nasal feeding started on the4th day after birth， micro-feeding， deep hydrolyzed milk powder，and non-nutritive sucking. Each time the stomach tube was fed 1 ml， once every 3 h， and then every 3 to 5 days with 1 ml each time， the feeding was well tolerated， and the gestational age was corrected 26+2 weeks and the breast milk nasal feeding was started. Correct the gestational age of 28+4 weeks and start partial oral feeding. After correcting the gestational age at 32 weeks， all oral breast milk was fed 13 ml/time， weighing 1300 g， and breast milk fortifier was added. Amino acids were administered intravenously within 24 h after birth to prevent negative nitrogen balance， fat emulsion was added 24 h later， and parenteral nutrition was used to supplement energy and various nutrients. Three weeks after birth， the blood routine examination revealed anemia， and erythropoietin was added， oral iron was used to prevent anemia， and a blood transfusion was given. Corrected the gestational age from 32+4 weeks， check the ophthalmology fundus every 2 weeks， and continue to return to the ophthalmology clinic after discharge. No abnormalities were found. Corrected for 41weeks of gestational age， the head MRI showed no abnormalities. The patient was hospitalized for 128 days. At discharge， his length was50 cm， his head circumference was 34 cm， and his weight was 3210g. The Neonatal Behavioral Neurological Assessment (NBNA) score was normal. Six months after birth (corrected age of 2 months)， the length is 58 cm， the head circumference is 38 cm， the weight is 4900g the NBNA score is normal，and the hearing screening and brainstem auditory evoked potential are normal.\n\n【8】Discussion\n\n【9】EPI less than 28 weeks has a high mortality rate， mainly due to perinatal asphyxia， intracranial hemorrhage， congenital malformations， hyaline membrane disease， pulmonary hemorrhage， persistent pulmonary hypertension， and various infections. In recent years， there have been more and more reports on the successful treatment of preterm infants with gestational age less than 28 weeks. There have been reports of survival at the minimum gestational age of 21 weeks . The survival rate of EPI at 23 weeks and 24 weeks in European and American countries is 44.4% and 69.2%. There is still a big gap between my country and foreign countries.\n\n【10】Our department successfully treated a case of 25+3 EPI in2016， and the follow-up developed well. The patient who has been successfully treated is one of the youngest premature babies in the region. The experience is summarized as follows：\n\n【11】Body temperature management\n\n【12】Close cooperation with obstetrics and pediatrics medical staff， the temperature of the delivery room is 24 to 28 degrees， the radiant table is preheated， the umbilical cord ligation is delayed for 1 min after the baby is born， and then placed on the radiant table to keep warm， the child has weak breathing， provide rescue treatment such as tracheal intubation and intra tracheal application of pulmonary surfactant， which is the first step for the successful treatment of children. After entering the neonatology department，live in an advanced incubator， maintain a constant temperature and humidity， and a humidity of90% to avoid excessive weight loss， reduce insignificant water loss， and restore birth weight 10 days after birth .\n\n【13】Respiratory management\n\n【14】Respiratory distress syndrome： The child's prenatal mother gave a course of adrenocortical hormone treatment to promote lung maturity. Prenatal application of adrenocortical hormone not only promotes lung maturity， but also accelerates the production of alveolar surfactant and reduces premature birth the incidence and severity of hyaline membrane disease in children . After birth， he was weak in spontaneous breathing and breathing like a wheeze. He was given tracheal intubation and preventive pulmonary surfactant treatment immediately. At the same time， the T combined resuscitator is used to assist breathing， which ensures that a certain end-expiratory pressure is maintained and prevents the open alveoli from collapsing again. After being transferred to the neonatology department， he was given mechanical ventilation and adopted a protective ventilation strategy . The child’s breathing was assessed in time， and mechanical ventilation was stopped 2 weeks after birth and changed to non-invasive ventilation .\n\n【15】Apnea： The chance of apnea in ultra-premature infants is very high. Caffeine citrate treatment is started on the second day after birth， which shortens the time of mechanical ventilation，reduces the number of apneas， and effectively protects brain cells .\n\n【16】Preventionofbronchopulmonarydysplasia： Bronchopulmonary dysplasia is a major cause of death from EPI. We mainly evaluate breathing in time， adopt permissive hypercapnia strategies， constant volume mode， and minimize PIP and tidal air. In order to avoid the occurrence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia BPD)， early mechanical ventilation was stopped and changed to non-invasive ventilation. Oxygen was completely stopped at 31 weeks of gestational age .\n\n【17】Nutritional support\n\n【18】Early micro-feeding： The child will start nasal micro-feeding 48h after birth， starting from 1 ml each time， once every 3 h， adding milk once every 2 to 3 days， adding 1 ml each time during the feeding process， there was no feeding intolerance such as gastric retention， vomiting，and abdominal distension. Early micro-feeding contributes to the integrity of the gastrointestinal tissue structure， improves the secretion and activity of digestive enzymes， and promotes the development and maturity of gastrointestinal motor function .\n\n【19】Early breastfeeding： Premature babies choose breastfeeding first， and inform mothers and family members of the importance of breastfeeding. The mother is very cooperative and insists on delivering breast milk until discharged from the hospital. When breastfeeding volume reaches 80 ml/kg.d， add breast milk fortifier， start with half fortification， and give full fortification after 3 days. During the hospitalization of the child， vomiting， abdominal distension， gastro esophageal reflux， and necrotizing enterocolitis did not occur.Mother feeding can reduce the incidence of nosocomial infections， reduce the number of days， and reduce the cost of children with children .\n\n【20】Parenteral nutrition： 24 h after birth， internal and parenteral nutrition is given amino acids via the umbilical vein to provide sufficient energy， reduce catabolism and prevent negative nitrogen balance. After 24 h， add fat milk， vitamins， trace elements and other intravenous nutrition to ensure the supply of liquid and calorie . Monitor the baby’s weight， length， and head circumference. The growth process is smooth ， and all indicators are above the 10h percentile when discharged from the hospital.\n\n【21】Infection prevention and treatment： Prevention is the first， strict implementation of aseptic operation technical specifications， attention to hand hygiene， centralized operation，dedicated operation and care， prevention of cross-infection， rational use of antibiotics， and active control of infection.\n\n【22】Prevention of brain injury in premature infants： Brain injury is an important factor affecting the prognosis of the nervous system of EPI. How to reduce and avoid brain damage is a problem that everyone faces. After birth， the patient should minimize movement and irritation， and regularly perform bedside cranial ultrasound monitoring. Hemostatic drugs and a course of neurotrophic therapy were used prophylactically for 3 days after birth. Pay attention to maintaining vital signs and internal environment stability. After the condition is stable， give music therapy and touch premature infants， pay attention to nutritional support， and ensure the needs of brain development . Give kangaroo nursing and family participatory nursing， and teaches parents the methods and skills of nursing premature babies . After active intervention， the NBNA score was normal after correction for age 2 months， and the hearing screening and brainstem auditory evoked potential were normal.\n\n【23】Prevention of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP)： Reasonable use of oxygen， the inhaled oxygen concentration is less than 30%， shorten the time of oxygen use as much as possible， and correct the gestational age of 31 weeks and have stopped oxygen. Corrected the gestational age from 32+4 weeks and the fundus were checked every 2weeks. After discharge， the ophthalmology clinic continued to follow up，and there was no abnormality in the monitoring of the retina .\n\n【24】Other aspects： Maintainfluiddbalance， prevent excessive fluid from causing arterial ducts to open， maintain blood sugar stability， phototherapy to reduce jaundice and prevent bilirubin encephalopathy， erythropoietin and iron agents prevent anemia in premature infants， research suggests that erythropoietin has brain protection . At present， the development of vision， hearing， intelligence， and motor functions are normal， and there is no abnormality in head MRI.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 11:28:15", "endTime": "2024/09/24 11:28:32", "cost": 16.87}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:35", "update_time": "2024-09-23 19:28:31", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 19:28:14"}

These editorial highlights the ongoing efforts to preserve and breed endangered species， focusing on captive breeding programs， artificial insemination， embryo transfer， and their role in conservation. Captive breeding programs have proven crucial in recovering declining populations and providing genetic reserves for future reintroduction into the wild. Additionally，advanced reproductive techniques such as artificial insemination and embryo transfer have enhanced reproduction rates and genetic diversity. However， it is important to acknowledge that these approaches should be complemented by in-situ conservation efforts aimed at protecting natural habitats and addressing underlying causes of population decline. Successful reintroduction of captive-bred animals requires ongoing research， careful monitoring， and collaboration among scientists， conservationists， and local communities. Public awareness and education play a pivotal role in promoting conservation and garnering support. Byadopting an integrated and collaborative approach， we can strive for a future where endangered species thrive in harmony with their natural environments，ensuring the preservation of biodiversity for generations to come.\n\n【2】Preserving biodiversity has become an increasingly urgent concern as the world faces a rising rate of species extinction. To protect and save endangered animals from disappearing forever， scientists and conservationists have been making significant efforts in the field of reproduction and conservation of endangered species. One of the most prominent approaches is the establishment of captive breeding programs， also known as ex-situ breeding programs. These programs have played a crucial role in attempting to recover declining populations and preserve endangered species from extinction. By maintaining animals in controlled environments such as zoos and specialized breeding centers， these programs can ensure the survival of species and provide a genetic reservoir for future reintroduction efforts into the wild. Furthermore， technological advancements have enabled the use of assisted reproductive techniques such as artificial insemination and embryo transfer to enhance reproduction rates and the reproductive success of endangered species. Artificial insemination allows for the collection of sperm from endangered males， which can be used to fertilize females that would otherwise be unable to reproduce naturally. Embryo transfer， on the other hand， enables the transportation of healthy embryos from endangered species to recipient females， thereby increasing the chances of successful reproduction. These advanced reproductive techniques not only help overcome reproductive challenges faced by endangered species but also contribute to genetic diversity and the long-term survival of these populations. By preserving genetic variability， these approaches assist in the adaptation and resilience of species in the face of environmental threats and climate change. However， it is important to emphasize that assisted reproduction and captive breeding programs should not be considered definitive solutions for biodiversity preservation. These strategies should complement in-situ conservation efforts， which aim to protect natural habitats and address the underlying causes of declining wild populations. The reintroduction of captive-bred animals to their natural habitats is a crucial step towards the long-term success of conservation. After all， the ultimate goal is to ensure that species can thrive and reproduce in their natural environments， contributing to the health of ecosystems as a whole. However，the challenges faced in reintroducing captive-bred animals should not be underestimated. Adaptation to new environments， competition with other species，and overcoming obstacles such as illegal hunting and habitat destruction are just some of the challenges reintroduced species may encounter. It is crucial， therefore， that reproductive and conservation programs be supported by ongoing scientific research， careful monitoring， and collaboration among scientists， conservationists， and local communities. Understanding the ecological requirements of species and implementing adequate protection measures in their natural habitats are essential elements for successful reintroduction. Additionally， public awareness and education play a vital role in promoting conservation and adopting behaviors that support wildlife preservation. By sharing the efforts of reproduction and conservation， along with the ecological and cultural significance of endangered species， we can generate interest and support from society at large. The reproduction and conservation of endangered species require a collective and comprehensive effort that includes not only actions directed at captive populations but also the protection of natural habitats， combating illegal hunting， controlling environmental degradation， and raising public awareness. Only through an integrated and collaborative approach can we effectively preserve endangered species and ensure the health and resilience of the ecosystems they inhabit. In summary， current efforts in the reproduction and conservation of endangered species， including captive breeding programs， assisted reproductive techniques， and careful reintroduction， play a vital role in biodiversity preservation. By combining scientific knowledge， active conservationism， and public engagement， we can work towards a future where threatened species can thrive and coexist harmoniously with their natural environments.

Treatment of such infections is still challenging in clinical work. An Erbium-doped Yttrium Aluminum Garnet (Er：YAG) laser is reported efficient in disinfection and decontamination. This case report describes a patient with early post-implantation infection that caused severe bone resorption in the right mandibular anterior region 2 months after the implant surgery. Complaint of pain was recorded. After reasonable decontamination and debridement using Er：YAG laser， Guided Bone Regeneration (GBR) was performed. Six months after the surgery， CBCT was taken which indicated that the infected implant achieved re-osseointegration and no lucency around the fixture. Debridement with Er：YAGlaser is promising in treating the infected implant.\n\n【2】Keywords： Er：YAG laser； Post-implantation infection； GBR\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Early infection after dental implantation is not a common complication. Factors are mainly related to patients'systemic problems， such as untreated diabetes and heavy smoking， technical problems such as bone overheating during drilling and inaccurate implant inserting， compromised operation sterility， and poor oral hygiene . Severe and acute infection can result in alveolar bone resorption， implant exposure and osseointegration failure. Due to the excessive dense bone， the risk of early implantation failure was 2.7 times higher when implants were placed in the anterior mandibular region than in the posterior mandibular region . The wavelength of the Er：YAG laser is 2，940 um， which happens to be at the highest peak of water absorption， so it can be absorbed extraordinarily by water to produce a \"microexplosion\" effect. An Er：YAG laser can act on the deep of implant threads and produce less heat， so it is one of the ideal treatment modalities for decontamination and debridement of an infected implant and for promoting implant re osseointegration.\n\n【5】In this case report， by using Er：YAG laser for decontamination and debridement， the implant was saved with sufficient bone support. Favorable restorative results and excellent implant osseointegration were achieved.\n\n【6】Case Presentation\n\n【7】A 38-year-old female patient was received implant placement 2 months ago at mandibular right central incisor region. The patient suffered persistent swelling of the gingiva and pyorrhea with pain for about 1 months. No improvement was achieved after local irrigation with chlorhexidine. The patient denied a medical history with systematic disease， such as hypertension， diabetes and heart disease； no drug allergy； no bisphosphonate treatment； and no smoking.\n\n【8】A healing abutment was placed on the implant without mobility. The gingiva of the implant was showing hyperemia， swelling， and hemorrhage. A fistula was observed at the apical of the implant of the labial mucosa. Discomfort occurred when palpating the labial gingiva around the implant. CBCT images showed that the implant was present without the labial bone .\n\n【9】Under local anesthesia， a full-thickness flap was reflected to expose the implant. Labial bone was completely resorbed and the exposure of implant threads were observed. There was a large amount of granulation tissue distal to the implant. The vertical absorption of the labial bone was approximately 10 mm.\n\n【10】Granulation tissue was completely removed with an Er：YAGlaser(parameter settings： SP， 80 mJ， 30 Hz， and water/air： 5/2). Infected implant surface decontamination and debridement were achieved with an Er：YAG laser (parameter settings： SP， 50 mJ， 30 Hz， and water/air： 5/2). After debridement， there was a bone defect in the distal area of the implant.\n\n【11】After decortication， bone graft (0.5 g， Bio-Oss， Geistlich) was filled into the bone defect. A resorbable collagen membrane (13mm x 25 mm， Bio-Gide， Geistlich was placed upon the bone graft. Wound closure without tension was achieved by interrupted sutures. Postoperative CBCT images showed that bone graft with a thickness of 2.2 mm was observed on the labial aspect of the implant. Two weeks after the operation， the surgical area healed uneventful without membrane exposure or obvious abnormal secretions. A Maryland Bridge was placed as a temporary prosthesis.\n\n【12】Six months after surgery， CBCT images revealed that there was new bone formation on the labial aspect of the implant， and the implant was achieved osseointegration. A screw retaining temporary prosthesis was made to shape the gingival soft tissue. After 3 months， the final prothesis was produced. X-ray images revealed that the crown was seated well. The patient was satisfied with the effect of therapy .\n\n【13】Results\n\n【14】At the 24-month follow-up， the implant prostheses showed good function and no noticeable soft-tissue recession was observed. The radiologic examination showed satisfactory preservation of marginal bone .\n\n【15】Discussion\n\n【16】The mandibular anterior region generally has the densest bone， mostly consisting of type I and II bone qualities . Although the primary stability of the implant is excellent in this region， but risk of implantation failure was increased due to the friction and bone necrosis induced by high local temperature during surgical drilling. Studies have reported that when exposed to a temperature of47°C for half an hour， local osseous necrosis， soft tissue wrapping around the implant， and osseointegration failure can occur， so the area is more susceptible to bacterial infection . Sufficient bone， which can provide a rich blood supply to maintain the processes of regeneration and reconstruction of peri-implant bone， is required for the implant success. When the facial bone thickness was more than 2mm， bone loss of the implant decreased significantly. When labial bone thickness was insufficient， bone resorption was more likely to occur in the mandibular anterior region with dense bone and poor blood supply.\n\n【17】A large number of studies have shown that implants can still achieve re-osseointegration following localdebridementand decontamination ofthe infected implant . It was demonstrated that implants with smooth surfaces were more likely to re-osseointegrate than implants with rough surfaces . This may be due to the ease of decontamination of smooth implant surfaces. However， more bone regeneration was observed for implants with rough surfaces than that for implants with smooth surfaces when re-osseointegration occurred. Therefore，how to achieve effective decontamination of implants with rough surfaces are urgently needed in the clinic.\n\n【18】At present， various methods， including mechanical curettes， ultrasonic devices， mechanical sandblasting， titanium brushes and irrigation with chlorhexidine， are commonly used for implant surface decontamination. The wavelengthoftheEr：YA Glaser is the same as the highest peak of water absorption，producing a\"microexplosion\"effect for tissue cutting， debridement and sterilization， which causes little damage to the implant. In vitro experiments showed that， compared with other mechanical methods， the Er：YAG laser had the best decontamination effect on the rough surface of the implants because Er：YAG laser light can irradiate the deep areas of the threads . Animal study has demonstrated that an Er：YAG laser can effectively treat infected implants and promote implant osseointegration . In a prospective clinical cohort study， 20 patients with peri-implantitis were treated with an Er：YAG laser (initial settings of 50 mJ and25 pps). After 1 year of treatment， CBCT images revealed that the infrabony defects around the implants disappeared . However， different Er：YAG laser parameters had different effects on the implant. The application of a high-level Er：YAG laser (150mJ/10 Hz) decreased the proliferative ability of osteoblasts on the SLA surface. The application of an Er：YAG laser (80 mJ/20 Hz) changed the surface topology structure of implants with SLA surface . Low energy level of Er：YAG lasers (50 mJ， 60 mJ， 120 mJ) were sufficient for debridement and decontamination of the implant surface . Moreover，Er：YAGlasers had different therapeutic effects on implants with different surfaces .\n\n【19】Conclusion\n\n【20】Decontamination and debridement with an Er：YAG laser were promising in treating the infection of the implant. Satisfactory therapeutic effects were obtained in a short period oftime，but further review is still needed in the long term especially for the optimum parameters of the Er：YAG laser.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 10:58:05", "endTime": "2024/09/24 10:58:35", "cost": 30.84}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:35", "update_time": "2024-09-23 18:58:33", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 18:58:02"}

She presented with progressive symptoms of general weakness，loss ofweight，loss ofappetite and severe progressive dyspnea in the hospital which treatedherinitially. Inlaboratorytest elevated CRPand leukocytosis was seen. The echocardiography showed some suspicious abnormal floating structure on the tricuspid valve. For further evaluation a transesophageal echocardiography was performed， which showed a 3.2 cm × 2 cm vegetation on the Right Ventricular (RV) lead. The patient was referred to our hospital for further diagnostics and treatment. We repeated the transesophageal echocardiography， which brought the same result so we decided to perform a CT-scan. A full cardiac cycle CT scan was performed on a photon-counting CT scanner， which showed besides vegetation on RV lead other multiple vegetations on the anterior leaflet of tricuspid valve in 4D imaging. The CT finding convinced us to opt for open surgical explanation of CRT-ICD System and surgical intervention of tricuspid valve. The CRT-ICD System was explanted safely， the vegetations were removed， and the anterior leaflet of tricuspid valve was partly resected and reconstructed using modified De Vega technique.\n\n【2】Keywords： CRT-ICD System； Tricuspid valve Endocarditis； Photon counting CT scan； Full cardiac cycle CT-imaging Transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography are the gold standard in the diagnostics of infective endocarditis. Along with Echocardiographic investigation， the role of CT scan in localization of vegetation is highly appreciable. With the advancement in the CT-technology was recently Photon Counting CT system (PCCT) introduced. It is a form of X-ray Computed Tomography (CT) in which X-rays are detected using a Photon-Counting Detector (PCD). These photon-counting detectors have the potential to overcome the limitations of current CT detectors， by providing CT data at very high spatial resolution， less noise， improved contrast-to-noise ratio， low radiation dose and with intrinsic spectral information. They are much more dose efficient than other detectors， have smaller pixels， which can significantly increase the spatial resolution. Here， we can expect qualitative images that visualize very fine tissue structures with low radiation and less use of contrast agent. Photon-counting CT offers several significant advantages over other existing CT imaging techniques， which opens potential to scan cardiovascular patients， overcoming compromises in lung and bone imaging and imaging of other organs and systems Here we present a case of CRT-ICD induced tricuspid valve endocarditis where photon counting full cardiac cycle CT-imaging played major role for the surgical intervention.\n\n【3】Cycle CT-Imaging. Clin Case Rep Int.\n\n【4】Case Presentation\n\n【5】A CRT-ICD was implanted in a 55-year-old female Patient with chronic heart failure due to dilated cardiomyopathy accompanying Left Bundle Branch block (LBB) in an external hospital. Six months later， the patient was admitted again in the same hospital with progressive dyspnea(NYHA III)， general weakness and weight loss. The laboratory report presented with leukocytosis， thrombocytopenia， CRP elevation， raised transaminase and creatinine levels. The blood cultures were negative. The Transthoracic and Transesophageal Echocardiography (TTE， TEE) showed a high-grade tricuspid valve regurgitation and a 3.2 cm x 2 cm long vegetation on the RV lead. In history as well as in physical investigation there were no infective foci found.\n\n【6】For further assessment and therapy， the patient was referred to our hospital. Here we repeated transesophageal echocardiography， which showed similar findings， a vegetation on theRVleadandahigh-grade tricuspid valve regurgitation. For further evaluation we decided to perform a CT-scan. A full cardiac cycle CT-scan with a photon counting CT scanner (NAEOTOM Alpha， Siemens Healthineers， Forchheim， Germany) was performed， which showed vegetation on the RV-lead and multiple minor vegetations on the anterior leaflet of tricuspid valve. So， we decided for sternotomy， surgical intervention on tricuspid valve and open CRT-ICD explanation. The vegetations were removed， the anterior leaflet of tricuspid valve was partly resected and reconstructed using modified De Vega technique. The Patient recovered fast and had a very uneventful stay in our hospital.\n\n【7】Discussion\n\n【8】In routine practice， the echocardiographic investigations are gold standards for the diagnosis of endocarditis. Its accuracy depends on factors like size and localization of vegetations， calcifications， concomitant valvular defects and the experienceofechocardiographer.\n\n【9】The photon counting CT have certain advantages over other preexisting CT-scan techniques. The metal artifacts， beam hardening artifacts and noise streaks are better mitigated. High contrast and high-resolution structures are also better visualized . The photon counting CT scan reduces radiation exposure， reconstructs images at a higher resolution， corrects beam hardening artifacts， optimizes the use of contrast agents and creates opportunities for quantitative imaging relative to other CT technology . A full cardiac cycle CT investigation enables the assessment of morphological and functional structures of heart and can also be used to analyze in depth the ventricular function .\n\n【10】In our case， the vegetations on the tricuspid valve were in echocardiography not clearly visible， so we decided to perform CT-scan. A full cardiac cycle CT investigation with a photon counting CT scanner was done to explore the vegetations on tricuspid valve. The result was very convincing and helpful in making the decision for major surgical intervention.\n\n【11】There are also otherTaa.lternative methods，Ssuch as18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission1Tomography with Computed Tomography-based attenuation Tomography correction(18F-FDG PET/CT)， which has been increasingly used in the diagnosis of infective endocarditis. Its accuracy and sensitivity are reported to be better than echocardiographic investigations .\n\n【12】Conclusion\n\n【13】Despite all echocardiography remains first choice and a great diagnostic tool in evaluation of infective valvular disease， but CT scan performed especially on photon counting CT scanner can play an additional important role in representation of cardiac structures as a whole.

The N-BEATS deep learning method has been applied to a dataset from an example of EHG by considering their first six principal components. Thus， it can be seen that the preview of EHG， and the early prediction of labor from the N-BEATS method， depends on the data size and recordings duration.\n\n【2】Keywords： Principal component； Uterine contraction； Machine learning； Prediction\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Maternal and child health is and remains a public health issue. But the approaches vary between low and high income countries. What is common to both is the problem of preterm births (gestation week less than 37 weeks and more than 26 weeks)， which still remains a huge public health issue. In addition to this， for low-income countries carrying a pregnancy to term (gestation week over 37weeks) is still a public health issue； whereas this is no longer the case in high-income countries. This is due to the lack of sufficient and quality health structures， adequate technical facilities and available qualified human resources. The problem is even more acute in rural and peri-urban areas. In this context， in order to solve the problem of premature births， high-income countries have initiated research that has led to the recognition of the Electrohysterogram as an effective technique for monitoring pregnancies in pregnant women. Several methods have been developed around it and several parameters have been discovered for its characterization in order to diagnose preterm birth earlier. In the literature， thirty of these parameters have been found to be the most widely used.\n\n【5】In order to address the various deficits mentioned above for low-income countries， we are interested in the prediction of labor in pregnant women with full-term pregnancies. It is in this context that we have sought to better understand the techniques of external recording of EHG and especially electrodes positioning on the pregnant woman's abdomen . In the same vein， we wanted to be able to distinguish between physiological contractions related to pregnancy and those leading to labor； the methods for doing so were identified in the literature . As a logical extension of this， in this work we are interested in predicting labor by forecasting the behavior of the EHG signal using a deep learning method. We will start with the principal component analysis， which will allow us to make an objective choice of the main components to be considered in the dataset to be provided to the learning algorithm. In the following sections of this paper we will describe the different methods used， the results obtained after their application，the discussion of these results and the conclusion.\n\n【6】Method\n\n【7】Used data\n\n【8】The Term-Preterm EHG database  was used in this work. In our study， we considered the record with the identity 1737 and carried out at 35.6 weeks of gestation with delivery at 39 weeks(full term pregnancy). Then， as data used in this study， we exploited the thirty  parameters most used in the literature for the characterization of the EHG signal and uterine contractions .\n\n【9】Empirical mode decomposition\n\n【10】The raw data from PhysioBank was then subjected to Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD).\n\n【11】This is a method used to analyze and decompose non-stationary and non-linear signals. It performs operations that partition a series into N finite \"modes\" (IMFs： Intrinsic Mode Functions) without leaving the time domain . The first extracted IMF contains the fastest oscillations of the signal， the last extracted IMF concerns the slowest ones， while the residual， r(t)， represents the signal trend .\n\n【12】The usefulness of EMD in our work is that it allows us to eliminate unnecessary variations in the original signal.\n\n【13】Principal component analysis\n\n【14】This is a widely used dimension reduction technique. Given a dataset with n features， the obiective is to have k features with ks n so that the k features retain most of the variation present in all the original variables. Let us assume the following dataset in matrix form to illustrate the technique： with each row representing an observation and each column a Darameter\n\n【15】By associating to each dataset a， b， c a function f，the average of each column gives： which allows us to obtain the covariance of each parameter fthrough：\n\n【16】Thus， following the rules of covariance we have：\n\n【17】cov(ff) cov(介))cov(f，f)\n\n【18】Considering the square matrix Ae mn and aeR an eigenvalue of A， reR\"-{0} is the corresponding eigenvector of A if：\n\n【19】A.=A. (eigenvalue equation)\n\n【20】det(A-A7)= b一A\n\n【21】Solving this equation (using the Sarrus rule)， we have an equation of the form： al+bA2+cA+d=0.\n\n【22】After solving this equation we obtain the eigenvalues：，入入， with：\n\n【23】We then obtain， by solving the eigenvalue equation， the different eigenvectors：2 P，\n\n【24】V。\"’\"， represents respectively the eigenvectors ofA，1.\n\n【25】Considering (a)， we can choose k ≤n principal components with k=2 in our case. This giving us the corresponding matrix：\n\n【26】This can still be written by transformation into a new subspace in the form：\n\n【27】It is therefore a technique whose objectives are to： Simplify and reduce data， select variables， classify， model，predict， etc. It also allows us to identify patterns in the data， and to compress them by reducing the higher dimensions to the lower ones， without causing any effect on the whole data or without losing important information. In other words， at the end of this analysis， we obtain a given number of Principal Components (PCs) such that this number is less than or equal to the number of initial dimensions of the dataset.\n\n【28】Stationarity and deep learning\n\n【29】The stationarity of the data series to be sent to the forecasting algorithm must be ensured. For this purpose， the method of visual observation of the signal， its mean and its standard deviation， all represented on the same graph， is used. A statistical method is associated with this for increasingly complex data series. In our case， the Augmented Dickey Fuller test  was used as it is the most widely used statistical method of stationarityanalysis in the literature. It is a mathematical method based on a null hypothesis and an alternative. The non-stationarity of the data is often considered as a null hypothesis. The objective is to eliminate it by obtaining a p-value lower than 0.05.\n\n【30】Once the stationarity of the data series is ensured， the forecasting process can start. For this purpose， the deep learning method N-BEATS  has been identified. It is a predictive algorithm with a deep neural architecture based on backward and forward residual links and a very deep stack of fully connected layers. The architecture has a number of desirable properties， being interpretable， applicable without modification to a wide range of target domains， and fast to train . It is a method that has proven itself in the field of time series forecasting in recent years. For its implementation， PyTorch Forecasting was used， itself being a PyTorch-based package with an open source machine learning framework .\n\n【31】Results\n\n【32】The application of the EMD on the EHG signal of our example(woman at 35 weeks of gestation) over a period of 20s centered on the peak characterizing the uterine contraction ， gives 4 IMFs among which we selected the second one in the framework of our study. The choice to focus on the periods of contraction is the one most often made in the literature.\n\n【33】After obtaining the IMFs from the EMD， when we apply the principal component analysis considering the 30 parameters， we obtain Table 2. Considering the results in Table 2， we have identified the 15 best parameters (RMS， MF， TM5， SM3， MYOP， ApEn， Tr， MAV2，TM3， SE (SampEn)， VCF， MNF，LOG， ZC，MAV1) by taking in order the principal components and the parameters representing them.\n\n【34】Atthe end of this， we notice that the first six principal components alone constitute 90% of the total information on the signal from the characterization point of view. Thus， in the following， these six principal components will be used to train our deep learning and decision algorithm for predicting the future behavior of our EHG signal. The application of our deep learning method to our dataset leads to Figure 3.\n\n| Table 1： Summary of the most used parameters in the literature.  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Authors  | Title  | Parameters/features  |\n| Garcia-Gonzales et al.，2013  | Characterization of EHG contractions at term labor by nonlinear analysis  | Nonlinear： Sample Entropy (SampEn)  |\n| Alamedine et al.2013a  | Parameters extraction and monitoring in uterine EMG signals.

The number of cycles refers to learning across the entire training data set. In this case， we will opt for small training cycles.\n\n【37】Discussion\n\n【38】In the literature， a fixed number of parameters have often been used regardless of the patient； in our work the parameters are selected according to the EHG signal， the characteristics of which depend on the patient， the week of gestation， and external factors that also affect the uterine contraction muscles. Indeed， when applying the method to other examples， the parameters do not appear in the same order from one woman to another and from one week of gestation to another. Furthermore， we find that it is unnecessary to go beyond a certain number of principal components (usually 6). Since often the first six principal components already represent 90% of the signal information if not more. We therefore recommend the analysis of the principal component before any characterization of the EHG signal and thus of the uterine contractions. So， parameters that do not actually represent a good proportion of the signal information can be discarded，unless one wants to study the signal specifically with respect to these parameters.\n\n【39】Table 2： Principal components of a patient at 35 weeks of gestation.\n\n| PC  | Parameters  | PC  | Parameters  | PC  | Parameters  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| PC1  | RMS  | PC11  | SampEn  | PC21  | TM4  |\n| PC2  | MF  | PC12  | MAV2  | PC22  | EMG  |\n| PC3  | TM5  | PC13  | MF  | PC23  | RMS  |\n| PC4  | SM3  | PC14  | VCF  | PC24  | SM1  |\n| PC5  | MYOP  | PC15  | MNF  | PC25  | WL  |\n| PC6  | ApEn  | PC16  | LOG  | PC26  | EMG  |\n| PC7  | Tr  | PC17  | ZC  | PC27  | TTP  |\n| PC8  | ApEn  | PC18  | RMS  | PC28  | MNP  |\n| PC9  | MAV2  | PC19  | MAV1  | PC29  | SS  |\n| PC10  | TM3  | PC20  | DASDV  | PC30  | WAMP  |\n\n【41】In our work， due to the sampling frequency and time interval， we have made forecasts over short periods. This can be remedied by increasing for example the recording time to extend the prediction over an earlier prediction horizon. The physiological signals forecasting and in particular the EHG ones， is still at an immature stage， with few articles on this subject. In our perspectives， we would like to build up larger datasets with longer recording times in order to make predictions over hours.\n\n【42】It should also be noted that in this work we have not stuck to the standard classification on the basis of parameters or their associated methods. This is generally done in the literature so far to see which parameter(s) better identify or predict the contractions that will lead to labor， or which method(s) achieve this result or the classification between preterm and term birth. Future perspectives would be to consider representative parameters of the principal components for prediction (corresponding to what is done in the literature) and to compare the results with those obtained by proceeding in the way indicated in the present work. But the majorlimitation of our work is the size of our data due to the lack of a more representative database of local populations and more adapted to our needs. We hope to overcome this limitation with the validation of our recording kit.\n\n【43】Conclusion\n\n【44】In this work， we have prioritized the most commonly used parameters in the literature by the proportion of information on the signal they represent， using the principal component analysis method. This allows us to avoid choosing the parameters for characterizing the EHG at random； especially as the order of the main components of the EHG as observed here varies from one patient to another and according to the weeks of recording. Furthermore， this allows us to know that the parameters we consider in our prediction models best represent the signal. Our prediction model here is based on predicting the behavior of the EHG signal by the deep learning method called N-BEATS. This is a recent method that is proving itself in other areas compared to existing methods. It allows a learning process which， in order to last in time， needs a large quantity of data at the beginning which was not possible in our case due to the limits of the exploited database. It would therefore be desirable to have a database of its own for longer predictions.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 11:41:30", "endTime": "2024/09/24 11:42:35", "cost": 64.931}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:35", "update_time": "2024-09-23 19:42:35", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 19:41:29"}

In addition， a higher level of multiple micronutrient deficiency and exposure to heavy metals through environment priming the health issue. The etiology of anemia is multi-factorial， among physiological iron deficiency and hemopoietic toxicity caused by Lead (Pb) are considered as important. Current study aimed to unveil serum essential element (Fe， Zn， Cu， Mg and Ca)， blood Pb and Cd levels among anemic (Group-A； n=77) and non-anemic children (Group-B， n=77). Blood Pb， Cd and serum elements were quantified by Graphite Furnace and Flame Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy， respectively. Hemoglobin， reticulocyte count and 8-Aminolevulenic Acid Dehydratase (8-ALAD) activity were also assessed. Mean Hb， serum Fe and 8-ALAD activity was significantly (p<0.01) lower in Group-A compared to Group-B. Blood Cd levels were non-detectable， whereas mean Pb levels were higher among Group-A compared to Group-B but in prescribed safe limits (<10ug/dL). Group-A children's serum Fe levels correlated positively with ALADactivity(p<0.05)，serum Zn and Ca levels (p<0.01)； whereas a significant (p<0.01) inverse correlation was noted between Hb levels and serum Zn levels.Elevation of 8-ALAD activity is presumed under IDA to meet the physiological requirement of Hb， but in the current study despite severe anemia in Group-A no such observation was noted. In conclusion， anemia among Group-A children may be iron deficient rather induced by hematopoietic toxicity. Further， Zn deficiency is more prevalent in children of both the groups， which need intervention strategies. Dual deficiency effect of Fe and Zn on physiological levels and function of 8-ALAD activity needs to be elucidated.\n\n【2】Keywords： Iron deficiency anemia； Blood Pb levels； 6-ALAD； Seru essential elements\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Anemia is a condition in which the number of red blood cells is insufficient to meet the body's physiologic needs. It is a widespread public health problem associated with an increased risk of morbidity and mortality， especially in pregnant women and young children . The etiology for anemia is a multi-factorial classified as nutritional such as vitamin and mineral deficiencies as well as non-nutritional such as infection and hemoglobinopathies. It is well documented that nutritional anemia is the most prevalent condition compared to non-nutritional anemia； further about 50% of the anemia is due to iron deficiency， and the remainder due to other causes . The prevalence of anemia is particularly high in developing countries， where 39% of children under five years old， 48%of 5 to 14 year old children， 42% of all women and 52% of pregnant women are anemic .\n\n【5】The diagnostic procedures to determine anemia involves a number of tests such as physical examination of conjunctiva， tongue and laboratory tests such as estimation of hemoglobin， reticulocyte count， complete blood picture， peripheral smear for shape and size of RBCs， serum iron and ferritin levels. A set of any of these tests may give an indication of type of anemia. A normal Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV) associated with an increased reticulocyte count suggest rapid RBC loss， as in hemolysis or acute blood volume loss . Multiple micronutrient deficiencies often coexist in populations in developing countries. A deficiency of one micronutrient may influence the absorption， metabolism and/or excretion of another micronutrient . Moreover， excess zinc ingestion is a cause of copper deficiency .\n\n【6】On the other hand， the heavy metals such as Lead (Pb)， Cadmium (Cd)， Mercury (Hg) and Arsenic (As) are known as potential environmental contaminants and pose public health problem. Further， due to vast industrial applications of Pb， lack of enforcement strategies coupled with awareness， the population of developing countries are more prone to exposure . The recent studies suggested a higher prevalence of blood lead levels(BLL) among the children residing in the industrial area compared to urban； whereas the children from rural background had no exposure to Pb. Similarly the accumulation of Cd has raised concern recently due to its vast industrial and agricultural practices . It was proposed that Pb and Cd are similar to trace element， and may enter in to blood stream through “Divalent Metal Ion Transporter-1'(DMT-1). The recent studies suggest that iron deficiency further increases absorption per se of Pb . Exposure to Pb affects many organs， primarily hemopoietic， renal and central nervous systems， especially in growing children and pregnant women. The recent reports suggest that subclinical Pb toxicity affects the heme synthesis by inhibiting the 6-Aminolevulenic Acid Dehydratase activity (6-ALAD)， which is one of the key enzymes in heme synthesis . It is well established fact that inhibited 8-ALAD activity' has been considered as a hallmark of“Pb toxicity， whereas in iron deficiency this enzyme levels were also altered. Our studies on induction of iron deficiencyin laboratory animals through dietary restriction have shown the elevated levels of 8-ALAD activity to meet the physiological levels of hemoglobin .\n\n【7】In view of the given background， current study aimed to determine the serum essential element levels (Fe，Zn， Cu， Mg & Ca)， blood Pb and Cd levels as well as their interactions， if any， in anemic children undergoing blood transfusion.\n\n【8】Methods Study design and selection of subjects\n\n【9】A cross sectional case-control study was conducted among children from ‘Pediatric division of Niloufer Hospital， Hyderabad， India. The National Family Health Survey-4， India (NFHS-4： 2015-16) reported prevalence of moderate and severe anemia were 30%and 2% respectively among children. Therefore， considering total prevalence as 32%， an odds ratio 2.6 and power 90， a sample size of154 was arrived.\n\n【10】Anemic children (Group-A； n=77) admitted in the pediatric in-patient ward of Niloufer Hospital for ‘Blood Transfusion’ were enrolled as study subjects. The children with moderate (Hb： 8.00%g to 9.99% g) to severe (Hb<8.00% g) anemia was included in the study (WHO Criteria). Children aged between 1.6 to 11.0 years， with no history of previous blood transfusion were included in the study. Similarly age and sex matched non-anemic’ children (Group-B； n=77) admitted in the same in-patient ward suffering from ‘other than anemia'were selected as control subjects. The children who have the history of blood transfusion， evidence of hemolysis/blood loss， hemotological malignancy and chronic diseases were excluded from the study.\n\n【11】The information on age， height， weight， clinical signs and symptoms’ forr anemia， heavy metal toxicity andd nutritional deficiencies were collected using a pre-tested questionnaire. In addition the information on dietary habits and cooking practices was alsocollected from the attendants of subjects. The studyandprocedures were approved by Institutional Review Board (Institutional Ethics Committee for Human Studies) of the ICMR-National Institute of Nutrition， Hyderabad， India. As per the recommendations of IRB， written consent was obtained from the participants or their parents.\n\n【12】Sample collection\n\n【13】Approximately 3.0 mL of blood was collected by venipuncture from all the children. Two aliquots of blood samples were prepared using vacutainer tubes， one for whole blood and other aliquot was used for serum. The blood samples from Group-A children were collected before the blood transfusion. Peripheral blood smear was prepared for examination of abnormalities in RBC， WBC and platelets. Reticount was performed to determine the percentage of reticulocytes.\n\n【14】Laboratory Analysis\n\n【15】Estimation of serum albumin and hemoglobin levels\n\n【16】Serum albumin levels were estimated as described by Doumas &Biggs. ， based on increase in absorbance of Bromocresol Green(BCG) at 630 nm. Binding of the dye to serum albumin at pH 4.2 is directly proportional to the concentration of albumin estimated using Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) as standard. The Hemoglobin (Hb%) levels were determined by cyanmethemoglobin method， briefly， 20uL of blood was mixed with 5.0 mL of‘Drabkins reagent'(Potassium Ferric Cyanide Solution) and allowed to stand for 5 min to develop color. The color intensity was measured at 540 nm against known standard using Spectrophotometer (UNICAM-UV 300， Thermo， Cambridge，UK). Levels of Hb in each samples were then calculated based on [A540unk X Conc. of Hb Std. (g/dL)]/A540std.\n\n【17】Preparation of sample for metal/elemental estimations\n\n【18】To estimate the blood Pb， Cd levels and serum elemental levels， samples were subjected to closed microwave digestion”as explained by Reddy et al. Briefly， 1.0 mL of blood and 0.5 mL of serum were digested with 2.0 mL of ultrapure nitric acid (Merck， Mumbai， India) in a closed microwave (MARSXpress， CEM Corp.， Matthews， USA) digestion system. The certified reference standard samples for Pb， Cd and serum essential elements were also processed along with the samples， as quality controls\n\n【19】Estimation of blood Pb， Cd and serum elementallevels\n\n【20】ThebloodPband Cdlevels were determined in microwave digested samples against standard plot obtained from Pb and Cd standards on Graphite Furnace Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer (GF-AAS， Thermoelectron， USA). Certified blood Pb and Cd standards were used to ensure quality of estimates. Serum essential elements such as Fe，Zn， Cu，Mg and Ca levels were measured using Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer (Varian 220， Pala Alto， CA， USA) in the closed microwave digested serum samples. Certified serum standards with two levels of essential elements were also analyzed simultaneously on the instrument to ensure quality ofestimates.\n\n【21】6-ALAD activ ity\n\n【22】Blood 6-Aminolevulenic Acid Dehydratase (8-ALAD) activity was determined as explained by Granick et al. ， method. In brief， aliquots of 50 uL heparinized whole blood were added to Saponin buffer with and without aminolevulenic acid' as substrate and each was incubated at 37°C for 1 h. After termination of the reaction by addition of 50 uL trichloroacetic acid-HgCl2 solution， the samples were centrifuged (1000 × g， 5 min， 25°C). The resulting supernatant was isolated and combined with an equal volume of freshly-prepared modified Ehrlich reagent. After 10 min at 25°C， the absorbance of the mixture was determined at 553 nm using the UV300 spectrophotometer. ALAD activity (as nM/hr/mL blood) in each sample was calculated as=(OD553×1378).\n\n【23】Prevalence of deficiency/toxicity and interactions\n\n【24】The WHO criteria followed for categorization of anemia in to moderate (Hb： 8.00% g to 9.99% g) to severe (Hb： <8% g). The prevalence of micronutrient deficiencies was computed considering the cut-off values of serum Fe (<70 ug/dL)， Zn (<70 ug/dL)， Cu (<80hg/dL)，Mg (<1.8 mg/dL) and Ca (<8.0 mg/dL). The safe cut offlimits for blood Pb and Cd levels were considered as <10.0 ug/dL and <0.12ug/dL in children (CDC， Atlanta). The interactions/associations between essential elements and Pb， ALAD activity was assessed using statistical method of \"Pearson’s correlation co-efficiency.\n\n【25】Statistical analysis\n\n【26】Mean and Standard Deviation (SD) were calculated for all the variables. The student t-test was applied to assess the statistical difference in mean levels of various parameters between two groups. Relationships were identified by means of Pearson’s bivariate moment correlation coefficient. The results were considered significant at p<0.05. The data were analyzed using SPSS 15.0 Window’s version.\n\n【27】Results\n\n【28】Anthropometry\n\n【29】The information on anthropometry， dietary habits of Group-A and Group-B children were given in Table 1. The mean age of children from both the groups was comparable. Whereas mean height (p<0.05) and weight (p<0.01) of Group-A children was significantly low as compared to Group-B. However， mean Body Mass Index (BMI) was comparable between groups. The albumin levels were ranged from1.18 g/dL to 4.69 g/dL in Group-A， whereas 1.65 g/dL to 4.54 g/dL in Group-B children . Mean serum albumin levels in children from Group-A and Group-B were 3.1 ± 0.73 g/dL and 3.5±0.47 g/dL，respectively.\n\n【30】Clinical profile\n\n【31】The information on signs and symptoms ofanemia， metal toxicity and nutritional deficiency'were given in Table 2. Pale conjunctiva(99%) and fever (61%) was observed among the majority of children from Group-A， whereas no pale conjunctiva was reported in control Group-B. Bald tongue and anorexia was alsohigh among the Group-A children compared to Group-B . The signs and symptoms for nutritional deficiencies such as Bitot spot， keratomalacia etc. was not observed except conjunctival xerosis in 3% of Group-A children.\n\n【32】The mean serum albumin levels were significantly (p<0.01) low among Group-A children compared to Group-B . Hemoglobin levels were ranged from 5.6 g/dL to 9.9 g/dL and 12.0g/dL to 15.4 g/dL in Group-A and Group-B children， respectively. The mean Hb levels were significantly (p<0.01) low in Group-A compared to Group-B . A twofold higher reticulocyte count (above 1.0%) was noted in Group-A children than Group-B children. Approximately 40% of children from Group-A had microcytic hypochromic condition， whereas no such condition was observed among Group-B children .\n\n【33】Table 1： Anthropometry and Dietary Habits of children.\n\n| S.No.  | Parameter  | Group-A (n=77)  | Group-B (n=77)  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1  | Age(Y)  | 4.4±2.73  | 6.6±2.62  |\n| 2  | Height (Cm)  | 90.2±19.9”  | 115.4±18.32  |\n| 3  | Weight (kg)  | 12.3±5.86  | 18.8±7.02  |\n| 4  | BMI (Kg/m²)  | 14.7±2.66  | 13.9±2.45  |\n| 5  | Albumin (g/dL)  | 3.1±0.73\"  | 3.5±0.47  |\n| 6  | Vegetarian  | 27%(n=21)  | 5%(n=4)  |\n| 6  | Non-Veg.

The mean serum Fe levels were significantly(p<0.01) low among the children from Group-A as compared to Group-B . Serum Zn levels ranged from 28.0 ug/dL to245.0 ug/dL in Group-A， whereas Group-B children had 32.0 ug/dL to 156.0 ug/dL. Mean serum Zn levels were comparable between the groups. Group-A children serum Cu levels were ranged from 36.5 ug/dL to 195.0 ug/dL， whereas Group-B children serum Cu levels were 24.0 ug/dL to 195.0ug/dL.\n\n【44】Mean serum Cu levels was significantly (p<0.05) higher in Group-A children than Group-B . Serum Mg levels were ranged from 1.57 mg/dL to 4.13 mg/dL and 1.19 mg/dL to 3.31 mg/dL in Group-A and Group-B children， respectively. Serum mean Mg levels were significantly (p<0.01) higher in Group-A children compared to their counterparts . Group-A children serum Ca levels ranged from 4.8 mg/dL to 15.3 mg/dL， whereas in Group-B it ranged from 9.6 mg/dL to 14.2 mg/dL. A significant (p<0.01) low levels of serum Ca was noted in Group-A children compared to their counterpart children .\n\n【45】Blood Pb， Cd levels and ALAD activ ity\n\n【46】Blood cadmium levels were below the detection limits (0.1 ppb) in children of both the groups. While， the Blood Lead Levels (BLL) varied widely among Group-A children. The BLLs were ranging from0.15 ug/dL to 39.81 ug/dL in Group-A， whereas in Group-B children were 0.18 ug/dL to 8.14 ug/dL . The mean BLL were 4.9±7.45 ug/dL and 2.4±2.12 ug/dL in Group-A and Group-B children， respectively. Though the mean BLL of Group-A children were significantly (p<0.05) higher than Group-B， they were within the cut-off limits specified (<10 ug/dL) by CDC， Atlanta. The ALAD activity of the Group-A and Group-B children were ranged from 52.0 nM/mL to 841.0 nM/mL and 267 nM/mL to 909nM/mL erythrocytes/hr， respectively. The mean ALAD activity of Group-A children (437.8±215.93 nM/mL erythrocytes/h) was significantly (p<0.01) lower than counterparts (583.0±142.07nM/mL erythrocytes/h).\n\n【47】Prevalence of deficiency and toxicity\n\n【48】Among Group-A children， moderate anemia was noted in 55%children， whereas， severe anemia in 45% suggesting the need to undergo the blood transfusion. Serum Fe levels were deficient in 42%of Group-A and 5% of Group-B children. However， 47% of children from Group-A and 39% ofGroup-B children had serum Zn deficiency. About 12% of the children from both the categories were deficient for serum Cu levels. The serum Mg levels were deficient in 4% and 18%of the children from Group-A and Group-B， respectively. Whereas， serum Ca levels were deficient in 7% of children from Group-A， but no such deficiency was observed in their counterpart children.\n\n【49】Ten percent of Group-A children had BLL above 10 pg/dL， the safe cut-off limits set by Centre for Disease Control and Prevention， Atlanta， USA. In addition， 7% of Group-A children had elevated (>20ug/dL) blood Pb levels. In contrast， the BLL among the Group-B children were within the acceptable limit (<10 ug/dL) of CDC， Atlanta. However， 25% of Group-A and 16% of Group-B children had BLL above 5 ug/dL.\n\n【50】Correlations among Pb， Hb and ALAD Activity with serum elements\n\n【51】The correlations among the blood Pb levels， Hb， ALAD activity with serum elemental levels was given in Table 4. Blood Pb levels didn't correlated either with Hb levels， ALAD activity and serum elementallevels except with serum Caand albumin levels in Group-A. However， Group-A children's serum Fe levels correlated positively with ALAD activity (p<0.05)， serum Zn and Ca levels (p<0.01). Whereas， a significant (p<0.01) inverse correlations was noted between Hb levels and serum Zn levels among Group-A children .\n\n【52】Blood Pb levels of Group-B children correlate inversely with serum Zn (p<0.01)andMg(p<0.05)levels . Nonetheless， the ALAD activity was correlated positively with serum Zn (p<0.01) and Mg (p<0.05) levels in Group-B children. Whereas， neither Hb nor serum Fe levels have shown correlations with either BLL or serum elemental levels among Group-B children.\n\n【53】Discussion\n\n【54】Iron Deficient Anemia (IDA) is still a devastating public health issue in the third world countries like India. It is well established that the etiology for anemia is a multi-factorial and classified as nutritional deficiencies such as vitamin and minerals， as well as non-nutritional such as infection and hemoglobinopathies. It is noteworthy to mention that the predominant cause of anemia is due to iron deficiency， which could be attributed to inadequate dietary intake or consumption of foods with low amounts of bio-available Fe along with presence of inhibitors such as phytic acid and low intake of animal foods .\n\n【55】Physicians relies on pale conjunctiva and bald tongue’ as characteristic ‘sign and symptom’of anemia. In the current study， Group-A children were moderate to severe anemic and were undergoing for blood transfusion. Majority of children from Group-A had characteristic feature of pale conjunctiva (>98%) and bald tongue. In addition， significantly lower levels of Hb， serum Fe and albumin levels among the anemic children suggests the magnitude of Iron Deficiency Anemia’ among Group-A children. As per the WHO criteria of anemia categorization， severe anemia was noted among 45% of children and moderated anemia was55% in the anemic children. Similarly， the National Family Health\n\n【56】Table 4： Correlations among Hb， ALAD activity， serum elements and Pb.\n\n【57】Group-A Children Group-B Children\n\n|  | Group-A Children  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | Group-B Children  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Alb  | Hb  | ALAD  | Fe  | Zn  | Cu  | Mg  | Ca  | Pb  | Alb  | Hb  | ALAD  | Fe  | Zn  | Cu  | Mg  | Ca  | Pb  |\n| Alb  | 1  | 0.038  | 0.188  | 0.198  | 0.109  | 0.251  | 0.511”  | 0.729”  | 0.436\"  | 1  | -0.147  | 0.121  | 0.126  | 0.357  | 0.425  | 0.423”  | 0.854”  | -0.071  |\n| Hb  | 0.038  | 1  | -0.16  | -0.044  | -0.298  | 0.196  | 0.039  | -0.221  | 0.053  | -0.147  | 1  | 0.255  | -0.01  | 0.058  | -0.272  | 0.104  | -0.087  | -0.103  |\n| ALAD  | 0.188  | -0.16  | 1  | 0.369°  | 0.084  | 0.13  | 0.026  | 0.235  | -0.174  | 0.121  | 0.255  | 1  | 0.03  | 0.532”  | -0.084  | 0.402°  | 0.201  | -0.065  |\n| Fe  | 0.198  | -0.044  | 0.369  | 1  | 0.340  | 0.119  | 0.1  | 0.298  | 0.019  | 0.126  | -0.01  | 0.03  | 1  | 0.046  | -0.099  | -0.05  | -0.077  | 0.083  |\n| Zn  | 0.109  | -0.298  | 0.084  | 0.340”  | 1  | -0.043  | 0.112  | 0.383\"  | -0.054  | 0.357°  | 0.058  | 0.532”  | 0.046  | 1  | 0.035  | 0.734”  | 0.564”  | -0.389°  |\n| Pb  | 0.436  | 0.053  | -0.174  | 0.019  | -0.054  | 0.107  | 0.196  | 0.274  | 1  | -0.071  | -0.103  | -0.065  | 0.083  | -0.389  | 0.088  | -0.325°  | -0.151  | 1  |\n\n【59】Alb： Albumin； Hb： Haemoglobin； ALAD： Aminolevulenic Acid Dehydratase Activity； significantly correlated at P<0.05； \"Significantly Correlated at P<0.01\n\n【60】Survey of India (NFHS) also reported that 30% of children are moderately anemic and 2% are severe anemia (NFHS-4： 2015-16). This was further corroborated with a 2 fold increase in reticulocyte count (above 1.0%) and ‘microcytic hypochromic condition'among anemic children compared to non-anemic children suggest a rapid turnover of the reticulocytes. It is well established fact that a high reticulocyte percentage or count reflects a marrow that is attempting to compensate for red cell destruction， or recovering from anemia. It is noteworthy to mention that， neither the metal toxicity nor other nutritional deficiency ‘signs and symptoms' were noted among children of either of the groups.\n\n【61】Recently thegrowing evidence suggests the association/relationship existbetween‘multiplemicronutrients'， further deficiency of one micronutrient may influence the levels of other micronutrients . In the current study， the serum Fe levels were deficient in the anemic children； in addition to this， they were deficient for other essential elements such as serum Zn， Cu， Mg and Ca levels. A decade of studies conducted by ICMR-NIN， Hyderabad in different vulnerable groups such as children， pregnant/postpartum women and livestock suggest an inter-relationship exist between Fe and Zn along with other essential elements . Further， it is alarming to note that Zn deficiency is more rampant in this population as compared to Fe deficiency. Trace mineral deficiencies usually occur when dietary intake is inadequate or result from metabolic imbalances produced by antagonistic or synergistic interactions among metals .\n\n【62】Plethora of literature suggests that Pb exposure results in hemopoietic toxicity . In the current study though the mean BLLs of anemic children were higher compared to non-anemic children， but within specified limits (<10 ug/dL) of CDC， Atlanta. So the anemia among Group-A children could be due to nutritional deficiency. Further， higher mean of BLL in anemic children compared to controls could be due to increased absorption per se of Pb under essential elemental deficiency， which could be mediated through Divalent Metal ion Transporter-1(DMT-1) at the mucosal surface . Our previous studies of dietary iron restriction followed by Pb exposure have shown significantly higher BLL suggesting the increased absorption through GI tract under Fe deficient condition .\n\n【63】The associations between BLLs， ALAD activity， Hb and serum essential element levels have been considered to illustrate the relationship between different functional parameters . Serum albuminlevelsarelongbeenconsidered asan index ofhealthand disease status. In the current study anemic children had hypoalbuminism， which could be malnutrition/altered nutrition or low protein intake by the children. In addition， significant positive correlations were noted between serum albumin levels with serum Cu， Mg， Ca and Pb. It is well established fact that albumin acts as buffering agent and involved in transportation of a variety of substances (ligands) include endogenous substances such as bilirubin and fatty acids， metals and other ions， hormones， as well as exogenous substances such as folic acid and drugs . The positive association between albumin and Pb could be to attributed to presence of -thiol’group containing amino acids in albumin， which has higher affinitytowards Pb， and deficiency of essential elementals might have increased the Pb absorption per se . In addition， significant inverse relationship between Zn & Hb and positive association of Fe with ALAD and Zn suggests the importance of co-factors’ for heme synthesis. Similarly， complex interactions were noted between different essential elements in both anemic and non-anemic children infers the interdependency of various elements to perform physiological function. Lack of data on serum ferritin/transferrin levels and MCV are the limitations of current study， whereas the strengths are quantification of various essential elements and heavy metals and assessing their interactions.\n\n【64】Conclusion\n\n【65】The results of present study conclude that anemia among the Group-A children may be iron deficient rather heavy metal induced hematopoietic toxicity. Further， Zn deficiency is more prevalent in children of both the groups， which need intervention strategies. Dual deficiency effect of Fe and Zn on physiological levels and function of8-ALAD activity needs to be elucidated.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 11:34:29", "endTime": "2024/09/24 11:35:11", "cost": 42.07}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:35", "update_time": "2024-09-23 19:35:11", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 19:34:29"}

When such regulatory bodies review and implement the regulations， they should always hold the fundamental principles.\n\n【4】The Dental Council of Hong Kong (\"Dental Council) wrote a letter to all registered dentists in Hong Kong on December 2， 2019， mentioned that they told the registered dentists there was a review of the “Code of Professional Discipline of Dental Practitioners in Hong Kong”on June 13，2019 . The Secretary of Dental Council， Maria Chow stated that the council endorsed the revised code recommended by the taskforce， and would take immediate effect . However， there was neither a list of the composition of the taskforce nor any opinion or suggestion sought from the registered dentists and the general public. Registered dentists read the revised code of ethics about their profession and are bounded by it without being informed of the rationales behind.\n\n【5】1.12 Information about Medical and Dental Innovations：\n\n【6】It is difficult to understand and to comply with the above sections during the release of the information directly or indirectly. “Adequately tested”， “evidence base\"，“evidence-based research\"，“peer approval\"， “relevant professional and academic bodies\" are not defined.\n\n【7】Especially for (e)， how can a registered dentist in private， the government， in NGOs or in the university sector etc. stop patients seeking consultation from him? What is the proper procedure to release the information to avoid being accused of (e)? Will there be any practical guide for him to follow? The staff in the dental faculty of the University of Hong Kong takes private cases and earn extra income， there is no difference for all the registered dentists.\n\n【8】For the \"Guidelines on Personal Web Pages and Social Media for Dentists” 2.5 A dentist should regularly review the privacy settings to ensure that information is not accessed by unintended audiences. However， a dentist should remember that even the strictest privacy settings do not guarantee that information will be kept secure and any information that posted could be viewed by anyone including the dentist's patients and colleagues.\n\n【9】2.6 Even if a dentist does not identify himself as a dental professional， he may still put his registration at risk if displaying inappropriate behavior whilst using social media.\n\n【10】The disciplinary action of any registered dentist is held by the Dental Council of Hong Kong ， which is established under the Chapter 156，“Dentist Registration Ordinance”， no one oversees the Dental Council， it means that registered dentists and citizens in Hong Kong have not yet been informed of\"Why\"，“How\"， “When”，“Who”and“What”about the establishment and/or the changes the code of ethics before it takes immediate effect. Registered dentists in Hong Kong only know the endorsed codes on December 2， 2019during the sudden announcement. If any dentist does not understand it or “is accused to offend” the code， there will be a disciplinary hearing against him， his reputation will be damaged immediately and could not be recovered.\n\n【11】Whether the code of ethics is lawful or not has not been accessed， the Secretary of the Dental Council does not request the declaration of conflict of interest of the witnesses and Council members (i.e. the judges) during the council hearing， self-declaration is the current practice. No one knows what happened until there is a judgment. From the draft to the judgment of the defendant dentist， no one examines whether the taskforce or the council member know what is“adequately tested”， “evidence base\"， “evidence-based research”，“peer approval\"， “relevant professional and academic bodies\".\n\n【12】In 1996， David et al.  and colleagues clarified the definition of this tributary of evidence-based medicine as \"the conscientious， explicit and judicious use ofcurrent best evidence in making decisions about the care of individual patients. Evidence-based medicine means integrating individual clinical expertise with the best available external clinical evidence from systematic research . Did the Taskforce members have the knowledgeeof evidence-based medicine? Did the minutes of the taskforce record this during the discussion? Did they use any other definition? Can we get the minutes during the drafting? There should be no secrecy in such drafting and meetings. Did they declare the conflict of interest before the meeting?\n\n【13】Most people do not know what an appeal is until they face it. An appeal is a fundamental premise of many legal systems that appellate courts review questions of law de novo， but appellate courts do not conduct independent fact-finding . Instead， appellate courts will generally defer to the record established by the trial court， unless some error occurred during the fact-finding process. Appeals only SO function both as a process for error correction as well as a process of clarifying and interpreting law . All these mean that there is no way to prevent or to correct the fundamental flaws of The Code of Ethics.\n\n【14】“The question of whether any particular course of conduct amounts to unprofessional conduct， and the gravity of such unprofessional conduct and of any conviction， are matters which the council will determine after considering the evidence in each individual case. The council， having regard to its quasi-judicial function， is not able to advise individuals. Dental practitioners desiring detailed advice on questions of professional conduct arising in particular circumstances may consult professional organizations or societies such as Hong Kong Dental Association and/or seek professional legal advice”. \"This code is not a substitute for the provisions of legislation and case law. If there is any conflict between this code and the law， the law takes precedence.\" Compare with the Good Medical Practice of Australian Medical Council ， The Australian Medical Council respects the law and thus could be considered being overseen and be restricted by the existing law.\n\n【15】The dental council members and unknown people in the taskforce might have the conflict of interest without the declaration； the dental council is a quasi-judiciary body with the power but not being overseen at all. The mechanism of the endorsement of the code of ethics could be abused easly. Filing a judicial review is the only method to stop The Code of Ethics take immediate effect， however， the applicant will waste huge amount of time， effort and money during the procedure.\n\n【16】The registered dentists and the general public could have no method to know the people involved previously since only current Council member list is given . When will we know the list of the people involved? Should there be a chance that the code of ethics could be used as a tool to restrict the freedom of speech or the release of the medical and dental innovation? Should the dental council endorse the code without being overseen? In what way and when can we know whether there is a conflict of interest for the whole issue? Will anyone work to minimize the chance that the code could be used as a tool to harm the innocent dentist or the competitor?\n\n【17】Declaration of Conflict ofInterest\n\n【18】The author is a registered dentist in private practice in Hong Kong， Patent and Trademark owner， Director of company limited， Editor and Reviewer of Medical and Dental Journals： and the Founding President of an Institutional Review Board.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 11:36:57", "endTime": "2024/09/24 11:37:11", "cost": 13.974}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:35", "update_time": "2024-09-23 19:37:11", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 19:36:56"}

Vertebral fusion becomes visible only after spinal ossification reaches completion in a young child .\n\n【6】This syndrome can be associated with scoliosis， Sprengel's shoulder， torticollis， hypoplasia of upper limb， genitourinary， cardiovascular abnormalities. More than 50% of the cases are associated with congenital scoliosis， 30% of them with deafness， 20% to 30% with Sprengel's deformity， 12% to15% with cervical ribs and 4% to 29% can show cardiovascular abnormalities .\n\n【7】Case Presentation\n\n【8】A 6-year old girl came with a complaint of right scapular pain on December 244， 2021 from the past 10 to 15 days. There was a gradual onset of pain and it was aggravated by doing overhead activities and relieved by rest. No other signs of heaviness， tingling or numbness were present. No history of recent injury or trauma was reported by the girl. According to mother-child was full term and C-section was done followed by an immediate birth cry. The mother didn’t have any postnatal complications.A vaccination course was completed. There was no history of delayed milestones Child started walking at age of 10 months. The child was having satisfactory physical and mental performance in the school as per parents and teachers. She was independent altogether activities of daily living. On observation， the child was having good build， short stature with low hairline， short neck， and decreased neck mobility. Facial expressions were symmetrical.\n\n【9】Right Cervico dorsal scoliosis along with kyphosis was present. Shoulder elevated on the right side， B/L wrist Radial deviation was there in the wrist along with hypoplastic thumb (one extra finger in the left thumb).\n\n【10】Mirror movements were present and gait was normal. Higher mental functions were normal and the child responded well to the commands.\n\n【11】Pain intensity on VAS score was 6. Tenderness was present in the medial border of the right scapula and bilateral tightness of sternocleidomastoid was present. Neck range of motion was restricted and is mentioned in Table 1.\n\n【12】Table 1： Neck range of motion was restricted.\n\n| Neck (Range of motion)  | Right  | Left  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Rotation  | 25 degree  | 15 degree  |\n| Side flexion  | 10 degree  | 11 degree  |\n| Flexion  | 35 degree  |  |\n| Extension  | 40 degree  |  |\n|  |  |  |\n\n【14】ROM of the bilateral shoulder joint was full.

Self-correction exercises and active exercises for both upper limb and neck were explained to the patient. After3 weeks of physiotherapy intervention， the patient was reassessed. The pain was reduced to a VAS score of 0. Exercises help to improve mobility and reduce the stiffness in the neck. Postural correction also helps to create self-awareness. Every day physiotherapy sessions helped the girl not only to develop the habit of regular exercise and well being but also boost the confidence level of the child.\n\n【52】Klippel-Feil syndrome remains asymptomatic many times and intervention is only given only when symptoms are present. Due to altered biomechanics， hypomobility at one level will be compensated by the hypermobility at the other level of the spine which can lead to secondary complications and functional impairment. Early intervention with physiotherapy will help to maintain the strength and mobility of the joint and prevent secondary degenerative changes.\n\n【53】In 1985 a study was done where 11 children with Klippel-Feil syndrome were classified into 3 categories， Group 1 patients with an unstable fusion pattern， Group 2 patients with craniocervical abnormalities Group 3 patients with cervical spinal canal stenosis.

According to his report， a patient can be well managed conservatively unless neurological deficit or cervical instability is present .\n\n【56】There have been lesser studies on physiotherapy management of Klippel-Feil syndrome. This study will provide an insight that a rare syndrome can be managed efficiently and can be a boon to those who are facing cosmetic and social stigma in society.\n\n【57】Conclusion\n\n【58】Early identification and physiotherapy intervention will improve mobility， prevent secondary complications and thus help to develop the confidence of the patient.

Unusually， in our patient the metastatic calcification with Metastatic Pulmonary Calcification (MCP)， vascular calcification， soft tissue calcification surrounding large joint and calcific uremic arteriolopathy. He underwent parathyroidectomy for secondary hyperparathyroidism. Five months after surgery a rapid regression of MCP and soft tissue calcification was observed， but calcific uremic arteriolopathy keep progressive development.\n\n【2】Case Presentation\n\n【3】A 43-year-old man with uremia due to glomerulonephritis， receiving hemodialysis since 2010， three times per week， four hours per time， was presented with ulcer of left heel for 1 month. He found a swelling over the right shoulder joint in early 2011. The swelling was mobile and soft， and grew rapidly from 2 cm to 10 cm in five months， but he had neither pain nor skin changes. There was no special treatment or regular examination of serum calcium， phosphorus and intact Parathyroid Hormone (iPTH). Over the next two years， another swelling developed over the left elbow joint similar to the ones described for the right shoulder joint. He hospitalized for lumbosacral area and bower limbs pain in July 2016. Blood tests revealed： (iPTH) 2156.5 pg/ml (<72 pg/ml). Computed Tomography (CT) scans showed bilateral， diffuse， centrilobular， ground-glass opacities areas distributed in the upper lobes . He was diagnosed with uremic renal osteopathy and uremic pulmonary metastatic calcification. There was no significant decrease in iPTH level after treatment with calcimimetics for 2 months. The lumbosacral area and bower limbs pain still progresses. He was difficulty in walking by the end of 2017. One yearlater， the patient returned to our hospital with the complaint of severe pain in left heel. In the past eight years， his height has been shortened by 6cm and his weight has dropped by 20kg.\n\n【4】Physical examination on admission showed： Emaciated form， a blood pressure of BP 144/96mmHg， a pulse rate of 90/min， a body temperature of 36.5℃ and a respiratory rate of 28/min. Two irregular， hard masses were found around right shoulder joint and left elbow joint. Joint range of (A) and coronal (B) computed tomography in lungs window shows more calcifications in both upper lungs. motion was normal and with no pain. Tender and necrotic indurated plaques with surrounding erythema were noted on his left heel.\n\n【5】Blood tests revealed： Calcium 2.27 (2.57) mg/dl，phosphorus of 2.53 (0.6) mg/dl， and iPTH levels up to 2580.5 pg/ml. Parathyroid scintigraphywas performed 15 min and 2 h after injection of Tc99m MIBI. The Tc-99 MIBI scintigraphy demonstrated a focus of intense uptake in the upper pole of the right lobe， lower and upper pole of left lobe on the early and late images. CT scans show multiple， centrilobular， calcified nodules through-out both lungs . The nodules were predominant in the upper and mid lung zones which was worse than 2016. Severe vascular calcification of thoracic and lower limb ， multilobulated calcified masses around the right shoulder joint were found at the same time . X-ray of the knee joint showed stripe shaped calcification of lower extremity vessels .\n\n【6】Total parathyroidectomy was performed in October 2018. Five parathyroid glands were excised . The pathological results in adenomatoid hyperplasia. The pain of lumbosacral and lower limbs was significantly relieved the second day after operation， but the pain on heel ulcer was not relieved. The patient was re-checked5 months after operation to evaluate the amelioration of metastatic calcification. CT scans revealed reduced metastatic pulmonary calcification . Peri-articular soft-tissue calcifications ofthe right shoulder were barely visible . X-ray of knee joint showed have no change . calciphylaxis on his left heel got worsen .\n\n【7】Discussion\n\n【8】With the advent of hemodialysis technology， the incidence of secondary hyperparathyroidism is rapidly increasing and metastatic calcification has become prominent. Metastatic calcification refers to the deposition of calcium in normal tissue， that is commonly associated with secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients on maintenance hemodialysis. Regions most commonly involved by this pathology are subcutaneous tissue， soft tissues of periarticular， vascular wall， internal organs . In the presented case， a middle-aged patient suffered from multiple metastatic calcification due to secondary hyperparathyroidism. The biggest differences of our patient are the widespread metastatic calcification with pulmonary metastases， vascular calcification， soft tissue calcification surrounding large joint and calcific uremic arteriolopathy. To our knowledge， no similar researches have been reported in the past.\n\n【9】The diagnosis of secondary hyperparathyroidism is mainly depending on the history of chronic renal failure and elevated PTH levels， hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia were also observed.\n\n【10】Visceral calcinosis can affect lung， stomach， heart， pancreas， and kidneys， but lung is the most vulnerable organ . The pathological characteristics of Metastatic Pulmonary Calcification (MPC) is calcium salt deposition in basement membranes ofthe epithelium and endothelium of pulmonaryalveoli . The main pathogenesis of MPC has not yet been illustrated， but some factors， such as hypercalcemia and hyperphosphatemia， dialysis-associated intermittent acid-base imbalance， and local secretion of free hydrogen ions in the lungs， kidneys， and stomach have been suggested as the risk factors for MPC formation . The diagnostic rate of MPC is very low， but histological changes of MPC are seen at autopsy in 60% to 75% of maintenance hemodialysis patients . This may probably due to insufficient sensitivity of chest X-ray examination， poorly understood about the imaging manifestations of MPC among clinicians， and the benign clinical course of the disease.\n\n【11】Chest radiographs are not very sensitive in the detection of MPC， especially in early stage of disease (small calcifications)， and are usually show patchy or confluent airspace opacities or normal. CT has high sensitivity in an early detection of MPC. A chest CT scan of metastatic pulmonary calcification reveals of bilateral， diffuse， centrilobular， ground-glass nodular opacities and partially calcified nodules or consolidations， predominantly in the upper lung fields， is the most common finding on . Calcium preferentially deposits in relatively alkaline tissues. The upperlung fields have high Ventilation/Perfusion (V/Q) ratio， creating high oxygen and low carbon dioxide levels.\n\n【12】The high V/Q ratio results in decreased PaCO， and increased pH . Therefore， it had nothing strange that the lung apex is more commonly involved than the lung base. In our case showed symmetrical， multiple， centrilobular areas of ground-glass opacity throughout both upper lung area in 2016. Preoperative CT scan showed more calcareous were deposited in upper lung zones， but not in lung base，which was in accordance with the characteristics of MPC imaging changes. In addition， radionuclide imaging is another useful technique in finding out the early MPC， demonstrating generally symmetrical and increased radioactive isotope uptake in affected lung fields . The pathological examination is the diagnostical golden standard for metastatic pulmonary calcification. However， it is largely limited in clinical applications since it is an invasive procedure.\n\n【13】MPC is a benign lesion， it generally slows progression in a long time， but it can also deteriorate rapidly within several weeks or months. Most patients with MPC are asymptomatic， but several cases of hemoptysis， cough， dyspnea have been reported . In our case， diffuse， patchy high-density shadows were found in both upper lungs in 2016. The imaging changes of MPC were obviously aggravated in 2018 before operation， but throughout， the patient have no any respiratory symptoms. Preoperative pulmonary function test mainly shows mild restrictive ventilatory dysfunction. The pathological changes were absorbed gradually after five months of operation.\n\n【14】So far， the best treatment of MPC has not been established. The mainstayoftreatmentisnormalizationofphosphate and calciumlevels， primarily with phosphate binders. Another means is too applicate of active vitamin D to control secondary hyperparathyroidism on the basis of maintaining normal calcium-phosphorus product . Most of these patients with asymptomatic， non-progressive MPC do not need to intervention since these patients eventually died of other causes instead of MPC. Cases have been reported that MPC can be fully absorbed after parathyroidectomy . More research’s need to be done to see whether renal transplant is good for MPC. In this case， the patient has no any respiratory symptoms， however， besides MPC， the patient had multiple periarticular metastatic calcifications， severe systemic vascular calcification， bone deformation，bone pain and calciphylaxis of the heel at the same time. Therefore， he underwent total parathyroidectomy. Five months after surgery a rapid regression of MCP was observed.\n\n【15】Soft tissue calcifications are another common manifestation of secondary hyperparathyroidism， characterized by large calcium phosphate deposition into cutaneous and subcutaneous tissues. Depositing of calcium salt in periarticular soft tissue region on patients of maintenance hemodialysis for chronic renal failure call Uremic Tumoral Calcinosis (UTC). Its estimated incidence is between 0.5% and 7% of hemodialysis patients . It usually presents with benign nodules at periarticular sites， mainly manifests as firm， painless， lobular， tumor-like masses around the joints that can lead to limitation of movement of joint when large in size. The key feature is absence of erosion and destruction of nearby bone， and such lesions is reversible after medication or parathyroidectomy . The sites commonly affected are soft tissues of periarticular shoulder， elbow， hip regions ， other areas such as wrist ， spine ， and knee have been observed . Our patient had extensive involvement of the shoulder and elbow； findings were consistent with metastatic calcinosis cut is secondary to TC. Why does it preferentially occur around joints? The exact mechanism behind this clinical entity is unknown. It may be related to the pH value of joint fluid， like the pathogenesis of gout. However， there have been no related experimental investigations published on this subject. In the natural course of such lesions is usually slow and progressive over several years . Sometimes， too much tumoral masses leads to ulceration with superadded secondary infection. In this case， five months after surgery， a rapid complete absorption of the tumoral masses around the right shoulder and left were observed.\n\n【16】Additionally， this case also showed calcification in vessels along chest and limbs. There was no improvement in systemic vascular calcification， instead an aggravation of calcific uremic arteriolopathy on his left heel was observed. These results consistent with the previous reports ， indicating that once calcification develops it probably cannot be reversed and tends to become more severe as time passes.\n\n【17】Overall， we report this case for the purpose of expanding the clinical and treatment of multiple metastatic calcifications in patient with SHPTH. MPC associated with uremia is potentially reversible， and can resolve after parathyroidectomy， but vascular calcification cannot be reversed and tends to deteriorate as time passes.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 11:33:24", "endTime": "2024/09/24 11:36:30", "cost": 186.183}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:35", "update_time": "2024-09-23 19:36:28", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 19:33:22"}

A well-known complication of nephrotic syndrome is increased risk of Venous Thromboembolism (VTE)， caused by various physiologic changes. Multiple treatment options are available for the treatment of VTE， including heparin， warfarin，and non-warfarin oral anticoagulants such as rivaroxaban. In this case report， we describe a 25-year-old male who presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with a Pulmonary Embolism (PE). He was deemed low-risk and eligible for discharge from the ED with rivaroxaban. The treatment is believed to have failed after he developed another VTE in a renal vein five months later while taking rivaroxaban daily. He was admitted to the hospital for thrombolysis and was subsequently diagnosed with nephrotic syndrome and hypoalbuminemia. There is no available data on the use of rivaroxaban in patients with nephrotic syndrome. Despite the fact that hypoalbuminemia could result in higher serum concentration of free drug for highly protein-bound agents such as rivaroxaban， the additional VTE risk inherent to NS appears to have led to re-thrombosis in this patient. Based on the pathophysiology of nephrotic syndrome， we caution the use of rivaroxaban in patients with this condition.\n\n【2】Keywords： Rivaroxaban； Venous thromboembolism； Nephrotic syndrome； Hypoalbuminemia； Pulmonary embolism；Anticoagulation\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Nephrotic Syndrome (NS) is a rare manifestation ofkidney disease with an annual incidence of three per 100，000 persons . NS is defined as proteinuria >3.5 grams per 1.73 m止body surface area per day in association with hypoalbuminemia， peripheral edema， and hypercholesterolemia . NS may be caused by systemic disease， medication， infection， or intrinsic renal disease .\n\n【5】Development of VTE is a well-known risk of NS with incidence of up to 25% . However， not all causes of NS confer the same risk of VTE. Risk is higher in patients with membranous nephropathy compared to focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and IgA nephropathy . A number of physiologic changes occur in patients with NS that may explain the prothrombotic state， which can be generalized as increased platelet reactivity， increased activation of the coagulation system， and reduced activity of the fibrinolytic system .\n\n【6】VTE includes both Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) as well as Pulmonary Embolism (PE). PE may be present in 40% to 50% of patients with DVT and has an average mortality of 10% to 15% in the first one to three months after diagnosis .Other complications of DVT and PE include right ventricular dysfunction and post-thrombotic syndrome， which is characterized by pain， heaviness， and swelling of the leg secondary to venous valvular damage caused by the venous thrombus .\n\n【7】Thereare a number oftreatments for patients with VTE，including heparin，low molecular weight heparins， vitamin K antagonists (i.e. warfarin)， and non-warfarin oral anticoagulants， including factor Xa inhibitors and direct thrombin inhibitors . Of the non-warfarin oral anticoagulants， rivaroxaban， apixaban， edoxaban， and dabigatran are all FDA-approved for treatment of DVT and PE. Rivaroxaban was shown to be a non-inferior treatment option for DVTand PE when compared with the standard of care (i.e. enoxaparin and warfarin.) in the EINSTEIN and EINSTEIN PE trials. Rivaroxaban treatment demonstrates unique advantages over traditional therapy with warfarin due to decreased need for laboratory monitoring， dosing adjustments， and decreased costs when compared to the standard treatment . Rivaroxaban is a highly protein-bound drug with 92% to 95% protein binding(primarily to albumin). It is hepatically metabolized with a terminal half-life of 5 h to 9 h. Approximately 66% of drug excretion occurs in the urine via active tubular secretion . Patients with severely reduced kidney function were excluded from the EINSTEIN and EINSTEIN PE studies； therefore， rivaroxaban should be used with caution in patients with advanced kidney disease . EINSTEIN does not report any demographic or outcomes data in patients with nephrotic syndrome. Clinical management of rivaroxaban in this unique subset of patients remains unclear. This case report describes a recurrence of VTE in a young， previously healthy， obese male receiving rivaroxaban treatment for an unprovoked PE who was later diagnosed with nephrotic syndrome.\n\n【8】Case Presentation\n\n【9】A 25-year-old Hispanic male presented to the emergency department with a chief complaint of chest pain after traveling for approximately 24 h via airplane and car. His past medical history was significant only for obesity， weighing 120 kg with a BMI of 36.8kg/m²at presentation. There was no known family history of VTE. A chest CT was obtained， which revealed a PE in the subsegmental arteries of the posterior basal right lung. Patient was deemed low-risk based on the absence of Hestia criteria， and discharged with outpatient management . He was prescribed rivaroxaban 15 mg by mouth twice daily for 21 days， followed by rivaroxaban 20 mg by mouth daily for 12 months. Of note， a Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (CMP) upon presentation revealed hypoalbuminemia， with a serum albumin of 3.0 g/dL (normal 3.4 g/dL to 5.0 g/dL). Serum creatinine at that time was 1.06 mg/dL and BUN was 20 mg/dL， both within normal limits.\n\n【10】He followed up with his Primary Care Provider (PCP) two days later and was prescribed tramadol 50 mg and cyclobenzaprine 5 mg for persistent abdominal and chest pain， which was attributed to the recent PE. He also followed up with the outpatient Embolism Clinic， managed by clinical pharmacists，6 weeks after the PE diagnosis . At this visit， the patient reported no issues with rivaroxaban therapy， indicating no adverse effects or barriers to adherence. He had not missed any doses and the clinical pharmacist verified appropriate fill history with his outpatient pharmacy. Duration of therapy and additional education points were also discussed and documented at that time.\n\n【11】Two months later， the patient presented to the ED with severe abdominal pain and was found to have an extensive right renal vein thrombus that extended into the Inferior Vena Cava (IVC). Of note， the patient was still taking rivaroxaban， as prescribed， at this time. He was noted to have a serum albumin level of 1.8 g/dL.\n\n【12】He was admitted to the hospital， underwent catheter-directed thrombolysis with alteplase and systemic heparin， and a suprarenal IVC filter was placed. Serial imaging showed resolution of caval thrombus with residual non-occlusive renal vein thrombosis， at which point the IVC filter was removed. ue to developing a new， large thrombus while being therapeutically anticoagulated， Hematology began an inpatient hypercoagulability work-up . A scrotal ultra品sound and germcell tumor markers were obtainedto rule out malignancy-related VTE； both were normal . Nephrology also began to work up and treat his NS empirically with methylprednisolone and prednisone.\n\n【13】Table 1： Hypercoagulability Screens (all negative).\n\n【14】Hypercoagulability Screens (all negative)\n\n| Anti-neutrophil antibody  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Dilute Russel viper venom (lupus anticoagulant)  |  |\n| Factor V Leiden mutation R506Q  |  |\n| Prothrombin Factor 2 G20210A  |  |\n| IgG and IgM beta 2 glycoproteins (antiphospholipid syndrome)  |  |\n| Anti cardiolipin IgG antibody  |  |\n| Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria panel (RBC and WBC)  |  |\n\n【16】Table 2： Other hypercoagulability-associated laboratory tests.\n\n| Other Hypercoagulability-Associated Laboratory Tests  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Test  | Result  | ReferenceRange  |\n| C3 Complement  | 102 mg/dL  | 90 to180 mg/dL  |\n| C4 Complement  | 9 mg/dLt  | 10 to 40 mg/dL  |\n| Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) IgG  | <1：20  | <1：20  |\n| Phospholipase A2 receptor antibody lgG  | <1：10  | <1：10  |\n| Antithrombin 3 level  | 72% | 82% to 136%  |\n| Double Stranded DNA antibody  | 32 units  | 0 to 99 units  |\n| Serum alpha-tetoprotein  | 3.9 ng/mL  | 0.7.9 ng/mL  |\n| Serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin  | <1U/L  | 0 to 3 IU/L  |\n| Glomerular basement membrane antibodyIgG  | 0AU/mL  | 0 to 19 AU/mL  |\n| IgM  | 40 mg/dL  | 40 to 230 mg/dL  |\n| IgG  | 616mg/dLt  | 700 to 1600mg/dL  |\n| IgA  | 272 mg/dL  | 70 to 400 mg/dL  |\n| Platelet aggregation  | Normal with allagonists  |  |\n| Immunofixation for monoclonal protein band  | Negative  |  |\n\n【18】tIndicates result value outside of the reference range\n\n【19】The decision was made to switch this patient from rivaroxaban to warfarin. He was discharged after 9 days of hospitalization with a5-day prescription for therapeutic enoxaparin as a bridge to warfarin therapy. The patient has remained on warfarin with no further episodes of VTE to date.\n\n【20】His NS was empirically treated with prednisone until biopsy Wasdone three months after discharge. Immunofluorescence stain for PLA2R and immunoperoxidase stain for TSHD7A， the most common antigens for membranous nephropathy， were both negative at that time . Immunofluorescence stain showed anti-IgG predominant glomerular capillary loop deposits consistent with membranous nephropathy. Electron microscopy also showed numerous subepithelial electron dense deposits， consistent with membranous glomerulopathy. He was started on cyclosporine 100mg by mouth twice a day， and prednisone was decreased to 40 mg by mouth daily. Immunosuppressive therapy， such as cyclosporine Orcyclophosphamide， is indicated in patients with idiopathic membranous glomerulonephropathy who have experienced severe or life-threatening symptoms related to NS . The prednisone dose was tapered and stopped slowly over the following 8 months due to the development of iatrogenic Cushing Syndrome.\n\n【21】Discussion\n\n【22】Thrombus recurrence while therapeuticallyanticoagulated with rivaroxaban is uncommon . The EINSTEINPE trial demonstrated rivaroxaban treatment provided similar protection against recurrent VTE compared to the standard treatment of enoxaparin bridged to a vitamin K antagonist . However， while patients with creatinine clearance <30 mL/min were excluded， there was no reporting of albumin levels or presence of proteinuria in the study. The clinical conundrum described above raises the question of Rivaroxaban's efficacy for treatment of PE in patients with NS. There is currently no published data on the efficacy of rivaroxaban in patients with NS or hypoalbuminemia.\n\n【23】Rivaroxaban is a direct factor Xa inhibitor that was approved for the treatment of DVT and PE in 2012. Dabigatran， apixaban， edoxaban， and enoxaparin bridged to a vitamin K antagonist are also approved for the treatment of venous thromboembolism . Rivaroxaban is highly (92% to 95%) bound to plasma protein， the most significant of which is albumin， and has a volume of distribution of approximately 50 liters . It reaches peak concentrations in 2 h to 4 h and has a half-life of 5 h to 9 h in adults and up to 11 h to 13h in the elderly . About 2/3 of each dose undergoes metabolic degradation and about 1/3 undergoes direct renal excretion . Standard dosing for the treatment of DVT or PE is 15 mg by mouth twice a day for 21 days， followed by at least six months of 20 mg by mouth daily.\n\n【24】A number of physiologic changes in patients with NS increase the risk of thrombus formation. Platelets in patients with NS are hypercoagulable， and the degree of hypercoagulability correlates with the severity of NS . This may be due to hypercholesterolemia or increased thromboxane generation . Other prothrombotic factors such as factor VIII and fibrinogen also have increased rates of synthesis and increased plasma concentrations in patients with NS . Plasminogen and antithrombin levels are also decreased in patients with NS . These changes all increase the risk of VTE in patients with NS. In addition to NS， the patient was at increased risk for development of VTE due to obesity . However， his hypercoagulability workup by Hematology did not reveal any other definitive causes for increased risk of VTE.\n\n【25】Other physiologic changes in patients with NS could also affect VTE treatment. Urinary protein loss， mostly of albumin but also of other proteins， is a defining feature of NS . Hypoalbuminemia was shown to be an independent risk factor for thrombus formation . Despite this risk， hypoalbuminemia theoretically should increase the serum concentration of free rivaroxaban due to its high degree of protein binding. This juxtaposition of competing factors results in an unclear overall risk profile for thrombus formation. To our knowledge，there are no other case reports or literature evaluating the use of rivaroxaban in patients with NS. Current literature provides the strongest support for the use of heparin or low molecular weight heparins followed by vitamin K antagonist for the treatment of VTE in patients with NS.\n\n【26】Conclusion\n\n【27】In this case report， we describe a patient with previously undiagnosed NS who developed an extensive renal vein thrombus while being treated for a prior PE with rivaroxaban. Rivaroxaban is one of several drugs approved for the treatment of PE， although limited data exists regarding its use in patients with NS. We suggest that the development of repeat thrombus in this patient may be due to either rivaroxaban treatment failure or the physiologic changes in patients with NS. With numerous alternative treatment options for VTE， we suggest caution in the use of rivaroxaban in patients with NS.

In addition， the correlation between syndromes and hyperglycemia，hypertension，hyperlipidemia and hyperuricemia was also analyzed.\n\n【3】Results： There were 37 patients with ASASS， among which deficiency ofvital energy and blood stasis accounted for the highest proportion. For patients with ASASS， the age difference among different syndromes was statistically significant (P<0.05). The proportion of patients with hypertension and sthenia of liver yang was significantly higher than that of other syndromes (P<0.05).\n\n【4】Conclusion： Patients with colorectal polyps in Shenzhen area are mainly deficiency of vital energy and phlegm-wetness， and the pathological factors involve phlegm-dampness， blood stasis and stagnation of vital energy. Age and hypertension should be considered in the treatment of ASASS.\n\n【5】Keywords： Colorectal polyps； TCM syndrome； ASASS； Deficiency of vital energy； Shenzhen\n\n【6】Introduction\n\n【7】In January 2021， a paper was published in the internationally famous journal (J Nat Cancer Center) and pointed out that the incidence of colorectal cancer in domestic population increased significantly in China from 2000 to 2015 after age standardization， especially in urban areas ， which may be due to the general application of endoscopic screening and early removal of various polyps.\n\n【8】Although most colorectal polyps are benign tumors， most colorectal cancers are evolved from polyps or adenomas， namely， polyp-adenoma-cancer pathway ， so it is of great clinical significance for early detection， diagnosis and treatment of colorectal polyps. As we all know， tumors in gastrointestinal system are closely related to living habits . These bad habits include alcoholism， deep-frying， barbecue， high-salt and high-fat diet， coupled with environmental changes and fast life rhythm， such as staying up late， high-load work and other factors， which damage the body's immune defense function and lead to the occurrence of benign and malignant tumors including polyps . These factors comprehensively act on the human， resulting in different physical changes. In traditional Chinese medicine， it is considered that these factors may be one ofthe factors causing different syndromes.\n\n【9】Shenzhen is located in Guangdong province， China， belongs to Lingnan area， and its climate is warm， rainy and humid. This unique climate can form unique physiological and pathological characteristics . However， so far there are no relevant researches on the distribution of TCM syndromes and related risk factors of patients with colorectal polyps in Shenzhen. Therefore， this paper discussed the distribution of TCM syndromes in patients with colorectal polyps in Shenzhen， and analyzed the correlation between related risk factors and TCM syndromes.\n\n【10】Methods Complicating diseases\n\n【11】Case data\n\n【12】This was a case retrospective study design. The patients who underwent electronic colonoscopy in the Department of Traditional Chinese Medicine (People's Hospital of Shenzhen Baoan District) were collected according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria from January 2016 to June 2021. The basic information including registration number， age， sex， admission diagnosis and TCM syndromes were recorded. A total of 296 eligible patients aged 27 to83 (52.62±9.85) were researched in this study， including 174 male patients (58.8%) and 122 female patients (41.2%).\n\n【13】We also collected the complicating diseases， that is， whether there Was hyperglycemia，hypertension， hyperlipidemia and Hyperuricemia (4H). The diagnostic criteria of the diseases were as follows： hyperglycemia (fasting blood glucose >6.1 mmol/L)， hypertension (systolic blood pressure >140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure >90 mmHg)， hyperlipidemia (total cholesterol>5.17mmol/L or triglyceride >1.43 mmol/L).\n\n【14】Statistical analysis\n\n【15】Diagnostic criteria\n\n【16】Diagnostic criteria of TCM： TCM syndrome types refer to “Diagnostic Criteria for Common TCM Syndrome”， and“Internal Medicine of Traditional Chinese Medicine”published by Zhou Zhongying . The syndromes are jointly determined by an attending physician and a senior doctor.\n\n【17】All the data in this study were performed by SPSS 23.0. The measurement data was presented by mean and standard deviation. One-Way ANOVA was used for comparison of age among multiple groups， and LSD method was used for multiple comparisons among groups， the correlation of age with TCM syndromes was analyzed by Pearson Correlation Coefficient. The qualitative data including sex and complicating diseases were presented by proportion， and the overall distribution among groups was analyzed by Chi-square test， and the correlation was evaluated by Spearman Coefficient. P<0.05was considered to be that the difference was statistically significant.\n\n【18】Diagnostic criteria of western medicine： Colon polyps or rectal polyps were diagnosed according to electronic colonoscopy.\n\n【19】Result\n\n【20】Inclusion criteria Basicinformation of patients with various TCM syndromes\n\n【21】These patients had no household registration and lived in Shenzhen for more than 5 years， and conformed to the diagnostic criteria of colorectal polyps. The age was over 18 years old. Allpatients had been examined by electronic colonoscopy.\n\n【22】Exclusion criteria\n\n【23】These patients had ahistory ofcolonic polyps in the past but could not provide a detailed examination report or did not find polyps after colonoscopy again. Patients had incomplete case data or familial adenomatous polyposis or colon cancer confirmed by pathological diagnosis.\n\n【24】A total of 296 eligible patients with colorectal polyps were collected in this study. Eighty patients were deficiency-syndrome，and the highest proportion of patients (33%) was deficiency of spleen and stomach energy， followed by deficiency-cold of spleen and stomach(cold-syndrome due to deficiency of spleen and stomach-yang) and deficiency of yin fluid， each accounting for 24% . There were 179 patients with sthenia-syndrome， among which the highest proportion was the stagnation of phlegm-wetness (55%)， followed by stagnation of vital energy and damp-heat or phlegm-heat， which were15% and 12% respectively . Among them， damp-heat/phlegm-heat was mainly wetness-heat in large intestine or phlegm- heat stagnation in lung. There were 37 patients with Asthenia-Syndrome Accompanied with Sthenia-Syndrome (ASASS)， of which the highest proportion was deficiency of vital energy and blood stasis， accounting for 35%， followed by deficiency of spleen energy and phlegm dampness/dyspepsia syndrome， accounting for 32% .\n\n【25】Appearance of intestinal polyps of all patients under electronic colonoscope\n\n【26】As shown in Figure 2， appearance of intestinal polyps of all patients under electronic colonoscope was different. The polyps in the patients with asthenia-syndrome were light， pale and tender， especially in these with deficiency of spleen and stomach energy， deficiency-cold of spleen and stomach， and deficiency of both vital energy and blood. While the intestinal mucosa was thin and the blood vessels were obviously exposed . On the contrary， significant hyperemia and edema was be found in the colon mucosa of the patients with sthenia-syndrome ， especially in the patients with wetness-heat or phlegm-heat stagnation， and heat-evil of liver and stomach. The blood vessels in the mucosa were purple and visible in the patients with blood stasis. As for the patients with ASASS， the mucosa was obviously marked with edema， while the polyp in the colon with phlegm-wetness with deficiency of yin fluid was red and swollen， and the blood vessels were clearly visible (Figure\n\n【27】Comparison of age and sex distribution of all patients\n\n【28】The results revealed that there were more men {47 cases) than women (33 cases) in the deficiency-syndrome group ， but there is no statistical difference in the overall distribution of gender among various deficiency syndromes， and there is no statistical difference in the average age between each group. As shown in Table2， there were 102 male patients in the sthenia-syndrome group， which was higher than 77 female patients， but there is no significant difference in the overall distribution among the groups. Although the age of patients with wetness-heat and phlegm-heat stagnation was lower than that of patients with other syndromes， there was no significant difference in the mean value among the groups. Similarly， there were more male patients than female patients in ASASS group(P>0.05)， however， there was a significant difference in age between each group (P<0.05)， and had certain correlation (Pearson coefficient was -0.451，P=0.005). As shown in Table 3， the patients with deficiency of spleen energy and phlegm-dampness/dyspepsia syndrome are the youngest， and significantly lower than those with deficiency of vital energy and blood stasis (P<0.05) and sthenia of liver yang (P<0.05). Comparison of complicating diseases in patients with deficiency-and sthenia-syndrome.\n\n【29】In this study， we found that some patients suffered from 11 cases of hypertension (29.73%)， 21 cases of hyperlipidemia(56.76%)， and 10 cases of hyperuricemia (27.03%) in patients with ASASS group. Hyperlipidemia patients accounted for the highest proportion， but there was no significant difference among the groups. The proportion of hypertension patients with sthenia of liver yang was higher than that of other syndromes (P<0.05)， but there is little correlation between hypertension and ASASS syndromes (Spearman correlation coefficient was 0.078，P>0.05).\n\n【30】Table 1： Comparison of age and sex distribution in deficiency syndrome groups.\n\n| Groups (80 cases)  | Gender(male/female)  | Age(years)  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Deficiency of spleen and stomach energy(27 cases)  | 18/9  | 55.0±9.71  |\n| Deficiency-cold of spleen and stomach(19 cases)  | 11/8  | 51.84±9.92  |\n| Deficiency of both vital energy and blaod(15 cases)  | 6/9  | 55.6±7.32  |\n| Deficiency of yin fluid (19 cases)  | 12/7  | 56.42±9.21  |\n| Pvalue  | 0.387  | 0.455  |\n\n| Groups (179 cases)  | Gender(male/female)  | Age(years)  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Wetness-heat or phlegm-heat stagnation(22 cases)  | 16/6  | 47.86±10.26  |\n| Retention of cold-wetness (8 cases)  | 2/6  | 53.75±13.04  |\n| Stagnation of phlegm-wetness (99 cases)  | 58/41  | 52.75±8.81  |\n| Depression of vital energy (27 cases)  | 15/12  | 49.30±9.95  |\n| Blood stasis (17 cases)  | 7/10  | 55.59±10.23  |\n| Heat-evil of liver and stomach (6 cases)  | 4/2  | 49.67±13.19  |\n| P value  | 0.177  | 0.094  |\n\n【33】Table 3： Comparison of age and sex distribution in ASASS groups.\n\n| Groups (37 cases)  | Gender(male/female)  | Age(vears)  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Deficiency of vital energy and bload stasis(13 cases)  | 10/3  | 57.0±8.89a  |\n| Sthenia of liver yang (7 cases)  | 6/1  | 57.71±8.38  |\n| Spleen deficiency with phlegm-wetness/dyspepsia (12 cases)  | 775  | 44.58±11.06  |\n| Phlegm-wetness with deficiency of yin fluid(5 cases)  | 2/3  | 48.0±8.22  |\n| P value  | 0.287  | 0.007  |\n\n【35】Note： ASASS is asthenia-syndrome accompanied with sthenia-syndrome； indicated vs. spleen deficiency with phlegm-wetness/dyspepsia syndrome group P<0.05\n\n【36】Discussion\n\n【37】According to the results of epidemiological investigation， a colorectal polyp is a very common disease in clinic . Most patients have no clinical manifestations， only found during physical examination or treatment of other diseases. Although most of colorectal polyps are benign lesions， some polyps also have canceration tendency . Therefore， early resection and identification of colorectal polyps are of great significance.\n\n【38】Although there is no name for colorectal polyps in Chinese medicine， as early as in ancient China， there are records and descriptions about the etiology and pathogenesis of polyps. For example， primitive theories documented by “The Yellow Emperor’s Canon of Internal Medicine (722-221 B.C) (Huangdi neijinig)\"point out that the occurrence of polyps was related to invasion of exogenous evils. Stagnation of cold-wetness evil (a pathogenic factor blended by evils of cold and wetness) results in obstruction in the channels and stasis of vital energy and blood， leading to occurrence of polyps.(Huangdi neijinig) said， \"Healthy energy (referring to the resistance of the human body against diseases) existed inside， but evils could not be done\"， suggesting that deficiency of healthy energy is also an important factor in the occurrence of colorectal polyps in addition to exogenous evils.\n\n【39】Guangdong in China belongs to the Ling nan region. Some statistics studies on TCM syndromes of patients with colorectal polyps in Guangdong have performed， and found that deficiency of spleen-energy and evil wetness accounted for the highest proportion， followed by asthenia of the spleen and stomach and wetness-heat and blood stasis . These researchers considered that deficiency of spleen-energy is the root of trouble and phlegm-evil and blood stasis are the causes of the disease. Our study found that the proportion of patients with asthenia of the spleen and stomach was the highest in all colorectal polyps'patients with asthenia-syndrome in Shenzhen， which is consistent with other research results . Our observation revealed that the proportion of patients with phlegm-evil was the highest， up to 55%， followed by stagnation of vital energy and phlegm-wetness or wetness-heat evil. Shenzhen is a southern city in Guangdong Province， and located in Ling'nan region which has a unique climate with heavy humidity and heat. These results have suggested that， tangible sthenia-evils including phlegm-wetness and blood stasis can be produced in the human body living in Shenzhen.\n\n【40】Table 4： Distribution and comparison results of \"4H\" diseases in patients with deficiency syndrome groups.\n\n| Groups (80 cases)  | Hyperglycemia (N/Y)  | Hypertension (N/Y)  | Hyperlipidemia (N/Y)  | Hyperuricemia (N/Y)  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Deficiency of spleen and stomach energy (27 cases)  | 22/5  | 20/7  | 14/13  | 17/10  |\n| Deficiency-cald of spleen and stomach (19 cases)  | 19/0  | 17/2  | 11/8  | 17/2  |\n| Deficiency of both vital energy and blaod (15 cases)  | 13/2  | 13/2  | 8/7  | 10/5  |\n| Deficiency of yin fluid (19 cases)  | 15/4  | 15/4  | 11/8  | 9/10  |\n| Pvalue  | 0.221  | 0.55  | 0.969  | 0.052  |\n\n【42】Note： “4H\" represented Hyperglycemia， Hypertension， Hyperlipidemia， and Hyperuricemia. \"N\" represented no \"4H\"， and \"Y\"mean existence of \"4H\" (The same below)\n\n| Groups (179 cases)  | Hyperglycemia (N/Y)  | Hypertension (N/Y)  | Hyperlipidemia (N/Y)  | Hyperuricemia (N/Y)  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Wetness-heat or phlegm-heat stagnation (22 cases)  | 18/4  | 17/5  | 22-Oct  | 17/5  |\n| Retention of cold-wetness (8 cases)  | 8/0  | 7/1  | 6/2  | 7/1  |\n| Stagnation of phlegm-wetness (99 cases)  | 88/11  | 76/23  | 43/56  | 66/33  |\n| Depression of vital energy (27 cases)  | 26/1  | 25/2  | 14/13  | 21/6  |\n| Blood stasis (17 cases)  | 14/3  | 15/2  | 7/10  | 8/9  |\n| Heat-evil of liver and stomach (6 cases)  | 5/1  | 6/0  | 2/4  | 4/2  |\n| Pvalue  | 0.478  | 0.305  | 0.565  | 0.22  |\n\n【44】Table 6： Distribution and comparison results of \"4H\" diseases in patients with ASASS groups.\n\n| Deficiency of vital energy and blood stasis (13 cases)  | Hyperglycemia (N/Y)  | Hypertension (NY)  | Hyperlipidemia (N/Y)  | Hyperuricemia (N/Y)  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Deficiency of vital energy and blaad stasis (13 cases)  | 12/1  | 11/2  | 7/6  | 8/5  |\n| Sthenia of liver yang (7cases)  | 6/0  | 1/6  | 2/5  | 4/2  |\n| Spleen deficiency with phlegm-wetness/ dyspepsia (12 cases)  | 9/3  | 9/3  | 4/8  | 10/2  |\n| Phlegm-wetness with deficiency of yin fluid (5 cases)  | 5/0  | 5/0  | 3/2  | 4/1  |\n| Pvalue  | 0.252  | 0.003  | 0.52  | 0.648  |\n\n【46】These tangible evils can block the functional activities of vital energy for a long time， leading to depression of vital energy and further heat-syndrome resulting from disorder of vital energy. In this case， phlegm-heat or wetness-heat evil is formed， further stagnating the functional activities of vital energy in turn. Depressed vital energy， phlegm-evil and blood stasis in conflict with each other within gut and leads to occurrence of polyps. Therefore， deficiency of spleen-energy， phlegm-wetness， blood stasis and depression of vital energy are the important pathological factors of colorectal polyps . Our study found that， in the patients with stagnation of wetness-heat， some patients suffered from stagnation of phlegm-heat in the lung， which may be due to the fact that the lung and large intestine share s paired relationship， phlegm-heat evil in the lung can enter the large intestine along the channel system and block the functional activities of vital energy in gut， further affecting the blood circulation. This consequence leads to the stagnation of phlegm， depressed vital energy and blood stasis in the local intestine， resulting in formation of polyps.\n\n【47】It is considered that the occurrence of colorectal polyps is the results of many risk factors. Although these factors are related to histological type of polyps and family history ， other risks have been paid more and more attention. Some studies have shown that age is considered as one of the risk factors related to the occurrence of colorectal polyps . The older the age， the higher the incidence of colorectalpolyps， especially after 40 years old . This is consistent with the observation of our study. We found that the average age of polyp patients is over 50 years old. This may be related to the decrease of intestinal peristalsis， intestinal flora imbalance and weakened immunity with increasing age . The age of patients with deficiency of spleen-energy and stagnation of wetness-evil， and deficiency of yin-fluid and phlegm-wetness syndrome (average age was lower than50 years old) was lower than that of other syndromes (average age was higher than 55 years old). This suggests that the patients younger than 50 years old should be paid more attention to invigorating the spleen and eliminating wetness-evil during determination of treatment based on the differentiation of symptoms and signs. While eliminating wetness， we should take care of nourishing yin fluid， and we should not use drugs that are too pungent and dry. The results of this study also found that the proportion of male patients was more than that of female patients， which is consistent with the results of big data analysis . It may be that men prefer smoking and drinking， and work and life are more stressful than women.\n\n【48】In this study， we found that some patients with colorectal polyps were complicated with Hyperglycemia， Hypertension， Hyperlipemia and Hyperuricemia (4H). Whether these complicating diseases are related to the formation of asthenia- and sthenia-syndrome of colorectal tumor? Although some studies have suggested that there was no direct correlation between the number of colonic polyps and hyperglycemia， hypertension and hyperlipidemia ， a research by Yunfeng Dong shown that the high risk factors of adenomatous rectal polyps are eating fat and having high triglyceride/cholesterol. Our research results also shown that， in the colorectal polyp patients with asthenia-syndrome， the asthenia of spleen and stomach， and deficiency of yin fluid in these with hyperuricemia accounted for a large proportion. Although the difference was not statistically significant， drugs for reducing uric acid can be complemented each other while invigorating vital energy and spleen and nourishing yin fluid for such patients in clinic.\n\n【49】In view of the recurrence of colorectal polyps， based on the theory of insidious toxin (a pathogenic factors) in Traditional Chinese Medicine， some studies suggest that the primary cause of colorectal polyps is that the insidious toxin deeply invaded the intestinal collaterals. Therefore， the insidious toxin and chronic consumption of essence and blood are the key mechanisms of occurrence and recurrence of colorectal polyps ， which indicates that toxic evil is also a pathological factor in the occurrence of intestinal polyps. In our study， we found that the patients with wetness-heat or phlegm-heat evil also accounted for a large proportion， while the patients with cold-wetness only accounted for a small proportion， which may be related to the unique climate environment in Shenzhen. Therefore， invigorating spleen， clearing away heat and eliminating wetness has become a strategy to prevent and treat colorectal polyps . Consistent with previous studies， it is easy to appear the syndrome of vin fluid deficiency because toxic and heat evil can consume essence and blood. As shown in our study， the syndromes of deficiency of yin fluid including yin-deficiency of liver and kidney， deficiency of stomach-yin， deficiency of lung-yin， and deficiency of both vital energy and yin also occupied a large proportion in the asthenia-syndrome. After statistical analysis， we found that there was no significant difference in the “4H” diseases between the patients with sthenia-syndrome， suggesting that there is no significant correlation between sthenia-syndromes and “4H”diseases.\n\n【50】Clinically， the occurrence of diseases is often presented by Asthenia-Syndrome Accompanied with Sthenia-Syndrome (ASASS)； therefore， there are quite a few patients with the ASASS in this study. Among them， deficiency of vital energy and blood stasis was the major ones， followed by deficiency of spleen-energy and phlegm-wetness syndrome. Ultimately， asthenia is still rooted as the occurrence of intestinal polyps， with phlegm-wetness， blood stasis and stagnation of vital energy as the symptomatic manifestation， which is consistent with the treatment thinking of supplementing vital energy and invigorating the spleen， and promoting blood circulation and removing blood stasis to treat colorectal polyps . A large number of studies have suggested that most patients with hypertension presented the syndrome of sthenia of liver-yang， and a significant correlation existed between the sthenia of liver-yang and hypertension . Therefore， in this study， we also found that the difference ofhypertension in the syndrome of ASASS was statistically significant. The proportion of patients with hypertension and sthenia of liver-yang was more than other syndromes， so it is necessary to pay attention to the prevention and treatment of hypertension in the therapy of colorectal polyp patients with sthenia ofliver-yang.\n\n【51】Conclusion\n\n【52】Deficiency of vital energy of spleen-stomach and stagnation of phlegm-wetness are the primary syndromes for the patients with colorectal polyps in Shenzhen， and the pathological factors involve phlegm-wetness， blood stasis and stagnation of vital energy. Yin-deficiency is mainly caused by liver， kidney，lung and stomach. There is no obvious correlation between sthenia-syndrome and age， Sex，“4H”. Age should be considered in the treatment of patients under 50years old with ASASS syndrome. The patients with sthenia of liver-yang syndrome often have hypertension， thus， hypertension should also be considered for such patients.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 11:32:32", "endTime": "2024/09/24 11:33:19", "cost": 46.982}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:35", "update_time": "2024-09-23 19:33:19", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 19:32:32"}

In addition to autoantibodies， Helicobacter pylori or Hepatitis C may be the cause of ITP. These illnesses are accompanied by co-existing antibodies that may have an impact on the antiphospholipid antibodies， and coexisting immune dysfunctions and molecular mimicry . Ayurveda， yoga therapy， and nutrition modification can all be used as integral part of an integrated treatment plan for a variety of illnesses.\n\n【2】Case Presentation\n\n【3】The patient， a 10-year-old girl， was identified having Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura(ITP) in 2019. She was admitted in the hospital due to symptoms that included an unremarkable peripheral smear， a physical exam that only indicated minor signs of bleeding linked to the low platelet count. The doctor suggested repeated hospital stays in addition to typical conventional medical therapy. Romiplostim 500 mcg Sc/once weekly， Pantop 40 mg/daily， Folvite 5 mg once daily， Tab. Tranexamic acid 1 g when bleeding occurs， and Tab. Shelcal 500 were normally administered to the patient as part of the standard care. Till June 16\"， 2023， these said medications were still being used. On the same day， the girl was brought to a clinical set up having the facility of complementary and alternative medicine near Betnoti，Odisha， East India. In addition to having an abnormal differential leukocyte count (Neutrophilic leukocytosis with myeloid left shift， Dc：Myelocyte + metamyelocyte=16%， Stab Segmented=67%，Lymphocytes =15%， Monocytes =02%)， the patient also had a lower platelet count (68，000/mm’of blood) and a higher white blood count(18100/mm’of blood). Additionally， the patients complained of excruciating bodily pain， weakness， and excessive menstrual flow. The patient additionally underwent yoga and ayurvedic therapy in addition to normal medical care. The patient asked to en gage in yoga meditation， Yoga Nidra ， and Sukshma Vyayam (subtle light intensity yoga techniques). Two turmeric tablets， two Giloy tablets， one table spoon of Triphala churna (a blend of Emblica officinalis， Terminalia bellerica， and Terminalia chebula)， and one teaspoon of Chirata powder (Swertia chirayita) each day was recommended. Four tablespoons of each of two different plant leaf juices were taken by the patients on an empty stomach. For a week， the following plants were utilized to make a chart： Syzygium cumini L， Carica papaya， Triticum aestivum， Dalbergia sissoo， Murraya koenigii， Mangifera indica， and Psidium guajava L are some examples of related plants. Any two-plant leaf that is prepared as leaf juice on a rotating basis. For preparation of leaf juice， healthy young plant leaves were frequently selected and crushed in a stone grinder. Additionally， the patient was told to have a vegetarian diet composed of 50% raw food and50% cooked food. The dish was cooked with Indian indigenous ghee. For detoxification， the patient was instructed to consume one bowl of papaya and one bowl of guava.\n\n【4】After undergoing additional treatment for 21 days， the patient significantly improved. The platelet count (342000/mm’ of blood)， hemoglobin concentration， and RBC count increased markedly.Neutrophil by 69.2%， Lymphocytes 25%， Eosinophil 3%，Monocytes 0.5%， Basophils 0.7%were the normal differential leukocyte counts， and the total WBC count (11725/mm’of blood) was reduced to a normal level. The patient reports feeling better， having less physical discomfort， and having fewer blood stains on their skin after receiving the Yoga and Ayurveda treatment module.\n\n【5】Discussion\n\n【6】In general， yoga practice improved mental stability， happiness， and mental calmness， as well as overall life quality. Moreover， a study reported that pregnant women who practiced yoga for three months had higher platelet counts than the control group . This is in response to the patient's requesttoincorporate yoga to their treatment regimen. ILP is mostly caused by autoantibodies， and a study found that doing yoga for 8 weeks couldreducethe symptoms ofautoimmune disease . In addition， the patient was instructed to take several Ayurvedic drug combinations， which were primarily composed of plant extracts. In dengue patients， platelet counts increased by taking extracts of the leaves of the giloy (Tinospora cordifolia) plant . The herb giloy has an immunomodulatory effect， improves cellular immunity， encourages the formation ofantibodies， and also improves lysosome activity and antibody responses . In a mouse model， a methanolic extract of Syzygium cumini L dramatically increased both the platelet and leukocyte counts . Moreover， a study with Busulfan-treated mouse models， demonstrated that administering nanocurcumin (curcumin derivatives) could retain bone marrow integrity and enhance the quantity of circulating platelets while the patient is receiving treatment with turmeric tablets . To boost immunity against autoantibodies and raise platelet count， patient was instructed to take various leaf extracts. The platelet count in dengue patient markedly elevated with the juice of Carica papaya leaves . Mango leaf was shown to considerably boost RBC count in normal albino rats . Patients with thrombocytopenia caused by alcohol-induced liver cirrhosis， Carica papaya and Tinospora cordifolia phytoextracts increased platelet count within 15 days and return it to normal within 90 days of treatment . However， a study reported that giving a patient one tea spoon of Chirata (Swertia chirata) powder dramatically increased the platelet count in healthy rats when given at high doses . Murraya koenigii is a rich source of phenolic chemicals， alkaloids， flavonoids， and steroids. According to one study， Murraya Koenigii semi-solid plant extract ingestion increased blood count in phenylhydrazine-induced anemic rats . An excellent source of phenolic acid and flavonoid content is wheat grass (Triticum aestivum) and it was reported in thrombocytopenic rats that wheat grass (Triticum aestivum) considerably lowered bleeding and clotting times and raised platelet counts . As the patient was advised to consume papaya fruits and leaves，possibly the polyphenolic chemical present in papaya fruit， leaves， and seeds had improved the formation of RBC and platelets . It was accepted with the fact that the immune system was made more tolerable by a number of plant extracts， which prevented autoimmune diseases. WBC count， cellular immune response， and humoral immune responses were enhanced by Dalbergia Sissoo . The patient was instructed to consume Triphala powder because it has a positive effect on the immune system. According to a study， Triphala demonstrated immunomodulatory effect by changing neutrophil activities in albino rats， including phagocytosis， adhesion， and NBT reduction . In a dose-dependent manner， Triphala treatment demonstrated a considerable suppression of complement activity， HMI， CMI， and mitogen-induced T-lymphocyte proliferation. These findings indicated that Thiphala inhibited the experimentally generated inflammation， demonstrating its potency in the management of autoimmune illness and inflammation . Currently it is very clear with the fact that combining yoga treatment with Ayurveda improved cell-mediated immunity and platelet count in ITP.\n\n【7】Conclusion\n\n【8】In the patient with Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura(ITP)， the platelet count considerably rises after doing yoga and an ayurvedic module， and the differential leukocyte count returns to normal. Numerous studies demonstrated that the plant extracts used in Ayurveda increased platelet count， while its mechanism of action remains unclear. Yoga also boosts the immunity and enhances the production of blood cell. Precisely we can conclude that Yoga and Ayurveda module improved the quality of life by improving the physicaland mental health. Since there have been very few studies on Ayurveda and Yoga therapy， it is exceedingly challenging to pinpoint the exact mechanism by which the platelet count rises in ITP. Future researches may be carried out to understand its mechanism more appropriately.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 11:25:34", "endTime": "2024/09/24 11:25:42", "cost": 7.263}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:35", "update_time": "2024-09-23 19:25:41", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 19:25:34"}

Some cases are also associated with erosions， crusting， hair， and nail changes . Most commonly， it is due to generalization of pre-existing dermatoses (such as psoriasis or atopic dermatitis)， drug reactions， or cutaneous T-cell lymphoma， but identification of the underlying disease process represents one of the most complex challenges in dermatology . We present the case of a patient affected by multiple myeloma who developed erythroderma.\n\n【6】Case Presentation\n\n【7】A 66-year-old male with a medical history of multiple myeloma developed an erythematous rash spread over the entire skin surface， with scaling and itching. Dermatologic examination revealed extensive pink patches with feathering edges and large scaling on head， neck， trunk， and limbs . He did not report previous dermatoses or known allergies， but a history of xerosis. Regarding multiple myeloma， he achieved Very Good Partial Response (VGPR) after four cycles of Bortezomib-Thalidomide-Dexamethasone (VTD) induction therapy followed by Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation (ASCT). Laboratory tests showed eosinophilia (5500/mm)， which has progressively increased for two months， until reaching a peak concomitantly with erythroderma. The previous month， acyclovir was replaced by valganciclovir for a cytomegalovirus reactivation (28000 copies/mL). Current blood tests found the presence of cytomegalovirus (481copies/mL)andhuman herpesvirus-7(90 copies/mL). Thepatient was started on oralprednisone and hydroxyzine， associated with topical steroids and emollients， but one month later erythroderma with lamellar scaling， intense itching and eosinophilia persisted， and thus a skin biopsy was performed. A week later， the patient developed fever， and blood cultures resulted positive for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus casseliflavus， therefore he received intravenous daptomycin in combination with piperacillin-tazobactam. Following the resolution of symptoms， all unnecessary drugs were suspended and intravenous 1 mg/kg/day dose of methylprednisolone was started， resulting in gradual improvement of erythroderma and eosinophilia. On the third day， as the patient developed a febrile relapse with positive blood cultures for Klebsiella pneumoniae Carbapenemase (KPC) enzyme producers， steroid therapy was suspended， and ceftazidime-avibactam treatment was set. Clinical improvement was again interrupted by a new febrile episode associated with reactivation of cytomegalovirus (16000copies/mL) and worsening of erythroderma. Foscarnet therapy induced resolution of fever and reduction of erythema and itching. A further biopsy was performed， and intravenous methylprednisolone was started again. The pathologist concluded that histological and molecular findings were referable to a non-specific inflammatory reaction. After the resolution of erythroderma  and negative viral tests， the patient was discharged with a follow-up prograr.\n\n【8】Discussion\n\n【9】Erythroderma is a condition caused by several etiologies that result in red inflamed skin on 80% to 90% or more ofthe body surface . The diagnoses of the underlying systemic or cutaneous disease can be remembered with the mnemonic SCALPID： Seborrheic dermatitis/sarcoidosis； contact dermatitis； atopic dermatitis/autoimmune diseases； lymphoma/leukemia； psoriasis/pityriasis rubra pilaris； ichthyoses， infestations (Norwegian scabies)； drug reactions . The most common disorders are contact dermatitis， atopic dermatitis， and psoriasis， along with drug reactions， while the most common malignancy is cutaneous T-cell lymphoma The color of the skin can vary from pink-red to red-brown to deep red-purple， and pruritus is observed in up to 90% of patients . The onset of scaling is typically seen 2 to 6 days after the onset of the erythema . It varies in size and color， depending upon the stage of the erythroderma and nature of the underlying disease： In more acute phases scales are usually large and crusted， whereas in chronic states they tend to be smaller and drier . In cases of pre-existing dermatoses， nail changes may precede the erythroderma (e.g. pits in psoriasis or horizontal ridging in atopic dermatitis)， whereas others develop subsequently， for example they can become thick， dry， and brittle . Colonization of the skin with Staphylococcus aureus is common and can lead to secondary cutaneous infections as well as bacteremia .\n\n【10】A detailed history is crucial for diagnosing the underlying etiology： Patients must be asked about pre-existing medical conditions， allergies， medications， and skin diseases (atopic or other dermatitis， psoriasis， etc) . The presentation of erythroderma in individuals without a pre-existing skin disease is more common with drug-induced erythroderma or malignancy； compared with other causes， the onset of erythroderma secondary to medication is typically more sudden and rapidly progressing， the resolution is often quicker， and additional manifestations may be observed， like fever and peripheral eosinophilia， along with facial swelling， hepatitis， myocarditis， and allergic interstitial nephritis： This constellation of findings is referred to as DRESS (Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms) . Our patient reported no pre-existing dermatoses or allergies； he was recently started on valganciclovir， but there was no improvement despite its suspension， and eosinophilia already existed before. Furthermore， mites could not be identified from skin scraping examined microscopically， and a screening test panel for associated auto antibodies was negative， thus we performed a 4-mm punch biopsy. Histological examination showed parakeratosis， spongiosis， vacuolization in the basal layer， exocytosis1of lymphocytes and granulocytes， inflammatory infiltrate in the dermis (with predominantly CD4+ T lymphocytes， histiocytes and granulocytes， but a moderate amounts of ezsinophils) and edema of the dermis.\n\n【11】Histological findings were compatible with1paraneoplastic erythroderma， idiopathic erythroderma and atopic dermatitis . Tests for multiple myeloma showed no evidence of disease activity， so we excluded this possibility. Erythroderma is labeled as idiopathic in9% to 47% of cases (this group is composed mainly of older adult men with a chronic and relapsing course of pruritic erythroderma) and longitudinal monitoring of patients with idiopathic erythroderma may reveal undiagnosed cutaneous T-celllymphoma ，therefore we performed a second biopsy to enhance the accuracy ofhistopathologic diagnoses， but it excluded again a lymphoproliferative disease and showed a non-specific inflammatory pattern. Acute lesions of atopic dermatitis show spongiosis， intracellular edema in the lower epidermis， exocytosis of lymphocytes， a perivascular infiltrate of lymphocytes and macrophages around vessels of the superficial plexus， mast cells in different stages of degranulation， and occasional eosinophils . The presence of dermal eosinophilic infiltrates is a characteristic histological feature observed in skin biopsies from patients with erythrodermic atopic dermatitis . The diagnosis of atopic dermatitis remains clinical， as there is currently no reliable biomarker that can distinguish the disease from other entities： An elevated total and/or allergen-specific serum IgE level is not present in about 20% of affected individuals  as well as in our patient. Of all the existing diagnostic criteria， none are considered wholly or mutually exclusive in the diagnosis of atopic dermatitis， which remains prerogative of the clinician . According to the 2-Plus-1model  proposed by Reynolds et al. ， our patient had two essential features (acute eczema and pruritus) and one important feature (xerosis)， without any exclusionary features of atopic dermatitis.\n\n【12】Furthermore， the onset of erythroderma was associated with a Cytomegalovirus reactivation twice， and the second time antiviral therapy resulted in improvement of erythema and itching. We believe that cytomegalovirus might have been a trigger of the cell-mediated immune response that unleashed an erythrodermic onset of atopic dermatitis. Triggers (e.g. viral infections， food allergens， cosmetics， fragrance， weather， and other causes) are the leading cause of an atopic dermatitis exacerbation， and avoidance of triggers is an important mechanism patients can use to control disease activity. Hafez et al.  found that active subclinical cytomegalovirus infection is more frequent in patients with atopic dermatitis and may have possible immunomodulatory role in the etiopathogenesis， even if it is not related to disease severity. Docke et al. suggest that active， subclinical cytomegalovirus infection is more frequent in patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis and may have immunopathological relevance . In-spite of the high prevalence of cytomegalovirus infection and its potent immunomodulatory activities， the relation of cytomegalovirus to atopic dermatitis is still poorly understood .\n\n【13】Conclusion\n\n【14】Erythroderma is a dermatologic emergency that could necessitate hospital admission， therefore determining the underlying etiology is crucial， and any external aggravating factors must be eliminated. Specifically， any potential drugs inducing erythroderma must be stopped. Early diagnosis is paramount as it allows early treatment and prevention oferythroderma-associated morbidity and mortality. It is very important to recognize atopic dermatitis as a cause of erythroderma， especially in a patient with late onset of the disease and no personal or familial history of allergic diseases. Further studies are necessary to clarify the relationship between atopic dermatitis and cytomegalovirus infection.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 11:45:10", "endTime": "2024/09/24 11:48:04", "cost": 173.353}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:35", "update_time": "2024-09-23 19:48:03", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 19:45:09"}

This case reports reflects upon a healthy 46 year old female who presented with subtype of true neoplasm called a neural fibrolipoma arising from the plantar nerve. The patient was referred by her GP for an evaluation of an unknown painful soft tissue mass present in the right plantar aspect of the mid foot. The mass had been present for approximately 2 to 3 years and had recently increased in size in the last 4 months. This 17 mmx7 mm x11 mm painful soft tissue swelling was detected by USS and showed it extended deep to the plantar fascia not arising from it hence ruling out the common misconception of plantar fibromatosis.\n\n【2】When reviewing such patients， it is imperative to rule out any malignancy before excising the mass which is why referring this patient to a Sarcoma MDT was essential. Other infectious differentials including septic arthritis and osteomyelitis were ruled out early since Blood counts showed CRP -1.2 mg/L， White cell count - 5.1×10/L，Neutrophils -3.47×10/L. Arthritic differentials such as Gout were also ruled out based on blood parameters which revealed Urate -287.\n\n【3】The patient opted for surgical excision biopsy of the lesion. Post operative period was uneventful with good healing of the wound She was followed up 2 months and at with the histology findings results revealed a rare soft tissue neural neoplasm in keeping of a neurofibrolipoma. The patient was happy with the overall outcome and discharged. This case report highlights the need to consider the neural fibrolipoma as a rare case of plantar/heel pain and excision of the lesion would provide an excellent outcome.\n\n【4】Keywords： Plantar nerve； Neural fibrolipoma； Neuroma\n\n【5】Introduction\n\n【6】A neuroma can be defined as benign tumour of nerve tissue. Neuromas can be differentiated into 3 categories. Firstly a true neuroma， secondly neuromas associated with trauma and finally neuromas as part of a syndrome such as neurofibromatosis or MEN2b. Neuromas are overlooked as a differential diagnosis for heel pain， and they are diagnosed by a combination of physical examination， history taking， and radiological imaging and by histopathological findings following excision.\n\n【7】A Neural fibrolipoma， also known as a lipofibromatous hamartoma is a benign， soft-tissue neoplasm generated by the proliferation of mature nerve sheet fibroblast and adipocytes leading to the formation of a palpable subcutaneous mass. The exact pathogenesis of a neural fibrolipoma is unknown however chronic irritation and trauma have known to play a precipitating factor. Often seen in nerves with high risk of compression such as the median nerve， it is very rare to present in the plantar nerve.\n\n【8】Case Presentation\n\n【9】A healthy 46-year-old female who was referred by her GP for an evaluation of a painful soft tissue mass present in the right plantar aspect of the mid foot. The mass had been present for approximately 2 to 3 years and had recently increased in size in the last 4 months. The patient described the feeling as walking on a hard stone. There was no history of trauma or significant familyhistory. Upon inspection there was no apparent infection or skin changes. Upon examination the patient had bilateral planovalgus feet with bilateral hallux valgus worse on the right side. This swelling had led to chronic pain with some sensitivity and numbness over that area. Following the patients' first appointment the patient received an injection of80 mg Depo-medrone and 1 ml of 1% Lignocaine under ultrasound guidance into the second MTP to temporarily provide symptomatic relief for the pain whilst an ultrasound was arranged to rule out plantar fibromatosis. X-rays ruled out any bony injury or obvious bone malignancy.\n\n【10】USS described this swelling in the plantar aspect of the mid-foot as well defined， hypoechoic tender lesion within the plantar subcutaneous tissue measuring approximately 17 mm x7 mm×11mm. More importantly the lesion extended deep to the plantar fascia not arising from it hence ruling out plantar fibromatosis . In order to rule out any aggressive pathology an MRI with contrast was arranged which revealed a 2 cm by 5 mm tubular oblique lesion in the plantar subcutaneous fat. MR imaging was also able to rule out sinus tarsi syndrome and any internal derangements . She was referred to orthotics for a medial support arch to help with pain. Since the exact characteristics of this lesion were still unknown the case was referred to the Yorkshire Sarcoma MDT. The outcome of this meeting concluded that there were no radiological features of a sarcoma. She still experienced excruciating， sharp stabbing pain in her right foot. Pain score was 10/10. She opted for surgical excision biopsy of the lesion. The post operative period was uneventful with good healing of the wound. She was followed up 2 months and at with the histology findings results revealed a rare soft tissue neural neoplasm in keeping of a neurofibrolipoma. The patient was happy with the overall outcome and discharged. She was reviewed again after 2 years for a further foot and ankle problem in the other foot and at the time of review she was completely pain free in the right foot with an excellent outcome.\n\n【11】Discussion\n\n【12】A.true neuroma can come in various sizes andlocations including a vestibular schwannoma， acoustic neuroma， ganglioneuroma， neurothekeoma， nerve sheath myxoma. These neuromas have their own unique characteristics and origin. The true incidence of many these neuromas vary in different literature as often neuromas go undetected until they become symptomatic. In the cases ofan acoustic neuroma or vestibular schwannoma patients can present with tinnitus hearing loss and vertigo. In this case the patient presented with chronic pain in her right foot.\n\n【13】When reviewing such patients， it is imperative to rule out any malignancy before excising the mass which is why referring this patient to a Sarcoma MDT was essential.Other infectious differentials including septic arthritis and osteomyelitis were ruled out early since Blood counts showed CRP - 1.2 mg/L， White cell count - 5.1×10/L， Neutrophils -3.47 10/L. Arthritic differentials such as Gout were also ruled out based on blood parameters which revealed Urate -287. Given that the pain was focused on the plantar aspect of the heel and not primarily in the posterior heel conditions such as Achilles tendonitis，retroachiles bursitis or retrocalcaneal bursitis were ruled out. Furthermore， given the age of the patient was not an adolescent Severs disease (calcaneal apophysitis) was also excluded .\n\n【14】It is important to recognize that this true neuroma originated from aperipheral nerve such as the medial plantar nerve and not from the inter-digital nerve as that would make it a Morton's neuroma.\n\n【15】During excision the medial plantar nerve was preserved ensuring the patient preserved motor function of the abductor hallucis， flexor digitorum brevis， the flexor hallucis brevis and the first lumbrical muscle.\n\n【16】Conclusion\n\n【17】This case report highlights the need to consider the neural fibrolipoma as a rare case of plantar/heel pain and excision of the lesion would provide an excellent outcome.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 11:02:43", "endTime": "2024/09/24 11:03:39", "cost": 55.518}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:35", "update_time": "2024-09-23 19:03:38", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 19:02:43"}

The results of PTC for a patient with illness anxiety disorder are presented here based on a brief account of his video recorded therapy sessions. The results and the empirical evidence obtained from the treatment of the patient indicated that PTC psychotherapy is a short-term yet very effective approach. The results of 28 months follow-up proved that the improvements were stable and constant. No relapse was reported within the follow-up period. The results of the present study can be applied to new developments in the field of psychotherapy theory， research， and practice.\n\n【2】Keywords： Psychotherapy； Paradox； Timetable； PTC； Illness Anxiety Disorder\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Treatment ofpsychological disorders has faced serious challenges sincethe beginning of scientific approaches to psychotherapy . Among these challenges are the preferred treatment approach， the length of treatment (number of treatment sessions)， the treatment costs， the treatment efficacy and outcomes， the treatment suitability， the treatment ending， and the relapse of the symptoms. The two major approaches to psychotherapy constitute psychodynamic psychotherapy and behavioral therapy. In recent decades， these approaches have sought to create intervention techniques and methods to overcome the aforementioned shortcomings and increase the treatment success . However，the existence of limitations andproblems related to the treatment， the patient， the disorder type， the therapist， the length of treatment， the costs oftreatment， the treatment outcomes， and the rate of relapse necessitate devising more efficient psychotherapeutic approaches. As a paradoxical psychotherapy， PTC  is an approach to treating psychological disorders which aims to overcome the aforesaid limitations and shortcomings. The present paper aimed to report a briefaccount of the PTC treatment for illness anxiety disorder.\n\n【5】A brief summary of PTC-treatment protocol\n\n【6】PTC treatment consists of two components： paradox and timetable. Paradox refers to the prescription of disorder symptoms； and timetable refers to executing the paradoxical task within a certain amount of time and to a certain degree. In PTC therapy， these two components are inextricably linked and the therapist should prescribe them together for the patient. Similarly， the patient ought to do the task to a certain degree and within the pre-planned period of time. The inseparability of these two components， called the paradoxical timetable， is regarded as one of the innovations in this psychotherapeutic approach. According to PTC， the paradoxical task should be done only within the pre-planned period of time. In other words， the paradoxical timetable should either be performed within the time limits or never performed at all. The therapist asks the patient to start the paradoxical timetable tasks 24 h after the first session is held. The delayed beginning is another feature of PTC psychotherapeutic model.\n\n【7】Case Presentation\n\n【8】Mr. NK is a 26-year-old single man admitted to an academic psychotherapy center with IAD. He is a university graduate with an M. Sc degree. The patient signed an informed consent document prior to performing the treatment sessions for both treatment and use of the anonymized case information for educational，learning， and research purposes. A written consent also signed by the patient for video recording of all treatment sessions. For initial evaluation the patient participated in a diagnostic interview ， the short version of the Health Anxiety Index (SHAI； )， and Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II； ). The patient met criteria for DSM-5 illness anxiety disorder， as well as a total score of 38.7 for the SHAI indicating significant health related anxiety，and a total score of 17.9 for BDI-II. Subjective ratings on illness anxiety and symptoms on a scale of 0(none) to 100 (extreme) percent were obtained at regular intervals. Illness anxiety during the first session was 100 out of 100. At his last session， his illness anxiety reduced to 0.00/100. Total scores of the SHAI and BDI-II reduced to 13.2 and 8.7 at post treatment， respectively. We next present the application of PTC for treatment of IAD based on a detailed video recorded treatment sessions of NK.\n\n【9】The application of PTC to lAD-case of NK\n\n【10】The clinical interview based on the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V；)， confirmed the existence of Illness Anxiety Disorder. He explained his symptoms thus in the first session： Following an unprotected sexual intercourse， I was afraid I might have contracted AIDS. I have had tests twice so far， which said that I am HIV negative. As time goes on， however， I feel more and more anxious and scared and I constantly check my body for AIDS symptoms. Whenever I hear anything about this illness， I feel really， really bad. My sleep is disturbed， I have lost my concentration， I have become short-tempered and irritable， I feel indifferent about everything and I have lost all motivation. He said that he had a long history of disturbed sleep， indifference and bad moods， the only difference being that they were short-term before and disappeared after a few days. But， following the anxiety about AIDS that started last year， they have remained with him. He had no history of taking medication and does not use drugs now. In line with the PTC model， the exact symptoms were prescribed along with the following timetable： for the first week， recreate thoughts and worries about AIDS three times a day (at 8：00， 16：00， and 23：00)， each time for 7 to 10 min. For the second week， do the same task twice a day (at8：00 and 23：00). At the beginning of the second session， the patient reported that he had done successfully about 80% of the tasks：“I feel I am much better. When I recreated those thoughts according to the timetable， at other times they did not bother me. I mean， they rarely entered my mind. Even while doing the tasks， I tried so hard to summon those thoughts， but they just didn’t come (smiles). All in all， the frequency of the thoughts has decreased by 30 to 40 percent， but they still haunt me every once in a while\". He was then assigned the following timetable： for the first week， four 5-min sessions (at 9：00，13：00， 17：00， and 23：00) every day， and for the second week， three5-min sessions (at 9：00， 17：00， and 23：00) every day. Answering the patient’s request for tasks related to depression and bad moods， the therapist told him that if depression continues after the fear of AIDS has been cured， they can arrange a timetable for it. According to the report given by the patient in the third session， he had made further improvements up to 50%. The fourth session was arranged to be four weeks later， with the following timetable to be carried out in between：for the first two weeks， three times a day (at 9：00，19：00， and 23：00)， each time for 5 min； and for the second two weeks， twice a day (at9：00 and 23：00). The patient reported in the fourth session that he had made improvement up to 90%. He also added that his bad moods and depression had also gone away， and he could sleep soundly. The following timetable was then arranged： one 5-min session for the first week (at 17：00)， and sessions on even days for the second week. He was to cease the tasks on the third week. The therapist explained to the patient that if there is a relapse after the third week， he must wait for 5 days to a week， in order to make sure the symptoms have returned. Then，he can arrange a timetable himself， similar to what was assigned to him for the first week. In the fifth session， that was held about four months later because of the summer holydays， the patient reported that he had made further improvements and there had been no relapse.\n\n【11】Evaluating the treatment outcome and follow-up\n\n【12】The result of the treatment evaluation was based on the patient's ratings and was graded on a scale from 0 to 100 as well as an open-ended question. The evaluation indicated that the 100% improvement of the patient， which resulted from PTC therapy， continued after28-month follow-up.\n\n【13】Discussion\n\n【14】The accounts given by the patient of the second session show that he has succeeded in doing the tasks. The patient reported having forgotten to say in the first session that he had been obsessed with AIDS because he thought the needle they used to take his blood was contaminated. However， due to the nature of the special clinical interview in the PTC model， in which the patient is asked to recreate the exact symptoms (the symptoms which are mentioned during the session or are later remembered； another feature in PTC model)， the patient tried to recreate these fantasies and thoughts during the tasks between the sessions. Despite the efforts made by the patient to recreate the symptoms exactly during the task， the symptoms were not re-experienced. This different condition is common during the paradoxical timetable tasks. The patient surrenders to the conditions of the disorder and is defeated by the symptoms. Suffering from these anxious symptoms， he is willing to be relieved of them and bends over backward to eliminate them. At the time of doing the tasks， the patient acts quite the reverse， according to the therapist's instructions. He wants the symptoms to be present for a couple of minutes and wants to experience them of his own volition. In this stage of treatment， the mere “wanting” constitutes the beginning of the individuals empowerment. This is the same empowerment which is called “ego-strength” and is the main and ultimate goal of PTC treatment. This wanting at the present is clearly the opposite of“not wanting in the past and signifies the individual's power and temporarily resolves the fundamental intrapsychic conflict， which is the basis for the symptoms of the disorder. In the absence of this conflict， the symptoms disappear. The amount of the symptoms was reduced during certain times of the day at a satisfactory level： the patient stated that 40% of the thoughts and worries concerning the illness anxiety were gone.\n\n【15】Based on the progress reported by the patient， the frequency and severity of the disorder， and the amount of the residual symptoms， the paradoxical timetable tasks were prescribed for the patient to be carried out in the interval between the second and the third sessions. According to a 40% progress， the patient was asked to do the tasks four times a day during the first week and three times a day during the second week. The report of the patient at the third session showed that the prior level of progress increased by 10% (i.e. 50% between the second and the third session). A one-month interval was inserted between the session three and four so that the patient would be able to do the task three times a day for the first two weeks and to continue to do it twice a day for the second two weeks. The reason behind this time interval was the severity of the illness anxiety and its consequences such as depressed mood and attention deficit， which the patient raised in the previous session. A longer interval provides an opportunity for the therapist to prove or reject the hypothes is that the symptoms are reactive； likewise， the patient will have a chance to see whether the depression and attention deficit symptoms will be relieved when the symptoms of the illness anxiety disorder are treated.\n\n【16】The patient reported a 90% progress， a condition which continued in the interval between the third and fourth sessions， which was about a month. It is regarded as a controlled and favorable condition in which the patient has a four-month break before the fifth session. According to the agreed plan， the patient ought to do the tasks once a day during the first week and every other day during the second week which concludes the tasks. Since a four-month break comes before the next session， the paradoxical timetable is explained for the patient in a way that he can prescribe for himself. This is a sort of self-therapy and is one of the features specific to PTC model. It is the same feature that turns the patient into a therapist at the end of the PTC therapy. This treatment plan will be explained to all patients in the last session and will totally obviate the need for another therapy session in case of the relapse. According to this treatment plan， and based on the therapist's instructions， the patient is trained to stop doing the tasks at a certain interval (usually two weeks) after the last therapy session. If the symptoms happen to return， the patient should prescribe and do the paradoxical timetable according to the symptom severity and similar to the therapist's instruction. The clinical evidence based on the patient's account indicates that this method is effective just like the treatment under the supervision of the therapist， returning the patient to his normal condition. The patient's account of the fifth session showed that the improvement had continued for four months and that the patient was 100% content and was ready to end the therapy.\n\n【17】Conclusion\n\n【18】The results of PTC treatment for IAD showed that PTC psychotherapy model is a successful and efficient psychotherapy. This model is a simple very short-term psychotherapy， which benefits both the therapist and the patient. Experts in the treatment of psychological disorders can easily learn the principles and techniques of this model and apply them to a range of psychological disorders. Patients can achieve the best results as well， based on the therapist's prescribed tasks in the shortest possible time. According to the treatment outcome of the patient’s follow-up as well as the published results of twenty patients with different psychological disorders ， the results of this very short-term therapeutic model have apt stability and constancy. Moreover， the relapse rate in this model is in its lowest level compared to other psychotherapeutic methods. Along with other evidence and reasons， this finding is an empirical evidence that shows PTC psychotherapy has succeeded in bringing about deep and constant therapeutic changes. Among other features of PTC psychotherapy model is the fact that the patient becomes a therapist and， if necessary， he/she can prescribe and do a similar paradoxical timetable for himself/herself.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 11:21:11", "endTime": "2024/09/24 11:21:30", "cost": 18.331}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:35", "update_time": "2024-09-23 19:21:28", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 19:21:09"}

It is isolated from patients receiving broad spectrum of antibiotics or long-term urinary catheter carriers. Its identification is one of the biggest challenges facing the laboratory because it is usually missed in routine urine cultures since it does not grow well after an overnight incubation. Thus， its diagnosis is often delayed due to the need for specific culture media， staining techniques and electron microscopy. Herein， we report one patient with clinical suspicion of Corynebacterium urinary infection. However， the isolation of the pathogen was highly demanding. The aim of this case report is to highlight the need of a multidisciplinary approach to diagnose this pathogen and the establishment of protocols to make easier its diagnosis.\n\n【2】Keywords： Infection； Encrusted cystitis； Urinary stones； Corynebacterium Lipophile\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Encrusted Cystitis (EC) is a rare form of Urinary Tract Infection (UTI)， especially in children. Is characterized by bladder， ureteral and pelvic encrustations causing pain， bladder necrosis and occasionally renal failure or death. Such encrustations are usually composed of ammonium magnesium phosphate and calcium carbonate-apatite crystals .\n\n【5】Corynebacteria Species (CS) are the cause ofthis pathology； they are gram-positive slow-growing bacillus characterized with a strong urease activity infecting the lower and upper urinary tract . CS are frequently selected by repeated broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy and are nosocomial acquired .\n\n【6】EC is treatable， but its diagnosis is often delayed. Despite suggestive symptoms and imagining features， diagnosis of EC is challenging given the need for specific culture media， staining techniques and electron microscopy . There is no consensus of treatment， but multiple options have been suggested based on three complementary elements： Antimicrobial therapy； acidification of urine， chemolysis and elimination of encrustations .\n\n【7】Here in， we report the importance of a multidisciplinary work between urologist， radiologist， microbiologist， anatomopathologist and infectiologists. After a clinical suspicion， specific staining techniques and electron microscopyare needed for its identification. In addition， due to its multiple resistances and the tissue adherence， the antibiotic treatment may be insufficient， and a multiple approach is needed.\n\n【8】An 18-year-old woman， with 10 years of repeated history of UTI， visited the urology department referring hypogastric pain， painful urination， and bladder stones expulsion. Normal uroflowmetry without postvoid residual urine. Laboratory workup did not reveal any clinically significant findings， except alkaline urine (pH 7.8). Standard urine culture was negative. Stone composition analysis revealed ammonium magnesium phosphate (struvite). CT pelvic scan showed thickening and calcification of the bladder wall . The patient went through an endoscopic transurethral resection， multiple solid neoformations coated by calcifications were resected (Figure 2). Anatomopathological analysis revealed intense mononudear leukocyte infiltration with focal calcified encrustations . The procedure exacerbated the pain.\n\n【9】Prompting a diagnosis ofEC， with pathogenic agent identification missing， a second endoscopic transurethral resection was performed. The anatomic pathology revealed again an intense mononudear leukocyte infiltration with focal calcified encrustations. Resected tissue culture for CU revealed few copies of the bacillus suggesting that urine cultures may be positive for CU infection. To confirm the species identification， PCR and sequencing was performed on the 18S ribosomal gene DNA of the bacteria isolate revealing a Corynebacterium Lipophile Group F1.\n\n【10】We started a combined therapy with levofloxacin 500 mg every 24haccordingtoantibiogram results，L-metionine and acetohidroxamic acid (125 mg every 8 h). Three weeks later an endoscopic removal was performed. After one month， the symptoms of frequency， urgency and suprapubic pain disappeared. Urinalysis was normal. Ultrasonography did not show any calcification of the bladder wall.\n\n【11】Discussion\n\n【12】Many urea-splitting bacteria are responsible for EC， but CU (or Corynebacterium group D2) are the most frequent causative agent and can be isolated from different samples including urine， blood and expelled encrustations in urine . This fastidious and opportunistic slow-growing microorganism can be missed in routine cultures， requiring enriched media and prolonged cultures(>48 h). Hence， clinical suspicion should be communicated to the microbiologist when samples are sent for culture . Another factor contributing to the delayed diagnosis is the lack of familiarity with EC and diphteroids reputation as colonizers .\n\n【13】Progress in molecular taxonomy (DNA-DNA hybridization and 16S rRNA sequencing) and in chemotaxonomy has profoundly modified the classification of Corynebacterium species. Amplified rDNA analysis， and amplification of the 16S-23S gene spacer regions can differentiate between species that are difficult to be differentiated by biochemical reactions . In our case， resected tissue culture revealed few copies ofthe bacillus suggesting that urine cultures may be positive for CU infection. To confirm the species identification， PCR and sequencing was performed on the 16S ribosomal gene， revealing a Corynebacterium lipophile group F1.\n\n【14】The correct identification is important because the antimicrobial susceptibilities of different coryneform bacterial isolates are quite variable . In addition， antibiotic therapy must be administered with urinary acidification.Endoscopiccresection of encrustations appears necessary to remove bacteria within calcified plaques (especially when cannot be dissolved by urine acidification therapy). This combined therapy should least until the mucosa is completely recovered and repeated urine culture is negative.\n\n【15】Conclusion\n\n【16】Encrusted cystitis is not a life-threatening disease but is a very painful condition. The delayed diagnosis and drug resistance of CU makes its treatment arduous. The identification of CU is one of the biggest challenges facing the laboratory and its diagnosis demands a multifocal approach. We fall upon the importance of establishing circuits to diagnose these patients as soon as possible when there is a clinical suspicion.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 10:38:21", "endTime": "2024/09/24 10:38:32", "cost": 11.362}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:35", "update_time": "2024-09-23 18:38:32", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 18:38:21"}

It usually occurs in middle-aged population and starts as a firm plaque-like lesion and is most commonly seen in the trunk. When there is a fibromatous transformation within the DFSP， the lesion can rapidly increase in size and develop an increased metastatic potential. Treatment of choice for DFSP is surgical excision with negative margins. Adjuvant therapy is indicated based on the margin status and aggressiveness of the tumor. Here we present a patient with a large DFSP with fibromatous transformation which presented as a large abdominal wall mass with gross extension into the peritoneal cavity， which was successfully excised.\n\n【2】Keywords： Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans； Abdominal mass； Fibromatous transformation； Excision\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Dermatofibrosarcoma Protuberans (DFSP) is a rare mesenchymaltumour. DFSPs are low grade tumors with low metastatic potential. In 5% to 20% ofcases，DFSPhave high grade fibrosarcomatous component and this transformation is responsible for high incidence of local relapse and distant metastases. Here we present a case of a giant DFSP of the abdominal wall which underwent rapid increase in size due to fibrosarcomatous transformation and was successfully excised.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 40 year old gentleman， otherwise fit and well， presented with a large swelling in the upper abdomen for about 5 years. The swelling was initially small and was slow growing up until a year ago when it rapidly increased in size to attain the present size. On examination， there was a large lobulated swelling in the midline measuring about 12 cm x15 cm， extending from xiphisternum to umbilicus craniocaudally and up to the midclavicular lines on either sides laterally . The skin on the surface of the mass was ulcerated at a few areas.\n\n【7】Ultrasonography of the abdomen was suggestive of heterogeneously hypoechoic mass arising from the anterior abdominal wall with moderate vascularity and cystic spaces within it. In view of giant size of the mass， contrast enhanced CT scan of abdomen was performed to look for infiltration into deeper structures. CT suggested heterogeneously enhancing lobulated protuberant lesion of12 cm x 15 cm x 13 cm， involving the skin， subcutaneous fat and musculature. The lesion was posteriorly protruding into the omentum， abutting the transverse colon and displacing the stomach posteriorly . Multiple prominent internal mammary and epigastric vessels were seen traversing into the lesion. Biopsy of the lesion was suggestive of dermatofibrosarcoma.\n\n【8】He underwent wide local excision of the giant lesion with clear margins. In view of infiltration into the abdominal wall musculature，tumor was excised along with muscular wall resulting in entry into peritoneal cavity. There was no obvious infiltration of thelesion to the intra-abdominal organs. Primary closure of the abdominal wall was done. Small defect of skin at the epigastric region was left open for healing by secondary intention. Intraoperative period was uneventful. There was no significant blood loss. Postoperatively he made a smooth recovery and he was discharged on the 2nd postoperative day. Histopathological examination of the mass on cut section showed grey white， fleshy and nodular lesion with margin clearance of 1.1 cm . Microscopic examination showed neoplastic cells arranged in a storiform and herringbone pattern with hypocellular area representing dermatofibrosarcoma andhypercellular area representing fibrosarcomatous transformation along with 5% to10% necrotic areas. Spindle cells showing hyperchromatic nudlei were present and mitotic count was more than 30 per 10 high power fields. These features were suggestive of Grade II fibrosarcomatous transformation of DFSP. Medical oncology opinion was obtained and he was advised regular follow-up.\n\n【9】Discussion\n\n【10】Dermatofibrosarcoma Protuberans (DFSP) is a slow growing，low to intermediate grade soft tissue sarcoma. It was first described by Darier and Ferrandas “progressive and recurring dermatofibroma”in1924 . DFSP arises from the dermal fibroblasts and infiltrates into the deeper subcutaneous tissues. It constitutes 1% to 6% of all soft tissue sarcomas. It is more common in the middle age adults between20 and 50 years of age with an almost equal incidence in both sexes. It occurs commonly in the trunk followed by proximal extremity and head and neck region .\n\n【11】DFSP develops as a firm plaque like lesion over the skin and characteristically grows slowly for several years and becomes protuberant with multiple nodules. Preoperatively， ultrasound scan， MRI or CT scan can be used to determine the nature of the lesion and its in filtration into the deeper tissues and surrounding vital structures. On ultrasound， DFSP appears as a well-defined hypoechoic mass. In some cases it can be mixed hypoechoic with high cellularity and hyperechoic with fibrous tissue along with tumour cells. DFSP is a moderately vascular lesion， mainly in the periphery which can be seen on color Doppler. MRI is more useful due to its high soft tissue contrast resolution. On T2 weighted images DFSP shows high signal intensity and on T1 weighted images it has similar intensity as skeletal muscle. On CT， DFSP appears isodense to the skeletal muscle and can be homogenous or heterogenous with non-enhancing areas of necrosis and cystic degeneration. CT is also useful in demonstrating involvement of underlying bones . Histopathological examination of DFSP consists of uniform spindle shaped cells with elongated nuclei arranged in a storiform pattern. These cells have low mitotic index and infiltrate in to the subcutaneous tissue in a honeycomb appearance. DFSP has different histological variants， which include myxoid， pigmented (Bednar tumor)， giant cell fibroblastoma， granular cell， sclerotic and Fibrosarcomatous (FS) components. Fibrosarcomatous transformation in a classical DFSP occurs in 5%to 20% of cases. It is an aggressive variant with high rate of local recurrence and high distant metastatic potential. Features suggesting fibrosarcomatous transformation within DFSP are at least 5% area of spindle cells showing mitotic index >7/10 high power field， high pleomorphism and herringbone growth pattern .\n\n【12】Genetically dermatofibrosarcoma is a result of translocation of chromosome t(17；22)(q22；q13) in 90% of cases， which leads to fusion of the genes COL1A1 (collagen type 1 alpha 1) on chromosome 17q21-22 and PDGFB (Platelet Derived Growth Factor Beta ) on chromosome 22q12. On immunohistochemistry classical DFSP is diffusely positive for CD34 staining in about 90%to 100% of cases， whereas in fibrosarcomatous DFSP the tumor cells lack CD34 positivity. CD34 staining is not a specific marker for dermatofibrosarcoma as it can be positive in benign neoplasms like solitary fibrous tumors and fibrohistiocytic tumors. DFSP can also express CD99 and SMA (smooth muscle antigen) but are usually negative for S100 .\n\n【13】The standard treatment for DFSP is wide local excision with 2cm to 4 cm margin. In tumors where cosmetically and functionally sensitive areas， Mohs micrographic surgery is preferred to preserve the vital tissue and prevent the local recurrence. Fibrosarcomatous variant of DFSP can also have a comparable local recurrence rate as classical DFSP， if surgical excision is done with adequate margins. Adjuvant radiotherapy improves the Disease Free Survival (DFS)， mainly in patients with close or positive margin conditions. Du et al. in their study， on role of adjuvant radiotherapy found that 5-year DFS was 88.1% for surgery and radiotherapy group compared to56.2% for surgery alone group . Systemic therapy with Imatinib mesylate， a tyrosine kinase inhibitor is beneficial in locally inoperable cases and metastatic DFSP. Imatinib acts by competitively binding to platelet-derived growth factor receptors on tumor cells and block their tyrosine kinase activity. Detection of chimeric gene COL1A1-PDGFB presence in tumour cells prior to starting systemic therapy with Imatinib is advisable to know the benefit. The usual dose of Imatinib is 400 mg/day and in cases with poor response， the dose can be increased to 600 mg/day to 800 mg/day. Novel VEGFR (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor) inhibitors such as Pazopanib， Sorafenib and Apatinib are on evaluation in controlling the Imatinib resistant cases.\n\n【14】The prognosis of DFSP is affected by the age， resection margin， lesion number， and histological subtype. Patients with age >50years， resection margin <2 cm and fibrosarcomatous variant have poor prognosis. Ki-67， tumor proliferation activity indicator is another prognostic factor. Tumors with high Ki-67 shows poor prognosis . Our patient presented with a slow growing anterior abdominal wall mass for 5 years with rapid growth in the last 1 year. Final histopathological examination after wide excision showed fibrosarcomatous variant of dermatofibrosarcoma with high mitotic count (>30 per 10 high power field). We believe that the rapid increase in size is due to the fibrosarcomatous transformation within the DFSP.\n\n【15】Conclusion\n\n【16】Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberancceeis rare soft tissule sarcoma with low distant metastatic potential. Fibrosarcomatous transformation which occurs in 5% to 20% of DFSP is an aggressive variant with high recurrence rates and high metastatic potential. Surgical resection with wide margins is the treatment of choice. Adjuvant radiotherapy in cases of close margins will prevent local recurrence.

Cutaneous lesion involvement is a rare clinical manifestation of IgG4-RD. We report a case of IgG4-RD presenting with cutaneous lesions in combination with autoimmune pancreatitis and subacute thyroiditis. A skin biopsy pathology confirmed the diagnosis of IgG4-RD. Here we present an uncommon case of IgG4-RD with subacute thyroiditis with pancreatic and skin involvement and provide a brief literature review of skin manifestations and treatment.\n\n【2】Keywords： Autoimmune pancreatitis； IgG4-related disease； Rash Skin pathology\n\n【3】Case Presentation\n\n【4】A 78-year-old woman was presented to the rheumatology clinic a year ago for scattered rashes on her lower extremities and pain in. The skin lesion began to be pinpoint-like and gradually merged， with clear boundaries， no pruritus， and hyperpigmentation . Six years before this presentation， she was treated for diarrhea and anorexia in another hospital. Pancreas Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) was performed which revealed suspected pancreatic cancer . Endoscopic Ultrasonography (EUS) revealed a 2.5 cm×1.6 cm round mass in the pancreatic tail. The EUS of a fine-needle aspiration ofpancreatic mass showed clumps of acinus and ductal epithelium， and no malignant cells and atypical epithelial cells were discovered. The serum IgG4 concentration was 4.78 g/L. Treatments such as supplementation of pancreatic enzymes， inhabitation of retinoic acid and protection of the gastric mucosa were initiated. But the patient is still suffering from recurrent diarrhea. Autoimmune pancreatitis was presumed after CT angiography of the pancreas was administrated with contrast material. Treatment with prednisone at an initial dose of 25 mg per day was started in April 2015， and the dosage was gradually reduced to 5 mg per day. After half a year of treatment， the diarrhea had not significantly abated， so the therapy was withdrawn. The pancreas lesion did not no progress at the 6-year follow up confirmed by CT scan， however IgG4level increased to 7.01 g/L.\n\n【5】Three years before this presentation， the patient was evaluated by colonoscopy due to abdominal IOS pain and asubmucosaleminence lesion was detected in the ascen ding colon. Therighthemicolectomy was performed to remove the cancer. The biopsy demonstrated a partial mass-like lesion in which all mucosa infiltrated with lymphocytic clusters， fibrous tissue hyperplasia， twisted blood vessels， and no granulomatous lesions was found. The distribution of T lymphocyte and B lymphocyte infiltration was proportional. No medication was administrated to her. The patient also had a history of hypertension and thrombocytopenia. On examination， she was found to have cutaneous lesion on her lower extremities and tenderness in her neck. The polymorphic eruption consists of multiple， scattered， dark brown rashes， varying in size up to 5 cm on both lower extremities， with no desquamation or raised lesions. Hemoglobin was 109 g/L (reference range 115-150 g/L)， C-reactive protein was 26.37 mg/L (reference range 0-10 mg/L)， erythrocyte sedimentation rate was50 mm/H (reference range 0-20 mm/H)， procalcitonin was 0.051 ng/mL (reference range <0.046ng/mL)， creatinine was 90 umol/L (reference range 41-81 umol/L)， IgG4 was 2.56 g/L (reference range 0.01 g/L)， serum thyroglobulin was more than 500 ng/mL (reference range 3.5-77 ng/mL). Coagulation， complement， thyroid function and tumor markers were normal. Autoantibodies were positive for antinuclear antibody with titer 1：300 (Immunofluorescent pattern： Granular type). Antinuclear antibody profiles， rheumatoid factor， anti-CCP antibody， anticardiolipin antibody， and antineutrophil antibody were all negative. B-ultrasound ofperipherallymph nodes revealed enlarged inguinal and axillary lymph nodes. Thyroid B-ultrasound suggested an abnormal echo in the right lobe of thethyroid， and subacute thyroiditis was considered. Magnetic Resonance Cholangiopancreatography(MRCP) showed splenomegaly and esophagogastric varices. Skin pathology was necessary for the differential diagnosis and a skin biopsy was performed. The pathological manifestation demonstrated a small amount of plasma cells and infiltrated lymphocytes in the papillary dermis and adjacent to small blood vessels， collagen fibers hyperplasia with hyaline degeneration in the dermal reticular layer， adnexa reduced， IgG4+ plasma cell staining， 12 to 14 IgG4+ plasma cells per high magnification .\n\n【6】The clinical manifestations involved multiple organs and combined with increased serum IgG4 concentration and the biopsy results， the patient was diagnosed with IgG4-RD associated with subacute thyroiditis. Accordingly， the patient was prescribed oral prednisone 30 mg daily. Her rash and diarrhea gradually improved after treatment. After two months， IgG4 was reduced to 1.24 g/L， the rash had completely subsided， and the diarrhea had improved significantly. The prednisone was reduced to 5 mg per day as a maintenance therapy， and there was no rash and diarrhea recurred during the subsequent 1-year follow-up.\n\n【7】Discussion\n\n【8】IgG4-RD is a unique clinical pathological disorder characterized by elevated circulating IgG4 levels and tissue infiltration of IgG4+plasma cells. Various organs are involved in IgG4-RD including the pancreas， salivary glands， lacrimal glands， bile ducts， peritoneum， kidneys， pituitary glands， lungs， and thyroid glands. Thus， symptoms and signs vary depending on the organs involved and the severity of the disease .\n\n【9】This case provided a patient with IgG4-RD involving the pancreas， skin and subacute thyroiditis. The cutaneous pathology facilitated a definitive diagnosis for this patient and allowed her to respond well to therapy. Only a few dozen cases of skin lesions associated IgG4-RD had been reported so far. Skin lesions can present as erythema， subcutaneous nodules， or papules， and are mostly distributed around the ears， face， and limbs， and are often combined with dacryoadenitis and sialadenitis， with infrequent involvement of the pancreas，liver， and biliary tract. Given this patient's previous history， clinical presentation， and constellation of symptoms， we suspect that subacute thyroiditis is secondary to IgG4-RD .\n\n【10】The specificity of skin lesions related to IgG4-RD is very poor. At present， the skin lesions can be classified into seven subtypes： 1) cutaneous plasmacytosis (multiple papulonodules or indurations on the trunk and proximal part of the limbs)，2) pseudolymphoma and angiolymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia (plaques and papulonodules mainly on the periauricular， cheek and mandible regions)， 3) Mikulicz disease (palpebral swelling， sicca syndrome and exophthalmos)， 4) psoriasis-like eruption (strikingly mimicking psoriasis vulgaris)， 5) unspecified maculopapular or erythematous eruptions， 6) hypergammaglobulinemic purpura (bilateral asymmetrical palpable purpuric lesions on the lower extremities) and urticarial vasculitis (prolonged urticarial lesions occasionally with purpura) and 7) ischemic digit (Raynaud phenomenon and digital gangrene). Most of the lesions are subacute and it often takes months or years to be diagnosed. Regardless of the organ involved， the key histologic features are dense lymphoplasmacytic infiltration， storiform fibrosis， and thrombophlebitis. Among skin lesions， however， thrombophlebitis is rarely observed and occurs clinically in IgG4-RD.\n\n【11】Not all patients with skin lesions require treatment， but without treatment， skin lesions are at risk of persistence or enlargement， whether treated or not， depending on symptoms and the extent of organinvolvement. IgG4levels can often be used as a markerto monitor therapeutic response. Steroids are usually effective in treating IgG4-RD， but immunosuppressants such as methotrexate， azathioprine， and mycophenolate mofetil are also effective. In addition， rituximab also has some effect on IgG4-RD treatment. After this patient was treated with a moderate dose of prednisone monotherapy， the rash did not recur， thyroid pain and diarrhea significantly resolved， and the levels of serological marker IgG4 returned to the normal range. Imaging findings on the pancreas is still under follow-up. While patients respond well to glucocorticoids， relapse rates remained high during reduction and maintenance therapy. Currently， the optimal therapy is still being explored .\n\n【12】This patient also had a mucosal protrusion in the ascending colon. She received a diagnosis of suspected Crohn's disease by a gastroenterologist at another hospital. The diagnosis was ruled out after a multi-disciplinary team discussion. We speculate that the mucosal lesion in the ascending colon may be related to IgG4-RD.\n\n【13】In conclusion， we have described an infrequent patient with IgG4-RD involving the skin and pancreas who was definitively diagnosed and effectively treated with the help of skin pathology. Importantly， it has been recognized that many different morphological rashes can also occur in IgG4-RD. Correct diagnosis relies on serum IgG4 levels and histological and immunohistochemical analysis.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 11:24:14", "endTime": "2024/09/24 11:24:33", "cost": 18.841}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:35", "update_time": "2024-09-23 19:24:32", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 19:24:13"}

The echocardiography revealed severe systolic dysfunction， mild pleural and pericardial effusion， and coronaryartery dilation. The patient developed multiorgan dysfunction and received treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin， Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist， and high doses of corticosteroids， vasoactive and inotropic support， anticoagulant therapy， and diuretics with complete resolution of clinical heart failure and normalized Left Ventricle (LV) ejection fraction within 10 days. Further studies are necessary to know ifa better prognosis in PIMS-TS related severe myocarditis is expected in patients with previously normal myocardium compared with patients with myocardial damage in acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection through direct injury of the virus(non-immune mechanism).\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Romania.\n\n【4】Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) is the name provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The proposed definition implies the demonstration of association with SARS-CoV-2 infection by RT-PCR， antigen test， serology， or COVID-19exposure within 4 weeks before the onset of symptoms， in an individual aged <21 years presenting with fever， inflammation， evidence of multisystem (≥ 2) organ involvement and no alternative plausible diagnoses. Pediatric Inflammatory Multisystem Syndrome Temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection (PIMS-TS) is the name provided by Royal College of Pediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH)， and refers to a child presenting with persistent fever， inflammation， evidence of single or multiorgan dysfunction， with no evidence of a microbial cause and with a positive or negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR test . It was initially thought that children were asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic in SARS-CoV-2 infection， however 4，404 patients with PIMS-TS were reported by CDC this year. Half of the children with PIMS-TS were between the ages of 5 and 13 years.99% of patients had a positive test result for SARS-CoV-2 and 1% had contact with someone with COVID-19.\n\n【5】The clinical features of PIMS-TS patients are non-specific and wide； the most common signs and symptoms are： Persistent fever， hands and feet edema， conjunctivitis， swollen and cracked red lips， rash， abdominal pain， vomiting， diarrhea， shock， and lymphadenopathy . Godfred-Cato et al.  studied the characteristics of 570 patients with PIMS-TS and reported the following system involvement： Gastrointestinal 90.9%， cardiovascular 86.5%， dermatologic 70.9%， hematologic73.9%， respiratory 63.0%， neurologic 38.2% and renal 18.4%. The most common cardiovascular findings were hypotension 49.5%， elevated NT-pro-BNP 43.2%， cardiac dysfunction 40.6%， shock35.4%， elevated troponin 30.9%， mitral regurgitation 25.5%，pericardial effusion 23.9%， myocarditis 22.8%， coronary artery dilatation 18.6% and congestive heart failure7%.\n\n| Parameter  | Patient  | Reference values  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Complete Blood Count (CBC)  |  |  |\n| White blood cells count-WBC (x 103uL)  | 25.3  | 5.50  |\n| Neutrophils-NEU(x 10芦L)  | 22.83  | 1.50-8  |\n| Lymphocytes-LYM (x 103uL)  | 1.95  | 1.50-7  |\n| Platelets-PLT(x10/pL)  | 106  | 150.00  |\n| Hemoglobin-HGB (g/dL)  | 10  | 11.50  |\n| Mean corpuscular volume-MCV (fL)  | 76.3  | 75-89  |\n| Inflammatory markers  |  |  |\n| C-Reactive Protein-CRP(mg/L)  | 137.92  | 00.00  |\n| Procalcitonin-PCT (ng/mL)  | 1.92  | <0.05  |\n| Interleukin 6-IL-6 (pg/mL)  | 40.36  | <7  |\n| Fibrinogen (mg/dL)  | 364  | 140.00  |\n| Acid-Base balance  |  |  |\n| pH  | 7.413  | 7.45  |\n| PCO2(mmHg)  | 47  | 32-48  |\n| HCO3 (mmol/L)  | 29.3  | 22-26  |\n| Electrolytes  |  |  |\n| Na (mmol/L)  | 136.6  | 138-144  |\n| K (mmol/L)  | 3.44  | 3.9  |\n| Biochemistry  |  |  |\n| TGO (U/L)  | 59  | 2.00  |\n| TGP (U/L)  | 32  | 2.00  |\n| Urea (mg/dL)  | 43  | <39  |\n| Creatinine (mg/dL)  | 0.9  | <1.2  |\n| Total seric protein (g/dL)  | 5.32  | 6.00  |\n| Albumin (g/dL)  | 2.81  | 3.40  |\n| LDH (UI/L)  | 288  | 120.00  |\n| CK(U/L)  | 26  | 7.00  |\n| CK-MB(U/L)  | 23  | 7.00  |\n| Troponin T (ng/L)  | <40  | <40  |\n| NT-pro-BNP(pg/mL)  | 48793  | <125  |\n| APTT (Sec)  | 28.2  | 24.00  |\n| D-Dimer (ug/mL)  | 7  | 0.00-0.50  |\n| PT (sec)  | 13.1  | 11.60  |\n| INR  | 0.96  | 0.20  |\n| Ferritin (ng/mL)  | 542.3  | 14-124  |\n| Bacteriology  |  |  |\n| Blood culture  | Negative  |  |\n| Urine culture  | Negative  |  |\n| Stool culture  | Negative  |  |\n| Serology  |  |  |\n| SARS-CoV-2IgG  | POSITIVE  |  |\n| RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2  | Negative  |  |\n\n【7】As a new described syndrome， first reported on April 7h， 2020， PIMS-TS was initially considered Kawasaki Disease (KD)-like syndrome due to persistent fever， rash， cervical lymphadenopathy， ocular and oral mucosal changes， peripheral extremity changes such as erythema of palms， edema of hands and feet， and elevated inflammatory markers. PIMS-TS are usually associated with an incomplete form of KD. The age of onset is mostly >5-year-old in PIMS-TS and <5-year-old in KD. Patients with Kawasaki disease and poor myocardial function may present with severe systolic dysfunction or shock， which defines Kawasaki Disease Shock Syndrome (KDSS)， a potentially life-threatening condition .\n\n【8】Shock， as a cardiovascular complication and modality of onset may be present in more than one third of the children . Shock accompanying PIMS-TS may be cardiogenic， distributive or both . To increase the degree of recognition of the severe cardiovascular involvement， we selected a PIMS-TS case from the Department of Pediatrics of Marie Curie Children’s Emergency Hospital， Bucharest， Romania.\n\n【9】Case Presentation\n\n【10】A six-year-old male child was admitted to our pediatric department by transfer from another hospital， where he was admitted with a five-day history ofhigh fever (39℃ to 40℃)， headache， apathy， and gastrointestinal symptoms (diffuse abdominal pain and vomit). During the first 24 h，he became drowsy， developed edema ofthehands and feet， and hypotension. Despite fluid resuscitation with normal saline and inotropic agents， the patient’s blood pressure remained low at 63 mmHg/23 mmHg and he was transferred to our pediatric ward for further investigation and treatment. Previously， he was a healthy child with no past medical history. The family also revealed that a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak was present in the kindergarten two months ago. The COVID-19 exposure matches the peak incidence of SARS-CoV-2 third wave (middle March 2021) in Romania .\n\n【11】The physical examination on admission showed pale， dry skin， palpebral and palmoplantar edema， red and cracked lips， conjunctival erythema， cervical lymphadenopathy， decreased skin turgor， capillary refill time (CRT<3 sec)， oliguria. He had tachypnea (respiratory rate=50 breaths per minute)， dyspnea and orthopnea， chest retractions， diminished breath sounds in both lung bases， fine crackles， 92%Oxygen Saturation (SpO2) on room air. The cardiovascular assessment showed tachycardia， (heart rate =120 beats per minute)， Blood Pressure (BP) 65/47 mmHg and muffled heart sounds. The liver edge was palpable 3 cm under the ribs. The child was drowsy， Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS=12). His weight on admission was 17.5kg， which represented a 2-kilogram weight gain.\n\n【12】Laboratory findings at the time of admission are shown in Table1. Electrocardiogram (ECG) in evolution showed ST-T changes- mild ST depression in V2-V4 and negative/biphasic T waves in V1-V5， aVL .\n\n【13】Considering the clinical presentation with cardiogenic shock， an echocardiography was performed in emergency and it revealed severe systolic LV dysfunction with diffuse ventricular hypokinesia(LV ejection fraction-25%)， mild RV dysfunction， small pleural and pericardial effusion， mild coronary artery dilation (right coronary artery- RCA-Z score +2，05 and left coronary artery-LCA-Z score+2，2) .\n\n【14】All the criteria for the definition ofPIMS-TS accordingtoRCPCH， CDC and WHO were fulfilled： Child's age <19 years， fever lasting for morethan 3 days，mucocutaneous inflammation signs，gastrointestinal symptoms，hypotension， features of myocardial dysfunction (muffled heart sounds， elevated NT-pro-BNP， severe systolic dysfunction and coronary abnormalities)， evidence of coagulopathy (increased D-dimers)， elevated markers of inflammation， no obvious microbial cause for inflammation， positive serology for SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\n【15】The case was approached by a multidisciplinary team involving a pediatrician， an infectious disease specialist， a pediatric cardiologist， a radiologist， and an intensive care physician. It was considered PIMS-TS with cardiogenic shock， similar to KDSS.\n\n【16】It was treated with： Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIG) 500mg/kg for 5 days， Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist 2 mg/kg for 7days， high doses of corticosteroids (Methylprednisolone 4 mg/kg)， antibiotic therapy (Meropenem in association with Vancomycin)， oxygen therapy， anticoagulant (Enoxaparin 100 UI/kg/day)， vasoactive and inotropic support， Adrenaline (initially dosage 0.1ug/kg/min， then in decreasing dosage until minimum 0.02 ug/kg/min) and Dopamine (10 ug/kg/min) for five days， subsequently， he received treatment with combined diuretic therapy， ACE-inhibitor and beta-blocker.\n\n【17】The clinical evolution following the treatment was favorable， with the improvement of general condition and the resolution of heart failure signs and symptoms. The cardiac ultrasound showed an increase of the left ventricular ejection fraction to 60% and normal aspect of the coronary arteries at 10 days from admission in our clinic.\n\n【18】CBC showed a normal number of leukocytes after 10 days of treatment. The inflammatory response slowly decreased with normalization of the values in 5 days .\n\n【19】The patient was discharged after 18 days of hospitalization and received treatment with Aspirin， Bisoprolol， Lisinopril， Spironolactone (cardiac remodeling). A cardiac ultrasound was performed a month later， showing normal heart function， allowing the gradually withdrawal of the treatment.\n\n| Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) CDC- Case definition  | Pediatric multisystem inflammatorysyndrome temporally associated with  | Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children(MIS-C) WHO -Case definition  | Case presentation  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) CDC- Case definition  | COVID-19 (PIMS-TS) RCPCH-Casedefinition  | Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children(MIS-C) WHO -Case definition  | Case presentation  |\n| Age <21 years  |  | Age 0-19 years  | Age  |\n| Fever >38.0°℃ for ≥ 24 hours  | Persistent fever >38.5°C  | Fever e 3 Days  | Fever  |\n| Inflammation  |  |  |  |\n| CRP， ESR， Procalcitonin  | 1.

There are three types of syndromes described as clinical phenotypes that can occur at the onset of PIMS： 1) Fever with hyperinflammation，2) Kawasaki disease-like features， and 3) Shock . PIMS-related shock is a frequent clinical presentation described either as vasoplegic (warm) shock unresponsive to fluid resuscitation ， cardiogenic， or a combination of them . Cardiogenic shock is an acute state with low cardiac output which furthermore leads to hypoperfusion and tissue hypoxia . The pathophysiology of PIMS related cardiogenic shock is not fully understood. In the symptomatic phase， three main immune mechanisms have an impact on cardiovascular involvement：the appearance of a cytokine storm， activation of immune cells(including neutrophils)， and deposits of immune complexes. The cytokine storm is mainly responsible for vasoplegia while IL6， CRP and activation of neutrophils lead to myocardial injury . A similar condition to PIMS related shock state is Kawasaki disease - shock syndrome， first described by Kanegaye et al. However， Kawasaki disease was first described in the 1960s  so during the five decades since it was reported， its pathogeny was better studied. Because of clinical similarities between PIMS and Kawasaki disease， it has been assumed that PIMS might be an immune complex-induced vasculitis and there might be several common pathways between Kawasaki disease and PIMS .\n\n【23】Myocarditis (described in several degrees， usually subclinical/mild) is aconstantfinding in almost all patients at the onset of Kawasaki disease，before the appearance of coronaryaneurysms. Several studies reveal myocardial inflammation at the microscopic examination as part ofpostmortem examination ，on en domyocardial biopsy ， or cardiac MRI. Moreover， Printz et al.  indicate an association between the level of systemic inflammatory status in Kawasaki disease and the left ventricle ejection fraction.\n\n【24】The endomyocardial biopsy cannot be routinely practiced， being an invasive procedure. Due to lack of consensus for the diagnosis of myocarditis， we defined myocarditis based on the criteria mentioned by Dasgupta et al. ： Elevated cardiac enzymes， ST segment elevation or depression on ECG， regional/global wall motion abnormalities with impaired LV function on echocardiography.\n\n【25】NT-pro-BNP is a polypeptide produced in atrial and left ventricle myocardiocytes when they are prone to mechanical stretch . Therefore， NT-pro-BNP is a well-known biomarker for heart failure.\n\n【26】We hypothesize 2 possible theories. Firstly， myocarditis might have been initiated due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. It overlaps the 3rd wave of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in Romania and the child was asymptomatic. Several studies indicate that subclinical myocarditis can occur in pediatric patients during viral infections . Symptoms of heart failure appeared after a 1.5 month delay from the initial infection. Therefore， an underlying mild degree of myocardial edema might persist after the initial SARS-CoV-2 infection. It might have been in resolution (activation of myocardial fibroblasts) if PIMS-TS would not have occurred. Due to PIMS-TS， a huge amount of vasoactive cytokines were released，leading to vasoplegic shock and increasing the level of myocardial edema which might explain the pathophysiology of cardiogenic shock in this patient. Troponin level was in the normal range at the moment of admission in contrast to a marked elevated level of NT-pro-BNP. Due to these two processes that overlapped (subclinical myocarditis and the cytokine storm which increased the level of interstitial edema of the heart) the myocardiocytes were increasingly stretched but not injured，leading to extremely high levels of NT-pro-BNP while the levels of troponin were at the upper limit of normal range values.\n\n【27】The second hypothesis refers to a newly developed PIMS-TS intramyocardial edema in a patient without myocardial damage during the acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection . Like we mentioned before， three main mechanisms are involved in PIMS-TS development， according to which pathway is more prominent， so it can clinically present as fulminant myocarditis (mostly described in adults)， acute heart failure， or mild/moderate myocardial enzyme elevation . Acute heart failure manifestation is linked with the over stimulating vasoactive cytokine pathway which furthermore leads to vasoplegic shock. Myocardial cell injury might have happened if the2d pathway would have been more prominent (activation of immune cells， neutrophils included) together with increased levels of IL6 and CRP. In this case， the levels of IL6 are CRP were mildly elevated， not leading to an acute muscular cardiac destruction. Once newly developed intramyocardial edema and distributive shock can lead to low LV ejection fraction and clinical manifestation of shock. So we admit that the shock in our case had two components： Cardiogenic and vasoplegic.\n\n【28】The cardiogenic shock had a favorable outcome in our case using 2 inotropic agents Adrenaline (initially dosage 0.1 ug/kg/min，) and Dopamine (10 ug/kg/min) for five days， then only Dopamine for another five days alongside with cardiac remodeling medication： Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitor (Lisinopril)， Spironolactone， Furosemide and Bisoprolol . Clinical condition progressively improved， with resolution of pulmonary stasis， good cerebral perfusion and normalized blood pressure values within 7days， with no mechanical circulatory support required. This clinical presentation matches the information reported by several authors， in which patients with PIMS-TS-cardiogenic shock had a favorable outcome primarily due to immune-mediated damage rather than myocardial injury post SARS-CoV-2 replication. The full recovery in such a short time (with normalized cardiac function by echocardiography in 10 days) using corticosteroids， IVIG， IL-1receptor antagonist and supportive cardiac medication could be an argument for our second hypothesis consisting with PIMS-TS related myocarditis on previously normal myocardium. In conclusion， this case presents a different clinical onset compared with other Covid-19related infections  or PIMS-TS cases  in Romanian pediatric population.\n\n【29】Conclusion\n\n【30】PIMS-TS is a new described pediatric syndrome which can present as several clinical phenotypes， and some of them can be life-threatening. Cardiogenic shock related to PIMS-TS (with underlying immune myocarditis) is an often clinical presentation with favorable outcome if specific treatment against cytokine storm and supportive cardiac medication are promptly administered. Further studies are necessary to know if a better prognosis in PIMS-TS related severe myocarditis is expected in patients with previously normal myocardium compared with patients with myocardial damage in acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection through direct injury of the virus (non-immune mechanism).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 11:40:52", "endTime": "2024/09/24 11:41:56", "cost": 63.729}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:35", "update_time": "2024-09-23 19:41:56", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 19:40:52"}

The source of the bacteria Coxiella burnetii was an infected herd of sheep. The epidemy lasted from February to April 2016. During this period 28 people got ill. Besides having high temperature and fever the people suffered from exhaustion， fatigue， nausea， vomiting and diarrhea as well as confused condition. Chest X-ray revealed interstitial pulmonary infiltrates in the majority of patients， localized in a single pulmonary lobe (25 or 89.3%). Pleural effusion was recorded in 3(10.7%) patients. In their treatment tetracyclines (doxycycline) were used and azithromycin and ciprofloxacin for treating the smaller number of ill people. Doxycycline showed the best clinical efficacy. All patients were cured. In this epidemia， the Q-fever in people was caused by the infected sheep and contaminated area in which the infected sheep stayed.\n\n【2】Keywords： Q-febris； Clinical characteristics； Epidemiology\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Q-fever is a zoonosis caused by the intracellular gram-negative bacterium Coxiella (C.) burnetii， which is distributed worldwide， except in New Zealand . Q-fever in animals usually causes a clinically inapparent infection. Q-fever in humans can be an acute or chronic disease， and they differ in duration， clinical presentation and serological test findings. Acute Q-fever can be asymptomatic or manifest as a short-term febrile illness， atypical pneumonia， and granulomatous hepatitis . Chronic Q-fever is most often presented as endocarditis， and less often as endovascular infection， chronic infection during pregnancy， chronic hepatitis， chronic lung infection and infections of the locomotor system . Endocarditis is responsible for 60% to 70% of cases of chronic C. burnetii infection . It is a disease of some wild and almost all domestic animals， among which it is maintained and transmitted by vectors (ticks). Among domestic animals， the most common hosts are ruminants， but it has also been proven in horses，pigs， camels，bison， rabbits， squirrels， mice， wild game， domestic poultry and wild birds. The most common source of infection for humans is sheep， goats and cattle. The causative agent， C. burneti， is excreted in the milk of infected animals， and there are extremely many causative agents in amniotic fluid， sheaths，lochia secretions and on wool. Humans are usually infected by inhaling dust contaminated with C. burnetii bacteria and by contact with infectious materials， during childbirth， abortion or slaughter. In humans， the infection is manifested by a severe headache，high fever， pain in the back and joints， and atypical pneumonia usually occurs. In the chronic form， a person can suffer from endocarditis and hepatosplenomegaly， and the outcome can be fatal.\n\n【5】In our country， Q-fever regularly appears at the end of winter or in spring， during the lambing of sheep， so it is extremely seasonal. In previous years， Q-fever in our country was more frequent and associated with nomadic sheep grazing. Thelast Q-fever epidemic in the Banja Luka region occurred in 2004. In 2015， 42 cases of this zoonosis were registered in the Banja Luka region. Epizootics and epidemics have been described in various countries. Nebreda et al. In 2001， it was described in Spain by Serbezov et al. 1999 in Bulgaria and Slovakia， Literak and Rehacek，1996) in the Czech Republic and Slovak Republic， Tringali and Mansueto 1987 in Italy .\n\n【6】The goal of the paper was to show the importance of this disease， a zoonosis that occurs in our area， especially in the differential diagnosis of unclear febrile conditions， by presenting the Q fever epidemic.\n\n【7】MaterialandMethods\n\n【8】In the period from February 1' to April 304， 2016， 28 people， 23men and 5 women， fell ill with Q-fever. Most of the patients were from Banja Luka， the Laus settlement (80%)， and 20% from the surrounding towns， Celinac， Kotor Varos， Gradiska， Han Kola. The youngest patient was 31 and the oldest 66. The affected population consisted of 82.1% men and 17.9% women. The extracted blood was sent to the Department of Microbiology， UKC RS Banja Luka for serological testing for Q-fever.\n\n【9】The diagnosis of Q-fever was made by detecting specificantibodies byenzymeeimmunoassay(ELISA，Virion-Serion， Wiitzburg， Germany). Specific IgM and IgG antibodies to the C. burnetii phase2 antigens， which appears in the acute phase of the disease， and specific IgG antibodies to the C. burnetii phase 1 antigens， which are indicative of the chronic form in addition to elevated antibodies to the C. burnetii phase 2 antigens， were determined. diseases. IgM antibodies to C. burnetii phase 2 antigens as well as IgG antibodies to C. burnetii phase 1 antigens were expressed quantitatively and were considered positive if the measured extinctions were greater than the extinctions for the standard control sample that determined the assay cutoff. IgG antibodies to C. burnetii phase 2 antigens were expressed quantitatively and a titer result greater than 30 U/mL units per mL was considered a positive finding. Values of 20 U/mL to 30 U/mL were considered a borderline finding. IgM antibodies for phase 2antigens and IgG antibodies for phase 1 C. burnetii can be expressed as index values，i.e.，the ratio of the measured extinction for the serum and the extinction of the cutoff value of the test. An index value greater than 1.1 is considered positive， while the threshold score is an index value of 0.9 to 1.1.\n\n【10】Results\n\n【11】Incubation in humans ranged from two to three weeks. In sick people， the most common symptoms were elevated bodytemperature(some higher than 40C)， nausea， vomiting， diarrhea， fatigue and malaise. An elevated temperature is the dominant sign in all patients， and in most patients， it was over 39°C. Headache of high intensity， especially in the frontal part and retrobulbar， was pronounced in most of the patients. Cough as a significant sign was dry and irritating with admixtures of blood in the sputum in only one patient. Atypical pneumonia developed in 100% of patients. Liver damage manifested by elevated values of Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST)， Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT)， and Gamma Glutamyl Transferase (yGT) was recorded in 19 (67.8%)， 17 (60.7%)， and 10 (35.7%) of the patient. The value of aminotransferases in one patient was increased more than five times expressed in international units per ml (i.j/ml)； AST349 IU/ml and ALT 1422 IU/ml. Serological tests included testing of serum from a group of patients， taken about 10 days after the onset of the disease， in the group of patients a significant titer ofantibodies to C. burnetii was demonstrated. In the treatment， doxycycline was most often used， and in some cases， azithromycin and ciprofloxacin. All applied antibiotics and chemotherapeutics were effective in the treatment.\n\n【12】Discussion\n\n【13】Q-fever is known in humans as primary atypical pneumonia， seven-day fever， desert fever， Balkan flu， Italian fever， Crimean fever and Cretan pneumonia . People who work with animals， veterinarians， cattle breeders and workers in slaughterhouses are most often exposed to the infection. During February， March and April 2016， a total of 28 patients were treated in the UKC RS Banja Luka， 21 in the Clinic for Infectious Diseases， six in the Clinic for Pulmonary Diseases and one patient for Internal Diseases.\n\n【14】The sick mostly came from the Banja Luka settlement of Laus， who came into contact with sheep infected with C. burnetii. Airborne route of infection， inhalation of contaminated dust. In this epidemic， there was contact of most people with a herd of infected sheep， and a part with a contaminated area. It is known that C. burnetii， in the form of spores， can survive for a long time in the external environment and cause disease in people who have been in contact with infected aerosol . In addition， it has been confirmed that Coxiella can be blown by the wind to greater distances . The resistance of the bacterium C. burnetii to adverse environmental conditions，especially to desiccation，played a crucial role. The authors state that C. burnetii remains infectious in an aerosol for up to two weeks， and in the soil for up to five months. In dried material， the causative agent can survive from 30 to 500 days . Just one C. burnetii bacterium is enough to cause disease in a susceptible person. This agent can be developed for use as a biological weapon and is considered a potential terrorist threat. Human-to-human transmission is rare. Kruszewska et al. described the possibility of sexual transmission of Q-fever in humans. The research was conducted on nine pairs of shepherds from Poland who worked seasonally in Spain. After returning to Poland， shepherds and their wives fell ill with Q-fever. C. burnetii was isolated from urine and semen samples of men. Cases of Q-fever in pregnant women have been described. Hellmeyer et al. describe placentitis and premature birth in 30%， slow fetal growth in 46%， spontaneous abortion in 22% and fetal death in the womb in 7% of cases .\n\n【15】Q-fever belongs to acute febrile diseases. The clinical symptoms were as follows： elevated body temperature， in some patients higher than 40°C， accompanied by fever. Other symptoms included cough， chest pain， headache， myalgias， nausea， vomiting and diarrhea， fatigue， malaise， confusional state (delirium). An X-ray of the lungs was performed in all patients upon admission to the hospital， and in 100% of patients an interstitial infiltrate was detected， located in one lung lobe (25 or 89.3%). Pleural effusion was registered in three(10.7%) patients.\n\n【16】28 or 100% of patients had an elevated CRP value. 9 or 32.1%had a CRP value of 10 mg/L to 100 mg/L， 101 mg/L to 200 mg/L 16or 57.2%， and 201 mg/L to 300 mg/L 3 or 10.7% of patients. Liver damage manifested by elevated values of aspartate aminotransferase， alanine aminotransferase， and gamma glutamyl transferase waS present in most of our patients. One third of patients， 9 of them(32.1%) had normal aminotransferases. Also， blood cultures were taken from all hospitalized patients， and sputum from some patients for bacteriological processing.\n\n【17】The disease was serologically confirmed in 28 patients. They were treated with tetracycline (doxycycline) for fourteen days， and a few patients with azithromycin and ciprofloxacin. In the initial therapy， some of the beta-lactam antibiotics were used in the majority of patients 20 (71.4%). Most of the patients were hospitalized， and some were treated on an outpatient basis. Various antibiotics (mainlybeta-lactams， quinolones， azithromycin) were administered to patients on an outpatient basis， before hospitalization， in 85.7% (24 patients)， which indicates a sometimespremature and quick decision to include antibiotics.\n\n【18】C. burnetii is innately resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics and aminoglycosides， and sensitive to tetracyclines， co-trimoxazole， rifampicin and fluoroquinolones. Mortality of untreated chronic Q-fever can be more than 65% . Adequate antimicrobial therapy significantly reduces mortality， but the causative agent is difficult to eradicate， which is why prolonged antimicrobial therapy is needed. Monotherapy with any of these antibiotics reduces the symptoms of chronic Q-fever. According to in vitro research， inside the phagosome where C. burnetii is located is an acidic medium that may be responsible for the loss of the bactericidal properties of some antibiotics. When antimicrobial therapy is stopped， disease relapses often occur， which is why combined antimicrobial therapy is preferred . Pebody et al. found respiratory disorders in 57% of patients with Q-fever，heart disease in 7% and hepatitis in 5%. Marrie lists headache， myalgia and pneumonia as the main symptoms of Q-fever. Connolly et al. found pneumonia in 62.8%， influenza-like illness in 24.6%，heart problems in 9% (endocarditis)， and hepatitis in1.6% of Q-fever patients . We did not have endocarditis in our patients. No deaths were registered.\n\n【19】Conclusion\n\n【20】In the differential diagnosis of unclear febrile conditions， the clinician should consider Q-fever， both acute and chronic form of the disease， especially if the patient has an indicative epidemiological history.\n\n【21】In vitro， tetracyclines， quinolones， rifampicin， co-trimoxazole and macrolides are active against C. burnetii ， but the drug of choice in the treatment of Q-fever is doxycycline in a daily dose of200 mg . Macrolides and co-trimoxazole are recommended for children and pregnant women .", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 11:16:41", "endTime": "2024/09/24 11:16:45", "cost": 4.495}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:35", "update_time": "2024-09-23 19:16:43", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 19:16:39"}

Causes of neutropenia result from four basic mechanisms：Decreased production， ineffective granulopoiesis， the shift of circulating Polymorphonuclear cells(PMNs) to vascular endothelium or tissue pools， or enhanced peripheral destruction . Here， we present a patient with isolated neutropenia from decreased production secondary to Vitamin B12(VitB12) deficiency due to Pernicious Anemia (PA).\n\n【2】Case Study\n\n【3】A 31-year-old Hispanic male with a history oftreated gonorrhea six months prior， presented to the ED with neutropenic fever， malaise， flank pain and was found to have severe neutropenia.On admission， he was hypotensive and febrile. Complete blood count demonstrated leukopenia at 1.02×10/uL with severe neutropenia， absolute neutrophil count of 0.02×10/uL，and elevated myelocyte precursors and blasts. Red blood cells were normocytic， and the blood smear did not demonstrate hyper-segmented neutrophils. A comprehensive metabolic panel demonstrated an elevated protein gap at 5.2. Human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis virus testing were negative， and protein electrophoresis was within normal limits. VitB12 level was <146 pg/mL， methylmalonic acid was126 nmol/L， and Intrinsic Factor (IF) antibody was positive. CT abdomen/pelvis and Chest X-ray showed no acute findings.

A positive IF antibody consistent with PA， and prompt resolution of symptoms as well as normalization of neutrophil count following Vit B12 treatment confirms the diagnosis.

The thymidine kinase 2 gene encode for mitochondrial thymidine kinase， which phosphorylates the pyrimidine nucleosides thymidine and deoxycytidine. The most frequent mutation is p.Lys202del and compounds heterozygous forms have been reported. We report a50-year-old female with recurrent rhabdomyolysis，bilateralptosis， and girdle limb weakness.Muscle biopsy presented frequent， red-raged fibers and dystrophic changes. The most severely affected muscles in magnetic resonance imaging axial T1-weighted sequences were the gluteus maximus， sartorius and tensor fasciae latae muscles. We found a compound heterozygous mutation in the thymidine kinase 2 gene (pathogenic mutation in [c.323C>T p.(Thr108Met)] and novel mutation in[c.268C>T p.(Arg90Cys)]). Deoxynucleoside therapy was offered.\n\n【2】Keywords： Thymidine kinase 2； Myopathy； Rhabdomyolysis； Mitochondria\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Thymidine Kinase 2 (TK2) deficiency myopathy is an autosomal recessive disease， due to mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) depletion . The mtDNA encodes less than 0.1% of the proteins regulating mitochondrial activity， most encoding genes remain unknown . TK2-deficiency myopathy is specifically caused by defects in the replication， maintenance， and repair of mitochondrial DNA by TK2， which is the first and limiting step in the phosphorylation of deoxypyrimidine nucleosides . Several mutations have been described in the TK2 gene that leads to the myopathic form .\n\n【5】TK2-related myopathy clinical picture is heterogeneous， and three forms have been described：infantile (<1 year)，childhood (1 to 12 years)， and late-onset myopathy (>12 years)， the latter being the most unusual (17.4%) and with a relatively better prognosis . In the late-onset group， the mean age of symptoms onset is between 17 and 31 years ， with a similar prevalence among gender， and mean survival is 19.8 to 23.0 years .\n\n【6】Muscle clinical manifestations are characterized by proximal weakness， ptosis， facial diplegia， ophthalmoparesis and dysphagia . The natural progression of the disease evolves to respiratory failure at 10 years of presentation， requiring non-invasive mechanical ventilation . Creatine Kinase (CK) may be normal， although it usually is elevated between 190 U/L to 6500 U/L . Serum lactate is a nonsensible test and is elevated in only 25% of cases .\n\n【7】The genetics profile of TK-2 patients shows that p.Lys202del is the most frequent mutation in the TK2 gene in late-onset patients . In recent years， compound heterozygosis has been described in TK-2 related children’s onset myopathy .\n\n【8】Herein， we report a novel compound heterozygosis mutation late onset TK2- deficiency\n\n【9】Case Presentation\n\n【10】We report a 50-year-old female， with no neuromuscular， cardiac， or diabetic family history. During her childhood， the patient had exercise intolerance without muscle weakness. At 36 years old， after a long flight， the patient presented an acute episode of limb girdle weakness， myalgias and a 25，000 U/L in serum CK. This episode lasted three days， then she returned to being asymptomatic， and CK returned to normal values.\n\n【11】The patient started a progressive girdle limb muscle weakness one year after the first rhabdomyolysis episode and slightly elevated CK(600 U/L to 900 U/L). At 47 and 50 years， she had new episodes of rhabdomyolysis (CK 15.000 and 17.000 U/L) episodes with no precise trigger. She was admitted to our hospital due to the last episode of rhabdomyolysis.\n\n【12】On examination， there was bilateral ptosis， orbicular oculi， and limb-girdle weakness. Venous blood lactate was elevated (18.9 mg/dl) and no other abnormalities were documented in the laboratory exams. No deafness and cardiopathy was found in audiometry and echocardiography， respectively.\n\n【13】Electromyography registereddmyopathiicc changesS.inn both orbicularis oculi and gluteus maximum. Muscle Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the lower limbs showed fatty infiltration predominantly in the gluteus maximus， sartorius and tensors fasciae latae. The other muscles of the pelvis， thighs， and legs had significantly less involvement . Deltoid muscle biopsy unveiled increased muscle fiber internal nuclei， several small rounded muscle fibers and scattered pale. There was a focus of endomysial inflammatory cells and necrotic fibers. Also， frequent cyclooxygenase negative and red raged fibers were found.\n\n【14】Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS)neuromuscularpanel revealed a pathogenic heterozygous mutation of the TK2 gen[c.323C>T p.(Thr108Met)] and [c.268C>T p.(Arg90Cys)] mutation， both associated with mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome. Genetic counselling was done， and a NGS TK-2 gen was performed on her asymptomatic son， showing only one allele with c.268C>Tp.(Arg90Cys) mutation.\n\n【15】The patient responded satisfactorily to intravenous fluids therapy without renal or respiratory involvement. Deoxynucleoside therapy was offered， and the patient was discharged.\n\n【16】Discussion\n\n【17】Recessive mutations in the TK2 gene are responsible for diverse clinical presentations mainly characterized by progressive muscle weakness， dysphagia， and respiratory involvement with a broad spectrum of severity and onset . Recurrent rhabdomyolysis is a rare presentation form oflate-onset TK-2 myopathy，only one clinical case was reported in the literature .\n\n【18】The most frequent mutation is p.Lys202del. Moreover， there are multiple pathogenic mutations described in the literature . Compound mutations have been described ， expanding the spectrum of possible mutated combinations. Generally， adult on-set TK-2 deficiency myopathy is less severe than pediatric forms. This may be due to better maintenance of the muscle mtDNA content， differing from late-onset pediatric forms， which have an increased mtDNA expression . Compound mutations have been increasingly described in different forms of TK2 deficiency myopathiesJ.These combinationss can produce the symptomatic form while homozygous (NM004614.4：c.323C>T)，or compound (NM004614.4：c.268C>T).\n\n【19】Muscle fat infiltration on lower-limb muscle MRI is an important clinical clue to the diagnosis. Gluteus maximus is the most severely affected muscle， and sartorius， a muscle which is usually spared in many genetic muscle diseases (even in late stages)， was also affected. Interestingly， these MRI fits with a pattern previously described in late-onset TK2 patients .\n\n【20】Muscle biopsies in late-onset TK-2 deficiency myopathy showed\n\n| Gene  | Coordinates  | Amino acid change  | SNP identifier  | Zygosity  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| TK2  | NM 004614.4：c.323C>T  | p.(Thr108Met)  | rs137854431  | Heterozygous  |\n| TK2  | NM004614.4：c.268C>T  | p.(Arg90Cys)  | rs281865489  | Heterozygous  |\n\n【22】Abbreviations： TK2： Thymidine Kinase 2；SNP： Single Nucleotide Polymorphism the typical findings of mitochondrial dysfunction described in most mitochondrial myopathies. However， other TK2 deficiency forms also revealed dystrophic features distinct from most other mitochondrial myopathies . Our patients show dystrophic and mitochondrial features on the muscle biopsy.\n\n【23】This case reinforces that rhabdomyolysis should be included in the myopathy phenotypic spectrum of TK-2 deficiency， similar to what was published in a previous case report .\n\n【24】Conclusion\n\n【25】A compound heterozygous mutation in TK2-gene (pathogenic mutation in [c.323C>T p.(Thr108Met)] and novel mutation in [c.268C>Tp.(Arg90Cys)l)are associated to recurrent rhabdomyolysis and late-onset myopathy.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 11:25:11", "endTime": "2024/09/24 11:27:12", "cost": 120.222}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:35", "update_time": "2024-09-23 19:27:10", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 19:25:09"}

Hypergammaglobulinemia is the most common cause of HVS， especially monoclonal conditions involving IgM and rarely by IgG. HVS classically presents with the triad of neurological deficits， visual changes， and mucosal bleeding. Diagnosis is based on history and physical exam findings， in the setting of a potential causative disease. Eye examination is of particular importance， since it can prompt diagnosis and therefore treatment. HVS requires emergent treatment that consists of supportive therapy， plasmapheresis and control of the underlying cause. Plasmapheresis allows symptom relieve and must be initiated promptly.\n\n【2】We report a patient who presented with low back pain， fatigue， weight loss and that was found to have anemia， hypercalcemia， acute kidney injury， hyperproteinemia and multiple osteolytic lesions， that led to the diagnosis of multiple myeloma， later discovered to be of IgG type.

It can be caused either by a deformity of the shape of red blood cells or by any pathological elevation of cellular or acellular components of blood， particularly， immunoglobulins . Hypergammaglobulinemia is the most common cause of HVS， especially the monoclonal condition of Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia (WM)， followed by myelomas， with the IgG type accounting for less than 5% of the cases . We report the case of a patient with HVS in the setting of an IgG Multiple Myeloma， and the clinical challenges associated with the diagnosis and treatment of this medical entity.\n\n【7】Case Presentation\n\n【8】A 64-year-old woman presented to the emergency room with a history of low back pain， fatigue and weightloss with 6 months duration. Her husband also reported episodes of apathy and confused speech lasting 2 weeks. On presentation， her physical examination was unremarkable， except for the presence of palor and gum bleeding . Her laboratory findings revealed a hemoglobin of5.7g/dL (with normal MCV)， hypercalcemia (Ca2+3.34 mmol/L)， a creatinine of 1.21 mg/dL and a total protein value of 153 g/L with hypoalbuminemia of 21 g/L. The diagnosis of multiple myeloma was considered and a skull X-ray and lumbar CT were performed， showing a raindrop skull and numerous osteolytic lesions， respectively， which confirmed our suspicion. Given the clinical picture， the diagnosis of HVS was also considered and assumed after the observation of retinal hemorrhage by an ophthalmologist. Plasmapheresis was immediately initiated and further laboratory， imaging and histologic studies were performed by Hematology， confirming the presence of： a monoclonal protein  of IgG type， multiple osteolytic lesions (on PET-CT) and a diffuse bone marrow infiltration of IgG kappa producing plasmocytes (on myelogram and bone biopsy).\n\n【9】After 3 days of plasmapheresis， the patient showed signs of improvement of the HVS， with resolution of gum bleeding， retinal hemorrhage and neurologic deficits. She also started chemotherapy with Bortezomib， which also prevented further episodes of HVS， but eventually died of sepsis due to febrile neutropenia， after 2 months of treatment.\n\n【10】Discussion\n\n【11】HVS is an oncologic emergency that results from elevated blood viscosity . The term viscosity refers to the internal resistance of a fluid to flow. HVS is the pathological condition in which blood flow is reduced due to an increase in its “thickness”. It can be caused by a deformity of the shape of red blood cells (that occurs in diseases such as sickle cell disease and spherocytosis) or by any pathological elevation of the components of blood， either cellular(red blood cells， white blood cells， platelets) or acellular (serum proteins) . Polycythemia vera， leukemia， and thrombocytosis are classic examples of diseases that can lead to an increase in blood viscosity due to an increase in the cellular components of blood， whereas conditions that result in hypergammaglobulinemia (either monoclonal or polyclonal) are examples of diseases that increase blood viscosity due to an increase in acellular components of blood. Polyclonal causes ofHVS include rheumatoid arthritis， systemic lupus erythematosus， Siogren syndrome compromise， Castleman disease and HIV infection. Monoclonal causes include myeloma， WM and cryoglobulinemia .\n\n【12】Hypergammaglobulinemia is the most common cause of HVS， particularly WM， because of the large star-shaped IgM pentamers that are highly viscous. Myelomas are the second leading cause， with IgA myelomas accounting for 25% of all HVS cases secondary to myelomas. IgG myelomas account for less than 5% of cases .\n\n【13】In terms of pathophysiology， an increase in blood viscosity decreases its flow， compromising the microvascular circulation， resulting inhypoperfusion oftissues. Whenhypergammaglobulinemia is involved， it can also impair platelet function， causing prolonged bleeding time .\n\n【14】Clinically， HVS cassically presents with the triad of mucosal bleeding， visual changes， and neurological deficits. Bleeding， that results from affected platelet aggregation， is the most typical sign， being epistaxis， bleeding gums and gastrointestinal bleeding the most common sites of hemorrhage . Visual changes and retinopathy can include blurred and/or double vision and arise from microvascular complications such as thrombosis or hemorrhage. Eye examination is paramount when HVS is suspected since it can lead to a timely diagnosis and allow a judicious treatment . A reduced blood flow to the central nervous system and deposition of paraproteins within the myelin sheath of peripheral nerves result in neurological deficits， including headache， confusion， neuropathic syndromes， generalized stupor， coma， dizziness， ataxia， hearing impairment， seizures， and stroke syndromes .\n\n【15】Less commonly， a variety of end-organ damages can also be observed as the initial presenting symptom such as heart failure and myocardial infarction .\n\n【16】A high degree of clinical suspicion is required to diagnose HVS. Although laboratory evidence of high serum viscosity establishes the diagnosis， not all laboratories perform this test and， therefore， diagnosis of this medical entity is usually made based upon the clinical picture， when a potential cause is present or highly suspected. Further testing should include a complete blood count， full serum chemistries， coagulation profile， and urinalysis Being an oncologic emergency， HVS requires prompt treatment in order to prevent catastrophic ischemia and multiple organ failure， and to reverse the signs， symptoms and complications associated with this condition . Therapy should be based on the severity of signs and symptoms rather than the calculated degree of viscosity . Initialtreatmentaims to controland ideally resolve the manifestations of HVS， while management of the underlying condition is planned and posteriorly initiated. Therefore， initial treatment of HVS consists of supportive therapy (particularly， hydration， since this condition results in high levels of dehydration) and plasmapheresis . Plasmapheresis can promptly reverse most clinical manifestations of HVS， by decreasing serum viscosity by 20% to 30%. It is usually well tolerated and safe and can be done on a daily basis until clinical resolution of symptoms .\n\n【17】The definitive treatment of HVS involves chemotherapy for the underlying hematologic condition， and is commonly started concomitantly， after observation and discussion of the case with Hematology/Oncology .\n\n【18】Conclusion\n\n【19】This case report describes a very rare condition of HVS associated with IgG Myeloma. It highlights the importance of clinical suspicion to the diagnosis and the need for urgent treatment to control symptoms and prevent complications.\n\n【20】The presence of HVS was highly suspected since our patient presented with gum bleeding and neurologic symptoms (history of confusion)， and was later confirmed after the identification of retinal hemorrhage， that completed the classical triad of this condition， in the appropriate clinical setting of a newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. This effectively shows the importance of eye examination， when HVS is suspected， since it prompted the diagnosis and， therefore， the immediate initiation of plasmapheresis. This report also demonstrates the importance of rapid beginning of plasmapheresis to avoid further complications， particularly multiple organ failure due to ischemia， and to improve signs and symptoms. After multiple sessions of plasmapheresis， our patient’s gum and retinal bleeding and confusion progressively resolved， and no other problems developed， which allowed the beginning of Bortezomib to treat the myeloma. Unfortunately， our patient presented with a severe and advanced form of multiple myeloma that resulted in her death due to complications associated with the disease and its treatment.\n\n【21】Our case is also interesting since there are few reports of HVS associated with IgG myeloma. This report alerts to the fact that this type of myeloma is also a potential underlying cause of HVS and this condition， if suspected， should not be ignored when an IgG related disease is present.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 10:20:37", "endTime": "2024/09/24 10:21:11", "cost": 33.828}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:35", "update_time": "2024-09-23 18:21:09", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 18:20:35"}

Six patients were male and 3 were female with the mean age of 67 years (range，57-83). The diagnosis of infected AAA was determined by clinicalevidence ofinfection (pain， fever andleukocytosis)，aortic image， and positive results from blood cultures， pus culture (from CT guide percutaneous and surgical drainage) and Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). Empirical parenteral antibiotics were administered on admission. At the time ofan operation， all were saccular and 4 of the 9 aneurysms (44.4%) were ruptured (3 contained，1 free ruptured). All patients have undergone EVAR for AAA；5 used Bifurcated stent grafts， 2 Tube stent grafts and 2 Aorto-uniiliac stent grafts with femoro-femoral bypass grafting. The parenteral antibiotics were continued in the postoperative period for 4-6 weeks.\n\n【4】Results： Chronic Renal Disease (CRD) was present in 66.66 %(6/9)， Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) was present in 55.55% (5/9)， Chronic Pulmonary Obstructive Disease (COPD) present in 44.44%(4/9) with diabetes mellitus present in 22.22%(2/9). The most common pathogen was Salmonella species (n =5)， Escherichia coli (n=2) and B. pseudomallei (n =2). Forty-four percent (4/9) of the patients presented with ruptured that needed an emergency surgery. There was no 30 days mortality and significant morbidity. Three patients (patient no. 1，5 and 7) had Infected Stent Grafts (ISG) at10， 26 and 36 months after EVAR， subsequently received CT-guided percutaneous tube drainage and 2 patients (patient no. 1 and 5) needed later stent graft explantation. One patient (patient no.7) refused stent graft explantation and died 1 month later at another hospital from gastrointestinal bleeding and septicemia.\n\n【5】Conclusions： The immediate results of EVAR for Infected AAA are fair with no 30 days mortality and few complications. The midterm results are not satisfied due to high rate of Infected Stent Grafts(ISG) 33.33%(3/9). EVAR is not a definitive treatment of Infected AAA； it could be a temporizing treatment prior to definitive open surgical repair， or a therapeutic alternative in critically ill patients who may not survive open surgery.\n\n【6】Keywords： Infected stent grafts， infected abdominal aortic aneurysm， endovascular treatment\n\n【7】Introduction\n\n【8】Management of infected AAA is a challenging and difficult clinical problem for the vascular surgeon. In the West， Infected AA A is rare； they represent only 1%to2% ofall aortic aneurysms . In an Asian population， infected AAA may raise up to 13.6%. Infected AAA are associated with high morbidity and high mortality 21-44% because they are frequently associated with complicating factors， such as late or delay in diagnosis， rupture， sepsis， and comorbid diseases of the patients. The gold standard for treatment of infected AAA is aggressive surgical resection， debridement of infected periaortic tissues， and reconstruction of the aortic flow by anatomic or extra-anatomic techniques. However； the presence of unfavorable anatomy， a hostile operative field after previous surgery， a contained rupture， or a physiologically debilitated state can elevate operative risk and morbid level . In this report， we describe our experience with the management of 9 patients with infected AAA of the infra renal， all patients underwent endovascular repair.\n\n【9】Table 1： Patient demographics.\n\n| Case  | Age/Gender  | Pathogens  | Diagnosis  | Underling diseases  | Rupture  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1  | 71/M  | Samonella  | Hemoculture/Pus culture  | COPD/CHD/HT  | No  |\n| 2  | 69/M  | B.pseudomallei  | Hemoculture/PCR  | Beta-thalasemia/HT  | No  |\n| 3  | 72/M  | E.coli  | Hemoculture/Pus culture  | Bronchiectasis/CHD  | No  |\n| 4  | 83/F  | Salmonella  | Hemoculture  | CKD/COPD  | No  |\n| 5  | 57/M  | B.pseudomallei  | Hemoculture/PCR  | CKD/CHD/DM  | No  |\n| 6  | 75/F  | Samonella  | Hemoculture  | CKD/CHD/ COPD  | Yes  |\n| 7  | 58/M  | E.coli  | Hemoculture/Pus culture  | CKD/Gouty arthritis  | Yes  |\n| 8  | 81/M  | Samonella  | Hemoculture  | CKD/COPD/ HT  | Yes  |\n| 9  | 61/F  | Samonella  | Hemoculture  | CKD/CHD/DM  | Yes  |\n\n【11】COPD： Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease； CHD： Coronary Heart Disease； HT： Hypertension； CKD： Chronic Kidney Disease； DM： Diabetes Mellitus， PCR：Polymerase Chain Reaction\n\n【12】Case Presentation\n\n【13】During the study period from January 2009 to December l2011， nine patients (six men， three women) with primary infected infrarenal AAA were treated using this EVAR strategy. Patients were a mean age of 67 years (range， 57-83 years). All patients had positive blood cultures showing five Salmonella， two Escherichia coli， and two B. pseudomallei. Broad-spectrum antibiotics were used in all9 patients. Mean C-reactive protein level was 188 mg/L (range， 67mg/L to 486 mg/L) and mean white blood cell (WBC) was 11 (range，8-18 x 10/L). The diagnosis of aortic aneurysm was confirmed by abdominal CT scan and by CT angiography. All of the patients had aortic pseudoaneurysms with a mean size of 5.2 cm (range， 4.3 cm to7.2 cm). There was no 30 days mortality. After 4 weeks of intravenous antibiotics postoperatively， lifelong oral antibiotics were maintained， if possible. All patients were followed in an outpatient clinic at 1， 6， and 12 months and thereafter once a year. The mean follow-up period was 74 months (range， 54-81 months). Three patients had Infected Stent Grafts (ISG) at 10， 26 and 36 months after EVAR， subsequently received CT-guided percutaneous tube drainage and needed later stent graft explantation. Patient no. 1 underwent axillo-bifemoral bypass grafting and stent graft explantation. Patient no. 2 underwent stent graft explantation and In-situ Dacron graft interposition. Patient no. 3 refused stent graft explantation and died 1 month later at another hospital from gastrointestinal bleeding and septicemia. All nine patients consented to publication of this report.\n\n【14】Patient 1\n\n【15】A 71-year-old man with a past history of arterial hypertension， chronic smoking， and myocardial infarction underwent elective EVAR for primary Infected AAA using a Cook Zenith Endograft for the main body TFFB-23-111-2T： legs TFLE-15-78-2T and TFLE-16-62-2T. (Cook Medical， Bloomington， IN). The patient had a history of positive hemocultures with Salmonella. Ten months after， he presented with back pain， asthenia， anorexia， 5 kg weight loss， and fever in the last 7 days. On physical examination， the abdomen was tender in the epigastric area to deep palpation. His blood results showed an elevated white blood cell count to 16 x 10/L with 75%of neutrophils and anemia of 7.5 g/dL. A CT scan revealed the stent graft surrounded by an abscess with air. CT guided percutaneous drainage was performed and yielded 30 cc pus with positive culture of Salmonella. The patient underwent an elective operation. First， a right-sided axillofemoral bypass was performed， employing an 8mm PTFE prosthesis. Through a midline laparotomy the endograft was completely removed . The infrarenal aorta and left common iliac artery were closed using nonabsorbable sutures and covered with omentum. Debridement of the abscess and lavage of the cavity were performed. Salmonella grew in the endograft culture. Hemocultures， microbiological cultures of aortic tissue and the abscess were negative. The patient received empirical intravenous antibiotics during 6 weeks of hospitalization. The postoperative course was uneventful， and the patient was discharged in good clinical conditions. Twenty-four months after surgery， both the clinical syndrome and CT scan showed no evidence of recurrent infection.\n\n【16】Table 2： Treatment Procedures and Results.\n\n| Case  | Procedures  | Complications  | Second Procedure  | Third Procedure  | Follow up (months)/ Status  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1  | Bifurcatec Graft  | Infected Stent Graft 10 months after EVAR  | CT guided percutaneous drainage  | AFB/Explantation 1 month after drainage  | 64/ Alive  |\n| 2  | AUI Graft/AFB  | No  | No  | No  | 81/Alive  |\n| 3  | Bifurcated Graft  | No  | Surgical Drainage  | No  | 79/Alive  |\n| 4  | Tube Graft  | No  | No  | No  | 82/Alive  |\n| 5  | Bifurcated Graft  | Infected Stent Graft 36 months after EVAR  | CT guided percutaneous drainage  | Explantation/In situ Dacron Graft Interposition6 months atter drainage  | 57/ Alive  |\n| 6  | Bifurcatec Graft  | Left Graft Limb Occlusion  | Thromboembolectomy  | No  | 80/Alive  |\n| 7  | Bifurcated Graft  | Infected Stent Graft 26 months after EVAR  | CT guided percutaneous drainage  | No， refused an operation  | Dead 1 month later from sepsis andgastrointestinal bleeding  |\n| 8  | AUI Graft/AFB  | No  | No  | No  | 76/Alive  |\n| 9  | Tube Graft  | No  | No  | No  | 77/Alive  |\n\n【18】AUI： Aortouniiliac； AFB： Axillobifemoral Bypass；EVAR： Endovascular Aneurysmal Repair 1.

(Medtronic， Inc.， Minneapolis，MN). The patient had a history of positive hemocultures with B. pseudomallei. Thirty-six months after， he presented with abdominal pain， anorexia， 3kg weight loss， and fever in the last 10 days. On physical examination， the abdomen was tender in the epigastric area to deep palpation. His blood results showed an elevated white blood cell count to13 x 10°/L with 81% of neutrophils and anemia of 8.5 g/dL. A CT scan revealed the stent graft surrounded by an abscess with air. CT guided percutaneous drainage was performed and yielded 25 cc pus with negative culture for organism. The patient underwent an elective operation. Through a midline laparotomy the endograft was completely removed. Aortic reconstruction with in situ Dacron graft placement with aortobi-iliac graft configuration was performed and covered with omentum. Debridement of the abscess and lavage of the cavity were performed. Hemocultures， microbiological cultures of aortic tissue， endograft and the abscess were negative. The patient received empirical intravenous antibiotics during 6 weeks of hospitalization. The postoperative course was uneventful， and the patient was discharged in good clinical conditions. Twenty-four months after surgery， both the clinical syndrome and CT scan showed no evidence of recurrent infection.\n\n【23】Patient 3\n\n【24】A 58-year-old man with a past history of chronic kidney disease and gouty arthritis underwent emergency EVAR for primary Infected AAA using a Cook Zenith Endograft for the main body TFFB-30-111-2T： legs TFLE-10-88-2T and TFLE-18-56-2T. (Cook Medical， Bloomington， IN). The patient had a history of positive hemocultures with E. coli. Twenty-six months after， he presented with back pain， anorexia and high fever in the last 7 days. On physical examination， the abdomen was tender in the epigastric area to deep palpation. His blood results showed an elevated white blood cell count to 15x10/L with 83% of neutrophils and anemia of 8.1 g/dL. A CT scan revealed the stent graft surrounded by an abscess with air. CT guided percutaneous drainage was performed and yielded 15 cc pus with positive culture of E. coli. The patient refused stent graft explantation and died 1 month later at another hospital from aorto-enteric fistula with gastrointestinal bleeding and E. coli septicemia.\n\n【25】Results\n\n【26】Between January 2009 and December l 2011， 9 consecutive patients (six men， three women) with primary infected infrarenal AAA were treated using this EVAR strategy. Patients were a mean age of 67 years (range， 57-83 years). The demographic data and the pathogens are presented in Tables 1 and 2.\n\n【27】All of the patients presented with abdominal or back pain， and five had recurrent fevers. All patients had positive blood cultures，3 patients had positive tissue cultures (33.33%) and 2(22.22%) had positive Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). Broad-spectrum antibiotics were used in all 9 patients. Mean C-reactive protein level was 188 mg/L (range， 67 mg/L-486 mg/L) and mean White Blood Cell (WBC) was 11 (range， 8x10-18x10/L). Chronic Renal Disease(CRD) was present in 66.66 %(6/9)， Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) was present in 55.55 % (5/9)， Chronic Pulmonary Obstructive Disease (COPD) present in 44.44% (4/9) with diabetes mellitus present in 22.22%(2/9). None of the 9 patients had evidence of immune deficiency. The diagnosis of aortic aneurysm was confirmed by abdominal CT scan and by CT angiography. All of the patients had aortic pseudoaneurysms with a mean size of 5.2 cm (range， 4.3 cm-7.2cm).\n\n【28】Four patients had ruptured aneurysms； 3 had focal aortic pseudoaneurysms with contained ruptures (33.33%) and 1 free rupture with signs of hemodynamic instability (11.11%)， all received urgency EVAR operations. Fever was present in two of the four urgency operative cases. Fever was controlled in most of the patients undergoing elective operations preoperatively. In addition to the typical infectious presentation and the imaging appearance on CT， all patients had positive blood culture reports showing five Salmonella， two Escherichia coli， and two B. pseudomallei. One patient (patient no. 6) developed left graft limb occlusion， which underwent successful thromboembolectomy； one (patient no. 3) underwent a minilaparotomy for open debridement due to persistent fever. There was no 30 days mortality. After 4 weeks of intravenous antibiotics postoperatively，lifelong oral antibiotics were maintained， if possible.\n\n【29】All patients were followed in an outpatient clinic at 1， 6，and 12months and thereafter once a year. The mean follow-up period was 74months (range， 54-81 months). Three patients (patient no. 1， 5 and 7) had Infected Stent Grafts (ISG) at 10， 26 and 36 months after EVAR， subsequently received CT-guided percutaneous tube drainage and needed later stent graft explantation . Patients with Infected Stent Grafts (ISG) Patient no. lunderwent axillo-bifemoral bypass grafting and stent graft explantation. Patient no. 5 underwent stent graft explantation and In-situ Dacron graft interposition. Patient no.7 refused stent graft explantation and died 1 month later at another hospital from gastrointestinal bleeding and septicemia.\n\n【30】Discussion\n\n【31】Primary arterial infections have been classified into 4 types .\n\n【32】2. Microbial arteritis-Bacteremiacaiisesinfection in aan atheromatous plaque leading to destruction of the wall and aneurysm formation； this is most common in the aorta.\n\n【33】3. Infection of a pre-existing aneurysm.\n\n【34】4. Post traumatic false aneurysm， such as following penetrating injury， invasive intra-arterial cannulation or drug abuse.\n\n【35】There are several theories to explain the pathology of aortic infection. Infected microemboli may lodge in the aortic infection. Infected microemboli may lodge in the vasa vasorum causing occlusion and damage to the aortic wall， which leads to degeneration and aneurysm formation. Emboli can also lodge in the irregular intima or the thrombus in the aneurysm during bacteremia. Aortic wall infection can occur due to direct inoculation into the arterial wall. Organisms may colonize the intact vascular wall through the vasa vasorum， where a local suppurative process， which results in Microbial arteritis with aneurysm formation， weakens the arterial wall .\n\n【36】With the introduction of antibiotics during the past 50 years， the incidence of infective endocarditis decreased gradually， and infected aortic aneurysms associated with endocarditis became rare . In nonendocarditis bacteremia or secondary to septic emboli， the most commonly reported site of infected aneurysms was the abdominal aorta due to infection of existing atherosclerotic plaque and aneurysms with a larger vasa vasorum， where infected emboli may dislodge. An interesting feature is that Salmonella spp.， rather than Staphylococcus spp.， seem to cause most infected aortic aneurysms in Eastern countries. It may be plausible that people in Eastern countries eat foods which in general have a greater than average risk of contamination with Salmonella spp.\n\n【37】Salmonella species in particular have a strong predilection to infect damaged aortic intima and abnormal arterial intima， especially arteries harboring atherosclerotic plaque . Characterization of the different bacteria is important， since gram-negative sepsis results in higher rupture rates than infection with gram-positive bacteria . The virulence species， Salmonella typhimurium and Salmonella chloeraesuis， account for over 50% of the reported cases of infected aneurysms . Other common organisms are Streptococcus， Bacteroides， Escherichia coli， and Staphylococcus aureus . In our report， Salmonella sp. was responsible in 55.55%(n =5) of patients . E. coli 22.22% (n =2)， and Burkholderia pseudomallei 22.22%(n =2). Gram-negative organisms were by far the most common isolates from hemocultures. Salmonella sp. responded in66.66% (4/6) of patients and is thought to exhibit a more virulent course because of its ability to invade the normal intima and cause early aneurysm rupture .\n\n【38】The complicated early outcome in patients with infected aortic aanIeurysms probably reflects the combination of an aggressive presentation， high rupture rate， and complex aneurysm location in hosts with chronic comorbid conditions. This study shows 44.44%(4/9) incidence of aneurysm rupture. All of our patients had at least one chronic comorbid condition； Chronic Renal Disease (CRD) was present in 66.66 %(6/9)， Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) was present in 55.55 %(5/9)， Chronic Pulmonary Obstructive Disease(COPD) present in 44.44%(4/9) with diabetes mellitus present in22.22%(2/9).Despite the fact that infected aneurysms occur in all age groups， the elderly comprised the largest group in our series. All of the 9 patients； 6 were men and 3 were women of mean age of 67 years(range， 57-83 years).\n\n【39】In our series， all patients were symptomatic， with symptoms having lasted for more than 7 days， and even up to 2 months. Classic manifestations include abdominal pain， fever， and a pulsatile abdominal mass. The presence ofleukocytosis-elevated sedimentation rate and positive blood cultures strengthen the surgeon's suspicion of the diagnosis of infected aneurysm. Symptoms of sepsis may be discrete and may easily go unrecognized，especially in the early stages. Broad-spectrum antibiotics should be started preoperatively after taking blood cultures. Positive blood cultures are helpful to signal the need for the specific antibiotic therapy. CT scan is also in establishing the diagnosis of infected aortic aneurysm .\n\n【40】Although a period of antimicrobial therapy before EVAR is advised， immediate EVAR is indicated， irrespective of bacteriologic status， when there are signs of rupture. Emergency surgery was performed in 44.44%(n =4) of patients due to rupture. Three patients had focal aortic pseudo aneurysms with contained ruptures (75%) and 1 free ruptures (25%)； CT scan confirmed all these. Three of the4 (75%) ruptured infected abdominal aortic aneurysms were infected by Salmonella species .\n\n【41】The surgical management ofinfected abdominalaortic aneurysms includes extensively resect the infected aorta， aggressively debride the periaortic tissues，andreconstruct the aortic flow usingextra-anatomic or anatomic bypass prosthetic grafts . Adequate drainage， administration of organism-specific parenteral antibiotics， extensive debridement and excision of infected aortic tissue are the strategies used to resolve infection . The virulence of the organism and severity ofthe arterial infection are more important determinants than any single operative procedure or method of arterial reconstruction. The associated mortality was still high， ranging from 25% to 40%. Death is usually related to persistent sepsis with multi-organ failure. The magnitude and long duration of the operation， especially in shocked and unstable patients， are major contributing factors to the perioperative mortality . Late graft infections occurred in 7% to 10% of the cases ， and extra-anatomic bypass had worse outcome than in situ reconstructions .\n\n【42】Endovascular treatment with stent-grafts has been introduced， as an alternative， less invasive， especially in the septic patient with considerable co-morbidity， will reduce the risk of cardiopulmonary， neurological and renal complications . This could be a temporizing treatment prior to definitive open surgical repair， or a therapeutic alternative in critically i patients who may not survive open surgery .The potential benefits of endovascular repair include small incisions， minimal aortic cross-clamping time with reduction in end-organ ischemia，avoidance of general anesthesia， full heparinsation， single lung ventilation and cardiopulmonary bypass. Endovascular repair should reduce the length of stay in intensive care units， high dependency units and in hospital，with an earlier return to activities of daily living and consequent improvement in the quality of life . An additional drainage procedure is usually required either via CT guided drainage or by open surgical approach .On our previous experience on open surgical management of infected AAA， we had a disease-specific mortality was 31.25% (5/16). 30-day mortality rate of the ruptured cases is high 25%(4/16) . We started EVAR for treatment of infected AAA since 2009 and hope that this alternative and less invasive procedure will decrease the patient's morbidity and mortality rates. We would go over on EVAR for treatment of infected AAA whenever the stents are available.\n\n【43】Immediate results are fair impressive； one patient (patient no. 6) developed left graft limb occlusion， which underwent successful thromboembolectomy； one (patient no. 3) underwent a minilaparotomy for open debridement due to persistent fever. There was no in-hospital death both in elective and emergency ruptured cases .\n\n【44】Antibiotic administration according to postoperative sensitivity testing is crucial： the duration of antibiotic therapy is not well established， but most authors recommend a minimum of 6 weeks intravenously and orally for another 6 weeks . Longer durations and even life-long antibiotic therapy have been recommended . Some authors believe that patients with a prosthetic reconstruction should continue on low-dose antibiotics for life. However， the advantage of a more prolonged therapy has not been confirmed.\n\n【45】The midterm results are not satisfied due to high rate of infected stent grafts 33.33%(3/9). Three patients (patient no. 1， 5 and 7) had Infected Stent Grafts (ISG) at 10， 26 and 36 months after EVAR， which are disease specific complications， subsequently received CT-guided percutaneous tube drainage and needed later stent graft explantation due to unresponsive conservative management. Patient no. 1 underwent axillo-bifemoral bypass grafting and stent graft explantation. Patient no. 5 underwent stent graft explantation and In-situ Dacron graft interposition. Patient no. 7 refused stent graft explantation and died 1 month later at another hospital from aorto-enteric fistula with gastrointestinal bleeding and E. coli septicemia.\n\n【46】Placing a foreign body in an infected field seems to be against the surgical infection principles. There is always concern about persistent infection after placing a stent graft in an infected field. Persistent infection after EVAR treatment of infected aortic aneurysms is usually associated with a poor prognosis. The endoprostheses become infected so compounding the problem over a greater length ofaorta， and they may cause rupture of a fragile vessel because of the necessary oversizing used to hold the device in place. Additionally， if the fever persists after the EVAR， This would be an indication to keep the patient on long-term broad-spectrum antibiotics until a definite surgical treatment is considered. Several reports have described a high incidence of recurrent infection and late mortality after endovascular repair .\n\n【47】Conservative management of infected stent grafts consists of antimicrobial therapy and percutaneous drainage (CT guided)； is accepted in high-risk patients with multiple comorbidities and patients with minor， low-grade infections . Mortality in these patients has been up to 40% . In the series of Lyons et al.  reported that their patients who did not have stent grafts explantation died of aortic disease progression， contrasted with a mortality rate of 30% when the graft was explanted. In suitable patients： when an infected graft is not manageable by a conservative approach， surgical treatment should be considered.\n\n【48】The virulence of the organism and severity of the arterial infection are more important determinants than any single operative procedure or method of arterial reconstruction . When there is gross contamination from infected stent grafts， excision and extra-anatomical bypass is the treatment of choice. The argument in favor of extra-anatomic bypass is the theoretic advantage of reducing the risk of graft infection， because revascularization is generally performed in a location remote from the site of infection.\n\n【49】When contamination is less severe， the aorta may be replaced in situ. The choice of the ideal conduit is still controversial. Rifampin soaked grafts may prevent graft infection by reducing early graft seeding . Antibiotic-coated Dacron grafts presented an attractive adjunct. Prolonged anti-staphylococcal activity ofrifampin-bonded， gelatin impregnated Dacron grafts has been demonstrated after implantation in the arterial circulation， in experimental and human studies. Infection rates， as well as mortality and morbidity rates， are much lower for rifampin-treated grafts than for plain in situ graft replacement . Encouraging results have also been reported with the use of cryopreserved human allograft and silver coated polyester grafts . Other safe alternatives include autogenous superficial femoral vein grafts and cryopreserved arterial allografts.\n\n【50】The duration of antimicrobial treatment in patients after removal of an infected aortic stent graft is controversial. No current guidelines exist on this issue and some authors suggest prolonging antibiotic administration until the C-reactive protein level has returned to baseline .\n\n【51】The immediate results of EVAR for Infected AAA are fair with no 30 days mortality and few complications. The midterm results are not satisfied due to high rate of infected stent grafts 33.33%(3/9). Endovascular treatment of Infected AAA is feasible and should be a durable treatment option； late infection-related complications do occur and are often lethal. EVAR could be considered a palliative treatment option， or a bridge to later elective radical open surgery， once the patient has recovered from the initial emergency.\n\n【52】Conclusions\n\n【53】Endovascular treatment of primary Infected AAA is feasible and for most patients a durable treatment option. EVAR is not a definitive treatment of Infected AAA； it could be a temporizing treatment prior to definitive open surgical repair， or a therapeutic alternative in critically ill patients who may not survive open surgery. T SU Late infections-related complications do occur； often lethal， need long-term antibiotic treatment and follow-up. In those cases， EVAR could be considered a palliative option or a bridge to later elective open repair.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 10:22:23", "endTime": "2024/09/24 10:22:44", "cost": 21.418}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:35", "update_time": "2024-09-23 18:22:44", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 18:22:22"}

She started having headache blurring of vision & multiple episodes of vomiting for one month .\n\n【12】MRI showed right thalamic mass with extensive Perilesional edema more in favor of radiation necrosis. She was referred for stereotactic biopsy in Christian Medical College， Vellore.\n\n【13】She underwent multiple stereotactic biopsies over there which were negative for malignancy， possible radiation necrosis. MRI/MRS & Perfusion scan ware repeated here . The scan on January2017 showed well defined lesion in the right parietal region (30 mm x 32 mm×25 mm) with significant perilesional edema extending to occipital region.

Watershed infarct areas are rarely observed in CVST and in cases where they are observed， they usually occur as a result of the involvement of deep venous structures. The definitive diagnosis of CVST is established by magnetic resonance venography. In addition， this article also includes a review of the cases with established CVST and watershed infarct areas reported in the literature. It should be kept in mind that in patients with watershed infarct areas and severe headache， the etiology may include cerebral venous thrombosis.\n\n【2】Keywords： Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis； Watershed infarction； Prognosis； Magnetic resonance venography\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Cerebral Venous Sinus Thrombosis (CVST) rarely occurs as compared to arterial stroke， accounting for 0.5% of all strokes . Its diagnosis can sometimes be delayed due to a wide spectrum of symptoms associated with it ranging from headache to coma. Nevertheless， the use of imaging methods such as Magnetic Resonance Venography (MRV) in the recent period facilitated the establishment of a final CVST diagnosis. CVST often affects the female gender， and hence gynecological causes such as pregnancy， postpartum period and oral contraceptive use are at the forefront in its etiology. There are also cases in whom CVST was reported recently after having a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine . A significant increase in the incidence of CVST was observed following the emergence of COVID-19 breakout.\n\n【5】In CVST， venous infarct， hemorrhagic venous infarct and even though rarely watershed infarct areas can be observed in radiological imaging. There are only a few case reports of venous watershed infarction available in the literature . In view of the foregoing， it is aimed with in this study to investigate the clinical course，prognosis and treatment of two patients with CVST accompanied by venous watershed infarction， who were being followed up in the institution， where this study was conducted.\n\n【6】Case Series\n\n【7】A 40-year-old male patient with complaints of severe headache， nausea， vomiting， and altered consciousness， to the emergency department in June 2021. It was learned that the patient had been vaccinated with a viral vector vaccine against SARS-CoV-22 days ago， and that the headache， which started one day after the vaccination， became increasingly severe. His neurological examination revealed that he was conscious， had distorted time orientation， and was partially cooperative. His laboratory tests revealed White Blood Cell (WBC) count as 20.38×10/uL (normal range： 3.9×107uL to 10.8×10/uL)，neutrophil count as 11.64×10/uL (normal range： 1.91×10/uL to 7.61×107uL)， lymphocyte count as 9% of the total WBCs (normal range： 18% to 47%)； C-Reactive Protein(CRP) as 32.22 mg/L (normal range： 1 mg/L to 5 mg/L)， platelet count as 209 x10/pL (normal range： 145×10/uL to 345×10/uL)， fibrinogen as 530 mg/dL (normal range： 245 mg/dL to 400 mg/dL)， vitamin B12 as 64 pg/mL (normal range： 126 pg/mL to 505 pg/mL)， and homocysteine as 26.9umol/L (normal range： 5 umol/L to 15 umol/L). Cerebral venous thrombosis and watershed infarct areas were observed in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the patient . Computerized cerebral angiography of the patient who had watershed infarct areas did not reveal arterial ischemia.\n\n【8】Table 1： Clinical and radiolagical features of patients with venous watershed infarction.\n\n|  | Patient 1  | Patient 2  | Tan  | Washidaat al.  | Ravinder- JeetSiinghat al.  | Simsek at al.  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Age (year)  | 40  | 55  | 15  | 67  | 30  | 39  |\n| Sex  | Male  | Female  | unspecified  | Male  | Female  | Male  |\n| Etiologicalcause  | SARS-CoV-2 vaccination  | Hyperfibrinagenemia  | Neurosurgical intervention  | Dehidratasyon  | unspecified  | Infection (COVID-19)andgenetics  |\n| Symptams andsigns  | Headache， nausea-vomiting， altered consciousness  | Headache， altered consciousness  | Seizures， left-sided spastichemiplegia， andvisual field deficits  | Headache， vomiting， alteredconsciousness  | Headache， vomiting， left hemiparesis，altered consciousness  | Headache  |\n| Fibrinagen (245-400 mg/dL)  | 530  | 472  | unspecified  | N  | unspecified  | N  |\n| Protein C  | N  | N  | unspecified  | N  | unspecified  | N  |\n| Protein S  | N  | N  | unspecified  | N  | unspecified  | N  |\n| ATIII  | N  | N  | unspecified  | N  | unspecified  | N  |\n| Genetic testing  | HomazygousMTHFR andheterazygous FVH1299R gene mutations  | Heterazygous FVH1299R genemutations  | unspecified  | N  | unspecified  | Heterozygous MTHFRand FVL gene mutations  |\n| MRI findings  | Watersheed infarctareas on diffusion-weighted images  | Watersheed infarctareas on diffusion-weighted images，Swelling of the leftthalamus in FLAIRsequence  | Diffusion-weighted imaging showed foci ofrestricted diffusion inthe right cerebral deepwhite matter  | Watersheed infarctareas on diffusion- weighted images，symmetrical swellingof the bilateralthalamus and basalgagnions in FLAIRsequence  | Thalamic and basalganglia signal changesand bilateral centrumsemiovalpunctateinfarcts  | Venous infarct area inthe right thalamus anddiffusion-weighted imagesrevealed watershedinfarct areas  |\n| MRV/CTV findings  | Right transverse sinus， straight sinus，superiorsagittal sinus thrombosis  | Thrombus in all superficial and deepcerebral veins  | Right internal cerebralvein thrombosis.  | Straight sinusand galen veinthrombosis  | Straight sinusthrombosis  | Bilateral transverse-straight-superiorsagittalsinus， right internalcerebral vein， andthrombus in the rightthalamostriatvein  |\n| Treatment  | Warfarin sodium  | Warfarinsodium  | unspecified  | Heparin  | Unfractionated Heparin  | Warfarin sodium  |\n| Conclusion  | Discharged  | Discharged  | Discharged  | Discharged  | Discharged  | Discharged  |\n\n【10】ATIII： Anti-Thrambin 3； FLAIR： Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery Imaging， CTV： Computed Tomography Venogram； LMWH： Low Molecular Weight Heparin； MTHFR： Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase， FVL： Factor V Leiden Gene Mutations， N： Normal； MRI： Magnetic Resonance Imaging， MRV： Magnetic Resonance Venagraphy His vasculitis markers were normal.

Partial recanalization was observed in the follow-up MRV taken two months later.\n\n【11】2021. The patient， who was learned to have a headache for the last few days， had been brought to the emergency room due to a change in her consciousness in the morning. During her neurological examination， her eyes were spontaneously open， she did not answer the questions addressed to her， and she made meaningless sounds and appeared apathetic. Her all four extremities were mobile， and her right upper extremity was lagging behind as compared to her left upper extremity. There was no neck stiffness， and the response of the plantar reflex was a bilateral extensor response. Cerebral venous thrombosis and watershed infarct areas were observed in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the patient . The results of her computed cerebral angiography were normal. Her laboratory tests revealed WBC count as 13.47 × 10/uL (normal range： 3.9x10/pL to 10.8×10/pL)， platelet count as 209 ×10/pL (normal range： 145 × 10/pL to 345×10/pL)， C-Reactive Protein (CRP) as17.1 mg/L (normal range： 1 mg/L to 5 mg/L)， and fibrinogen as 472mg/dL (normal range： 245 mg/dL to 400 mg/dL). She did not have any focal and systemic infection foci. Her vasculitis markers were normal. Her genetic analysis revealed heterozygous factor V H1299R gene mutation. Her malignancy scan was clear. The etiologic cause was thought to be hyperfibrinogenemia， taking into consideration the persistent high fibrinogen levels found in repeated examinations. The patient was discharged with warfarin sodium. Her MRV taken one week later revealed partial recanalization， and her clinic had significantly improved.\n\n【12】Discussion\n\n【13】There is no effective drug therapy in the fight against COVID-19， and the most effective way to be protected from COVID-19 is to try to prevent the spread of the COVID-19 through vaccination. There are two types of vaccines， viral vector vaccines and messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines. CVST is one of the serious side effects seen in association with the administration of mRNA vaccines， albeit rare. Vaccine-induced thrombocytopenic thrombosis is blamed for this serious side effect . However， in addition to cases with CVST accompanied by thrombocytopenia， cases who developed thromboembolic events without thrombocytopenia have also been reported duringthe post-vaccination period. In parallel， in the study of Perry et al. ， in which cases that developed CVST after vaccination against COVID-19 were examined， vaccine-induced immune thrombocytopenia was observed in 70 of the 95 CVST patients， while the remaining 20 patients did not develop thrombocytopenia . In comparison， the first case presented in this study developed CVST on the second day after vaccination. This is different than the results reported in the literature in that the cases presented in the literature were reported to have developed thrombosis within 4 to 19 days after vaccination. The platelet count of the patient was normal， however he was found to have hyperhomocysteinemia， vitamin B12 deficiency and homozygous MTHFR (Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase) mutation. Accordingly， the presence of additional risk factors is thought to have predisposed the patient to thrombosis， which caused the patient to develop thrombosis as early as on the second day after vaccination. This result raises the question whether genetic examination， homocysteine， vitamin B12 level and other coagulation factors should be checked before vaccination， even if the patients do not have a history of thromboembolic events. On the other hand， the etiology of the second case presented in this study included hyperfibrinogenemia as well as obesity as a predisposing factor. Brain MRI revealed venous watershed infarct areas in both of the cases investigated in this study， and a dramatic improvement was observed in their clinics after treatment. There was extensive thrombus in both deep and superficial veins in the second case presented in this study， yet the fact that recanalization was observed in the follow-up MRV taken on the 7h day suggests that early diagnosis and treatment were effective on the prognosis.\n\n【14】In CVST， venous pressure increases secondary to obstruction， whereas capillary perfusion decreases. Initially the cerebral collateral network tolerates this pressure， yet venous stasis， vasogenic edema， and hemorrhagic infarctions occur in the later period as the capacity of the collateral network is exceeded. Decreased cerebral perfusion causes cytotoxic edema and increased intracranial pressure. There are studies in which it was demonstrated on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) that the resulting increase in intracranial pressure causes ischemia . The reported etiological causes of patients with watershed infarcts secondary to CVST in the literature vary. The course of the disease was not mortal in any of these patients， and clinical improvement was observed in all of them after treatment. Deep venous thrombosis was common to all these patients. Presence of deep venous thrombosis indicates a poor prognosis as venous watershed infarcts are seen in relation thereto， but there were no patients with a mortal course among the reported cases.\n\n【15】In conclusion， early diagnosis seems to be a very effective parameter in prognosis. Additionally， the presence of genetic mutations in the two cases presented in this study in association with COVID-19 infection and COVID-19 vaccination suggests that genetic tests should be carried out in these patients.\n\n【16】Watershed infarct areas are mostly observed in hypotensive cerebral infarction. Differential diagnosis is important since different treatments are indicated in arterial and venous watershed infarcts. It should be kept in mind that CVST may be present in patients with watershed infarct areas and clinically prominent headache， and that watershed infarcts may be of venous origin， albeit rarely.\n\n【17】Highlights\n\n【18】Watershed infarcts are not always arterial.\n\n【19】Cerebral venous thrombosis should be excluded in the presence of headache and watershed infarct.\n\n【20】Heparin may worsen the clinic in thrombosis induced by COVID-19 infection.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 11:22:01", "endTime": "2024/09/24 11:22:31", "cost": 29.844}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:35", "update_time": "2024-09-23 19:22:29", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 19:21:59"}

This study aimed to examine the previous cesarean sections influence on pregnancy complications among women with singleton delivery in their second pregnancies.\n\n【2】Method： A total of 2018 eligible women with second pregnancies who had a singleton delivery from January 2015 to October 2017 were studied retrospectively. Data on the previous delivery mode for the first pregnancy， maternal characteristics and pregnancy complications for the second pregnancy were obtained from the electronic medical records. Chi-square test was used to describe and obtain the significant maternal characteristics according to the previous mode of delivery. The pregnancy complications associated with previous cesarean section was analyzed with binary logistic regression.\n\n【3】Results： Of 2018 eligible women with singleton delivery in their second pregnancy， 942 (46.7%)had a previous cesarean section (study group) while 1076 (53.3%) also had a previous vaginal delivery LISC(reference group). Previous cesarean section had an increase risk on the following pregnancy complications； Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) (Adjusted Odds Ratio [aOR]： 1.438；95% CI，1.894)， fetal anomaly (aOR： 14.258； 95% CI， 4.248)， and placenta previa (aOR： 2.890；95% CI，1.148).\n\n【4】Conclusion： This study demonstrates that the previous cesarean section is associated with increased risk of GDM， fetal anomaly and placenta previa on second singleton pregnancy after the implementation of the universal two-child policy in China.\n\n【5】Keywords： Cesarean section； China； Pregnancy complications； Second pregnancy； Two-child policy\n\n【6】Introduction\n\n【7】Cesarean Section (CS) is the most common obstetrical operation known worldwide. Over the past decades， the rate of CS has increased both in developing and developed countries. The WHO issued a disclosure in 1985， stating the CS regional rates must not exceed 10% to 15%. Nonetheless， China is one of the countries with the prevalence of CS averagely of 46.2% over the past decades that are higher than the recommended threshold. Coincidentally， this high prevalence of CS began during the implementation period of the one-child policy introduced in 1979 to reduce the then growing population in China. CS is considered safe under medical indications， but most women who had CS under the one-child policy opted for it without any medical indications . In 2015， the one-child policy was replaced with the universal two-child policy. This new policy has encouraged most couples to consider having a second child. As a result， it suddenly increased the number of pregnancies with an obstetrical history of previous CS . Hence， previous CS has become a new medical risk for clinicians in China.\n\n【8】A study on previous CS and its association with adverse pregnancy outcomes has been studied extensively in other countries. However，literature on such studies in China is sparse， mainly due to the one-child policy， which could not all ow for subsequent pregnancies that could be used to access previous CS's influence on pregnancy complications. However， these previous studies' findings have been reported to be associated with some pregnancy complications， but the results were inconsistent. Some studies have indicated previous CS to be associated with pregnancy complications such as pregnancy-induced hypertension disorders ， placenta previa ， placenta abruption， placenta accreta/adhesions . In contrast， other studies showed that previous CS had no significant effect on placenta disorders such as placenta previa ， placenta abruption and placenta accrete .\n\n【9】Furthermore， other pregnancy complications are not well known to be associated with previous CS due to the limited number ofstudies on these outcomes. Few studies have reported an increased risk for Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM)  and polyhydramnios  in pregnancy after CS when compared with vaginal delivery. Also， a previous study indicated high incidence of pregnant women with a previous CS diagnosed with fetal anomaly when compared with women with previous vaginal delivery . Studies conducted to support the hypothesis of previous CS association with GDM， polyhydramnios， and fetal anomaly remains sparse to the best of our knowledge. Given the limited evidence on the influence of previous CS on these pregnancy complications such as GDM， polyhydramnios and fetal anomaly and the inconsistencies in the association between previous CS and the placenta disorders shown in other studies， there is a need for research attention on these pregnancy complications to update clinicians and women on the risk associated with CS.\n\n【10】The implementation of the universal two-child policy provides an ideal situation to study previous CS's influence on pregnancy complications. Therefore， this study examines previous CS's influence on pregnancy complications such as Gestational Diabetes Mellitus， polyhydramnios， fetal anomaly， Pregnancy Induced Hypertension(PIH)， placenta disorders (placenta previa， placenta abruptions and placenta accreta among women with singleton delivery in the second pregnancies.\n\n【11】Methods\n\n【12】Subject's section\n\n【13】This study used clinical data of 2018 women with singleton delivery in the second pregnancies delivered between January 2015and October 2017 at the Third Xiangya Hospital of Central South University. These women were identified from the electronic medical records and enrolled in the study. The 2018 women were selected based on the following inclusion criteria： (i) women who had live delivery at ≥ 24 weeks gestation； (ii) had singleton delivery for both the first and this second pregnancy. Women were excluded if they do not meet the criteria above or； (i) women whose pregnancy were as a result of Artificial Reproductive Technology (ART)； (ii) women whose records had missing information on the previous mode of delivery， pregnancy complications in the second pregnancy as well as maternal characteristics of second pregnancies.\n\n【14】Clinical data on theeprevious delivery mode， maternal characteristics and the pregnancy complications in the second pregnancy were retrieved from the electronic medical records and further validated and maintained by our research team. Women with a singleton pregnancy with previous CS in the first pregnancy were categorized as the study group. In contrast， those with spontaneous vaginal delivery for the first pregnancy were categorized as the reference group.\n\n【15】We obtained ethical approval for this study from the Xiangya School of Nursing and the Institutional Review Board from the Third Xiangya Hospital of Central South University， Hunan， China.\n\n【16】Definitions of variables\n\n【17】Maternal characteristics included demographic and obstetric information such as maternal age at second pregnancy， Body Mass Index (BMI)， which was obtained from the weight and height of the pregnant woman at the first prenatal booking and was calculated as (weight in kg)/(height in m)， the number of prenatal care visits2 4 (standard prenatal care according to doctor’s suggestion)， Interpregnancy Interval (IPI) was also defined as the interval of years between the first delivery and the second pregnancy， history of Terminations of Pregnancy (TOP) before this second pregnancy and preexisting medical conditions which were all diagnosed by an obstetrician (pre-pregnancy diabetes， chronic hypertension， angiocardiography， anemia， systemic lupus erythema， asthma， fibroid， ovarian and fallopian cyst， syphilis， hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism).The continuous yvariables of the maternal characteristics were further sub-grouped into categories.\n\n【18】The pregnancy complications for this study are defined as disorders or diseases that occur during the second pregnancy period. Hence the pregnancy complications that obstetricians diagnosed were selected for this study and included Gestational Diabetes Mellitus{(GDM)， Polyhydramnios，Fetalanomaly， Pregnancy Induced Hypertension (PIH)， Placenta Previa， Placenta abruption， Placenta accreta. Gestational Diabetes Mellitus GDM was diagnosed using a 2-h， 75 g oral glucose tolerance test . Polyhydramnios was defined as an abnormally sizeable amniotic fluid of 24 cm or greater during pregnancy and diagnosed through ultrasound examination. The fetal anomaly was defined as a delivery defect or congenital malformation during the intrauterine life and can be identified prenatally or at delivery (WHO). Pregnancy Induced Hypertension(PIH) was defined as diastolic blood pressure >90 mmHg on two occasions， four hours apart or a single reading of >110 mmHg from20 weeks gestation . Placenta previa is an implantation of the placenta over or near the internal opening of the cervix. Placental abruption is the premature separation of a usually implanted placenta from the uterus， and placenta accrete refer to the clinically apparent morbidly adherent placenta .\n\n【19】The study's covariates included significant maternal characteristics and the possible pregnancy complications (in the second pregnancy) known in the published literature as risk factors of the pregnancy complications in this study (potential confounders). For significant maternal characteristics that were used as covariates， we excluded pre-pregnancy diabetes and chronic hypertension when analyzing for GDM and PIH， respectively. We considered potential risk factors for the following： GDM (PIH)， polyhydramnios (fetal anomaly， GDM ) and PIH (placenta disorders ， GDM ).\n\n【20】Statistical analyses\n\n【21】The maternal characteristics were described and summarized by frequencies and percentages. Chi-square and Fisher's exact test was used to compare the groups. Probability values of <0.05were considered statistically significant. We used univariate and multivariate logistic regression to ascertain the influence of previous CS on pregnancy complications. The influence of the covariates was analyzed. First， maternal age， Body Mass Index (BMI) at booking， history of pregnancy termination， and significant preexisting medical condition (diabetes， chronic hypertension， asthma， fibroid， ovarian and fallopian cyst) were added as covariates. For the covariates of GDM and PIH， we excluded pre-pregnancy diabetes and chronic hypertension， respectively. Then potential risk factors for GDM(placenta disorders， PIH)， polyhydramnios (fetal anomaly， GDM) and PIH (placenta disorders， GDM) were further analyzed. We presented the logistic regression results as crude and adjusted Odds Ratios (ORs) with 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs). The data was analyzed using SPSS 25.0 (IBM Corp.，Armonk，NY，USA).\n\n【22】Maternal characteristics\n\n【23】Amongthe 2018 eligible women with singleton second pregnancy，942(46.7%) had experienced one previous CS， while the remaining1076 (53.3%)had one previous vaginal delivery.\n\n【24】Women with previous CS were older and had advanced age (≥35years) than women withprevious vaginal delivery. Those with previous CS had a higher BMI>25.0kg/m'and a longer IPI (5years and above) than those with previous vaginal delivery. Both women with previous CS and previous vaginal delivery had the recommended number of prenatal visits 2 4 visits. The history of pregnancy termination was slightly higher among those with previous CS than those with previous vaginal delivery. Furthermore， women with previous CS had a higher rate of preexisting medical diseases such as diabetes， hypertension， asthma， fibroid， cyst of the ovary and fallopian tube than those with previous vaginal delivery .\n\n【25】Analysis of previous CS on pregnancy complications\n\n【26】Regarding the pregnancy complications， women with previous CS had a significantly higher rate of Gestational Diabetes Mellitus， fetal anomaly and placenta previa when compared with those with previous vaginal delivery. When these pregnancy complications were analyzed using the univariate binary logistic regression (odd crude ratio)， they were all associated with previous CS .\n\n【27】After the multivariate logistic regression (adjustment for the covariates， which include significant maternal characteristics and potential risk factors)， there was an association between previous CS with GDM， fetal anomaly and placenta previa. Comparing the adjusted odds ratio of the pregnancy complications among women with previous CS and previous vaginal delivery (reference group)， women with previous CS were 1.44 times more likely to have GDM(95%CI， 1.89) and 14.26 times more likely to have fetal anomaly(95%CI， 4.25). Furthermore， women with previous CS were2.89 times more likely tohave placenta previa (95% CI，1.15)than those with previous vaginal delivery. In contrast， polyhydramnios， pregnancy-induced hypertension， placenta abruption and placenta accreta were the pregnancy complications that were not associated with previous CS compared with previous vaginal delivery in our study .\n\n【28】Discussion\n\n【29】This study examined previous CS’s influence on pregnancy complications among women having their second pregnancy under the Chinese two-child policy's implementation. The main findings of this study indicated that GDM， fetal anomaly and placenta previa are the pregnancy complications associated with previous CS independent of maternal age， BMI at admission， IPI， history of termination of pregnancy， significant preexisting medical conditions\n\n【30】Table 1： Maternal characteristics of women with second pregnancies by the first previous mode of delivery in Hunan， China.\n\n| Previous Mode of delivery， n(%)  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Maternal characteristics  | Previous vaginaldelivery n= 1076  | Previous CSn=942  | P value  |\n| Age， (years)  |  |  |  |\n| <35  | 716(66.5)  | 447(47.5)  | <0.001  |\n| 235  | 360(33.5)  | 495(52.5)  | <0.001  |\n| BMI on admission (kg/m?)  |  |  |  |\n| <18.5  | 1(0.1)  | 1(0.11)  | <0.001  |\n| 18.9  | 359(33.4)  | 198(21.0)  | <0.001  |\n| 25.9  | 606(56.3)  | 558(59.2)  | <0.001  |\n| 230  | 110(10.2)  | 185(19.6)  | <0.001  |\n| IPl (years)  |  |  |  |\n| >2  | 365(33.9)  | 149(15.8)  | <0.001  |\n| 2-4  | 262(24.3)  | 217(23.0)  | <0.001  |\n| 25  | 449(41.7)  | 578(61.1)  | <0.001  |\n| Prenatal care visit ≥ 4  | 938(87.2)  | 796(84.5)  | 0.085  |\n| History of termination of pregnancy  | 625(58.1)  | 625(66.4)  | <.001  |\n| Preexisting medical conditions  |  |  |  |\n| Pre-gestational Diabetes  | 21(2.0)  | 44(4.7)  | 0.001  |\n| Chronic Hypertension  | 8(0.7)  | 19(2.0)  | 0.013  |\n| Angiocardioparthy  | 68(6.3)  | 54(5.7)  | 0.581  |\n| Anaemia  | 52(4.8)  | 43(4.6)  | 0.777  |\n| Systemic lupus erythema  | 4(0.4)  | 9(1.0)  | 0.941  |\n| Asthma  | 13(1.2)  | 23(2.4)  | 0.037  |\n| Fibroid  | 22(2.0)  | 35(3.7)  | 0.024  |\n| Fallopian and ovarian cyst  | 11(1.0)  | 39(4.1)  | <0.001  |\n| Syphilis  | 3(0.3)  | 10(1.1)  | 0.47  |\n| Hypothyroidism  | 21(2.0)  | 15(1.6)  | 0.543  |\n| Hyperthyroidism  | 16(1.5)  | 12(1.3)  | 0.683  |\n\n【32】BMI： Body Mass Index； IPI： Interpregnancy Interval and potential risk factors (pregnancy complications in the second pregnancy that are confounders) for the pregnancy complications in this study.\n\n【33】This paper has shown that previous CS is associated with increased risk of GDM， fetal anomaly and placenta previa but not polyhydramnios， PIH， placenta abruption， and placenta accreta. To our knowledge， this is the first study to support the hypothesis of previous CS's influence with GDM and also the first recent study to show an association between previous CS and fetal anomaly.\n\n【34】Pregnant women with previous CS were 1.44 times at high risk of GDM. The results of Hu’s study also presented this relationship ， although there is an unknown exact biological relationship between previous CS and GDM. Nonetheless， there has been speculation that inefficient placenta function due to abnormal trophoblastic invasion that may occur due to the uterine changes induced by prior CS can interfere with uteroplacental blood flow leading to subsequent gestational complications， including GDM . Furthermore， a normal placenta's buffer action against hyperglycemia in the mother may impede due to placenta insufficiency as a result of placenta abnormalities associated with previous CS. Therefore， this may cause GDM in pregnancy. Also， placenta hypoxia associated with\n\n【35】Table 2： Crude odd ratios for pregnancy complications associated with previous cesarean section in the second pregnancy， Hunan， China.\n\n【36】Previous Mode of delivery，n(%)\n\n| Pregnancy complications  | Previous vaginal delivery n=1076  | Previous CS n=942  | B  | S.E  | WaldX2  | P  | OR  | 95% CI  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GDM  | 112(10.4)  | 156(16.6)  | 0.535  | 0.133  | 16.248  | 0  | 1.708  | 1.216  |\n| Polyhydramnios  | 2(0.2)  | 4(0.4)  | 0.829  | 0.867  | 0.913  | 0.339  | 2.29  | 0.531  |\n| Fetal anomaly  | 3(0.3)  | 44(4.7)  | 2.864  | 0.598  | 22.899  |  | 17.525  | 5.638  |\n| PIH  | 43(4.0)  | 51(5.4)  | 0.319  | 0.212  | 2.257  | 0.133  | 1.375  | 0.084  |\n| Placenta previa  | 18(1.7)  | 46(4.9)  | 1.104  | 0.282  | 15.372  |  | 3.018  | 1.241  |\n| Placenta Abruption  | 9(0.8)  | 6(0.6)  | -0.274  | 0.529  | 0.269  | 0.604  | 0.76  | 0.143  |\n| Placenta Achesion  | 118(11.0)  | 102(10.8)  | 0.014  | 0.143  | 0.01  | 0.921  | 0.986  | 0.305  |\n\n【38】B： Unstandardized Regression Weight/ Coefficient of the Constant， S.E： Standard Error； Wald X： Chi-square test； P.

Pre-gestational diabetes was not added to the covariates of GDM and chronic hypertension was also not added to the covariates of PIH tFurther adjusted for PIH in the second pregnancy\n\n【44】#Further adjusted for fetal anomaly and GDM in the second pregnancy placenta insufficiency may also affect the glucose transporters found in the placenta's syncytiotrophoblast， responsible for increasing glucose transport from the mother to the placenta . This placenta insufficiency may result in hyperglycemia in the maternal circulation that may contribute to GDM. GDM in previous pregnancy can be recurrent in the subsequent pregnancy. However， a study  indicated that recurrent GDM in previous pregnancy does not significantly reduce previous CS’s influence on GDM. Also， advanced maternal age and overweight or obesity is identified as risk factors for gestational diabetes mellitus. Although most of the women with previous CS were of advanced maternal age and were overweight， we adjusted for these confounders. Nevertheless， there remained an association between previous CS and GDM. However， further studies elucidating the current findings on the relationship between previous CS and GDM and the possible biological and physiological relationship need to be appraised.\n\n【45】Furthermore， previous CS showed a significant impact on the fetal anomaly in our study. To our knowledge， this is the first recent study that shows the association between previous CS and fetal anomaly. These findings of this study， might be due to the increased risk of placenta disorders associated with previous CS， which can predispose the women to placenta insufficiencythat may affect the fetus s normal development leading to increased risk for fetal anomaly . It could also be speculated that the risk of fetal anomaly may be due to the uterine cavity changes induced by a uterine scar from previous CS， which can alter the uterus s anatomy that predisposes women to have a fetal anomaly. Although advanced maternal age， pre-gestational diabetes， and chronic hypertension are considered high-risk fetal anomaly factors， there remained a higher risk for fetal anomaly associated with previous CS when adjusted for our studies. However， most of the pregnancies with fetal anomaly were terminated at the first or second trimester， which may not represent the exact number of women with a fetal anomaly. Therefore， more studies focusing on the association between previous CS and fetal anomaly need to be conducted in the future.\n\n【46】Among the placenta disorders， only placenta previa has an association with previous CS in our study. Previous CS was associated with an increased risk of placenta previa with an adjusted Odds Ratio(ORs) of 2.89， higher than some previous studies . These previous studies have indicated the association between previous CS and placenta previa， but the Odd Ratios (ORs) were lesser than our study. However， parity and multiple gestations，considered to increase the risk of placenta previa in a previous study ， were excluded from our study. Furthermore， when adjusted for the covariates(significant maternal characteristics)， which were also considered potential confounders to placenta previa in previous studies ， it remained a higher risk. This higher Odd Ratio (OR) may be due to the study conducted with data from a tertiary hospital where women with high-risk pregnancies such as placenta previa are referred to. Currently， the exact cause of placenta previa is unknown. However， placenta previa is hypothesized to be related to a failure of apparent placental migration， impaired differential growth of the lower uterine segment， and deficient decidua basalis in the presence of previous surgery injury .\n\n【47】However，polyhydramnios was not associated with previous CS in our study； this is in variance with previous studies . The difference might be attributed to the small number of pregnant women with polyhydramnios in our study， which contributed to a small effect size that did not associate previous CS and polyhydramnios. This is supported by the wide Confidence Interval (CI) observed in its Odds Ratio (OR). Furthermore， among the placenta disorders associated with previous CS in the previous studies， placenta abruption and placenta accreta did not show any association with previous CS. This finding is in variance with other previous studies . An observation of no increased risk between previous CS and Pregnancy Induced Hypertension (PIH) existed in our study. This may be due to a smaller number of women with PIH in our study which could not predict the association.\n\n【48】Our study also confirms the high CS rate of 46.7% in the first delivery as the previous CS. This finding is congruent with the WHO study， which indicated China to be the country with the highest CS rate of 46.2% among the 24 Asian countries. This present study is one of the few studies conducted after the two-child policy that examines previous CS's influence on pregnancy complications. This study also adjusted for several confounding factors that could have influenced our result. The study was conductedthree years after implementing the two-child policy that accurately represents pregnancy complications among women with a second pregnancy.\n\n【49】The present study also had some limitations， primarily due to the retrospective nature of the design. Firstly， misclassification of the pregnancy complications may exist just as other administrative databases， which can lead to bias， but this may have occurred randomly and therefore could have the tendency of reducing the bias that could have occurred in this stuidy.\n\n【50】Secondly， some details of information on the first pregnancy， such as the pregnancy outcomes and indications for previous CS， were not present due to the transitioning from paper medical records entry to electronic medical records. Information regarding their first pregnancy， which happened very long ago， was not captured. There can be a reduction of bias from lack of indication for the previous CS since most women during the one-child policy had CS without any medical reasons . Also， some women did not have their first child at our hospital； hence the available details ofthe first pregnancy were obtained from maternal self-report， of which there could be a P presence of recall bias.\n\n【51】Thirdly， the BMI used for the study was BMI at admission for delivery， which may not represent the exact BMI since the fetus’s weight could have influenced maternal BMI at admission. Lastly， there could be selection bias since most women who had obstetric complications in their first pregnancy might opt for a tertiary hospital or be referred to a tertiary hospital to seek medical help during their subsequent pregnancy.\n\n【52】Conclusion\n\n【53】In conclusion， our study revealed the association of previous first CS with pregnancy complications such as GDM， fetal anomaly and placenta previa on singleton pregnancy among women having their second child under the universal two-child policy. Hence， this study provides the needed information for obstetricians， nurses and midwives to acquaint themselves with knowledge pertaining to pregnancy complications and provides intensive management and follow-ups of women with previous CS to ensure a healthy mother and baby throughout the pregnancy and delivery periods. Such information obtained from this study could help the decision-making process regarding CS for the health care providers and expectant mothers alike， mainly when there are no clear medical indications for CS.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 11:33:19", "endTime": "2024/09/24 11:33:53", "cost": 34.641}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:35", "update_time": "2024-09-23 19:33:53", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 19:33:18"}

Possibly the undesirable consequence developed with aging， sex， obesity， diabetes， hypertension， smoking， and other comorbidities likely for the severity associated with the infectious and non-infectious disease.\n\n【2】It is well acknowledged that the men are more prone to develop the risk of OSA with the occurrence of 11% and 4% of middle-aged men and women individually . Interestingly， the gender predisposition to COVID-19， with men more vulnerable to being affected . The putative male prevalence rate around 67% to 75% conditional on the country， mortality and diagnosis methods . Generally， the ratio between male and female is 2.7：1 .\n\n【3】The reduced vulnerability of females to COVID-19 infections could be attributed to enhanced inborn and adaptive immune responses in females regulated by X chromosome and sex hormones. Surprisingly， heighten expression level of Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE-2) is reported in the lungs of males compared to females， which is the entry receptor for the COVID-19virus . However， smoking habits could be an another susceptible factor for the over expression of airway ACE2 ， meanwhile the smoking effect on ACE2 expression should be analyzed .\n\n【4】Noteworthy， in a limited studies the gender variances in the number of cases， if they occurred， were not statistically remarkable ，and the variances have been revealed to probably altered with age also . In general， insufficient studies have provided precise data stratified by age group and gender differences ； this might be a notable barrier to evidence-based results making and disease management strategy .\n\n【5】Although records on gender differences are inadequate， and have not yet been assimilated in course of action and recommendations for the diagnosis， prognosis and management. Gender specificity has also been incorporated into a classifier prediction model to adopt the status of improved and dead COVID-19 patients . Consequently， through the roadmap of gender specificity， we define the putative associations that are more pores for OSA patients to get infected by COVID-19 virus. Likewise， in COVID-19 and OSA cases gender specificity is a conspicuous risk factor as they both are more venerable for men as compared to women. Thus superior aid and， the new gender specific approach should be assimilated for the prevention and control of COVID-19vulnerability in OSA patients as they are already affected with other interlinked comorbidities Nevertheless， due to restricted quantifiable records， it remains a task to delineate the pathophysiology that may lead to improved outcomes of using gender differences management during COVID-19 infection in OSA patients. Even though the emergent figure of recommendation evidently points out the gender-specific changes in diverse series of medical circumstances， from chronic infection to pandemics， little has been explained into gender-oriented and attuned medical strategies and health care guidelines.\n\n【6】In continuation with this integrative awareness for the gender specific medicine strategies which incorporates information of medical outlines of pre medical conditions， considering the changing aspects of these outlines may reduce the disease development at early stage， and may bridge this wide gap. Strategies and public well-being efforts have not reported the gender-related influences of disease occurrences . Unfortunately， till date no international organizations or governing body in any affected nation has directed the gender analysis of the pandemic .\n\n【7】Herewith， we present all the expected gender specific and other related comorbidities in COVID-19 and OSA to increase the awareness of gender-specific variances in the field of medical sciences and clinical research to advance the preventive strategies as well as health care policies. Additionally， to heighten the personalized care， appropriately report the distinctive requirements of sexual category and hence reduce inequalities， as well as decrease existing and upcoming risk of disease at the specific， public， national and international levels.\n\n【8】There is a need to enhance the awareness among the patients， health care professionals and organizations for effective gender specific therapeutic approach and control measures among these patients.\n\n【9】Keywords： Obstructive sleep apnea；(COVID-19； Gender-specificity； Angiotensin-converting enzyme-2； Global health", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 11:17:22", "endTime": "2024/09/24 11:17:29", "cost": 6.683}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:35", "update_time": "2024-09-23 19:17:28", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 19:17:22"}

The formation of adhesions begins at the moment when the discontinuity of the peritoneal integrity occurs and the endocrine metabolic response is initiated at a cellular level to repair the defect caused in the peritoneum's surface. However，preventing adhesions from forming in the abdominalportion is considered to be a correlation， from the moment of the execution of the techniques to the total recovery of the patient. Containment measures and the best healing of the tissue can be applied， such as； the use of bio-resorbable membranes and specific dressings emphasized in this analysis. Ensuring stability and a lower probability of the development of the tissular adhesion.\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Intraperitoneal Adhesions constitute an important cause of postoperative complications in patients undergoing abdominopelvic surgery， including infertility， intestinal obstruction， and chronic pelvic pain， making explicit a high potential for morbimortality . Directly correlated to the intestinal microbiota and the correlation between the human tissues of healing， the abundant production ofa fibrous repair tissue can be harmful to the intestinal tract since it causes abdominal chronic pain， a recurrent intestinal obstruction that requires multiple hospitalizations， and infertility. Moreover， it can become a chronic disease with significant mortality and minimum perspectives of a cure.\n\n【4】In a general context， defined as “adhesions\"， they can be developed in many areas of the human body， possessing many nomenclatures such as； intrauterine adhesion， pericardial adhesion， epidural adhesion， and peritoneal adhesion，the latter being more emphasized in this study. The postoperative adhesions are pathological peritoneal tissues that connect adjacent structures. Then， the physical properties of these tissues can vary significantly from a thin membrane of connective tissue to a thick fibrous structure that can contain blood vessels and nerves. Still， avoiding its formation is of primordial importance .\n\n【5】From the start of the incision， it is necessary to respect the caution and care with which the tissue and the rupture of its cells are handled， that is， specific cutting techniques are theoretically utilized with precision. Even the prevention in the act of the surgical cut alone does not guarantee that the adhesions cannot be eventually and periodicaly developed. In this regard， current methodologies that make use of biomaterials as a theoretical and practical foundation are based on the possibility of avoiding the friction between the tissues and the exacerbated inflammation， as well as the coagulation cascade and the production of fibers The biomaterials are generally active biochemical compounds that prevent intestinal adhesions such as； biofilms， hyaluronic acids， bio-resorbable membranes， hydrogels， natural films， and resorbable biofilms. Each classification has specific physical properties， being used in specific cases of cellular regeneration. In short， they can avoid the consequences of adhesions .\n\n【6】Methodology\n\n【7】The present study has a descriptive-discursive character， emphasizing primarily the intestinal adhesion's theme， as well as a possible form of prevention and treatment through the usage of membranes and bio-absorbable dressings applied in a perspective of proof of activity in the human body， besides emphasizing concepts in physiology， anatomy， and Pathophysiology in general.\n\n【8】In this way， objective research was performed in the following databases； PUBMED，SCIELO， and Google Scholar. This article's bibliographical research made use of these terms； “Intestinal adhesions\"， “biological dressings”and“bio-absorbable membranes\"， without exclusion criteria， however， greater attention was given to the most recent papers due to their greater applicability.\n\n【9】Results and Discussion\n\n【10】Adhesion formation process\n\n【11】The peritoneum is a membrane that covers the cavity of the abdomen and its internal organs， which is composed of two layers： a parietal layer that covers the abdominal wall and a visceral layer that covers the organs. Adhesions occur after peritoneal trauma from damage cauised bysurgicalinterventions，abdominopelvic inflammatory disease， or infections， and can take form between the intestinal loops， as well as among other abdominal structures such as the liver and diaphragm .\n\n【12】In the surgical process， the skin is injured by a local incision， the tissue injury initiates an inflammatory response and the subsequent healing process， which stimulates the formation of fibrous tissue. Systemic coagulation results in fibrin deposits， which are a matrix for the development of fibro-collagen tissue and the formation of the extracellular matrix . The trauma of peritoneal tissue and other intra-abdominal tissues results in a substantial compound rich in proinflammatory cytokines： Fibronectin， hyaluronic acid， glycosaminoglycans and proteoglycans， and various cell types：Mesothelial，macrophages，neutrophils，lymphocytes， and fibroblasts. These，exhibit activation of the coagulation cascade， and a fibrin mesh forms，eventually reabsorbed or matured into an adhesive connection between surfaces . The process of formation of intestinal adhesion is explained in Figure 1.\n\n【13】Thus， postoperative adhesions are a consequence of abnormal peritoneal healing： Thelack of early postoperative fibrinolysis (in the first 48 h) allows cellular infiltration of the initial fibrinous matrix.\n\n【14】Around the seventh day， the adhesions are composed ofa collagenous extracellular matrix infiltrated by fibroblasts， smooth muscle cells， and neovascularization； this group is covered by a mesothelial covering .\n\n【15】Surgical treatments and techniques\n\n【16】Treatment can be challengingandoften1inyolves2multidisciplinary approach， including the use of medication， physical therapy， endoscopic interventions， and in some cases， surgery. In the case of intestinal obstructions caused by adhesions， initial treatment may include the use of medications to control pain and symptoms， as well as nasogastric tube feeding to reduce pressure on adhesions .\n\n【17】Removal surgeries can be a complex procedure， the adhesions often can be dense and deep， involving multiple layers and scar tissue formation. Delicate manipulation of the tissue should be fully performed using meticulous hemostasis， choice of sutures of small caliber， frequent irrigation of the dissection area to prevent the formation of fibrinous deposits， minimal use of monopolar electrocautery to prevent diffuse thermal injury， maximum resection of devitalized tissues， removal of fibrinous residues， and blood clots before peritoneal closure .\n\n【18】In this regard， techniques can be used at the last stages of the surgery to aid healing in the best way possible， such as containment barriers or tissues that allow better fixation between human tissues. An ideal barrier must possess certain properties： Biodegradability and biocompatibility properties， so a second surgical procedure is not required to recover it. Also， the area of the lesion must be accurately identified and covered completely， the barriers are difficult to apply due to the complex geometries of the abdominal cavity， however， the surgeon must apply the barriers manually and uniformly .\n\n【19】Biomaterials in general\n\n【20】Biomaterials， bio-membranes， and tissues are technologies that can be used as treatment and prevention of body adhesions； however， they have specific factors for distinct cases. Biomaterials have been studied as an option to prevent and treat intestinal adhesions. These materials can be used as a physical barrier to prevent the intestinal loops from joining during the postoperative healing process and improving intestinal function .\n\n【21】Hyaluronic acid and hydrogels\n\n【22】It is estimated that 93% of patients undergoing intra-abdominal surgery will develop some type of viscera-with-viscera or viscera-with-abdominal wall adhesions， the estimated risk being 60-90% in gynecological surgeries， thus consequently becoming one of the main causes of secondary infertility and chronic pelvic pain. Barrier intermediates that use hyaluronic acid and hydrogels are appointed as a method of prevention， avoiding the occurrence of adhesions. These barrier intermediates reduce the development of adhesions by disassociating the peritoneal areas injured during mesothelial restructuring， which is completed at around the eighth postoperative day .\n\n【23】Hyaluronic acid is a protein that is naturally present in the human body， with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties and its applications are on-site during the surgical procedure or in the gel after the closure of the incision. The most common formulas of pharmacological agents containing hyaluronic acid and hydrogels found in the pharmaceutical industry are Intergel， Hyalobarrier gel， ACP gel， Sepracoat， and Seprafilm， which is a promissory non-stick barrier that is formed by the biopolymer and carboxymethylcellulose.\n\n【24】An in vivo test performed in rabbits demonstrates the very high efficienc of the use of hyaluronic acid， effective in reducing the formation of intraperitoneal postoperative adhesions. It was demonstrated using a model of cecum abrasion with a defect in the side wall of a rabbit. This became particularly clear when comparing the prevalence of score 3 adhesions (firm and difficul to cut). In untreated rabbits， 8 out of 10 developed adherences， however， in rabbits treated with acid，only 2 in 8 developed adherences，confirming a high success rate and a possible treatment alternative .\n\n【25】In addition， Seprafilm (a chemically based on hyaluronic acid) demonstrates a remarkable reduction in the severity of adhesion formation after application in patients undergoing the Hartmann procedure. Particularly， in the case of planned relaparotomy， as in Hartmann's procedure， the application of Seprafilm can facilitate re-exploration and may reduce the risk of damage to the intestine during surgery. Therefore， the use of Seprafilm as a non-stick barrier is considerably effective . As in the hydrogel of Hyaluronic Acid (HA)， the application of HA gel reduces the number oforgans involved in the formation of adhesions in an ischemic bud， moreover， the polarization of macrophages is associated with the formation of adhesions .\n\n【26】The using of several types of gels is a good option for preventing intestinal adhesions.Adhesive-capablehydrogel barriers can reach the physical isolation of the adjacent tissues and therefore are considered an ideal solution. Nevertheless， integrating the convenience of endoscopic delivery and viscoelastic hydrogel formation remains a major challenge . Theefficac ofanti-adhesion in an in vivo model revealed that the hydrogel effectivelyseparated itselffrom the wounds of the abdominal wall and cecum. In the seventh post-surgery， the wounds were completely covered by a new epithelial layer， while the wounds in the negative control group were glued .\n\n【27】Biofilm and resorbable bio-membran\n\n【28】Biofilms and resorbable biomembranes are a kind of covering and have been studied as an approach to reduce the risk of complications and susceptibility to long-term bacterial infections. These materials are made of biocompatible polymers and， are designed to be absorbed by the body after a certain period， they can also be programmed to release compounds that help reduce inflammation. These can be constituted of various biomaterials， such as collagen， cellulose， acids， and fibers among others .\n\n【29】A barrier membrane composed of hyaluronic acid can separate the peritoneal surfaces for about 7 days. The efficac of these membranes in reducing intra-abdominal adhesions after fibroid enucleation and colectomy has been investigated and verified in the scientific literature. A study conducted by Briiggmann et al. analyzed the use of the barrier membrane as the only preventive measure against occlusion related to small bowel adhesion after intestinal resection. They found that the membrane resulted in an absolute reduction of 1.6% and a relative reduction of 47% in the occurrence ofthis complication .\n\n【30】Another type of adhesion barrier， which can be applied as a spray， comprises a pair of polyethylene glycols in a two-component system. The barrier is sprayed on the injured serous surfaces and seals them for 7 to 14 days. Its effectiveness in an in vivo study reached 83% of effectiveness Using a resorbable collagen membrane， a prospective multicenter studypoints out that the removal of the gastric band without the use of a nonstick product was correlated with a higher rate of postoperative adhesions (90.3% including 29% of severe adhesions)， while a highly significant reduction (89.9%) was observed in severe adhesions using the bio-membrane . The effects of three electrospun fiber membranes on the formation of postoperative adhesions in surgical models of rats were studied， and submitted to laparoscopy， and the results were positive. The three electrospun submicrometric membranes were soft， flexible， easy to handle， and effectively reduced adhesion formation in rats .\n\n【31】Resorbable microbiological dressing\n\n【32】The microbiological dressing is a technology in development， in which its most recent studies include the use of beneficial microorganisms such as probiotics and lactic acid bacteria， assisting the rearrangement of the intestinal microbiota. Probiotics are living microorganisms that can be found in food or dietary supplements and that provide health benefits， especially for the digestive system. The lacticacidbacteria，forinstance，areatype ofbeneficial microorganism that can be found in some types of food， such as yogurts and kefir， that promote resistance to colonization by pathogens. In this regard， microbiological techniques can be used as a method of prevention and postoperative care .\n\n【33】Bacterial cellulose within biomedical engineering is considered one of the ideal possibilities for its biocompatibility and possible applications withinvarious prototypes ofdressings such as nanocomposites， due to its properties of skin protection， blood coagulation， and healing. The use of implantable dressings to physically block surgical wounds is the main solution to prevent postoperative adhesions. Thus， the synergy between practicality and the high tissue recovery rate shows the method's effectiveness. As mentioned earlier，collagen and hyaluronic acid are great compounds that aid in the correct healing process of tissue. However， not only bioactive can produce them， but specific bacteria can produce collagen and tissue activation properties.\n\n【34】The production of cellulose through bacteria is done by a metabolic process， directly correlated to cellular multiplication. Primarily， the metabolism is activated after the consumption of nutrients， usually， glucose and sucrose， which initiate the metabolic process in the pentose phosphate cycle and the Krebs cycle， resulting respectively in the oxidation of carbohydrates and oxidation of organic acids. In this regard， the synthesis of bacterial cellulose is the product of metabolic reactions of hexoses phosphate based directly by phosphorylation of exogenous hexoses and， indirectly， by the pentoses and gluconeogenesis pathway involving various biochemical reactions， which are regulated by a high number of enzymes and regulatory and catalytic protein complexes. Bacterial cellulose can be biosynthesized by several species of bacteria belonging to the genera： Acetobacter， Achromobacter， Aerobacter， Agrobacterium， Alcaligenes， Azotobacter， Escherichia and Komagataeibacter .\n\n【35】With the use of bacterial cellulose， with collagen properties， the dressing can be further enriched by vitamins and acids. Its effectiveness rate is usually higher than ordinary membranes， due to its high metabolism. However， its production is not yet fully feasible due to the complexity of the methods . Also， the resorption of the dressing can be used in the final surgical moments， or be applied in a superior way to the skin with the addition of antimicrobial factors， which can also be applied to the dressing， ensuring that infections can hardly occur.\n\n【36】Conclusion\n\n【37】In summary， efficien methods to prevent and treat painful intestinaladhesionsLS。suchhasdressings andbio-membranes， demonstrate full capacity on aiding in tissue regeneration. Moreover， active compounds such as hydrogel and hyaluronic acid can be great helpers. The combination of bioactive and membranes can be even more revolutionary. In general， new technologies can still be developed and fully applied， avoiding adhesions and promoting better postoperative quality.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 11:14:07", "endTime": "2024/09/24 11:14:25", "cost": 18.456}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:35", "update_time": "2024-09-23 19:14:25", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 19:14:07"}

The individual who takes the drug assigns multiple meanings both to the drug itself and to the fact of taking it . Considering that today's patients often seek diagnosis online before visiting a doctor， and verify the recommendations received after the appointment itself， they often arrive at their doctor's doorstep having already formed a preconceived opinion about their alleged condition and the treatment required. In some cases， this can make consultation easier； in others， it may result in increased difficulties in introducing the correct drug therapy. In the latter case， the doctor's clinical experience may prove to be of paramount importance . This paper describes the case of an individual suffering from generalized anxiety disorder who presented for counselling with a self-diagnosis of dissociation and a hesitant attitude towards pharmacological treatment. The first step enabling the introduction of treatment was to reformulate the patient's prior beliefs.\n\n【2】Case Presentation\n\n【3】A 38-year-old IT company employee came forward with complaints of \"derealization and dissociation\"， which he diagnosed himselfwith based on descriptions available online， claiming that“there are no cures for this\"， also based on internet sources.\n\n【4】First appointment\n\n【5】The patient described the symptoms experienced in a way that mostly corresponded to his self-diagnosed condition， saying： \"I have been in a state of permanent dissociation and derealization for3 weeks. In these states， I feel like I'm doing everything on autopilot； my consciousness is watching what I'm doing； these states are exacerbated in stressful situations. My stress resistance has dropped to zero.\"Further， he added the following： \"I have also read that there is no treatment for dissociation and derealization， only psychotherapy can help.\n\n【6】The meaning structure imposed by the patient at the onset of the appointment was based on a diagnosis formulated by the patient himself and a narrowing of the range of treatment options available. Yet， at the same time， the patient reported to a psychiatrist rather than a psychotherapist， which indicated uncertainty about his own attitude. During anamnesis， it was established that the patient had already experienced such a state of mind before. He recounted： \"I had already felt like this at one point， the previous time was after a party， during which I had taken a psychoactive substance.\n\n【7】Murawiec S. Psychological Barriers in the Treatment of a Patient with a Generalized Anxiety Disorder-A Case Report of Pregabalin Treatment. Clin Case Rep int. 2023，7：1498. Copyright @ 2023 Murawiec S. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License， which permits unrestricted use， distribution， and reproductionin any medium， provided the original work The patient made a connection between the two periods when he was experiencing similar feelings， saying that the psychoactive drugs he had taken many years before had permanently damaged his brain， with his current state being a manifestation of biological brain damage. Sharing this concern expanded the scope of the conversation to include a new area： Anxiety. This made it possible to go beyond the meaning of \"dissociation and derealization\"-for which \"there are no cures\"- as proposed at the beginning. It soon turned out that the patient was facing an increased workload and experienced more pressure at work (which he caused himself) and believed his workplace intellectual performance to be declining. His interpretation was as follows： \"I am not so efficient at work because I had damaged my brain at that time； this damage has permanent consequences\".\n\n【8】Subsequent statements by the patient directly pointed to anxiety symptoms\n\n【9】“My thoughts are that I'm very scared it's going to get worse； I'm going to run out of strength to fight it. I feel like I'm losing my identity in a way. I have this question about who I am， what I want and what is important lingering over my head. Profoundly philosophical. I am afraid this condition will get worse. I am afraid that something might happen to me， a serious illness. If I wake up in this state at night， allI want to do is survive； sometimes panic sets in.\"\n\n【10】He also reported experiencing a “constant feeling of anxiety\"and claimed： \"I have always been thinking of what might go wrong； my head couldn’t stop； I would go from a minor thing to tragic consequences. The patient had a multifaceted neurological diagnosis. No features of CNS neurological problems were found.\n\n【11】This statement by the patient also indicated another aspect of the treatment that proved crucial. One important value for the patient was his identity -the question \"Who am I?\". Indeed， this question made the context of treatment more meaningful still. It made it clear that the patient would not accept treatment that would lead to a subjectively discernible violation of his sense of identity. The patient needed to be in control of himself and that which concerned him. After all， he reported to the doctor with a ready-made self-diagnosis and views on the possibility of receiving help. In the subsequent part of the conversation，he stressed the importance of his sense of self， of who he was.\n\n【12】After reformulating the diagnosis from1“dissociationi and derealization\" to \"anxiety disorder\"， to which the patient agreed，he was presented with a description of generalized anxiety disorder. The patient fully identified with this description. Treatment with pregabalin was then suggested， which included a reference to the presentation ofdrug-related information and the summary ofproduct characteristics. The remainder of the visit was spent discussing the patient's fears， anxieties and beliefs about the possible use of the drug. While the patient ultimately agreed to take pregabalin， he did indicate that he had an appointment with another psychiatrist to get a \"second opinion\".\n\n【13】Further treatment stages\n\n【14】The second opinion he sought confirmed the recommendation to take pregabalin. At the follow-up appointment， the patient reported that \"This drug has helped a little， I don't have as many panic attacks\". He was taking 75 mg of pregabalin at the time； however， he did not consent to an increase in the dosage of the drug. He feared that taking higher doses would make him lose his identity. Subsequent appointments with the patient can be described as a \"negotiation\"between the desire to take higher doses of pregabalin， linked to perceived improvements in mood and function， and fears of losing control. Although the patient had carefully read the information about the drug， including the dose range starting from 150 mg， and did not dispute this information，he expressed strong concerns about increasing the drug dosage (and simultaneously a desire to do so). These concerns applied even to the threshold dose indicated in the leaflet. The patient was concerned about losing control over himself and his well-being， as well as suffering a loss of identity， and feeling a sense of dependence on a drug-a factor beyond his control.\n\n【15】After increasing the dose of pregabalin to 150 mg， the patient experienced a marked improvement， including in terms of mood and function throughout the day. As a result， he grew even more hesitant about the drug he was taking. The drug's effect proved to be very helpful； the irritating and function-limiting symptoms he had been suffering from for years began to disappear. On the other hand， this confronted the patient with the feeling that his well-being was not entirely up to him and was not fully un der his control， raising his fear and，ironically， creating some anxiety. Nonetheless， so great were the benefits of taking pregabalin that the patient opted for another dose increase to 225 mg. The features of generalized anxiety have subsided， and the patient's functioning in many spheres has significantly expanded in capacity. The patient reframed his mindset， recognizing that “I'm myself the way I am now\". He was satisfied with the new opportunities to meet other people (which had previously been significantly limited)， to travel and go on trips， and the significant improvement in his workplace status and image.\n\n【16】Conclusions\n\n【17】An important feature of generalized anxiety disorder is a specific form of anxiety- thinking of negative scenarios of future events， anticipatory anxiety and having anxious thoughts about the future. Individuals suffering from this disorder often craft elaborate scenarios full of negative expectations based only on a piece oftrivial information .\n\n【18】Their anxiety can take many forms， some of which do not directly indicate that they are experiencing it. Patient complaints can include a range of somatic and psychological symptoms， as well as a variety of behaviors. To formulate a diagnosis， it is necessary to carry out a more thorough history taking and discuss with the patient the content of the experiences underlying the reported symptoms.\n\n【19】Individuals suffering from anxiety may express fear of SDe treatment and various aspects of it， including those of a highly improbable nature. This fear should be thoroughly discussed to ensure the patient's cooperation in treatment. If the patient's hesitant attitude towards treatment is dominated by fears rather than hope for improvement， their cooperation in the treatment will be incomplete In treating mental disorders， the dimension of subjective and psychological aspects of treatment is often crucial . Such phenomena often determine cooperation in treatment. They are based on the subjective feeling of the drug's effect (the perception of \"what the drug does to me) and the interpretation of this effect . These interpretations are individual and result from the patient's life history and numerous psychological conditions like confidence levels， values held or culturally based perceptions about the effects of substances prescribed by psychiatrists. The sense of identity， of being oneselfand of \"not compromising one's personality\" during treatment is vital to the success of treatment in some patients with mental disorders.\n\n【20】F ersonalized selection of pharmacological treatment appropriate to the diagnosis and the given patient plays an important role here.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 11:12:17", "endTime": "2024/09/24 11:12:45", "cost": 28.47}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:35", "update_time": "2024-09-23 19:12:45", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 19:12:16"}

However，this therapy， by inducing a T-cell-mediated immune response disinhibition， can potentially trigger a cascade of immune toxicity with a wide range of manifestations affecting multiple systems. Myasthenia Gravis(MG) as an adverse effect of immunecheckpoint inhibitorshas a reported incidenceofapproximately0.24%. Despite its low incidence， when it occurs as an immune-mediated adverse effect， it carries a high mortality rate， emphasizing the importance of the early recognition of its manifestations. We present a case of a 68-year-old male who developed de novo myasthenic syndrome as a secondary adverse effect of anti-PD-L1 therapy， specifically Atezolizumab.\n\n【2】Keywords： Immune checkpoint inhibitors； PD-1； PD-L1； CTLA-4； Atezolizumab； Myasthenia gravis\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Cancer cells employ inhibitory signals on T-cells as a mechanism to evade detection and elimination by the immune system. Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors (ICI) function by suppressing the inactivation signals on T-cells .Once the inhibitory signal is removed， an enhanced immune response is triggered， leading to the elimination of abnormal cells .\n\n【5】However， this heightened immune response can also unleash an unpredictable cascade of autoimmune toxicity known as Immune-related Adverse Events (IrAEs).IrAEs have been reported with a frequency of 60% to 90% for CTLA-4 inhibitors and 20% to 70% for PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors， with the majority being grade 1 to 2 events .\n\n【6】IrAEs typically occur within 3 to 6 months after treatment initiation and commonly affect systems with high cellular turnover， such as the skin， endocrine， gastrointestinal， renal， and pulmonary systems. However， neurological involvement， as described in the case presented below， has also been observed， albeit much less frequently .\n\n【7】Various ICIs， based on their target molecules， include Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-Associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) inhibitors (e.g.，ipilimumab， tremelimumab)， programmed cell Death Protein1 (PD-1) inhibitors (e.g.， nivolumab， pembrolizumab， cemiplimab)， and programmed cell Death-Ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitors (e.g.， atezolizumab， avelumab， durvalumab). Additionally， the inhibitor targeting Lymphocyte Activation Gene 3 (LAG-3： relatlimab) has recently been added to the group.\n\n【8】Myasthenia Gravis as an Adverse Effect of Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors：A Case Report. Clin Case Rep int. 2023， 7：1592.\n\n【9】We present the case of a 68-year-old male with a history of well-controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus， dyslipidemia， and hypertension. In June 2020， he was diagnosed with unresectable multifocal trabecular hepatocellular carcinoma secondary to Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) with Child-Pugh A classification.\n\n【10】In October 2020， the patient started treatment with the combination of atezolizumab and bevacizumab， approved for systemic treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. Regular evaluations during the first 7 months of treatment showed significant improvement in liver function tests and alpha-fetoprotein levels (normalizing from 300 ng/ml to within the normal range)， along with substantial clinical and functional improvement and Computed Tomography(CT) imaging indicating a partial response according to RECIST criteria. However， in April 2021(6 months into treatment)， he presented to the hospital emergency department with a 4-day history of progressive generalized weakness， necessitating the use of a wheelchair for mobility. He also exhibited bilateral ptosis worsening throughout the day， weakness in neck flexion， difficulty swallowing， dyspnea， shallow breathing， and fatigue， with preserved level of consciousness. During hospitalization the patient experienced respiratory decompensation， requiring acute management with endotracheal intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation. CT imaging of the chest and abdomen and AFP levels at that time indicated disease control.\n\n| COMMENTS： 213511887Test Name  | In Range  |  | out of Range  | Reference Range  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Acetylehuline Ree BiiidingAcetylcholine Rec Bind Ab  |  | 4.90 H  |  | nmol/L  |\n|  | Reference Ranges for Acetylcholine Receptor  |  |  |  |\n|  | Bindiny Antibudy：  |  |  |  |\n|  | Negative：< ur -0.30  |  | )mul/L  |  |\n|  | Equivocal： 0.31-0.49  |  | nmol/L  |  |\n|  | Pusitiye：>r-0.50  |  | nmo1/L  |  |\n| ACETYLCHOLINE RECEPTOR Acetylchuline Ree Bloe.

The patient was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit(ICU)， where Intravenous Immunoglobulin G (IVIg)， neostigmine， corticosteroids， azathioprine and plasmapheresis were administered.\n\n【13】During his ICU stay， the patient experienced de novo seizures. CT and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the Central Nervous System (CNS) ruled out brain metastases. The MRI showed symmetricalwhite matteredema in theparieto-occipitalandcerebellar regions， consistent with Posterior Reversiblee Encephalopath1y Syndrome (PRES) . Cerebrospinal fluid analysis revealed acellular fluid with normal glucose levels and elevated protein levels with negative culture and autoimmune encephalitis antibodies.\n\n【14】Eventually， the patient was extubated and gradually recovered from myasthenic syndrome andPRES symptoms， continuing neurological treatment on an outpatient basis.\n\n【15】Due to the association between myasthenic syndrome and ICI use， atezolizumab was discontinued， and subsequent treatment with bevacizumab monotherapy was initiated. However， after 7 months of monotherapy， the patient experienced disease progression and eventually passed away.\n\n【16】Neurological IrAEs that affect the CNS include conditions such as hypophysitis， aseptic meningitis， non-infectious encephalitis or myelitis， diffuse encephalopathy， rheumatological CNS diseases， and Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES). Meanwhile， myositis， Myasthenia Gravis (MG)， Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS)， and other polyneuropathies fall under the category of Peripheral Nervous System (PNS) involvement .\n\n【17】Discussion\n\n【18】Neurological immune-related Adverse Events (N-irAEs) have an incidence of about 1% to 6% .N-irAEs can be divided into two major groups： those affecting the Central Nervous System (CNS) and those affecting the Peripheral Nervous System (PNS). Within the CNS group， conditions such as hypophysitis， aseptic meningitis， non-infectious encephalitis or myelitis， diffuse encephalopathy， rheumatological CNS diseases， and PosteriorReversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES) have been described. The PNS group includes myositis， Myasthenia Gravis (MG)， Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS)， and other polyneuropathies . Among drug-induced MG cases，ICI therapy appears to be the most common cause， with an incidence reported in small studies of approximately 0.24%. Notably， Nivolumab (anti-PD-1) use has been associated with an incidence of ICI-induced MG as high as 0.12% . Myasthenic syndrome typically occurs within the first 3 months after treatment initiation， either de novo (due to ICI use) or as an exacerbation of pre-existing disease . According to available data， the majority of cases (85%) present de novo syndrome induced by ICIs， while a smaller number manifest as exacerbations， predominantly associated with anti-PD-1 use .\n\n【19】Clinical manifestations include ocular weakness and fatigability(ptosis， diplopia)， bulbar weakness (dysphagia， dyspnea)， and weakness in proximal muscles. ICI-induced MG may concur with varying degrees of myopathy in 37% to 51% of cases and myocardial involvement in 8% to 16% of cases .\n\n【20】Diagnostic aapproaches may include serological testLsSfor acetylcholine receptor or anti-Musk antibodies， Tensilon or ice pack test，electromyography with repetitive nerve stimulation， CT or MRI， CSF analysis， and nerve sample biopsy . Importantly， some patients maypresent with seronegative myasthenic syndrome induced by ICIs， with a seropositivity rate of 59% . Management involves discontinuation of the ICI and the use of drugs such as neostigmine， immunosuppressants， corticosteroids， rituximab， mycophenolate， IVIg， or plasmapheresis in case of clinical deterioration， as was the case with our patient .\n\n【21】Although most patients have a favorable outcome， mortality rates range from 20% to 30%， with respiratory failure being the most frequent cause. Therefore，assessing potential indicators ofrespiratory tailure is crucial.\n\n【22】Conclusion\n\n【23】Immune checkpoint inhibitors have ushered in a new era in the treatment of various types of cancer， with expanding therapeutic indications. However， these novel medications havedistinct toxicological profiles and pose a vulnerability of the CNS and PNS， making their use challenging.\n\n【24】ICI-induced MG，along with other N-irAEs， is a rarebut potentially lethal complication associated with multiple daily life impairments. It has a high severity rate and often co-occurs with other autoimmune conditions， such as myositis and myocardial involvement. It also exhibits a distinct serological profile， necessitating clinical tests and electromyography to confirm the diagnosis.\n\n【25】Early diagnosis， discontinuation of the triggering agent工， early recognition of risk factors for respiratory deterioration， and symptomatic management with anticholinesterases， immunosuppressants， and respiratory therapy form the basis of its management.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 11:29:36", "endTime": "2024/09/24 11:30:13", "cost": 37.29}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:35", "update_time": "2024-09-23 19:30:11", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 19:29:33"}

Furthermore she showed symptoms of perineal nerve palsy of the same leg. In the diagnostic course it was found that the sciatic nerve was compressed by a Heterotopic Ossification (HO) of the greater trochanter.\n\n【2】The stretching lead to a dislocation of the nerve around the HO， which prevented the nerve to slip back in its anatomical position.\n\n【3】Operation was performed and the neurological symptoms diminished.\n\n【4】Keywords： Sciatic nerve compression； Peronaeus nerve palsy； Heterotopic ossification\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 41 year old patient presented to our Emergency Department (ED) after performing a stretching technique derived from Yoga with the name， Ardha Paschimottanasana\". During this exercise one of the legs is bend in the hip and knee joint in a sitting position so that the foot is placed on the medial aspects of the contralateral thigh. Next step is to bend the upper body above the thigh which leads to stretching of the hamstring muscles.\n\n【7】While performing this exercise the patient felt a sudden pain in her posterior thigh which resulted in the inability to extend her knee. The knee was locked in 70° flexion.\n\n【8】In the past she has been treated due to algophobia (fear of pain) and she was diagnosed with a somatic disorder. Other than that she repeatedly suffered from muscle cramps in the posterior thigh. No further relevant past medical history was present.\n\n【9】On admission in the ED3 days later she showed no pain in a relaxed position but still was not able to extend her knee. A passive movement of the knee was not possible because the patient felt uncomfortable and reported dysesthesia of her lower thigh and foot. A meniscal tear was assumed and a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)-scan was performed. There were no pathologic findings.\n\n【10】The patient was ambulating on crutches and Continuous Passive Motion (CPM) was applied. While walking her then expressed mild symptoms of sensory perineal nerve palsy.\n\n【11】A neurological examination was performed but did not show typical symptoms that could be associated with a nerve root injury or a peripheral injury of the perineal nerve. Knowing that the patient had a somatizing disorder (algophobia). The neurologist assumed an interference of her symptoms.\n\n【12】However an MRI-scan of the lumbar spine was obtained to rule out nerve root injury or compression， it also showed no significant pathologies. To prevent ongoing lack of motion of her knee joint it was extended under mild analgosedation. The knee showed free Range of Motion (ROM) under sedation. A knee brace was applied to keep the knee in an extended position. The following day she presented with a foot drop.\n\n【13】Once more we asked the neurologist for a detailed examination including a Nerve Conduction Study (NCS). The NCS showed pathologic signals indicating an acute sciatic nerve injury.\n\n【14】Mean while the patient mentioned that she had been diagnosed with a bony tumor in her proximal right femur. An MRI-scan of that area was obtained externally just a few weeks before. The MRI images were not available but the results were reported negative regarding any compression of the sciatic nerve.\n\n【15】The X-ray showed a heterotopic ossification of approx. 16 mm ×13 mm emerging from the posterior aspect of the greater trochanter.\n\n【16】An MRI-scan of the proximal femur showed significant swelling of the sciatic nerve and a dislocation from its anatomical position. The nerve was strained around the ossification and showed signs of acute hemorrhage.\n\n【17】The patient then was operated via Kocher-Langen beck approach and the ossification was removed.Intraoperativelythe nervepresented with elongation and hematoma but its continuity was preserved.\n\n【18】Once the ossification was resected the nerve slipped back into its anatomical position. It then was tested to remain in place while moving the hip and knee joint .\n\n【19】A few days after the operation the sensory function of the nerve started to recover mean while the drop foot remained.\n\n【20】The patient was discharged eight days later to a rehabilitation facility.\n\n【21】Discussion\n\n【22】A rare case of a locked knee and foot drop due to sciatic nerve compression is presented.\n\n【23】Peronaeus nerve palsy is common in trauma patients often caused by proximal fibular fractures or compartment syndrome.\n\n【24】However compression syndrome the sciatic nerve can also lead to this entity.\n\n【25】These symptoms have different reasons. There are numerous case reports about compression syndromes caused by veins， pseudoaneurysms of the gluteal artery， heterotopic ossifications or hematoma following surgery .\n\n【26】The number of patients suffering from sciatic nerve palsy is unknown since most of the literatures are case reports only.\n\n【27】Correct interpretation of this patient's symptoms was difficult due to a known somatic disorder. She was sometimes comfortable with her situation and did not express any signs of severe pain， while few minutes later she was crying in bed due to unbearable pain not responding to any medication. As complicating factor she was diagnosed with a， bony tumor “possibly resulting from a fall a few years earlier. Unfortunately we did not get this information on admission. Retrospectively the patient reported periodic cramps and pain in her posterior thigh ongoing for several months. An MRI-scan of that area was performed externally shortly before was reported to show no signs of sciatic nerve compression at that time.\n\n【28】This might have been one of the reasons why we first did not focus on a possible nerve injury but rather on thelocked knee and the lower spine. Therefore the MRI of the pelvis and thigh was the last of three MRIs performed.\n\n【29】The symptoms were inconclusive and only the nerve conduction study objectified the injury of the sciatic nerve. Once it was diagnosed operation was performed immediately to decompress the nerve and to prevent long term symptoms11.\n\n【30】Conclusion\n\n【31】In cases with nerve palsy especially in young and healthy patients a thorough neurological examination and a nerve conduction study should be performed as soon as possible to differentiate between central or peripheral causes.

Anti-NMDA Receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis is associated with an immune-mediated mechanism and clinically characterized by a prominent neuropsychiatric syndrome . Other clinical features include sleep dysfunction， agitation， fluctuating catatonia， memory deficit， decrease of verbal output or mutism， seizures， dyskinesia and autonomic instability . Psychosis is less common in adults. In children there can be prominent early psychiatric symptoms， but dysautonomia and hypoventilation are less frequent and severe .\n\n【2】The diagnostic approach is based on neuroimaging， EEG， lumbar puncture (lymphocytic pleocytosis or oligoclonal bands) and antibody testing on serum and cerebrospinal fluid .\n\n【3】Another NMDAR encephalitis characteristic is its association with tumors (mostly ovarian teratomas) and herpes simplex infection . There is evidence that tumor identification and treatment and immunotherapy are responsible for stabilizing or slowing disease progression.\n\n【4】Currently， we have not found yet any biomarkers that can be useful to guide therapy or predict oiitcome.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 46-year-old Italian woman was found pathologically excited， anxious， and restless. For this reason， she was admitted to the Psychiatry Department， where it was decided to start an antipsychotic therapy with olanzapine and delorazepam. After two days， she was discharged clinically compensated.Nevertheless， she came back to Psychiatry because she was feeling sick.\n\n【7】During her hospitalization， she underwent brain MRI with contrast that was negative for any findings. Blood tests revealed increased thyroglobulin antibody levels (112 UI/mL). Electroencephalogram showed diffused slow and sharp waves， while lumbar puncture demonstrated lymphocytic pleocytosis (72 cells). Thus， it was decided to transfer the patient to neurology.\n\n【8】Principal viral and bacterial meningoencephalitis were excluded， and anti-NMDA receptor antibodies were detected in the cerebrospinal fluid and serum. A full body CT scan was performed， that showed left thyroid lobe inhomogeneity and tracheal deviation. Furthermore， total body PET demonstrated left thyroid nodule uptake.\n\n【9】Discussion\n\n【10】At the Neurology Department， she was first treated with a 5-day cycle of high-dose methylprednisolone associated with a 7-day cycle of plasmapheresis. Subsequently， she was given5-day cycle of immunoglobulins. Her clinical status fluctuated following initiation oftreatment，and it was necessary to transfer her to ICU because of important psychomotor agitation and difficulty in carrying out treatments.\n\n【11】Lumbar puncture was repeated， and it showed minimal lymphocytic pleocytosis (5 cells) and anti-NMDA receptor antibodies persistence. Repeat brain MRI were also performed， which underscored right hippocampus and amygdala hyperintensity.\n\n【12】Because of neurological worsening， corticosteroids were again administered， which was accompanied by a progressive reduction in oral dose. Furthermore， the immunoglobulin cycles were repeated monthly.\n\n【13】ElectroencephalogramIsS(EEG)iinitially yshowed a slow， continuous， rhythmic activity in the theta range. This pattern is typically associated with the catatonic-like stage . Moreover， diffuse delta brushes， a characteristic EEG pattern of anti-NMDAR encephalitis ， were evident.\n\n【14】During hospitalization， the patient progressively showed a slight improvement in mental status， self-orientation， disease insight and EEG pattern.\n\n【15】With regard to the association with tumors， after total body TC and PET results， otolaryngologists agreed to recommend thyroidectomy because of the uncertain presence of thyroid cancer and tracheal compression. Actually， we know that the most frequent tumor autoimmune encephalitis-associated is ovarian teratoma， but no one has ever described a correlation with thyroid tumors or thyropathy.\n\n【16】After one month from discharge， although maintaining normal consciousness， motor， and sensory function， she had a small limitation in executive skills (MoCA 25/30) without implications in daily life activities.\n\n【17】Lesson Learnedand Recommendations\n\n【18】First of all， we have to remember that NMDAR encephalitis not only is the most common autoimmune syndrome， but also it has to be considered on the differential diagnosis of all patients presenting encephalopathies. This is well represented by a multicenter report from the United Kingdom which found that this condition is responsible 4% ofencephalopathies .\n\n【19】This case report highlights the importance of considering every imaging result suggestion of probable cancer or thyropathy. From this perspective， it would be interesting to evaluate thyroid function and structure in other patients.\n\n【20】In the end， symptomspresented by these patients are often thought to be purely psychiatric， so these conditions are often misdiagnosed. Unfortunately， a favorable outcome is time dependent. We have to remember that organic causes of psychosis have to be fully evaluated and considering the lack of biomarkers in clinical practice， imaging results， blood test and clinical data have to be integrated as much as possible.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 11:17:31", "endTime": "2024/09/24 11:17:39", "cost": 7.978}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:34", "update_time": "2024-09-23 19:17:39", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 19:17:30"}

There are effective laser treatments for the prevention and therapy of OM， however， the lack of trained professionals difficult the use of this technique in Brazil's public hospitals， being necessary alternative treatments to circumvent this issue. Non-clinical studies conducted by our group to elucidate the mechanism of action of A. chica extract with further toxicity on genotoxicity and mutagenicity reports provided necessary data to apply for authorization to conduct clinical trial with the herbal gel containing 2.5%Arrabidaea chica Verlot standardized extract. The open-label clinical trial protocol aims to access safety issues of the herbal gel on oral mucosa of healthy research participants. This clinical trial was approved by the ethics committee of research in humans at the Faculty of Medical Sciences of University of Campinas (report no. 007891/2015). Results of this trial demonstrated that herbal gel is safe， which culminated in the approval of the phase 2 clinical studyprotocols.\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Clinical trials are a way to test new methods of diagnosing， treating， or preventing health conditions. The goal is to determine whether something is both safe and effective. Clinical trials take place in four different phases during which different questions are asked. Each phase provide evidence on safety and efficacy issues related to the intervention under study. Drug developments proceed throughout all four phases over a long period of time. With phase four being a surveillance phase after post marketing to monitor safety issues with broaden use. Phase I focuses on safety issues with participant groups that range from 20 to 100 research participants， generally with healthy individuals aiming to determine which is the highest dose humans can tolerate without serious side effects. Investigators monitor this phase closely to see the drug candidate's outcome on participants’health .\n\n【4】These studies are fundamental to identify new products for the relief of symptoms that cause patients suffering， seeking to improve patient’s life quality. Among diseases that are life-threatening with various side effects arising from treatment are neoplasia. Oral Mucositis (OM) is a frequent event in patients treated with radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy， which tends to appear in buccal and labial surfaces， the ventral surface of the tongue， the floor of the mouth， and the soft palate of patients. This side effect interferes in patient’s life quality since oral mucositis is associated with considerable pain and dysphagia which also complicates nutritional intake， increases susceptibility to infections， and leads to cancer treatment interruption， that has outcomes on total treatment increased cost .\n\n【5】The Brazilian government published the RENISUS list that consist of plants that are of interest to further study for the purpose to apply in the public system of health (SUS) . Arrabidaea chica(Humb.& Bonpl.) Verlot， was included in this list as result of previous reports indicating healing and antiulcerogenic activity in preclinical studies . The crude standardized A. chica extract， enriched with anthocyanins， demonstrated calcaneus tendons healing in animal model ，along with reduction of cutaneous fulcerations， evaluated in experimental in vivo healing experimental model with semisolid basis incorporated extract . Arrabidaea chica extract decreased 96%wound area in dermal ulcer models of male Wistar rats. In diabetic Wistar rats， A. chica extract decreased the ulcerated area by 85% .\n\n【6】Preclinical toxicity study with A. chica extract evaluated on Salmonella test and in vivo micronucleus test from mice bone marrow confirmed that the sample tested did not present any mutagenic or genotoxic potential， inferring the extract to be genetically safe . In gastrointestinal tract mucositis and oral mucositis experimental models induced by5-fluoracil in mice and hamsters showed that animals treated with A. chica extract had an increase in survival lifespan in comparison with the negative control. Furthermore a decrease of diarrhea and increase of food intake was also observed . Recently Wiziack Zago et al. reported that at low concentrations， A. chica extract showed promising cytoprotective effects against zoledronic acid induced damage.\n\n【7】These results contributed to the development of the phase I clinical study protocol with the objective of identifying possible adverse events and toxicity signs of the herbal medicine containing A. chica extract applied to healthy participants.\n\n【8】Clinical Experience with Phase 1Studies\n\n【9】In the order to evaluate the safety of an herbal gel containing 2.5%Arrabidaea chica Verlot standardized extract on the oral mucosa of healthy research participants a phase 1 clinical trial protocol submitted to the Research Ethics Committee (CEP) was developed. This clinical trial was approved by the ethics committee of research in humans at the Faculty of Medical Sciences of University of Campinas(report no. 007891/2015).\n\n【10】Twenty research participants were selected after laboratory， clinical， and dental evaluation. Ten men and ten women， who were framed within the concept of healthy individuals. Following Resolution 466 of December 2012 ， participants signed the Informed Consent Form (ICF) before entering the open-label study carried out during 30 days. On May 19h， 2016， after medical， dental， and pharmaceutical anamnesis， 1 pump pack containing the herbal medicine (the study object) was dispensed. The herbal medicine was given to participants every 10 days within 30 calendar days.\n\n【11】The instructions were to use the gel three times a day， morning， afternoon， and night， in 4 different oral mucosa regions (palate， right and left cheek， under the tongue). Before each application， participants were guided to sanitize the oral cavity by brushing and flossing teeth with no further water and food intake for 30 min after product application. The participants remained in their routine activities and maintained their normal general diets.\n\n【12】Each participant had a paper file for registering any discomfort or pertinent observation， during the 30 days of gel application， such as burning， use of concomitant medication or even forgetting to apply the gel. Weekly， the participants were submitted to clinical pharmaceutical， medical， and dental evaluations. At the end of the30 days of gel application， all the participants repeated the laboratory tests which， together with the diary and the clinical annotations of the medical records were analyzed to evaluate the possible adverse events generated by the use of the herbal medicine.\n\n【13】There are no reports of adverse events found in the literature for the crude extract of Arrabidaea chica， therefore， for patient follow-up， the events described in the package insert of a mucoadhesive herbal gel already commercialized and prescribed for mucositis， such as dry mouth， rash， itching， coughing， redness in the face， among other hypersensitivity reactions that could arise were monitored. The extract's red coloring was also taken into account， since the extract could stain mucosa and teeth. Also any discomfort caused by the texture of the gel associated with the sweet taste due to the natural sugars present in the extract was assessed regarding the presence of nausea and even vomiting at the time of application. For security monitoring purposes， the participants were monitored daily and any and every report thoroughly analyzed.\n\n【14】According to the report of all the at the application sites， the oral mucosa， as well as the nearby teeth， were stained with “bright”red， but after a few hours， this color was no longer visible. During the study，the following adverse events were observed：\n\n【15】 A participant， displayed throat inflammation after medical evaluation that was promptly treated with anti-inflammatory drugs， nevertheless this event after a thorough clinical evaluation was proven not to have relationship with the test medication.\n\n【16】 Complaint of migraine， from a participant after using the herbal medicine for the first time. As the first application of the gel was assisted by the research team， the medical and dental evaluation was immediate， where the use of an analgesic was advised. The second application was then carried out under the supervision ofthe research investigator and there was no further complaint. The adverse event， after clinical evaluations， therefore did not have relationship with the use of the gel.\n\n【17】 Report of unpleasant taste by a participant but without signs of nausea or rejection of the gel.\n\n【18】 A participant reported that the gel had better grip on the cheeks and felt a numbness in the region of the tongue. After dental evaluation， this reported event may be related to the use of the test medication.\n\n【19】 A participant reported pain in the dental arch after the tenth day of the study. Self-medicated with an analgesic and reported pain improvement. The day after the report， a dental evaluation was performed and this event was not related to the use of the test medication， but to a tension in the dental arch.\n\n【20】These results were submitted to the CEP， through a report for the evaluation of the execution of the study as well as of all medical， dental， and pharmaceutical clinical evaluations carried out and of the cases of the reported adverse events. The report was approved culminating in the development of the Phase 2 study protocol，which， after approval by the same ethics committee， is undergoing for the assessment of safety and efficacy .\n\n【21】Conclusion\n\n【22】The complexity of developing a clinical protocol coupled with low financial investment in the areas of research on natural products discourages translational progress from pre-clinical to clinical phases. Therefore， herein insight to the importance of investing on the discovery of new products for the relief of patients' suffering， seeking life quality is a positive influence for the treatment of diseases of life-threatening neoplasia with the various side effects resulting from treatment.

Especially during the COVID-19 pandemic， a dedicated team of anesthesiologists to undertake the work of establishing artificial airways for severely infected people who require mechanical ventilation. This phenomenon is mainly due to the anesthesiologists havingthe most experienceintracheal intubation. It is undeniable that the anesthesiologist is necessary in the emergency airway management team in the hospital. However， many doctors have a misunderstanding and believe that the endotracheal intubation in-hospital onlyneeds to be completed by the anesthesiologist. In this text， we emphasize the task and role of the anesthesiologist in in-hospital airway management.\n\n【2】The point repeatedly mentioned in other departments is that tracheal intubation is a complicated and risky operation， and only doctors with rich experience can properly predict and deal with potentially difficult airways. As one sentence says，professional han dles professional affairs. Especially during the COVID-19 pandemic， the effect of a dedicated tracheal intubation team is significant on infection control. Skilled doctors can complete the intubation in the shortest time， and reasonable induction ofanesthesia can reduce the release of droplets and aerosols during operation. In addition， excellent anesthesia management can ensure that the critically ill patients with fragile lungs of survive from the hypoxic period before the artificial airway is established. The efforts of anesthesiologists have provided patients with safe and reliable in-hospital airway management， but it has also led to the dependence of other departments on anesthesiologists. People often don't realize that tracheal intubation is a technique that must be mastered in the training of residents. The lack of training and practical opportunities for tracheal intubation in many departments has led to young physicians being unskilled in this skill.\n\n【3】Anesthesiologists have practiced countless difficult airway cases in operating rooms for centuries. They have summarized the procedures and strategies for dealing with various special situations. These procedures have direct significance for the practice of endotracheal intubation， and most fatal risks can be avoided. At present， domestic experts， including Professor Wu-Hua Ma， spare no effort to promote and train the latest guidelines for airway management to general practitioners，but these courses are often unable to be used by them in practice. It is difficult to change the status quo of intubation in the hospital only from the education aspect， and their inherent concepts must be changed from the hospital management aspect.\n\n【4】In addition to physicians in other departments， some anesthesiologists also misunderstand their identities. Their role in airway management is not only as a tracheal intubation operator， but also as a manager for the patient’s entire period of airway management. For example， their job includes assessing the patient’s airway and cardiopulmonary function， choosing sedation and tracheal intubation methods， even include determining whether the patient really needs tracheal intubation. This kind of identity change anesthesiologists will have more initiative to avoid unnecessary intubation. Some decision to intubation only comes from specialist considerations. Anesthesiologists can provide more risk-avoidance options including supraglottic ventilation or tracheotomy.\n\n【5】As anesthesiologists’ work move to the operating room， except providing patients with operating techniques， they must also contribute more of their experience and wisdom in physiology and pathology. As an expert in airway management， anesthesiologists play a leading role in the in-hospital emergency airway management team， not just intubation. The team role requires experts from various disciplines to perfect its rationality， including otolaryngologists and emergency doctors. Moreover， hospital managers should strengthen the training of basic skills for specialist physicians. Because in a hospital with a shortage of manpower， a dedicated emergency airway team is extravagant. This requires specialists to have the ability to deal with the critical moment of the disease， rather than waiting for the help of the same busy anesthesiologist.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 11:20:25", "endTime": "2024/09/24 11:20:42", "cost": 16.838}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:34", "update_time": "2024-09-23 19:20:40", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 19:20:23"}

Review the literature on anomalous aortic origin of a coronary artery.\n\n【3】Results： A child， male， 9 years old， syncope after exercise， coronary angiography showed that left coronary artery originated from the right sinus and the stenosis of the left main stem， treat with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and surgery， but died for pneumonia.\n\n【4】Conclusion： The children with anomalous origin of left coronary artery from the right sinus and abnormal path had the possibility of sudden changes and adverse consequences. Vigorous exercise should be avoided. The early application of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation plays an important role in protecting heart and extending the surgery time of the children， and early surgery is a radical cure method.\n\n【5】Introduction\n\n【6】Anomalous Aortic Origin of a Coronary Artery (AAOCA) is with a frequency around 0.3%to 1.5% in the general . Although AAOCA has a low incidence， it is the second leading cause of cardiac arrest and sudden cardiac death in young athletes. The highest risk is the Anomalous Origin of Left Coronary Artery from the right ainus (AOLCA)， which walk between the aorta and pulmonary arteries is the most dangerous and has the highest rate of sudden death.\n\n【7】Case Presentation\n\n【8】A 9-year-old boy with dizziness and chest tightness for 3 h after running coughed pink foamy sputum on the way to our hospital. He had a history of \"syncope after exercise\" twice in the past， accompanied incontinence， and had to wake up after a rest. There was no similar symptom in the family.\n\n【9】Electrocardiogram： Ventricular tachycardia. Oxygen saturation lower than 93%. His hemodynamics is unstable， transferred to ICU for tracheal intubation； ventilator assisted breathing， and treated with Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) for 4 days.\n\n【10】Magnetic-Resonance Imaging (MRI)： Left ventricular wall， forearm anlddside wall myocardial necrosis， and pericardial effusion .\n\n【11】Coronary Computed Tomography (CT) and three-dimensional reconstruction： The left main stem originates from the right coronary sinus and walks between the aorta and pulmonary artery .\n\n【12】Note： The arrow points to the diffuse T2W1 signal increase of left ventricular partition， anterior wall， side wall， prompt acute myacardial infarctian anteriar CK： Creatine Kinase， CK-MB： Creatine Kinase Isoenzymes-MB， BNP： Pre-Brain Natriuretic Peptide， cTnl： Troponin l.\n\n【13】Note： The coronary artery indicated by the arrow runs between the artora and pulmonary arteries.\n\n【14】Coronary angiography： About 40% stenosis can be seen in the left main stem . Diagnosis： AAOCA. 2 months later， he went to a specialized hospital due to recurrence of syncope after exercise， Echocardiography showedLeftVentricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) 39%. Three days later ECMO supports descending coronary artery exploration and left coronary artery correction surgery. During the operation， we saw the patient’s coronary artery anatomy is that the left and right coronary arteries originate from the right coronary sinus， with a single opening about 3 mm， and the left coronary artery is intramural walking. It goes up posteriorly beyond the junction of the left and right coronary valves to the left coronary siniis.\n\n【15】His LVEF did not improve significantly during the 4-month follow-up due to hadn't stayhome but went to school and did exercise. Otherwise the echocardiography showed pulmonary hypertension. (Pulmonary artery systolic pressure was about 52mmHg). Eight months after the operation， he died of lung infection and heart failure.\n\n【16】Discussion\n\n【17】The most likely to cause sudden death type of AOLCA is sandwich deformity\". However， most domestic AOLCA studies on children are small sample studies . The clinical manifestations are not specific， and it is easy to be misdiagnosed as endocardial elastofibrosis ， myocarditis， etc. The detection methods of coronary artery origin abnormalities include： exercise test， echocardiography， intravascular ultrasound， coronary angiography， CT angiography， cardiac MRI and so on.\n\n【18】Regarding treatment， the guidelines for the management of adult congenital heart disease published by the American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) recommend surgical intervention by this case.\n\n【19】The incidence of AOLCA is low. Clinical workers have little clinician experience. The clinical manifestations are not specific， which caused confusing with common diseases and frequently-occurring diseases， and is easy to cause misdiagnosis and missed diagnosis. This child has a left coronary artery anomaly originating from the right coronary sinus， with one exit， and intramural walking. It is a dangerous coronary artery abnormality. He has a history of syncope after exercise， accompanied by incontinence，presented with acute heart failure and respiratory failure this time. CMR suggested a combined old myocardial infarction. And myocardial damage occurred within 12 h. Such reports are relatively rare . This child is also the first case of coronary artery exploration + left coronary artery correction with ECMO support.\n\n【20】The main cause of death of the child is not strict immobilization and has not early attention to abnormal post-exercise syncope. This case shows coronary artery origin abnormalities can cause serious adverse effects such as acute myocardial damage， acute heart failure， acute respiratory failure， affect heart function， even death. Accordingly， coronary angiography， CT angiography， and CMR should be actively used to determine whether there are abnormal origins， intramural walking or between the aorta and pulmonary artery walking and myocardial ischemia. Once the diagnosis is confirmed， timely operation should be carried out to prevent irreversible damage occur .", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 10:40:49", "endTime": "2024/09/24 10:41:05", "cost": 15.744}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:34", "update_time": "2024-09-23 18:41:05", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 18:40:48"}

Cardiac amyloidosis has multiple subtypes， the most frequent forms in our country (Spain) being primary amyloidosis due to light chain deposits (LA-CA) and transthyretin deposit CA (ATTR-CA). The latter has an inherited variant (ATTRh) and a mutant or senile variant (ATTRwt).\n\n【4】We present a curious report of two octogenarian sisters who were independently diagnosed in2019 with ATTR-CA by two different cardiologists； the 87-year-old debuted at this age with a clinical scenario of Heart Failure (HF) with preserved ejection fraction and left ventricular hypertrophy(interventricular septum： 20 mm， left ventricular ejection fraction-LVEF 64%， left atrium volume35 mL/m²， NT-ProBNP 1737 pg/mL)， with a pseudoinfarction pattern (Q image) in V1to V3 in the electrocardiogram . An infiltrative deposit disease was suspected， because of this severe degree of ventricular hypertrophy. The younger sister， 82 year-old， had a previous history of syncope with mild conduction disorders in the electrocardiogram (left anterior hemiblock)， and required implant of a pacemaker several years ago because of atrial fibrillation with slow ventricular rate . She subsequently developed congestive HF with reduced ejection fraction (LVEF20%， left atrium volume 39 mL/m’， NT-pro BNP 16，246 pg/mL). Echocardiogram also showed a severe left ventricular hypertrophy， being interventricular septum 21 mm . A diagnosis of transthyretin deposit was made in both sisters， according to Gillmore et al. ： Grade 3 uptake of Perugini's classification in bone scan ?mTc-DPD ， and exclusion of AL-CA by demonstrating the absence of a monoclonal peak in the serum and/or urine immunofixation test. Blood samples from the two sisters were sent for genetic study， and conventional sequencing by Sanger's method indicated that the TTR gene sequence was normal in both. This was quite a surprise， as we thought we were facing a clear case of ATTRh， and the absence of genetic alterations in the sequencing of the TTR gene showed two matching cases in the same ATTRwt family.\n\n【5】Reviewing this case， we would like to point out several essential aspects of ATTR-CA：\n\n【6】Variability in clinical presentation ofthe disease： TTR-CAcan presented with severeleft ventricular hypertrophy， HF with preserved ejection fraction ， HF with reduced ejection fraction， and conduction disorders leading to syncope and need for a pacemaker . Al of them due to the progressive deposit of Amyloid material by transthyretin in the different cardiac structures(myocardium and conduction system).\n\n【7】The false belief that we are facing a low-prevalence disease. This case shows it is necessary to test this diagnostic entity in certain patient profiles， because the prevalence is not low. Even in the same family， several sporadic cases of the disease (ATTRwt) may appear， as occurred in our report. There are already published series where up to 5% to 13% of patients with HF with preserved ejection fraction  and up to 11% with HF with reduced ejection fraction have Amyloid deposit per transthyretin.\n\n【8】The need for a genetic study to sequence the TTR gene for pathogenic variants.

Although usually diagnosed in the first decades of life， it is possible that manifestations are not recognized at older ages. This article aims to report the case of a 70-year-old female patient， admitted to the emergency department with delirium， and who， after ruling out organic causes， was diagnosed with a rare mitochondrial syndrome. The detailed evaluation of the case allowed the diagnosis of MELAS syndrome， with symptoms manifesting late. In this report， the importance of possible differential diagnoses regarding encephalopathies of atypical course is highlighted， even in patients with advanced ages.\n\n【2】Keywords： MELAS； Delirium； Mitochondrial Diseases； Older adults\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】MELAS (Mitochondrial myopathy， Encephalopathy， Lactic Acidosis and Stroke) syndrome is one of the most common mitochondrial diseases， although its prevalence is rare (0.18 cases per100，000 population/year) . There are reports of more than 30 pathogenic variants related to this syndrome， as the m.3243A>G mutation is known as the most commonly found. It is a mitochondrial DNA pathogenic variant， and maternal relatives of patients with the syndrome may carry this mutation without showing symptoms . The prognosis of patients with MELAS is quite unfavorable， with rapid and aggressive progression； thus， patients hardly ever reach advanced ages and only 1% to 6% of cases occur after the age of 40 years .\n\n【5】Especially for patients at older ages， MELAS syndrome manifests as cumulative multi-organ disease with broad manifestations that are relatively common to agingpopulation including stroke-like episodes， dementia， hearing impairment， muscle weakness and diabetes. Such impairments， evaluated separately， would hardly be attributed to a rare genetic syndrome， especially in an older patient and could possibly be undiagnosed. Similarly， the syndrome may course with cognitive deterioration in different degrees， and its manifestations may mimic an acute confusion condition， that could be attributed to other cause or even and undefined etiology .\n\n【6】This case report aims to describe a patient with an initial clinical manifestation of delirium， which， after extensive investigation， led to a late diagnosis of MELAS syndrome. Previous cognitive alterations， history of familial migraine，neuroimaging exams， and a positive family history with the pathogenic variant m.3243A>G helped in the diagnostic conclusion.\n\n【7】Case Presentation\n\n【8】A 70-year-old white female patient was admitted to the emergency room with a history of psychomotor agitation and worsening of disorientation that began the day before admission. Her comorbidity history was referred by a son and consisted of systemic arterial hypertension， type II diabetes mellitus not properly controlled， visual and auditory impairment since the age of 50， and no history of smoking. During her medical history， it was also reported that， approximately a year before， the patient had a stroke， manifested with aphasia and transient motor deficit (right hemiparesis). Since then， she had been apathetic， with periods of disorientation and psychomotor agitation， associated with tonic-clonic seizures. She presented a neuroimaging exam that showed previous ischemic insults. In the first 24 h of hospitalization， the patient presented with decreased level of consciousness associated with generalized tonic-clonic seizures， with gasping respiratory pattern， being submitted to orotracheal intubation in the emergency room and referred to the intensive care unit for neurological monitoring and hemodynamic control.\n\n【9】During the investigation， Computed Tomography (CT) of the skull demonstrated cortical-subcortical hypodensities in the left temporal and occipital region with liquor density， suggesting encephalomalacia due to a previous ischemic event， and another temporal cortical-subcortical hypodensity on the right， suggesting another area of ischemia. Laboratory testing showed elevated blood glucose， with no evidence of bacterial infection and negative viral serological markers. Electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm and repolarization alteration； transthoracic echocardiogram with preserved cardiac function and mild mitral insufficiency； doppler of carotids showed no obstructions. Sedation was discontinued a couple of days after but the patient did not recover consciences.\n\n【10】Furthermore， an electroencephalogram was performed， which showed no epileptiform seizure pattern， as well as a control CT scan of the skull， with no evidence of acute ischemic or hemorrhagic events. Thus， it was decided to collect Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF)， which showed elevated lactate (58 mg/dl-RV： 9-19 mg/dl)， with no other alterations. During hospitalization， the patient underwent skull Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (MRI) due to clinical worsening， demonstrating an alteration in the cortical-subcortical intensity of the temporal lobes，hyperintense on T2 and FLAIR， notably to the left. Contrast enhancement in the thalamic capsular vascular lesion， on the left. Lentiform nucleus has hypersignal on FLAIR， hypoxic-ischemic lesion， dilatation of the ventricular system . Cranial arterial and venous angioresonance was also performed， which showed no evidence of aneurysmal dilatation or stenosis.\n\n【11】Regarding clinical evolution， the patient underwent treatment for subsequent infectious conditions， required dialysis therapy with recovery of renal function and， due to the indispensability of mechanical ventilation without neurological recovery， needed a tracheostomy. Approximately 90 days after admission， the patient evolved with refractivity to the instituted treatments， with progressive clinical worsening and death in the intensive care unit.\n\n【12】Discussion\n\n【13】Genetic diseases involving pathogenic variants are more prevalent in youngpatients， rarely developing symptoms after the age of 65. Among the diseases caused by pathogenic variants， one of the most frequent is MELAS syndrome. The manifestations of MELAS are typical in childhood， with a prevalence of 65% to 76% of affected individuals presenting symptoms until the age of 20 . Although the onset of MELAS manifestations is more typical in young patients， this case report shows a later onset of symptoms.\n\n【14】MELAS syndrome is a neurodegenerative disease caused by the decreased ability of cells to produce sufficient energy in the form of Adenosine 5'-Triphosphate (ATP) . Dysfunctional mitochondria are unable to generate enough ATP to meet the energy needs of various organs，particularly those with high energy demands， including the nervous system， skeletal and cardiac muscles，kidneys， liver， and endocrine system .\n\n【15】MELAS involves multiple organ involvement with diverse clinical manifestations， including neurological symptoms， lactic acidosis， myopathy， recurrent headaches， hearing impairment， psychiatric， renal， gastrointestinal， and endocrine disorders . Symptoms develop when the metabolic demands of the body exceed the available energy supply of the defective mitochondria . The most com manifestations of MELAS include altered level of consciousness， stroke-like e episodes， focall or generalized1 seizures， migraine headaches， and dementia. Stroke-like episodes are so described because they do not present an ischemic etiology， and the affected areas do not correspond to the classical vascular distributions .\n\n【16】The reported patient initially presented with two important clinical manifestations： Acute onset disorientation and psychomotor agitation， attributed at first to a delirium possibly superimposed on a previous neurodegenerative condition. Acute changes in the emergency department have a high prevalence in patients over 65years of age. Commonly， these patients are rashly diagnosed with delirium， and the organic cause is often not identified. Delirium is defined as an acute neuropsychiatric syndrome marked by cognitive and behavioral changes. It comprises a brain dysfunction， with multifactorial etiology， of abrupt onset and fluctuating course. Delirium is a common disease， but 55% to 80% of cases are not recognized and are not documented by the clinical team treating the disease . Initially， the management involves identifying several etiologies， such as： Psychoactive drugs， hydroelectrolytic alterations， severe pain， hypoxemia， severe anemia， infections， and significant immobility .\n\n【17】In the present case， after excluding the most common etiologies that trigger delirium， the presence of clinical manifestations， such as seizures， decreased level of consciousness and behavioral changes， associated with a history of recurrent headaches， psychiatric alterations and maternal family history， and neuroimaging exams， stimulates clinical reasoning focused on differential and uncommon diagnoses of other encephalopathies. After a joint investigation of the clinical， family， laboratory， and imaging history， it is concluded to be a rare mitochondrial syndrome.\n\n【18】As a genetic disease with hereditary characteristics， MELAS is a progressive neurodegenerative disease associated with polygenic mutations， inherited from the mother， of the mitochondrial DNA. Thus， a rigorous review of family history is of great importance， especially in relation to maternal antecedents， including a history of migraine， exercise intolerance， and psychiatric alterations. In the clinical case reported here， the family history proved to be of enormous magnitude to hypothesize MELAS as a possible diagnosis.\n\n【19】As well as the clinical history， the radiological examination is extremely important to aid in the diagnosis， since the lesions are similar to stroke in the temporal， occipital and parietal regions. The affected areas do not correspond to the classical vascular distributions， presenting an irregular distribution， well associated with metabolic or small vessel etiology . In the reported case， neuroimaging exams showed cortico-subcortical alterations in temporal and occipital regions， on the left， and thalamus， justifying the symptoms presented， such as migraine and neuropsychiatric alterations.\n\n【20】The managementofMELAS syndromeinvolves a multidisciplinary approach， with lifestyle modification by means of diet and physical exercises， in addition to symptomatic treatment and treatment of complications. There is no drug therapy approved by the Food and Drug Administration or therapeutic protocol established to date for the treatment of MELAS . Affected individuals need to be evaluated globally， with assessment of the organs most affected by the disease and should be followed up at regular intervals to monitor progression， with screening for possible complications . One of the most important behavioral measures is smoking cessation since it can worsen mitochondrial dysfunction . Among the treatments， supplements， such as antioxidants and cofactors， are being used in MELAS syndrome based on limited clinical trials， for example， L-arginine and citrulline， which aim to increase the availability of nitric oxide， leading to an improvement in vasodilation and， consequently， blood flow . More studies are still needed to effectively establish a drug therapy that can interfere with the prognosis and improve the quality of life of patients with MELAS， especially those with a later diagnosis.\n\n【21】The case reported here demonstrates the importance of screening and initial evaluation of older patients with delirium or acute encephalopathy， reinforcing the concept of the need to perform a detailed review of the clinical history of these patients， including family history. It is emphasized the importance of expanding the range of differential diagnoses when the most prevalent and common etiologies are discarded or when the evolution of the case presents clinical manifestations that do not confirm the context of delirium. The present report also emphasizes that MELAS disease， although rare， may be diagnosed in older patients and it is possible that the incidence is underestimated due to underdiagnosis.\n\n【22】Conclusion\n\n【23】Acute neurological conditions are highly prevalent in patients over 65 years of age in the emergency department； therefore， detecting their etiology might be challenging. In cases that present with unusual clinical manifestations and atypical evolution， less prevalent diagnostic hypotheses should be considered. Mitochondrial pathologies， although more common in young people， can mimic an acute neurological condition in older adults. Although there is an unfavorable and progressive evolution， without therapeutic possibility， the diagnosis of MELAS is fundamental for the planning of patient comfort care and support in the face ofunfavorable evolution. The diagnosis also allows genetic counseling of family members and its better recognition and investigation in future studies，contributing to the understanding of the causative mechanisms of this disease and therapeutic possibilities.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 10:17:51", "endTime": "2024/09/24 10:18:01", "cost": 9.486}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:34", "update_time": "2024-09-23 18:18:01", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 18:17:51"}

The principal outcome measures were pain score， evaluated with the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS)， and the Oswestry Disability Index(ODI) at three different time points：Baseline， at 2 weeks after the procedure 2-weeks and at 6-month after. The degree of achievement was determined as a reduction in NRS of2 50% or an ODI reduction of≥ 40%.\n\n【4】Results： At 2 weeks and 6 months after the procedure， retrospectively， NRS was found to be significantly reduced (P<0.05) in both groups， but no significant differences were found between the groups. It was also found that ODI scores is sign ificantly lower in treatment groups when compared to the control， but the difference between the groups were not significant. At the 6 months after procedure， 12 patients (75.0%) and 14 patients (77.8%) were found to have decrease in the NRS by more than 50% among the 7-min group and 15-min group， respectively， while there was no significant difference in the percentage of patients who had decrease in ODI more than 40% between the two groups (P=0.243).\n\n【5】Conclusion： ID-PRF was shown to have significant efficacy in management of CDNP regardless of the duration of ID-PRF (7 min vs. 15 min).\n\n【6】Introduction\n\n【7】Chronic neck pain is a common cinical problem among general population  and reported prevalence between 14% and 41% . Chronic neck pain can be induced by anatomical predisposition， including facet joint irregularity， disc pathology， neck muscle and ligament . The prevalence of zygapophyseal joint pain was 55% and discogenic pain was 16% . Among chronic neck pain， discogenic neck pain could be caused by abnormal nerve in growth into annular and the expression of pain nociceptors . Several methods were introduced to treat discogenic neck pain.\n\n【8】Percutaneous radiofrequency treatment was first introduced in the 1980s  and distinguished into two type of radiofrequency： Continuous radiofrequency stimulation  and Pulsed Radiofrequency (PRF)  stimulation by means of an electromagnetic arena. PRF consists of a high-intensity electromagnetic current delivered in pulses， allowing heat to disperse through the latent period so that neurodestructive heats cannot be extended .\n\n【9】It is reported that the Intradiscal PRF (ID-PRF) is applied to an in lumbar discogenic pain. It has been proposed that percutaneous ID-PRF may reduce nociceptive input from the intervertebral disc . In adding， numerous studies have related the beneficial effects of ID-PRF on discogenic low back pain .\n\n【10】While the application of percutaneous jellified ethanol， platelet-rich plasma， and inter laminar epidural injection in cervical discogenic neck pain were reported ， the study on ID-PRF has not yet been reported. The only one case of ID-PRF treatment was reported .\n\n【11】A high-voltage and long-duration PRF， which is assumed to be 15min to 20 min is recommended.\n\n【12】The present analysis aim to investigate the effect of the application percutaneous monopolar ID-PRF in the management of chronic discogenic neck pain.\n\n【13】Methods\n\n【14】A total of 34 patients with treatment conducted between January2018 and September 2020 were included in this retrospective study. The patients were allocated into groups based on the duration of the procedure they underwent： 7 min or 15 min.\n\n【15】The studyprocedure waspermitted by the Institutional Review Board. The inclusion criteria were： 1) axial neck pain； 2) single level； 3) sitting neck pain； 4) single level degenerative disc in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)； 5) positive response to provoking discogram  and 6) neck pain that had not responded to conventional handlings (pharmacotherapy and physical therapy) inside the prior 4 to 6 weeks. The exclusion criteria were as follows： 1) Neck pain induced by pressure on the paraspinal muscles；2) cervical herniated intervertebral disc； 3) cervical spinal stenosis； 4) facet origin pain； 5) myelopathy； 6) pain due to infection； and 7) bleeding tendency.\n\n【16】Data on age， sex and length of pain of each patient was contained. The primary outcome measures were the pain score using the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS)， and the Oswestry Disability Index(ODI) measured before， at the 2 weeks after and 6-months after the treatment.Degree of achievement was described as a decrease in NRS of 2 50% or an ODI reduction of 2 40%.\n\n【17】Procedure\n\n【18】All patients were intravenously injected with antibiotics in prior to the procedure. The ID-PRF， a single needle placement procedures performed on the patients laying on the fluoroscopy table in the supine position with pillow under their neck. The disc level for the treatment was selected based on the findings ofMR\n\n【19】Betadine was used for the disinfection of the skin entry site. With fluoroscopy， the target disc was found using metal indicator. The skin entry site was infiltrated with 1% lidocaine. With second and third digits of left hand second， the trachea and esophagus medially displaced. On fixed two digits， the PRF needle (NeuroTherm， 20 G，15cm length， 20 mm active tip) was percutaneously progressed and was located on the affected disc with an anteroposterior view . In fluoroscopiclateral view，PRF needle advanced to posterior margin of affected disc . Anteroposterior and lateral fluoroscopic projections were used to confirm whether the introduced needle was properly placed.\n\n【20】We applied ID-PRF with a frequency of 5 Hz， a pulse width of5 ms， the amplitude of 60V， and a extreme heat of 42°C， for either patients with 7 min or 15 min treatment by means of the NT1100generator (NeuroTherm， Middleton， MA， USA). After the end of the procedure， the PRF needle was removed after procedure and the patients were transferred to the recovery room.\n\n【21】Wilcoxon signed-rank exam was used in assessments of increase in NRS and ODI scores before and after the procedure. A statistical significance was established when P-value is <0.05.\n\n【22】Results\n\n【23】Thirty-four patients were included in this study were divided into two groups based on the duration ofPRF application (7-min group； 16patients. 15-min group； 18patients). Data on the patient character are presented in Table 1. It is found that NRS and ODI were significantly reduced in a time-dependent manner in both groups . Mean post-treatment pain scores were found to be significantly lower (P=0.000) in both groups at the follow-up period of 2 weeks and 6 months， respectively， while the variances among the groups were insignificant . The ODI scores were also significantly reduced when compared to that of baseline scores； however， the differences between the groups were insignificant . At the6-months follow-up examination， 12 patients (75.0%) in the 7-min group and 14 patients (77.8%) in the 15-min group were shown to have decrease by more than 50% in their pain score (P=0.17). No significant difference was found between the degree of reduction ODI score in each groups (P=0.24) .\n\n【24】Table 1： Summary of patient's characteristics.\n\n| N=34  | 7 min (n=16)  | 15 min (n=18)  | P value  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Age (yrs)  | 54.2±7.3  | 56.4±6.7  | 0.58  |\n| Gender (M：F)  | 7：09  | 10：08  | 0.97  |\n| Pain Duration (Months)  | 10.2±14.7  | 12.7±10.2  | 0.29  |\n| Procedure  |  |  |  |\n| C45  | 4(25%)  | 3(16.7%)  | 0.51  |\n| C56  | 10(62.5%)  | 13(72.2%)  |  |\n| C67  | 2(12.5%)  | 2(11.1%)  |  |\n\n【26】Table 2： Changes of Numeric Rating Score scale (NRS) and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI).\n\n| N=34  | Pain  | Pre-treatment  | Post 2 weeks  | Post 6 months  | P value  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 7 min  | NRS  | 7.4±0.9  | 3.1±1.7  | 2.8±1.4  |  |\n| (n=16)  | OD  | 55.1+4.7  | 24.6±7.9  | 24.7±7.1  |  |\n| 15 min  | NRS  | 7.3±0.8  | 2.7±1.9  | 2.4±1.2  | 0  |\n| (n=18)  | ODI  | 55.6±5.0  | 23.2±8.4  | 23.2±6.9  |  |\n| Pvalue  |  | 0.71  | 0.92  | 0.74  |  |\n\n【28】Table 3： The number who obtained the percentage improvement of pain at post-procedure 6 months.\n\n| N=34  | Reduction  | 7-min (n=16)  | 15 min (n=18)  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| NRS  | <49  | 4(25.0%)  | 4(22.2%)  |\n| NRS  | 250  | 12(75.0%)  | 14(77.8%)  |\n| NRS  | Pvaue  | 0.172  |  |\n| ODI  | <39  | 5(31.3%)  | 4(22.2%)  |\n| ODI  | 240  | 11(68.7%)  | 14(77.8%)  |\n| ODI  | P value  | 0.243  |  |\n\n【30】No severe problems， including epidural hemorrhage， dural or neural damages， or pollution， were noted in any group.\n\n【31】Discussion\n\n【32】The outcomes of this report show that significant pain relief can be achieved with either 7-min or 15-min application of ID-PRF. There was little reported to ID-PRF treatment for chronic discogenic neck pain. Only one case ID-PRF had achieved decreased the numeric rating scale at 3-months follow up .\n\n【33】Chronic neck pain occurred from severe factors， such as cervical intervertebral， facet join， atlantoaxial joints and neck muscle， etc. Cervical intervertebral disc was innervated sinuvertebral nerve by posterior vertebral plexus， anterior vertebral plexus， and vertebral nerve . If degenerative change occurred in the disc， disc innervating nerve potentially extending into the internal third of the annulus fibrosus and the nucleus . It was can cause discogenic neck pain.\n\n【34】The mechanism of ID-PRF is not fully understood. It could be possibly suggested that ID-PRF may reduce nociceptive input derived from the intervertebral disc and the induce of a cellular and immune response and inhibit evoked synaptic activity . Park et al.， reported intradiscal pulsed radiofrequency was effective in patient with chronic discogenic low back pain .\n\n【35】There was difficult to diagnosis discogenic pain . In our study，pre-procedure provocative cervical discogram was performed. Cervical discogram was useful methods for diagnosis cervical discogenic neck pain . Inclusion criteria of this study were not guaranteed pure disco-origin pain. It was not easy to distinguish discogenic pain from facet pain，or muscle/ligament pain， etc.\n\n【36】This study is limited in that it has small sample size and the lacks control group. We may also not fully full rule out the pain from facet pain or muscle pain. Evaluation with MRI should be not conducted in follow-up to assess the potential of ID-PRF to prevent or to aggravate disc degeneration.\n\n【37】It is concluded that the application of ID-PRF is efficient for the conduct of discogenic neck pain regardless of ID-PRF application duration (7-min vs. 15-min).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 11:45:19", "endTime": "2024/09/24 11:45:30", "cost": 10.431}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:34", "update_time": "2024-09-23 19:45:30", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 19:45:19"}

It is the most common Central Nervous System(CNS) malformation compatible with life， affecting approximately 1 to 2 per 1，000 live births worldwide，represented by the lack of dorsal closure of the vertebrae which lack neural arches and may be located at any level along the spine. These defects can be classified into closed when the spinal defect is skin covered (spina bifida occulta) or open (spina bifida aperta) when the lesion site is not covered by skin and involves abnormalities of the meninges and/or the spinal cord (meningocele/myelomeningocele).\n\n【7】This condition results in significant morbidity and lifelong disability， making early diagnosis and intervention crucial for optimizing outcomes.\n\n【8】Prenatal detection of spina bifida aperta has evolved significantly over the years， with advancements in imaging techniques allowing for accurate and timely diagnosis. Ultrasonography， particularly during the first trimester， has emerged as a valuable tool in the antenatal evaluation of fetal anomalies. High-resolution transabdominal and transvaginal ultrasound approaches enable detailed visualization of the developing neural tube， facilitating the identification of structural abnormalities associated with spina bifida aperta.\n\n【9】In recent years， these approaches have been increasingly utilized in first-trimester ultrasound examinations， offering the possibility of early intervention and improved outcomes. Additionally， histopathological examination of terminated pregnancies provides valuable insights into the underlying pathology and helps confirm the ultrasound findings. This integrated approach allows a better assessment of the condition， aiding in counseling and appropriate management strategies. diagnosed during the first trimester in order to contribute to the existing body of knowledge on this serious condition， particularly in terms of its prenatal diagnosis and associated histopathological features.\n\n【10】The combined use of these diagnostic modalities provides a comprehensive understanding of the condition， emphasizing the importance of early detection and accurate characterization for effective clinical decision-making.\n\n【11】Furthermore， this report underscores the significance of multidisciplinary collaboration between obstetricians， radiologists， and pathologists in theevaluation and management of fetal anomalies. Ultimately， improved diagnostic capabilities of spina bifida aperta can lead to enhanced prenatal counseling and better outcomes for affected pregnancies.\n\n【12】Case Presentation\n\n【13】A 27-year-old primigravida woman presented for routine prenatal care at 13 weeks of gestation. The patient had no significant family history related to neural tube defects. Transabdominal ultrasound screening was performed using a high-resolution transducer and three-dimensional ultrasound.\n\n【14】The ultrasound examination revealed a midline defect in the lumbosacral region of the fetus’s spine. A detailed assessment of the defect showed a sac-like protrusion containing cerebrospinal fluid， indicating the presence of spina bifida aperta. The visualization of the defect and the associated findings were consistent with the diagnosis of this neural tube defect.\n\n【15】To further confirm the diagnosis and obtain additional anatomical details， Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) was conducted. The MRI findings were in concordance with the ultrasound results， confirming the presence ofthe spinal defect and providing precise delineation of the associated structural abnormalities.\n\n【16】Given the diagnostic findings and after thorough counseling， the patient opted for the termination of the pregnancy. Subsequently， a histopathological examination was performed on the fetus.\n\n【17】Gross examination of the fetus revealed an open defect in the spinal column ， confirming the presence of spina bifida aperta. The defect corresponded to the previously identified midline defect observed during the ultrasound and MRI examinations.\n\n【18】Microscopic analysis of the spinal cord tissue obtained from the affected area demonstrated dysplastic changes， indicative ofabnormal development. The examination also revealed the herniation of neural elements through the defect， further confirming the diagnosis of spina bifida aperta.\n\n【19】Histological staining techniques allowed for detailed evaluation of the cellular architecture and structural changes within the spinal cord tissue. The dysplastic features included disorganized cell layers， abnormal neuronal migration， and disrupted neural connectivity. These histopathological findings provided further insight into the underlying pathology associated with spina bifida aperta.\n\n【20】The combination of the prenatal ultrasound screening， MRI， and histopathological examination provided a better understanding of the diagnosis of spina bifida aperta in this case. The initial ultrasound findings were subsequently validated by the MRI， and the histopathological examination served as definitive confirmation， providing detailed insights into the structuraland cellular abnormalities originally causing the condition.\n\n【21】Discussion\n\n【22】Open spina bifida， also known as spina bifida aperta is a neural tube defect involving the lack of closure of vertebral arches and associated meninges and/or spinal cord abnormalities. Ultrasound examination being the gold standard for the diagnosis of spina bifida aperta， represents the main imaging tool used to ascertain this diagnosis early in gestation.\n\n【23】While three-dimensional ultrasound is necessary to detect the level and the size of the defect， Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) represents a more sensitive tool， giving specific information of the defect and associated anomalies， playing an important role in ruling out differential diagnosis. Due to the advent of MRI use， it is possible today to achieve in utero treatment of fetuses with this pathology.\n\n【24】The case presented here highlights the significance of utilizing first-trimester ultrasound screening and subsequenthistopathological examination in diagnosing spina bifida aperta . This integrated approach involving imaging and histology provides more accurate diagnosis， counseling， and management decisions .\n\n【25】First-trimester ultrasound screening plays a crucial role in the prenatal diagnosis of spina bifida aperta. High-resolution transabdominal and transvaginal ultrasound techniques allow for detailed visualization of the fetal spine and identification of structural abnormalities .\n\n【26】In this case， multiple findings consistent with the characteristic features of spina bifida aperta (a midline defect in the lumbosacral region， accompaniedby2 sac-likePprotrusioncontaining cerebrospinal fluid) were detected early in gestation using a well oriented， performed and accurate first trimester ultrasound screening allowing early intervention and appropriate management planning.\n\n【27】To validate the ultrasound findings and obtain additional anatomical details， MRI was performed confirming the presence of the spinal defect and providing precise delineation of the associated structural abnormalities . This advanced imaging tool is particularly useful in complex cases where detailed visualization and characterization of the defect are required. The integration of ultrasound and MRI imaging enhances diagnostic accuracy and aids in surgical planning if required .\n\n【28】Histopathological examination serves as a definitive confirmation of the prenatal diagnosis of spina bifida aperta. In this case， following the termination of the pregnancy， a thorough examination of the fetus was conducted . Gross macroscopic examination revealed an open defect in the spinal column ， corroborating the ultrasound and MRI findings. The size and location of the defect were carefully documented， providing important information for clinical management .\n\n【29】Microscopic analysis of the spinal cord tissue obtained from the affected area further supported the diagnosis of spina bifida aperta. Dysplastic changes， characterized by disorganized cell layers， abnormal neuronal migration， and disrupted neural connectivity， were observed . These histological findings provide valuable insights into the underlying pathological mechanisms involved in spina bifida aperta and therefore help understanding the histopathological features of the condition contributing to a better understanding of its etiology and pathogenesis .\n\n【30】The integrated1 use of first-trimester ultrasound screening and histopathological examination allows for a multidimensional evaluation of spina bifida aperta. Early detection of the condition during pregnancy enables appropriate counseling and management strategies . It provides an opportunity for parents to make informed decisions regarding the continuation of the pregnancy and prepares healthcare professionals for any potential surgical interventions or postnatal care requirements.\n\n【31】Moreover， the combined expertise and collaborative input of obstetricians， radiologists， and pathologists is crucial in the complete evaluation and management of spina bifida aperta thus these specialties ensure accurate diagnosis， facilitate multidisciplinary discussions， and optimize patient care.\n\n【32】This case report emphasizes the importance of integrating efficient first-trimester ultrasound screening and histopathological examination in the diagnosis of spina bifida aperta . This comprehensive approach enhances prenatal care and contributes to improved outcomes for patients affected by spina bifida aperta. Further research and advancements in diagnostic techniques will continue to improve our understanding and management of this complex congenital condition.\n\n【33】Conclusion\n\n【34】In conclusion， theelpresentedcaseIreport highlights the significance of combining first-trimester ultrasound screening and histopathological examination in diagnosing spina bifida aperta allowing more informed decision-making， and optimized patient care.\n\n【35】Indeed， early detectionduring pregnancyyenables timely interventions and counseling\n\n【36】Continued research and advancements in diagnostic techniques will further enhance our understanding and improve outcomes for individuals affected by spina bifida aperta.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 10:22:46", "endTime": "2024/09/24 10:25:47", "cost": 181.167}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:34", "update_time": "2024-09-23 18:25:47", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 18:22:46"}

Excellent outcomes and the preservation of renal function were obtained through an arteriographic study of the right renal vessel combined with coil embolization of the tributary artery branch. Renal artery embolization is an effective and safe treatment in expert hands even in giant arteriovenous malformations.\n\n【2】Keywords： Renal vascular malformations； Arteriovenous malformation； Coil embolization； Endovascular management\n\n【3】Key Note Message\n\n【4】Renal arteriovenous malformations are rare vascular anomalies with heterogeneous manifestations， but can have significant morbidity ifunrecognized and untreated. The management oflarge lesions can be challenging. We present a case of a giant arteriovenous malformation that was successfully and minimally invasively treated by embolization， allowing preservation of the renal uinit.\n\n【5】Introduction and Background\n\n【6】Renal vascular malformations are conditions that involve renal veins and arteries and include Arteriovenous Malformations (AVM) and Arteriovenous Fistulas (AVF). They may be acquired， congenital， or idiopathic .\n\n【7】Congenital arteriovenous malformations are characterized by abnormal communication between the renal arterial and venous systems， and they are typically diagnosed in the third or fourth decade oflife . They are thought to represent focal spontaneous failures of vascular development occurring during the first trimester of pregnancy . The right kidney is affected more frequently than the left one， and women are three times more likely to be diagnosed with a renal AVM than men 5.\n\n【8】Three types of congenital renal AVM can be distinguished based on the vessel architecture： The angiomatous type， which is characterized by a single large artery feeding multiple interconnecting distal branches； the cirsoid type， the most common， with multiple arteriovenous interconnecting varix-like vascular communications； and the aneurysmal or cavernosaltype， which is more common in elderly patients， occurring typically from a pre-existing arterial aneurysm which has eroded into an adjacent vein .\n\n【9】Acquired arteriovenous fistulae resulting from instrumentation or kidney surgery are the most prevalent kind of renal vascular abnormalities. Additionally， they could be caused by pyelonephritis， renal-cell carcinoma， or blunt or penetrating trauma .\n\n【10】Clinical manifestations of kidney vascular lesions are varied， and they range from asymptomatic presentation， flank or back pain ， hematuria， which is the most common presentation ， abdominal mass ， hypertension ， and high output heart failure . Ifleft undiagnosed and untreated， these lesions may result in considerable morbidity and mortality .\n\n【11】The ideal course oftreatment can be chosen after extensive clinical evaluation and non-invasive imaging and angiographic studies. The preferred initial diagnostic technique for assessing the kidneys is ultrasonography. On Computed Tomography (CT) imaging， AVM appear as masses of vascular density with dilated draining renal veins. The best method for displaying the precise vascular anatomy of a renal vascular abnormality is still angiography， which can define the main arterial supply， the presence of a nidus， the size of the arteriovenous shunt and venous drainage .\n\n【12】Surgical treatment of these anomalies has been replaced by endovascular embolization， which is considered the procedure of choice， because it allows occlusion of the vascular lesion with preservation of the unaffected renal parenchyma.\n\n【13】We present a clinical case， imaging studies and management related to a patient with a giant congenital right renal AVM that was treated with endovascular embolization.\n\n【14】Case Presentation\n\n【15】The case of a 51-year-old woman with no significant medical history other than recurrent Urinary Tract Infection (UTI) is presented.\n\n【16】An ultrasound was requested during follow-up of her urological pathology， and it revealed a mass in the lower pole of the right kidney with a longitudinal axis of approximately 4 cm. It had an irregular morphology and a partially calcified， echogenic wall. Doppler study revealed that it was a vascular structure. The rest of the examination and blood and urine tests were normal. The patient did not report back pain， hematuria or other symptoms derived from the lesion described. arteriovenous malformation was evident occupying the entire lower third of the kidnev. The malformation measured 42 mm x22 mmx26 mm and was dependent on an inferior polar artery of hilar origin.\n\n【17】After careful discussion of the case with the local staffand with the patient， the decision was to perform angiography and embolization of the lesion under local anesthesia by interventional radiologists.\n\n【18】Catheterization of the right femoral artery and a selective arteriography of the right kidney were performed with a 7F curved guide catheter， revealing that the inferior polar artery was feeding the aneurysmal sac.\n\n【19】Endovascular treatment was successfullyperformed by deposition of small caliber fibrous micro-coils until complete occlusion of the aneurysmal sac and nutritional artery .\n\n【20】The patient remained in the hospital ward for 24 h and was discharged with no immediate complications and with stable renal function.\n\n【21】An abdominal CT scan performed 1 month after the procedure showed the embolization material correctly positioned， with no recanalization of the vascular malformation and good perfusion of the remaining renal parenchyma . Serum creatinine was normal (0.9 mg/dL). The CT scans at 3- and 6-months follow-up show no changes.\n\n【22】Discussion\n\n【23】Renal arteriovenous malformations are rare vascular anomalies with.heterogeneousmanifestations.Thieepatient may remain asymptomatic， and AVM are frequently diagnosed incidentally on imaging studies performed for a different reason . The most Computed tomography angiography was requested. A right common symptom is hematuria， which can even be massive  and other symptoms include flank pain， hypertension， headache or congestive heart failure .\n\n【24】Although selective renal arteriography is the test of choice for the detailed investigation of vascular architecture and hemodynamic parameters of AVM， CT angiography quite reasonably for the diagnosis .\n\n【25】Even with large lesions， embolization is the treatment of choice and is a safe and effective approach that preserves healthy renal parenchyma. Multiple materials have been used with excellent results reported . Surgery is occasionally necessary for very large anomalies or unstable patients.\n\n【26】Follow-up after endovascular treatment for renal AVM is not well defined. The main endpoint is symptom resolution， if previously present. Furthermore， control of renal function should be performed within the first 48 h after the procedure. Initial worsening with progressive improvement is common. Blood pressure should also be monitored.\n\n【27】The imaging test of choice during follow-up is contrast-enhanced CT， which allows to assess the success of the procedure， to determine the existence of a parenchymal infarction and to evaluate the hypothetical coil migration and its consequences . There is some experience with the use of angiography during follow-up to assess parenchymal perfusion， although coils may limit image quality. Imaging tests should be performed prior to discharge and during follow-up within the first 12 months， unless new symptoms occur making earlier testing necessary .\n\n【28】Conclusion\n\n【29】Congenital renal AVM are uncommon disorders with a wide range of clinical manifestations.

When she was 18 months age old， the background of inter atrial communication was corrected. At age of 8， she presented refractory Atrial Flutter (AF)， and in December 2006 catheter ablation was performed， achieving AF reversal evolving with sinus dysfunction. In August 2007， a Maze procedure and implant of a Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (CRTP) with an epicardial approach due to recurrence of the AF (incisional) was performed In the evolution with echocardiographic controls， non-compact cardiomyopathy was diagnosed with severe dysfunction and is referred to the cardiac transplant service of our hospital for evaluation. It evolves in Functional Class I-II (FC) medicated with Enalapril， Amiodarone， Furosemide， Carvedilol， Acenocoumarol. In 2014 it presented an Ejection Fraction (EF) of 34%. In interconsultation with the EP Tech for technical control of the implantable device， its depletion(ERI) is observed and the result of the last echocardiogram shows an EF of 27% with a clear deterioration in FC. Impedance tests， sensing threshold and stimulation threshold are performed.\n\n【4】The electrocardiographic signal with narrowing of the QRS associated with resynchronization was not adequate. The optimization of the CRTP therapy with echocardiography is attempted by observing a marked improvement in echocardiographic parameters by stimulating in AAI mode； Threshold tests are performed in Biventricular stimulation mode only LV， only RV and in AAI mode. Atrial stimulation was optimal with a good threshold stimulation， in LV the threshold was raised as in RV where the threshold was 7 volts with width pulse of 0.5 msec .\n\n【5】It is considered that the patient is not responding to the CRTP and the replacement of the unit is considered the only way to resolve it because it is in Immediate Elective Replacement (ERI).\n\n【6】The DAVID study was a multicenter controlled randomized clinical trial that evaluated two modalities of cardiac stimulation in patients who received an implantable automatic defibrillator. Patients were randomized to a double-arm DDDR chamber with the range stimulation between70 to 130 beats per minute and another arm in VVI stimulation mode with a backup frequency at40 beats per minute. The results of this study showed worse evolution in terms of all-cause mortality or hospitalization for a new episode of heart failure in the DDDR arm 70 to 130， other studies reinforced the hypothesis of the benefit of the prevalence of the own rhythm over the stimulated in pacemaker patients . open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License， which permits unrestricted use， distribution， and reproductionin any medium， provided the original work The algorithms available in cardiac stimulation technology are the management of ventricular stimulation (MVP-Medtronic)， extended hysteresis of AV search (Search AV +) or combined as RHYTMIQ (Boston Sc). These modes provide atrial stimulation with ventricular support. If AV conduction is lost， the device is designed to switch to DDDR or DDD mode. Periodic driving checks are performed and， if AV driving is resumed， the device returns to AAIR or AAI mode  .\n\n【7】The implantation ofa device with intrinsic conduction promotion algorithms and operating in AAI (R) stimulation mode with VVI support during normal driving times was indicated， switching to DDD(R) mode when a conduction block is detected (RHYTMIQ/MVP). In the 24-h Holter and in serial electrocardiograms， the rhythm was stimulated in the Atrial at 100%， maintaining AV conduction with a prolonged PR interval， a correct ventricular sensing evolving with a marked clinical improvement， and despite the RBB with LHB the markers Echocardiography showed no dyssynchrony with an EF 50%.\n\n【8】Conclusion\n\n【9】The use of the algorithms developed to promote one's own rhythm， such as Search AV+， MVP， RHYTMIQ， are a tool that has proven the clinical benefit in multiple clinical trials， although the AV Search Hysteresis algorithm is sometimes insufficient， the availability of additional algorithms seeks to compensate for its limitations to allow the highest percentage of own driving； it is extremely important to know in detail the operation， and application of these algorithms， the electrocardiographic recognition of functions that can beconfused with sensing failures with alternation in stimulation cycles that are nothing other than the normal operation of an algorithm that can be very beneficial for the quality of life of complex patients such as the one presented as an example， and in others， in which unnecessary stimulation can worsen the clinical condition silently.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 11:23:13", "endTime": "2024/09/24 11:23:30", "cost": 16.71}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:34", "update_time": "2024-09-23 19:23:28", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 19:23:11"}

This chronic mental illness causes significant difficulties for the individual as well as their family， including the difficulties that may arise as a result of the symptoms， disruption of family routine， interpersonal issues between couples， its effects on social and occupational functionality， and the stigma associated with the mental illness. This case report presents the role of psychosocial interventions in the non-pharmacological management of apatient diagnosed with early-onset schizophrenia. In this scenario， the role of a psychiatric social worker is essential to enhancing the quality of life of the person with mental illness.\n\n【2】Method： The present study was undertaken with the objective of evaluating the efficacy of establishing comprehensive psychosocial interventions for person with early-onset schizophrenia. The interventions carried out with the patient and family included psychoeducation， supportive psychotherapy， addressing the expressed emotions， enhancing the support system and supportive work with family Result： Significant improvement was observed after intervention at the individual and family level.\n\n【3】Conclusion： The case study helps us understand why and how psychiatric social work interventions are important in mental health care. Interventions from psychiatric social work can improve the quality of life and health of people with long-term mental illnesses. It also empathizes with the fact that a psychiatric social worker plays a key role in the treatment of early-onset schizophrenia.\n\n【4】Keywords： Schizophrenia； Psychiatric social work interventions； Early onset\n\n【5】Introduction\n\n【6】In India， the majority of the people with schizophrenia stay with their families . Persons with severe mental illness experience significant disability in self-care， interpersonal relationship and work. The onset of mental illness in the family can be stressful . It can be crisis for the family members. They were experience high levels of burden in caring a person with severe mental illness. Family experiencing high perceived stigma in the community which in turn can affect their relationship with the affected with family member， as well as neighbors the majority of the family members could not seek help from the community due to stigma and illness parse it affects the well-being of the family and patient. Expressed emotion found to be high among these families . Expressed emotions are the strongest predictor of relapse in schizophrenia . It is also observed that family who cares for a person with mental illness experience less social support and withdraw from their regular social contacts due to their high perceived stigma . Psychoeducational and family interventions and reduce the rate of patient relapse. Interventions improve patient functioning and family well-being . Evidence based Psychiatric Social Work interventions have been found to help to enhance the level of functioning of the patient and their family members and also it may reduce the risk of relapse and improve compliance with medication .\n\n【7】The present case report is of a person with early-onset schizophrenia who was struggling with various psychosocialproblems with his family. It dealt with psychosocial intervention； a psychosocial formulation was made to accomplish with the patient and his family members. So， to demonstrate the scope， feasibility， and possible outcome of the psychosocial intervention in a case of a person with early onset of schizophrenia and associated psychosocial problems formed the background of this case report.\n\n【8】Case Presentation\n\n【9】Reason for psychiatric social work interventions\n\n【10】Psycho Social Assessment and Intervention a) Assessment ofawareness about Mental illness b) Assessment of the impact of mental illness in the family c) Assessment of the caregiver issues due to the illness d) A.ssessment ofintervention for Marital issues e) Evaluation and planning of Rehabilitation and Vocational needs Clinical history： The patient was apparently maintaining well until December 2016. In January 2017， a patient quarreled with the neighbor over a land issue. After a few days， the patient started telling caregivers that the neighbor was tryingtoharm him and was following him. Additionally， the patient also claimed that the co-workers at his workplace were talking badly about him and discussing him， which he used to cross-check with his friends. Despite the friends telling him that it was not true， the patient argued and believed that they were talking about him and plotting against him. Patient had a physical fight with them as well， following which he took leave from work and went to his hometown. After a few days， when parents inquired about his job， he got angry and assaulted them. Subsequently， when the patient went back to work， he fought again with co-workers for trying to harm him due to their suspicion， left the job， and went back home. When he was at home， he was abusive and quarreled with family upon enquiring about his job. The patient’s father’s friends informed the family that the sudden behavioral changes in the patient were probably the result of black magic by the neighbors， secondary to theland issues. Hence， it was advised to take him to the temple and the faith healer in the village. The patient's family took him to various faith healers， and he was less disturbing for a few days after such visits. Symptoms were reported to have worsened close to the full moon days. When the patient became unmanageable， his parents took him to different temples suggested by his relatives. They also involved him in religious ceremonies for a year. Though they spent around 1.5lakhs， the patient’s symptoms were fluctuating and unmanageable. During the symptomatic phase， the patient also demanded to get married because his friends got married. A few neighbors' families pushed this idea to get him married. After a few days of marriage in May 2019， the patient and his wife moved to Bengaluru for employment. Though marriage was consummated， after 3 months， there were frequent quarrels with his wife， including physical abuse. A few days later， the patient suspected his wife of having extramarital affairs. Accusing her of having extramarital affairs. Secondary to this， he used to be physically abusive to the wife. Due to this， the wife went back to her family of origin. Patient biological， social， and occupational functioning was also impaired. With these complaints， he was brought to the hospital and admitted on 8/26/2019.\n\n【11】Family environment before the onset of illness： Family routine usually starts at 6 a.m. in the morning. Mother did all household chores，including preparing meals. Father did outside household work- cleaning the ground and feeding the cattle- and after that he went to the field. All family members used to attend functions together. Every week， the family went to the temple and ate together. Father took the decisions in consultation with the rest of the family， and the family followed them. The interaction among them was cordial. The patient was contributing financially as well as in the day-to-day affairs of the family.\n\n【12】Family environment after the illness： The family routine was disrupted. Family stopped attending functions that used to happen in extended family. Routines were disrupted， and everyone appeared confused. The family environment became disorganized， with fights， disagreements， stress， and a high noise level. The brother stopped coming home regularly， the wife went back to her home， and communication within the family became need-based. The patient used to wake up late and did not engage in any family activities， except watching TV， eating， and sleeping. He also stopped going out and said nothing about his life.\n\n【13】Family dynamics\n\n【14】Boundaries： Since there were a lot of arguments， family members involved less as family. Relatives reduced visiting them. There were a lot of talks about his mental illness and that made the family to withdraw from social gatherings. However， there were a very few good neighbors and relatives who supported them. Family tried to keep the fights less and hence spoke less， and accommodated the demands of the patient. Father also started preferring to take support from extended relatives during the crisis and when the patient was unmanageable. Family had to listen to the influencing neighbors and relatives. The decision making was taken over by others. The family took all the suggestions given by others. Family got the patient married because of the influence of the neighbors and relatives.\n\n【15】Leadership and decision making-everybody took their own decisions： More confused and chaotic as the family environment kept changing with the symptoms of the patient. Majority of the decisions were taken by the younger brother and father supported it.\n\n【16】Role structure andfunctioning： Fatherperformedthe instrumental role while mother performed expressive role. Father and younger brother were the primary bread winners of the family. Father accompanied patient for the treatment everywhere and hence his role to contribute financially was affected. Nobody else took the charge of caregiving and he was tired of being with the patient. The younger brother took charge of the situation and started contributing more， mother continued to take care of the household affairs.\n\n【17】Communication： Conversation among the family members decreased. Patient communicated his needs through the mother to father. Brother and patient did not communicate at all. Patient spoke only to the mother. Both parents communicated to each other. The quarrels and arguments of the patient increased the noise level at home.\n\n【18】Reinforcement： Thetfamilyyexercised variousformI：SCof reinforcement when the family had young children. However， father used praise and support with patient to maintain self-care and hygiene. Though many times， appreciations were not said and given， acknowledgements of roles were evident.\n\n【19】Family rituals： Meeting together， talking to each other at home， visiting relatives together， eating together， celebrating festivals at home， and going for fair， were almost stopped. They also stopped visiting the temple as a family but they continued individually.\n\n【20】Cohesiveness： Wife separated from him. There were no efforts initiated to work with the marriage. Though the brother took charge of financially supporting the family， he reduced visiting them because of the fights.\n\n【21】Table 1： Psychiatric and psychosocial diagnosis.\n\n| F & Z Category  | Diagnosis  |\n| --- | --- |\n| F.20  | Schizophrenia  |\n| Z65  | Problem related to employment  |\n| Z60  | Problem related to social environment  |\n| Z60.4  | Social exclusion and rejection  |\n| Z63.0  | Problems in relation spouse with partner  |\n\n【23】Family development stage six： Family with lunching young adults .\n\n【24】Adaptive patterns and coping strategies： The whole family was not able to deal with the crisis well. They though， sought help from others， it did not help them. They had difficulties to selecting the best care for the patient. They were carried away with the demands of the patient and encouragement of neighbors in getting the patient married. They did not disclose about the mental illness to the wife’s family. Only during the admission of the patient， wife was contacted.\n\n【25】Social support system： Family had adequate primary and Tertiary support； however， secondary support was inadequate.\n\n【26】Social analysis and diagnosis\n\n【27】Patient is hailing from a family that is rooted in religious beliefs， rural background and healthy parental and sibling subsystems. Members had healthy interaction among them； they were supportive to each other， shared healthy communication and was a cohesive unit. Family had adequate rituals to be together. However， changes started seen after the patient became mentally ill. History reveals that， the interaction of family members affected， family members involved less as family and withdrawal from socializing. Family followed magico-religious beliefs and practices its hindered early treatment of the patient it's impacted the family functioning. Father started preferring to take support from extended relatives. During the crisis and when the patient was unmanageable， the family system started changing especially，the boundary system becoming diffused， leadership changing， communication pattern becoming need based， and involvement of several others in the family affairs. Family environment became， more confused， stressful， conflictual and chaotic. Illness also affected the decision-making role of the patient and the younger brother became more powerful in decision making. Father had Care giver burden role in the family. Patient also went through a marriage without disclosing about his illness that has also contributed in aggravating his condition as well as affecting the wife and marriage. The whole family was not able to deal with the crisis well， and they did not receive adequate guidance which prolonged the psychiatric consultation，impact of mental illness of the patient. The pathological family situations or disorganizations could be attributed to the impact of mental illness .\n\n【28】Psychosocial interventions\n\n【29】Goals and interyentions：\n\n【30】To establish rapport with the patient and family\n\n【31】Psychoeducation\n\n【32】Supportive psychotherapy\n\n【33】Family Intervention\n\n【34】Normalizing the family routine\n\n【35】Expressed Emotions\n\n【36】Addressed Caregiver burden\n\n【37】Pre discharge counselling\n\n【38】Intervention Offered\n\n【39】Psychoeducation： Assessed the knowledge of the patient and caregivers about etiology， treatment， and prognosis and provided information about etiology， symptoms of schizophrenia， the importance of medication， and treatment compliance. Discussed relapse and early signs of relapse. Dealing with stress today while managing a person with schizophrenia improving insight into illness handling expressed emotions and improving communication enhancing adaptive coping to deal with persistent or residual symptoms.\n\n【40】Supportive psychotherapy\n\n【41】Supportive psychotherapeutic work initiated with father who was the primary care giver.\n\n【42】Alowed ventilation enhanced his psychological strength by addressing his worries and concerns. Guidance is given about the available treatments and the patient’s recovery process. Provided a strong foundation for him. The therapist appreciated his efforts in accompanying the patient. Validated his emotional experiences brought other family members for therapy and made their roles clear in caregiving. Gave him time away from caregiving. Discussed his need for his space and routines to be normalized.\n\n【43】Family interventions\n\n【44】Normalize the family routine： discussed with and facilitated insights with the family about the disadvantages of focusing on the patient's illness as the center of their lives. The long duration of illness and its potential effect on members potential stress-related issues in family's potential perception by the patient as a burden to his family encouraged them to resume the daily routines that were present before the illness； helped them to make a daily routine that included time for leisure； celebration of festivals； birthdays； marriage ceremonies； family time and advised them to attend to the needs of other family members.\n\n【45】Addressed expressed emotions： identified criticality from the brother and father .\n\n【46】Explained the effect ofexpressed emotions on mental illness. There was discussion about the father's and brothers emotional reactions to the patient's symptoms. Validated their emotional responses and educated them about the role they play in relapses. Helped them understand these reactions as normal for such experiences. However， they needed handling because it speeds the recovery. Once they were able to relate to the patient as a person with illness， their attitude and behavior changed. We appreciated their understanding and changes.\n\n【47】Addressing the family caregiver burden： As the family belongs to a lower socioeconomic class and faces lots of financial issues， it adds to the family’s caregiver burden issues， which adds to the family’s burden. They followed the magico-religious practices and spent more than one lakh rupees on these practices. The patient's father was staying with the patient in the hospital， while other family members were less involved due to other commitments. The caregiver burden was addressed with the father， and the therapist encouraged the other family members to get involved in the patients treatment， which reduced the caregiver burden in the family.\n\n【48】Pre-discharge counselling： The emphasis was given to improving the client's treatment adherence. Previous sessions were summarized. Points on identifying signs of relapse and seeking immediate help were discussed. Support was assured to the patient and wife from the hospital through follow-up sessions. Emergency care locations were given locally. Refers to DMHP Tumkur Karnataka. Questions related to discharge were addressed.\n\n【49】Follow up (Telephonic)\n\n【50】On regular medication under supervision.\n\n【51】Patient is helping father in agriculture work family is very supportive and no expressed emotions reported\n\n【52】Wife is living with him and in laws. Communication improved and relationship improving\n\n【53】Outcome\n\n【54】Individual level： The patient showed significant improvement in the illness， communication， and relationships with his wife and brother at the time of discharge.\n\n【55】Better understanding of illness\n\n【56】Planned to join her father in farming.\n\n【57】Family Level： Psychoeducation improved the family's awareness， acceptance of the patient and his illness， and their role in supporting the patient.\n\n【58】Challenges while treating as an IP Care\n\n【59】Had difficulties psycho-educating the family because it frequently clashed with magico-religious beliefs and practices with psychiatric treatment.\n\n【60】The patient's father's receptivity was too low， and therefore the intervention went at a very slow pace in the beginning. The patient’s father was not ready to include the patient's wife during the hospitalization as she was pregnant.\n\n【61】Conclusion\n\n【62】Chronic mental illnesses have a devastating impact on the individuals as well as their families. The present case report demonstrated that psychosocial intervention could be effective in reducing the family burden， enhancing the well-being of patients as well as their families， and improving their quality of life and social functioning.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 10:44:37", "endTime": "2024/09/24 10:45:29", "cost": 52.608}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:34", "update_time": "2024-09-23 18:45:29", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 18:44:37"}

A full ED， Elental (Ajinomoto Pharmaceutical， Tokyo， Japan)， is often used for induction and maintenance therapy in CD patients， particularly in those with abdominal pain due to active CD with expansive ulcers and multiple strictures. Selenium deficiency is rare， but occurred in patients under long term management with full ED， because elental does not include selenium. A 35-year-old man had received long-term full ED treatment since the diagnosis of CD. Symptoms of curly， ulotrichous hair， recurved nails， dysarthria， visual disturbances and sensory disturbances of the limbs were exaggerated. Serum concentration of selenium was below the detection limit of 2.0 ug/dL. He was diagnosed with systemic disorder caused by selenium deficiency. With continuous administration of sodium selenite， hair and nail changes and dysarthria resolved， but visual and limb sensory disturbances remained unchanged. The present case suggests that selenium supplementation should be started when distinctive symptoms associated with selenium deficiency appear in a patient receiving long-term ED.\n\n【2】Keywords： Selenium deficiency； Full elemental diet； Crohn's disease\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Crohn’s disease (CD) is a chronic and progressive inflammatory disorder involving the entire gastrointestinal tract and is a disabling disease characterized by accumulated intestinal damage and loss of body weight . Significant body weight loss also leads to loss of the mesenteric fat pad， resulting in superior mesenteric artery (SMA) syndrome . This causes chronic， intermittent， or acute complete or partial obstruction of the duodenum .\n\n【5】The therapeutic strategies for CD comprise pharmacotherapies such as immunomodulators and anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a antibodies  and elemental diet (ED) such as Elental(Ajinomoto pharmaceutical， Tokyo， Japan) . Because ED offers a safe and effective therapy， full ED is often used for induction and maintenance therapy in patients， particularly those with abdominal pain due to active CD . However，long-term full ED with Elental can sometimes cause trace mineral deficiencies that are difficult to cover using commercially available oral materials . Among various trace mineral deficiencies， selenium deficiency can damage multiple organs， and can even cause lethal heart failure because of the rarity of this clinical entity and the difficulty of diagnosis .\n\n【6】We report herein a rare case of selenium deficiency showing distinctive physical and neurological disorders under long-term management of full ED due to repeated abdominal pain from SMA syndrome associated with CD.\n\n【7】Case Report and Discussion\n\n【8】A 35-year-old man was referred to our hospital because of slow progression ofvisual disturbance and dysarthria in March 2016. He had been diagnosed with colitis-type CD at 22 years old. Since then， the patient has been taking mesalazine and a total of 1800 mL to 2000 mL (1 Kcal/mL) of ED in a day per orally， for the treatment of CD. In 2009， a small bowel series and colonoscopy showed normal results. The patient was in clinical remission. However， because repeated and continuous abdominal pain persisted， full ED (Elental) was continued. In 2011， dysarthria emerged along with abnormalities of the hair and nails. On referral， physical examination revealed curly， ulotrichous hair， recurved and flat nails ， visual disturbance and sensory disturbance of the limbs and low body weight (height： 179 cm； weight： 58 kg； BMI： 18.1). Laboratory investigations demonstrated macrocytosis with (mean corpuscular volume (MCV)， 113.2 fL)， and， high concentration of vitamins B1 and B12. Trace mineral elements (Fe， Cu， Zn and Mn) were within normal ranges . Brain magnetic resonance imaging and angiography showed normal results. Ophthalmological examination showed that appearance of the optic discs and flicker sensitivity was normal. Visual evoked potential (VEP) testing showed that amplitude of the P100 wave was decreased during pattern stimulation. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) showed partial compression of the third portion of the duodenum， which passes between the superior mesenteric artery and aorta， and dilatation of the oral side， resulting in SMA syndrome . Clinical history， hair abnormality and macrocytosis were suggestive of selenium deficiency. Serum selenium concentration was below the detection limit of 2.0 ug/dL. Based on these findings， a systemic disorder caused by selenium deficiency was diagnosed. Sodium selenite has not been approved for the treatment of selenium deficiency in Japan.\n\n【9】Table 1： Laboratory data for CBC， biochemistry， vitamins and trace mineral elements on admission.\n\n| CBC  |  | ChE  | 408 U/L  | Vitamin A  | 203 IU/mL  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| WBC  | 4100/L  | T-Bil  | 0.6 mg/dL  | B1  | 70 ng/mL  |\n| RBC  | 402x104/uL  | BUN  | 16.8 mg/dL  | B12  | 1660 pg/mL  |\n| Hb  | 15.6 g/dL  | Cre  | 0.9mg/dL  |  | 4.2 pg/mL  |\n| Ht  | 45.50%  | UA  | 1.1mg/dL  | E  | 0.84 pg/mL  |\n| MCV  | 113.2 fL  | Glu  | 68 mg/dL  |  |  |\n| MCH  | 38.8pg  | TC  | 130 mg/dL  | Fe  | 99 pg/dL  |\n| MCHC  | 34.30%  | TG  | 50 mg/dL  | Cu  | 91 pg/dL  |\n| PLT  | 23.3x10/uL  | Na  | 140 mEg/L  | Zn  | 82 pg/dL  |\n|  |  | K  | 4.3mEg/L  | Mn  | 1.3 pg/dL  |\n| Biochemistry  |  | CI  | 104mEg/L  | Se  | ≤2.0 pg/dL  |\n| TP  | 7.1 g/dL  | Ca  | 9.6mEg/L  |  |  |\n| Alb  | 4.5 g/dL  | CRP  | 0.03 mg/dL  |  |  |\n| AST  | 23 U/L  |  |  |  |  |\n| ALT  | 33 U/L  |  |  |  |  |\n| LDH  | 180U/L  |  |  |  |  |\n| ALP  | 176U/L  |  |  |  |  |\n| V-GTP  | 21 U/L  |  |  |  |  |\n\n【11】Written consent was therefore obtained from the patient after a study protocol for sodium selenite administration was approved by Nagoya City University Ethics Committees. Intravenous administration of sodium selenite at 100 ug/day at day 1 and at200 ug/day at day 2-7， was performed， and administration at 200ug/day twice a week thereafter was continued. Six months after starting administration， curly and ulotrichous hair， nail changes and dysarthria gradually resolved ， and MCV rapidly normalized to 88.7 fL. Serum selenium concentrations gradually increased to 10.9 ug/dL (within normal limits) by December 2016. However， visual abnormalities and sensory abnormalities of thelimbs remained unchanged， and persisted.\n\n【12】Selenium deficiency causes distinct physical manifestations like hair and nails changes， and visual and limb sensory disturbances， but definitive diagnosis is difficult due to the rarity. We have reported here a rare case of selenium deficiency in a patient receiving long-term management with full ED due to repeated abdominal pain from SMA syndrome associated with CD. Continuous administration of sodium selenite resulted in partial improvement.\n\n【13】Elental° comprises amino acids， very little fat， vitamins， trace elements， and a major energy source， dextrin， but， does not include selenium . The therapeutic effects of ED such as Elental reportedly result from reductions in not only immune stimulation in the gut and intestinal permeability ， but also the concentrations of cytokines associated with mucosal inflammation . Thus， based on the usefulness of ED in CD patients， continuous full and/or half ED is frequently used for inducing and maintaining remission . On the other hand， one report described the risk of decreased concentrations of serum selenium under long-term management with full ED . In general， selenium deficiency is known to arise among 1 month to 6 years after starting total parenteral nutrition(TPN). Long-term full ED administration is also supposed to cause selenium deficiency. Clinical knowledge regarding increased risks for selenium deficiency during full ED，and signs and symptoms of selenium deficiency are generally lacking for physicians and gastroenterologists. In addition， sodium selenite has not been approved forthe treatment of selenium deficiency in Japan. Therefore， a long time may pass before a definitive diagnosis of selenium deficiency is reached and treatment is started. In the present case， 13years elapsed before treatment with sodium selenite was started.\n\n【14】Selenium is incorporated in glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and selenoprotein P as a key element， and plays an important role in the stability of the plasma membranes of neurons， erythrocytes， muscle and liver cells. GPxs act as reductases eliminating the oxidants and lipid peroxides constitutively produced in cells . Attenuation of GPxs by selenium deficiency cause cardiac andskeletal myopathy ， liver damage， erythrocyte macrocytosis ， encephalopathy ，neuropathyand nailandhair abnormalities. In particular， whitened nail beds in the hands and/or feet represent a well-known sign. In the present case， curly， ulotrichous hair was observed in addition to recurved and flat nails on the hands， but nail beds were not whitened. Based on the fact that nail changes gradually resolved soon after sodium selenite was administered， recurved and flat nails may also represent a symptom associated with selenium deficiency. Moreover， this suggested that changes to nails and hair might support definitive diagnosis of selenium deficiency and monitoring of the effects of therapeutic treatment，as the turnover of nails and hair is rapid.\n\n【15】Visual disturbance is another key symptom observed in selenium deficiency， and other neurological symptoms included dysarthria， spasticity of the extremities， ataxia and sensory disturbance. These manifestations occurred 1-12 years after starting TPN or elemental enteral nutrition . In the present case， visual disturbances and sensory disturbances of the limbs remained unchanged， and persisted. Most cases with neurological disorders receiving sodium selenite have shown no or only slight improvement . These unfavourable outcomes may mainly result from irreversible oxidative damage to the brain related to the low levels of GPxs and other selenoproteins due to selenium deficiency .\n\n【16】In conclusion， clinical history and manifestations including hair and nail changes， visual disturbances and sensory disturbances of the limbs， and macrocytosis may be useful to make a diagnosis. Since the prognoses of visual and sensory disturbances don’t seem so good， selenium should be administered rapidly before those disturbances emerge if deficiency is suspected.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 11:13:39", "endTime": "2024/09/24 11:15:17", "cost": 97.962}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:34", "update_time": "2024-09-23 19:15:15", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 19:13:37"}

The treatment of choice is the embolization of the aneurysm sac， because of its high efficacy and lower mortality. The following is a case that depicts a rare case of spontaneous rupture of an inferior pancreaticoduodenal artery aneurysm that was diagnosed during investigation of gastrointestinal symptoms. The treatment provided was endovascular embolization， with complete exclusion of the aneurysm and a good clinical course.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】E-maii\n\n【7】Male patient， 55 years old， comes to our PS referring to widespread abdominal pain and constipation； no previous pathology. Blood tests (Hb 12， neutrophils 82%， Lymphocytes 13.6%) P.A.120/75 mmHg，fc 105 bpm， diuresis 1200cc，T.C38°C， open alvus with swollen and painful abdomen. Urgent abdominal ultrasound examination is performed， which shows a non-homogeneous hypoechogenic formation in the meso-hypogastrium  and some slightly thickened intestinal loops， but it is not conclusive. We proceed to hydration and start antibiotic therapy. Due to the persistence of the symptoms and the drop in Hb values (8.4)， the patient is then subjected to a CT examination of the abdomen with intravenous contrast which shows， in the median mesenteric region， extensive retroperitoneal hematoma with evidence of aneurysm of the pancreaticoduodenal artery without active spreading in the arterial phase or in the venous phase . The patient is then urgently transferred to another hospital to undergo angiography that documents acute stenosis of the celiac tripod and aneurysmal dilatation of about 11 mm of the proximal tract of the first collateral branch of the inferior pancreatic-duodenal artery . The patient requires an endovascular treatment with embolization ofthe efference， the sac and the afference with complete exclusion of the aneurysm .\n\n【8】Discussion\n\n【9】Visceral artery aneurysms are infrequent and in order those of the splenic artery account for about 50% followed by aneurysms of the hepatic artery (20%)， mesenteric superior artery (8%) and pancreaticoduodenal artery (2%). Pancreaticoduodenal artery aneurysms are extremely rare but are probably little known because the symptoms are non-specific and heterogeneous as there may be mesogastric pain， dyspepsia， nausea， jaundice， digestive bleeding or an acute bleeding event . The incidence is the same in both sexes  and usually at diagnosis the average age is 60 years . They can be classified into true aneurysms or pseudoaneurysms； the pseudoaneurysms are secondary to trauma， infectious and inflammatory diseases  while true aneurysms are secondary to celiac trunk stenosis， atherosclerotic disease， or fibromuscular dysplasia . They have a high risk of rupture independently of the diameter . In our case， the patient presented with a true aneurysm， as there were no other possible etiologies and arteriography showed a reduction in the caliber of the celiac trunk at the origin. Aneurysmal rupture occurs with a frequency between 59 and 69% giving rise to a retroperitoneal hematoma . The diagnostic gold standard is contrast-enhanced CT . The treatment options are conventional surgical treatment and endovascular approaches . Conventional surgery is indicated in hemodynamically unstable patients and in cases of aneurysms in territories that are inaccessible to endovascular procedures or after failure of embolization . Angiographic embolization is indicated regardless of the size of the aneurysm and is the treatment of choice for its high efficacy (67% to 100%)， low mortality (2.7%)， low risk of rupture， low postoperative pain and limited post-procedural hospitalization time . In our case， after right common femoral arterial access， the selective catheterization of the celiac tripod was not possible due to emergency stenosis and therefore selective catheterization of the superior and super-selective mesenteric artery of the inferior duodenal pancreatic artery and subsequent aneurysmatic embolization was proceeded； the patient had no peri and post procedural complications.\n\n【10】Conclusion\n\n【11】Aneurysms of the duodenal pancreatic artery are rare and present with non-specific symptoms； the diagnosis， made by CT examination of the abdomen with intravenous contrast， is incidental and considering the high mortality rate they must be included among the diagnostic hypotheses in the case of a patient presenting with abdominal pain and anemia. Treatment must be prompt by selective endovascular embolization.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 10:23:30", "endTime": "2024/09/24 10:23:57", "cost": 27.04}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:34", "update_time": "2024-09-23 18:23:55", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 18:23:28"}

An early diagnosis of endometrial cancer increases proportional for correct treatment like in all cases of cancer.\n\n【2】Material and Methods： During a year a study was conducted about the value of the vaginal ultrasound of 112 woman with pre- and post-menopause bleeding making an association with the results of the histopathological analysis obtained from the uterine curettage biopsy.\n\n【3】Results： A increased thickness of the endometrium higher than 8mm was found in endometrial cancer， endometrial hyperplasia and glandular cystic hyperplasia Conclusion： There was a statistically significant association (p<0.001) between the endometrium thickness and the histopathology analysis results. The differences obtained between the thickness of the endometrium in endometrial cancer and endometrial hyperplasia have no statistically significant association (p=0.31) though there is a statistically significant association (p=0.0036) between endometrial hyperplasia and proliferative endometrium.\n\n【4】Keywords： Endometrial cancer； Ultrasound； Endometrial hyperplasia； Histopathological analysis；Diagnosis\n\n【5】Introduction\n\n【6】Female genital cancer is one of the major concerns for gynecologist form all around the world. If in the 1980s the main concern was the cervical cancer in the last 30 vears interest shifted towards the uterine cancer due to its high incidence and the difficulties for an early diagnostic and therapy， not only due to the sever comorbidities that appear in elderly woman. Today uterine cancer is the 2nd most common female genital cancer after breast cancer. Through the vears the incidence between cervical cancer and endometrial cancer changed from 9：1 to 2：1 in favor of the cervical cancer to 1：3in favor of uterine cancer. The ratio changed due to early diagnosis of precancerous lesions of the cervix and due to higher life expectancy in woman .\n\n【7】The positive diagnosis for endometrial cancer is based on the symptomatic triad： Obesity， hypertension and diabetes which is associated with bleeding in pre- and post-menopause.\n\n【8】The Gold standard for the diagnosis for endometrial cancer is the histopathological exam after diagnostic dilation and curettage.\n\n【9】During the 1980s the ultrasound examination became one of the best screening tests for endometrial cancer due to the evolution of the ultrasounds  .\n\n【10】Materials and Methods\n\n【11】A number of 112 patients in pre or post menopause which underwent and diagnostic dilation and curettage during one year were taken into account for our study. The results from the histopathological analysis were correlated with the thickness of the endometrium which was measured by ultrasound. An Voluson 730 with a 7.5 mm HZ vaginal probe was used， measurements were made for a longitudinal section. The biopsy results were classified in 6 groups after a study by Szabo .\n\n【12】1 Endometrial cancei\n\n【13】2. Endometrial hyperplasia\n\n【14】3 Glandular cystic hyperplasia\n\n【15】4 Endometrial polyp\n\n【16】5. Proliferative endometrium\n\n【17】6. Atrophic endometrium\n\n【18】We can consider this procedure like a screening method for the adenocarcinoma so we can do an early detection and adopt a good and early treatment so we can have a better prognostic .\n\n【19】Results\n\n【20】The average age in the study lot was 59 years 9 months and 3days. The cases were classified in groups according to the results of the histopathology analysis and the thickness of the endometrium.\n\n【21】Table 1 and 2 show the endometrial thickness resulting from the ultrasound examination for the six groups of histopathological results， seen from two perspectives： As a continuous numerical value(expressed with range， mean， and standard deviation) and as a rank value (expressed as six disjoint ranking intervals)， respectively.\n\n【22】The endometrial thickness was compared for the patients with endometrial cancer vs. those with endometrial hyperplasia， but statistical significance was not reached for the present sample of cases(t=1.04， df=44，p=0.31).\n\n【23】On the other hand， the endometrial thickness was significantly different for the cases with glandular cystic hyperplasia compared to the patients with a proliferative endometrium (t=3.094， df=44， p=0.0036).\n\n【24】Endometrial cancer and the hyperplasia of the endometrium were considered as pathological so we further compared the variations and changes in the endometrium separately within this group of cases and the benign ones (i.e.， endometrial polyps， proliferative activity or atrophy). Sensibility and specificity were calculated.\n\n【25】Table 3 and 4 show the results of independence statistical testing for the pathology and the benign group， respectively. The Monte-Carlo method was applied for the Chi-square test. For both groups， results proved a very significant association between the histopathological examination results and the ultrasound results regarding the endometrial changes.\n\n【26】From this study results that an endometrium with a thickness smaller than 4 mm excludes any pathological lesion in our study in9.82% of the cases. All cases of endometrial cancer had a thickness of tales 8 mm in 30.35% of the cases.\n\n【27】Statistical analysis\n\n【28】Statistical analysis was performed using the R package . Continuous variables were expressed either as minimum-maximum range with sub-intervals of values or as mean values with standard deviation； while categorical data were synthesized as counts with percentages. For the statistical tests， a 0.05 (i.e.，5%) level of significance was considered， with 0.95 (i.e.， 95%) confidence level for the estimates.\n\n【29】Table 1： Ultrasound examination results expressed as a continuous numerical variable， for the six groups of histopathological groups.\n\n| No.  | Results of the histopathological examination  | Cases  |  | Range  | Mean ± Std. dev.  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| No.  | Results of the histopathological examination  | No.  | %  | min-max  | Mean ± Std. dev.  |\n| 1  | Endometrial cancer  | 34  | 30.35  | 8-22 mm  | 15.5±7mm  |\n| 2  | Endometrial hyperplasia  | 12  | 10.71  | 8-18mm  | 13.7±4.3mm  |\n| 3  | Glandular cystic hyperplasia  | 28  | 25  | 6-24 mm  | 10.4±5.5mm  |\n| 4  | Endometrial polyp  | 14  | 12.5  | 6-14 mm  | 9.3±4.3mm  |\n| 5  | Proliferative endometrium  | 18  | 16.07  | 2-10mm  | 5.7±4.7mm  |\n| 6  | Atrophic endometrium  | 6  | 5.35  | 1-8mm  | 4.6±1.2mm  |\n| 7  | TOTAL  | 112  | 99.98  | 1-23mm  | 11.1±10.9mm  |\n\n【31】Table 2： Ultrasound examination results expressed as a rank variable， for the six groups of histopathological groups.\n\n| Results of histopathological examination  | Thickness of the endometrium [mm]  |  |  |  |  |  | TOTAL  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Results of histopathological examination  | 4  | 5-7  | 8-10  | 11-15  | 16-20  | >20  | TOTAL  |\n| Endometrial cancer  |  |  | 6  | 14  | 8  | 6  | 34  |\n| Endometrial hyperplasia  | 0  |  | 2  | 6  | 4  | 0  | 12  |\n| Glandular cystic hyperplasia  |  | 7  | 9  | 10  | 1  | 1  | 28  |\n| Endometrial polyp  |  | 4  | 6  | 4  | 0  | 0  | 14  |\n| Proliferative endometrium  | 7  | 8  | 3  | 0  | 0  |  | 18  |\n| Atrophic endometrium  | 4  | 2  | 0  | 0  |  |  | 6  |\n| TOTAL  | 11  | 21  | 26  | 34  | 13  | 7  | 112  |\n\n【33】Table 3： Association between the ultrasound examination and histopathological results， for the pathology group.\n\n| Results of histopathological examination  | Thickness of the endometrium [mm]  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Total 74 cases  | 5-7  | 8-10  |  | 11-15  | 16-20  |  | >20  |\n| Endometrial cancer  | 0  | 6  |  | 14  | 8  |  | 6  |\n| Endometrial hyperplasia  | 0  | 2  |  | 6  | 4  |  | 0  |\n| Glandular cystic hyperplasia  |  | 9  |  | 10  | 1  |  | 1  |\n\n【35】Test Chi-square with Monte-Carla methad (10000 replicates)丶p=0.0019 1.

For testing independence between the histopathological examination and the ultrasound results， the Chi-sguared test did not meet the validity condition，therefore the Monte-Carlo method was applied， with 1，000 replicates each time.\n\n【39】Discussion\n\n【40】The transvaginalultrasound is the most common used exploration in gynecology and in oncogynecology alongside the CT and MRI.\n\n【41】The ultrasound exam has an important value in the exploration of the endometrium， the measurement of the endometrial thickness being the most useful and objective value.\n\n【42】The endometrial hyperplasia is a specter of morphological and biological changes of the endometrial glands which include variable aspects from normal tissue to in situ carcinoma.\n\n【43】WHO and ISGC in the pursuit for a better evaluation of the endometrial hyperplasia in relation to the endometrial cancer introduced a new term. Atypical cells are a better indicator for the progress towards carcinoma.\n\n【44】The evolution from hyperplasia to carcinoma in our study had the incidence of： Simple endometrial hyperplasia 1%， complex endometrial hyperplasia 3%， atrophy simple endometrial hyperplasia8%， atrophy simple endometrial hyperplasia 29%. It is difficult to define the limit between in situ carcinoma and atypical sever endometrial hyperplasia. It can be appreciated in those cases in which the thickness of the endometrium is bigger than 10 mm .\n\n【45】Associating endometrial hyperplasia with bleeding during the climax with the symptomatic triad of the uterine cancer increases the chances of an early diagnosis. In those conditions ultrasound evaluation of the endometrium has an important value in the diagnostic of endometrial cancer.\n\n【46】Conclusion\n\n【47】2. A value smaller than 5 mm in post menopause exclude and precancerous lesion and endometrial cancers.\n\n【48】3. Vaginal ultrasound can diagnose endometrial polyps which can be the cause for post-menopause bleeding in 12% of our cases.\n\n【49】4. Vaginal ultrasound can specify the local extension of the endometrial carcinoma visualizing the location of the tumor， its biometric invasion as well as whether or not the cervix is included； there was a statistically significant association (p<0.001) between the endometrium thickness and the histopathology analysis results.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 11:23:22", "endTime": "2024/09/24 11:23:47", "cost": 24.87}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:34", "update_time": "2024-09-23 19:23:46", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 19:23:21"}

The diagnosis is usually made using cystoscopy with biopsy. Here we report a case about a tumor-like eosinophilic cystitis in a 36 vear old man.\n\n【7】Case Presentation\n\n【8】A 36 year old smoking man， with history of psoriasis since the age of 20， was admitted December2018 in our department with hematuria， suprapubic pain and frequency evolving for 2 months. The patient had no known an atopic disease nor drug allergies.\n\n【9】On physical examination he was afebrile and hemodynamically stable with hypogastric tenderness. He was passing hematuria with clots. Skin examination revealed erythema-squamous lesions on the elbows and knees. Blood Cell Count (BCT) showed neither eosinophilia nor anemia. Renal function was normal. Urinalysis showed no infection.\n\n【10】Computer Tomography (CT) scan  revealed a large budding lesion with a large implantation base without secondary lesion.\n\n【11】He underwent cystoscopy which found a large solid tumor on the right side of the bladder dome that was partialy resected. Pathology  reports on the tissue biopsy indicated dense and polymorphic inflammatory reorganization with eosinophilic predominance of the mucosa without signs of malignancy.\n\n【12】The diagnosis ofEC was retained. Postoperative recovery was unremarkable， urine was cleared， and corticosteroids 20 mg/daywere administrated for 4 weeks associated with topical corticosteroids. We performed a second cystoscopy for complete resection. A follow up 20 months later revealed an asymptomatic patient on the urological and skin level，and ultrasound examination and cystoscopy showed no evidence of disease recurrence.\n\n【13】Literature Review\n\n【14】Eosinophilic cystitis is an inflammatory condition defined as the infiltration of the bladder by eosinophilic cells.\n\n【15】The etiology of EC is still unknown， but some conditions were blamed， such as transitional-cell carcinoma，intravesicalimmunotherapy ，allergic diseases (asthma，rhinitis)，autoimmune diseases(psoriasis as in our case， coeliac disease)， certain medications (sulfonamide， cyclophosphamide) parasitic disorders， eosinophilic enteritis  and allergyto chromic catgut suture. Ninety fivepercent of the cases are revealed by symptoms such as frequency， dysuria(62%)， gross hematuria (57%)， urgency (4%) and suprapubic pain(49%)， rarely urinary retention (10%) . other rare presentations are reported in the literature including fever， skin rush， nocturnal enuresis， gastrointestinal symptoms.\n\n【16】While examining patients we can notice suprapubic tenderness or a lower abdominal if the pseudo tumor is voluminous. Blood tests can reveal eosinophilia， especially found when EC is associated with an allergic disease.\n\n【17】Urinalysis is often normal， but may show a urinary tract infection which shouldbetreated. Renal failure may exist due tohydronephrosis or bleeding.\n\n【18】Ultrasound，as well as CT scan and MRI may showvariable aspects：Thickening of the bladder wall， a mass formation， hydronephrosis and blood clot or can be normal. Cystoscopic abnormalities include inflammatory lesions (edema， erythema and velvety red lesions)， ulcerations and tumors. None is pathognomonic. Therefore，biopsy is needed to confirm the diagnostic. Basically， transmural inflammation predominantly with eosinophils is found， suggesting EC.\n\n【19】Cystoscopy in not only the gold standard in diagnostic， it has a major role in therapy， it allows transurethral resection of the lesions， preferably in the same time of taking biopsies .\n\n【20】Studies proved that the allergen eviction is a safe strategy to cure patients； therefore， we suggest that it's legitimate to try to find the allergen in cause by skin tests and specific immunoglobulin search.\n\n【21】Antibiotics are only recommended in case of a urinary tract infection or distension. Patients have been successfully treated with corticosteroids along with antihistaminic . Corticosteroids seem to accelerate the disappearance of symptoms and inflammation . In case of failure， it is possible to use cyclosporine-A .\n\n【22】In patients whose medical treatment was not successful， surgery such as partial or total cystectomy can be performed， but with heavy consequiences.\n\n【23】Conclusion\n\n【24】Eosinophilic cystitis is a rare disease which etiology is still not clearly known.

The Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the main host cell receptor of human pathogenic SARS-CoV-2 and it plays a crucial role in the entry of the virus into the cell to cause and finally COVID-19 infection. We review the possible association of ACE2 gene polymorphisms in COVID-19 along with the risk of cardiovascular disease. From the year 2020 onwards number of researchers reported ACE2 main functional role in simulations has indicated several of these polymorphisms could affect interactions of SARS-CoV-2 and explained the concept of partial explanation for the regional differences and the disease severity. Here， we discuss the potential effect of polymorphisms of the ACE2 gene in the main function of plasma ACE2 activity in myocardial infarction， ischemic heart disease， and hypertension. Furthermore， we speculate on the potential role of ACE2 gene polymorphisms of rs2285666 as a common genetic locus and susceptibility marker for the COVID-19 infection that might be associated with cardiovascular disease risk.\n\n【2】Keywords： ACE2 polymorphism； Cardiovascular risk； COVID-19； Genetic susceptibility\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Critical pathways for hypertension control and kidney functions are attributed to Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE). ACE-2 is one of the members of the ACE family protease and is attached to the cell membrane of (mACE2) in the kidney， heart， intestines， testis， and a soluble form in gallbladder (sACE2) . The sACE2 lowers blood pressure by catalyzing the hydrolysis of angiotensin II into angiotensin . Which in turn binds to MasR receptors creating the vasodilation and decreasing the blood pressure ? Cardiovascular and hypertension patients are mostly affected by blood pressure and making the entire processes a promising drug target . The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2， which was first discovered in December 2019， has subsequently， spread rapidly through global trade and travels . The Coronaviruses (CoVs) are positive-sense single-stranded RNA， with the capacity to environmentally get rapidly mutated and recombination.COVID-19 is well-known to cause human respiratoryand intestinal infections. The risk of serious illness of COVID-19 is mostly affected by older aged people， cardiovascular disease， diabetes， chronic respiratory disease， and cancer patients. Globally， in May 2021， there have been 51，39，55，910 confirmed cases of COVID-19， including 62，49，700 deaths， as reported by WHO. (WHO， COVID-19 daily reports， April-2022) . The SARS-CoV-2 has affected humans and worldwide deaths ratio of 4.5 million . In India， as on May 2022， a total of 4，30，94，938confirmed positive cases of COVID-19 with 5，24，002 deaths as reported by WHO (WHO， May2022) . The review work was planned to investigate the high-risk genetic variants of ACE2gene SNPs in COVID-19 infection and their association with Cardiovascular Diseases (CVD). COVID-19 is discovered in December-2019， however， before the COVID-19 infection，ACE2 gene polymorphisms were identified as susceptibility molecules in CVD. A recently higher number of new genetic variants were identified in the ACE2 gene as the reason for COVID-19 infection. The cured COVID-19 infected persons with ACE2 polymorphisms are at a higher risk of cardiovascular disease.\n\n【5】Methods\n\n【6】An extensive search was performed for literature collection from the ACE2 gene polymorphisms in COVID-19 and cardiovascular disease utilizing PubMed，and other scholarly searchbibliographic databases with a variety of terms that included， rennin-angiotensin system， pulmonary hypertension， and rs2285666 susceptibility in COVID-19 or cardiovascular disease.\n\n【7】ACE2 Gene Structure and Function\n\n【8】Activation of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) plays an important role in the development and progression of cardiovascular complications. One of the pivotal components of renin-angiotensin system is ACE， which mediates various systemic and local regulations in the cardiovascular system and kidney and blockade of the RAS by Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and Angiotensin(Ang) II receptor blockers have been shown to reduce Blood Pressure(BP) and the cardiac and renal complications of diabetes. The ACE exists in two isoforms， a somatic ACE，and testis-specific ACE (tACE). In 2000， two independent research groups discovered ACE2， one of the ACE family metalloprotease， unlike ACE， ACE2 removes the carboxy-terminal phenylalanine in Ang-II to form the heptapeptide angiotensin-. The chromosome location of the ACE2gene is at Xp22 and the size is 39.98 kb， containing 18 exons and 20introns . The ACE2 is identified as a functional receptor for the SARS Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) . Serves as a main entry point in to the cell for coronaviruses such as HCoV-NL63，SARS-CoV，and SARS-CoV-2 . ACE2 is expressed specifically in heart and kidney and capable of cleaving Ang I and Ang-II into angiotensin 1-7and angiotensin 1-9 respectively and other key vasoactive peptides， thus provides additional possibilities for the development of novel therapeutics .\n\n【9】The ACE2 Gene Role in COVID-19\n\n【10】The ACE2 contributes a central role in cardiac pathophysiology. Original SARS-CoV give rise to SARS-CoV-2 which differs from the original by 380 amino acid substitutions， and renders a difference in the receptor-binding domain between the viral spike (S) protein with surface expressed human ACE2 . This viral spike protein is target for therapeutic and vaccine development. The viral spike glycoprotein， synthesized as an inactive protein， is cleaved by the furin protease plasmin at furin cleavage site of spike protein， which is absent in SARS-CoV， thereby enhancing and increasing the cellular uptake of viral particles  by membrane fusion. Once the virus enter in to the host cell， the viral RNA is released and the host cell's cellular programs are utilized for viral replication of the host. The viral mediators down regulates ACE2 and induce the ADAM Metallopeptidase domain 17 (ADAM-17) ， latter cleaves ACE2， and directly pointing towards its direct involvement in COVID-19 and the RAAS system. Silhol et al. proposed low ACE2 level and a decrease in angiotensin 1-9 were correlated with a poor prognosis in acute respiratory distress syndrome. Similarly， COVID-19 viral mediated down regulation of ACE2 and its product can also be correlated with a poor prognosis in COVID-19.\n\n【11】ACE2 Gene PolymorphismsSasSaRisk in Cardiovascular Disease\n\n【12】CVD is the leading cause of mortality ratio in worldwide， representing 32% and 17.9 million people died in 2019， WHO，June，2021 . China had the highest number of heart disease deaths in2018， followed by accounts in India， Russia， the United States， and Indonesia (Robert Preidt， Health Day Reporter， WEDNESDAY， December 10\"， 2020 (Health Day News) . It has been reported that COVID-19 can cause heart injury， even in people without underlying heart issues. The most frequently reported cardiovascular malfunction in COVID-19 is acute cardiac injury and it occurred in ~8% to 12% of all COVID patients. A unique interplay between SARS-CoV-2 and CVDs has been reported. Patel et al. reported that genetic variation of ACE2 is associated in Caucasians with diabetic hypertension . Lu et al. reported the ACE2 gene G8790A variants are more significantly associated with essential hypertension in Chinese patients . These studies demonstrate that the A allele of the rs2285666 polymorphism in the ACE2 gene influences the risk of fatal CVD events to be a potential risk factor for males and females. Cheng et al.  reported the ACE2 SNP rs879922 may be common genetic loci and genetic susceptibility marker for T2D and T2D-related cardiovascular risks in Uygurs . The SNP rs2285666in ACE2 has been reported as a risk factor for hypertension and heart failure . Table 1 shows the ACE2 gene polymorphisms that are possibly more vulnerable to COVID-19 and the risk of CVD. Cross-sectional human studies from Sheila et al. reported that the circulating ACE2 gene is a genetic marker of cardiovascular disease. Paramasivam et al.  reported that understanding the underlying mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 causes CVD is of greatest importance， and cardiovascular protection should be taken into consideration during treatment for COVID-19 . All the above observations strongly suggested the importance of ACE2 and its regulation in cardiovascular disease and COVID-19.\n\n【13】ACE2 Gene Polymorphisms asaRisk in COVID-19\n\n【14】The ACE2 gene polymorphisms are linked to several diseases， which also play a main role in COVID-19 infection and its severity. There are four SNPs in the ACE2 gene， reported to be involved in modulating cardiac structure and function. One of the SNPs rs2285666 was reported to be involved in left ventricle mass in additional other three SNPs RS1978124， rs4646179. Srivastava et al. ascertained a significant positive correlation for SNP rs2285666with COVID-19 infection susceptibility and fatality rate among the Indian population. In addition to TMPRSS2 rs2329760 SNP， ACE2rs2285666 SNP is one of the predictors of COVID-19 disease severity has been shown in the Egypt population. Kushal et al.  reported the soluble ACE2 K26R and T92I mutants were more effective in blocking the entry of the virus suggesting that ACE2 variants can modulate susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 . Earlier evidence reports of the C/C genotype of rs2106809 and the allele A of rs2285666 in ACE2 are risk factors in patients with COVID19. The different SNPs of ACE2 and rs5183 AGTR1 showed an association with severity and death in patients with COVID-19 and comorbidities . Mayan et al. first reported a miRNA candidate that can target ACE2in cardiomyocytes and thus may be exploited as a therapeutic target for cardiovascular complications and COVID-19 . The review finds that COVID-19 patients with severe symptoms also seem to suffer from various other health conditions including Cardiovascular\n\n【15】Table 1： Show the ACE2 gene rs2285666 polymorphisms are susceptibility in Covid-19 and Cardiovascular disease.\n\n| S.Nos  | COVD-19  | Country  | Cardiovascular Disease  | County  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1  | Maria et al.   | Spain  | Zhong et al.   | China  |\n| 2  | Srivastava et al.  | Incia  | Lieb et al.  | Germany  |\n| 3  | Nahid et al.  | Iran  | Huang et al.  | China  |\n| 4  | Birte et al.   | Germany  | Ciara et al.   | Ireland  |\n| 5  | Abdelsattar et al.  | Egypt  | Chaoxin et al.   | China  |\n| 6  | Asselta et al.   | Italy  | Cheng et al.   | South African  |\n\n【17】Disease (CVD)， hypertension， and diabetes .

Recently， clinicians and physiotherapists can measure the ankle-ROM using smartphone applications. However， these measurement methods cannot be done remotely and body integration is required. For this reason， our study aim is to develop a smartphone application that can measure ankle-ROM remotely and to investigate the its correlation with the universal goniometer.\n\n【2】Methods： Twenty-two of healthy university students with 44 feet were recruited in the study. DijiA application was developed for Android smartphone to measure ankle dorsiflexion and plantar flexion ROM remotely. 44 feet were evaluated by both universal goniometer and DijiA application. After completion of testing， all of the participant were filled out the System Usability Scale (SUS) survey for measuring usability of application.\n\n【3】Results： The variation in Pearson Correlation Coefficient between the Universal Goniometer and DijiA Smartphone App result showed that there was a moderate positive relationship Between the Universal Goniometer and DijiA (r=0.323 for DF，r=0.435 for PF).\n\n【4】Conclusion： Smartphone-based ankle ROM measurement with“DijiA app can be used to assess active ROM ofthe ankle joint without weight-bearing. The result of the study showed that usability of DijiA app is satisfactory and above the standards.\n\n【5】Keywords： Ankle 1； Application 2； Range of motion 3； Smartphone\n\n【6】Introduction\n\n【7】Ankle Range of Motion (ROM) is an important parameter for assessing the functional status of the ankle joint . The assessment of ankle ROM is commonly performed in both clinical and research settings. Traditionally， ankle ROM measurements have been taken using a universal goniometer， which is a reliable and valid tool for measuring joint angles . However，advancements in technology have led to the development of Smartphone applications that claim to be a simple and accurate alternative to the traditional goniometer .\n\n【8】In recent years， there has been a growing interest in using IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) sensors and image processing techniques using a Smartphone camera system for analyzing the motion or posture of the foot and ankle region . IMU sensors are small， wearable devices that can measure movement and orientation， and can be used to assess joint angles during ROM measurements . The use of Smartphone camera systems has also gained popularity in recent years， as they can provide accurate measurements of joint angles without the need for additional equipment .\n\n【9】However， despite the potential benefits of these technologies， there is still a need for further research to validate their use in clinical settings. Larger patient sample sizes and more robust validation assessments are necessary to ensure that these technologies can provide reliable and accurate measurements of joint angles. Additionally， the use of these technologies may require specialized training for healthcare professionals to ensure proper use and interpretation of the data.\n\n【10】Despitethe challenges，the use of mobileapps and newtechnologies for ROM measurements holds promise for improving the efficiency and accuracy of clinical assessments . Many clinical tests have also been computerized using mobile apps. ROM or Goniometric Measurement has gained the attention due to its importance for clinical assessment， quick-and-easy procedures， and more mobile equipment . ROM measurements have been developed for various joints， including the lumbar， knee， shoulder， and wrist . Despite the fact that multiple studies have showed good reliability， more validation assessments with larger patient sample sizes have been identified as a general route for future research . By providing quick and easy procedures， and more mobile equipment， these technologies could potentially increase patient access to care and improve patient outcomes . As such， continued research and development in this area will be important for advancing the field of clinical assessment and enhancing patient care.\n\n【11】The aim of this study is to investigate the correlation between measurements of ankle ROM taken using a universal Goniometer and a Smartphone application. The use of a Smartphone application has the potential to reduce measurement errors and increase the efficiency of data collection. However， the accuracy and reliability of these applications need to be evaluated before they can be considered as a valid tool for measuring joint angles.\n\n【12】The findings of this study will provide valuable insights into the potential use of smartphone applications in the assessment of ankle ROM. This could have significant implications for the clinical and research settings， as it could provide a more convenient and cost-effective alternative to traditional goniometry. Furthermore， the results of this study may also inform the development of future Smartphone applications for measuring joint angles.\n\n【13】Materials and Methods\n\n【14】Fourteen patients with 28 feet (7 females and 7 males aged 21 to29 years) who have the foot deformity were included in this study. Patients with ankle arthrodesis， acute fractures， or other major acute illness were excluded.\n\n【15】Study design\n\n【16】DijiA application was developed for Android smartphone to measure ankle DF and PF ROM remotely. The purpose of the pilot study was to test the reliability of DijiA in ankle DF & PF-ROM measurement compared with UG. According to this， twenty-two of healthy university students with 44 feet were recruited in Yeditepe University. All subjects were applied applications'evaluation([age， gender， existing chronic diseases， surgical conditions and injuries， morning， activity and severity of night pain and System Usability Scale (SUS) survey for android]， Figure 2) form before testing. After completion of testing， all of the participant were filled out the System Usability Scale (SUS) survey for measuring usability of application.\n\n【17】Instruments\n\n【18】Smartphone application： The Smartphone App were created to collect sociodemographic and particular information about the foot and ankle region and were authored mostly in the native (Turkish) language. Individuals might access a consent page under the KVK's(Turkish Personal Data Protection) privacy policy before proceeding to the app's home page. The participants were then requested to provide information about their sociodemographic factors [age， gender， height， weight]， dominant side， diabetes， neurological and internal disorders， history of ankle injury， trauma， and surgery. VAS was used to rate the degree of foot and ankle pain in the morning during activity， andat night . To eliminate problems caused by a lack of technological understanding， the interface was designed to be user-friendly and straightforward.\n\n【19】In order to meet with the requirements described above， a system designed and implemented. As show in Figure 1， the system is formed by a mobile component and a cloud component.\n\n【20】The mobile component will consist of the mobile application (The DijiA app) developed in accordance with the mobile device and device operating system on which the software will run. Accordingly， the mobile component will consist of software that creates a user interface suitable for the screen sizes of the device used， instantly stores the collected user data， communicates with the cloud component， and safely directs the stored data to the right service.\n\n【21】A cloud component is a platform that keeps collected data on a designed system for access via a web server. It runs on Amazon Web Services (AWS) consisting of three EC2 Ubuntu servers which are functionally a web server，an application server， and a database server in a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). The web server welcomes the data packets coming from the mobile component to the cloud component and provides access to information stored in the primary database which locates on the database server. Media files sent to the cloud component were kept in the file system of the database server as well. Application server runs a ROM measurement service which takes the media files from database and process to find the ROM angle of the patient. The mobile component， cloud component and ROM measurement service supplied by the cloud component are detailed in the paragraphs below.\n\n【22】The researcher created a systematic questionnaire and present to the user via mobile component. The first section of the questionnaire asked about age， weight， height， gender， existing chronic diseases， surgical conditions and injuries， morning， activity， and night pain severity. The second component ofthe questionnaire concentrated on the System Usability Scale (SUS)， a \"quick\" and dependable tool. It is a ten-item questionnaire with five response options (strongly agree-strongly disagree) that evaluates a wide range of products and services(software， hardware， mobile devices， websites， and apps). According to studies， SUS scores above 68 are considered above average， while anything below 68 is deemed below ordinary .\n\n【23】The DijiA app， whose screenshots are shown in Figure 2， was initially available offline after being downloaded. Until the user has an internet connection， patient s data was saved in the local database (SQLite) on the mobile device. The video shooting step in the mobile app decided the ROMs of the patients. During the video recording phase， patients were requested to do DF and PF movements in a lengthy sitting position with a rolled towel orfand pillow under the knee. Patients were shown the steps of this procedure via video simulation via the app.\n\n【24】Following the completion of the mobile app's optimization and testing， those who volunteered to participate in the study were requested to download the mobile app to their phones in order to carry out the pilot study. Individuals uploaded their information onto the app， which they then downloaded to their phones and used to provide their ankle normal range of motion measures by capturing videos through the app.\n\n【25】Individuals completed the usability tests for evaluating the mobile app after uploading their videos to the system. The prototype of the mobile device app was tested for usability so that the latest releases contain messages that are clear，effective， consistent with the purpose， and easily understood by the target audience， and do not provoke negative responses. This test provided researchers with data on how individuals perform on questions and the app (colors， music， sounds， timing). Mixed methodologies (direct observation， interviews with individuals， and satisfaction surveys) were utilized in the pilot study to explain areas of progress in a cross-sectional way.\n\n【26】The information and video gathered from the patient are sent to the cloud component. The video file stored in database server is taken by the application server to be processed. This process can be named as a human pose estimation which is a challenge of estimating the articulated joint locations of a human body from one image or a sequence of photos of that person. This challenge has been tried to be solved with the methods developed over time. Thus， it has been observed that advances in computer learning provide more accurate human body part detection. In the light of these in-formation， we used deep learning and image processing techniques to determine the angle between leg and foot.\n\n【27】For segmentation of the ankle area，Mask-RCNN， a deep learning algorithm， trained with COCO dataset is used. After segmenting the region of interest， we applied image processing techniques such as CLAHE， skin segmentation， contouring and skeletonizing. The code is open source under the GNU General Public License v3.0 at https：//github.com/gulsahgg/FootMaskApp. Figure 3， shows the steps to acquire the angle from a video frame.\n\n【28】Statistical analysis\n\n【29】Statistical analyzes were applied by using IBM SPSS Statistics 22Program. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was applied to assess the distribution of the data. Descriptive statistics were used to define features of study groups. Pearson correlation coefficients were utilized to find significant correlations between the outcomes of two instruments. The 0.05 significance value was used.\n\n【30】Results\n\n【31】Twenty-two healthy university students with 44 feet (14 females and 8 males aged 18 to 24 years) were included in the study. DijiA pilot study participants descriptive data (age， weight， and height) are presented in Table 1.\n\n【32】For comparing the Universal Goniometer (UG) and DijiA， 44 feet were available in Table 2. The mean of ROM measured with the UG were DF for 19.93 ±8.00， PF for 38.59 ±6.46 and measured with the DijiA were DF for 37.45±29.52， PF for 78.55±56.54.\n\n【33】According to Pearson Correlation Coefficient between the Universal Goniometer (UG) and the DijiA in measuring ankle dorsiflexion and plantarflexion were significant with DF； 95% CI=0.06-0.65； PF； 95% CI=0.21-0.64 .\n\n【34】The variation in Pearson Correlation Coefficient between the Universal Goniometer and DijiA Smartphone App result was showed in Figure 4. According to these findings， there was a moderate positive relationship between the Universal Goniometer and DijiA (r=0.323for DF， r=0.435 for PF).\n\n【35】The System Usability Scale (SUS) is a 10-item questionnaire with5 response options (Appendix C). The Survey results for measuring usability of DijiA smartphone app were displayed in Table 4. In the literature， A SUS score of 68 or more is regarded above average， while anything below 68 is considered below standard. SUS score was report as 76.5 (higher perceived usability). It can be interpreted that the application usability is high and people liked it .\n\n【36】The overall score given by the participants to the application was recorded by evaluating it out of 10， and the average was found to be 8.26. In addition， feedback was received from the participants expressing their opinions and suggestions for the application. Accordingly， 3 people out of 15 gave the feedback which is written in the Table 5.\n\n【37】Discussion\n\n【38】Chronic medical problems (osteoarthritis， diabetes mellitus， for example)， anatomical (pes planus-cavus)， better shoe wear， prolonged standing on hard surfaces， sports activity， and biomechanical(increased pronation subtalar joint， AT tightness， limited dorsi-plantar flexors weakness) factors are all associated with hindfoot pain . Early recognition and assessment of HP risk factors can lead to successful control and prevention of these symptoms and their chronicity . Many manual and device-based techniques are available in the literature for the early detection and evaluation of the risk factors listed above (especially foot deformity and ankle-ROM). Many techniques can be used to determine ankle joint mobility， including tape measures， digital gravity goniometers， visual estimation， inclinometers， or measurement of joint angles after radiographic visualization in maximal flexion or extension， and Universal Goniometers (UG) . Using eye evaluation or mechanical goniometers is inexpensive， simple， and quick， but it has significant error. The higher exposure of radiographic examination prevents it from being widely employed， despite the fact that it is universally recognized as the reference procedure . Other methods of ROM measurement (gait analysis， digital goniometers， or imaging with computer image processing) are too time-consuming and expensive to be employed on a regularbasis. Furthermore， the UG is inexpensive and widely used . Munteanu et al. discovered that UG reliability (ICC 14 0.65-0.89) was worse than digital inclinometer(ICC 140.88) and acrylic plate apparatus dependability (ICC 14 0.89) in earlier research when they examined ankle joint DF in a weight-bearing position with the knee extended .\n\n【39】Table 1： DijiA pilot study participants' descriptive data.\n\n| N=22  | Minimum  | Maximum  | Mean ± SD  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Age (years)  | 18  | 24  | 20.68±1.72  |\n| Height (cm)  | 157  | 183  | 170.27±9.21  |\n| Weight (kg)  | 47  | 91  | 65.09±14.52  |\n\n【41】Data expressed as mean + standard deviation； N： Faot Number； ROM： Range of Motion， DF： Darsiflexion； PF： Plantar Flexion， UG： Universal Goniometer， DijiA：\n\n【42】Dijital Adimlar App Table 2： Summary statistics for ankle Range of Motion (ROM) measurements in the study participants.\n\n| ROM(N=44)  | Minimum  | Maximum  | Mean± SD  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| UG DF PF  | 1025  | 5050  | 19.93±8.00 38.59±6.46  |\n| DitA DIF PF  | 00  | 88.23235.65  | 37.45±29.5278.55±56.54  |\n\n【44】Motion； DF： Dorsiflexian， PF： Plantar Flexion； UG： Universal Goniometer； DijiA：Dijital Adimlar App\n\n【45】Table 3： Pearson correlation coefficient between the universal goniometer and DiiA.\n\n| ROM  | Pearson Correlation  | %95C  | P value  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| DIF UG-DIiA  | 0.323  | (.65)  | <0.01  |\n| PF UG-DIiA  | 0.435  | (.64)  | <0.01  |\n\n【47】Data expressed as mean ± standard deviation； N： Faat Number； ROM： Range of Motion； DF： Dorsiflexion； PF： Plantar Flexion， UG： Universal Goniameter； DijiA：Dijital Adimlar App\n\n【48】Table 4： Distribution of answers to the System Usability Scale (SUS) survey questionnaire for DijiA Smartphone App.\n\n| Questions  | Disagree%(n)  | Not sure%(n)  | Agree%(n)  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Complexity  | 86.6  | 6.6  | 6.6  |\n| Ease of use  | 0  | 6.6  | 93.33  |\n| Technical support need  | 66.6  | 20  | 13.33  |\n| Integration of functions  | 6.6  | 13.33  | 80  |\n| Presence of inconsistency  | 93.33  | 6.6  | 0  |\n| Quick use  | 0  | 20  | 80  |\n| App is slow  | 80  | 20  | 0  |\n| Confident Use  | 0  | 20  | 80  |\n| learn before use  | 66.6  | 26.66  | 6.6  |\n\n【50】Table 5： The application overall score， suggestions and feedback results for DjiA Smartphone App.\n\n| Application OverallScore (N=15)[minimum-maximum1  | Feedbacks (N=3)  |\n| --- | --- |\n|   | Videa uplaad locations can be improved.

Despite this issue， UG remains the gold standard in clinical practice for measuring ROM . Furthermore， because of their accessibility， low cost， and simplicity， a growing number of mobile applications on smartphones are being employed in medical settings instead of traditional measuring equipment such as UG . Previously， the validity and reliability of numerous smartphone ROM measurement apps were tested， and they were discovered to be validiand trustworthy in measuring ROM in a range of joints (elbow，knee， and fifth metatarsophalangeal joints) . According to Williams et al.，who evaluated ankle DF-ROM in weight-bearing using the mobile goniometer app TiltMeter downloaded on a smartphone (ICC 0.8 or higher)， measurement intra/inter-rater reliability with knee extend-flexed was shown to be excellent . Two more studies demonstrated moderate to excellent reliability and validity in the use of IOS-based goniometer applications to test weight-bearing DF-ROM. Weight-bearing the inter/intra-rater reliability of the DF-ROM assessment using the mobile goniometer software Spirit level plus loaded on an Android Smartphone was reasonable . There could be several explanations for why their reliabilities were higher. The most prominent documented example is the use of various mobile goniometer applications on different types of devices with different operating systems (Android vs. iOS) . Another consideration is that applications may have an impact on measurement differences， and their respective software platforms must be extensively evaluated. Any new version of the program that is released should be validated again .\n\n【53】Weight-bearing ankle-ROM assessments are nevertheless limited in that they cannot be used if weight-bearing is forbidden， and the process appears to be less objective than non-weight-bearing ones because the applied load is required to achieve the final position. Cox et al. investigated ankle joint PF-ROM measurements in non-weight-bearing position and found that The Plaincode Smartphone app was a viable instrument for measuring PF-ROM(right foot r=0.92， p=0.00， left foot r=0.92， p=0.00， combination r=0.92， p0.00) . Walaa et al. also investigated the validity and intra-rater reliability of the Smartphone app \"Clinometer\" for assessing ankle ROM in non-weight-bearing position using a digital inclinometer as the reference standard. Clinometer was shown to have moderate validity when compared to the digital inclinometer for ankle ROM (r=0.52-0.57). Similarly， in our investigation， we discovered a modest amount of Pearson Correlation between UGand DijiA . Furthermore， a SUS score was regarded as having higher perceived usefulness， with a total average usability score of 76.5  .\n\n【54】The study has a few limitations. The first was the lack of a one-year follow-up assessment period and any outcomes from the combination treatment techniques long-term impacts. Second， DijiA， one of the Smartphone apps we created， was for Android. These apps should be built into all phone OS， and their usefulness should be evaluated. Furthermore， based on the findings of the usability survey， we believe that the inter-face design of the DijiA application should be altered， and the correlation relationship should be strengthened by continuing optimization testing of the DijiA application.\n\n【55】Conclusion\n\n【56】HP can effectively reduce and avoid these symptoms， as well as their chronicity. As a result， we created a Smartphone application(DijiA) and studied its usefulness and correlation for assessing ankle range ofmotion. The\"DijiA\"app on a smartphone can be used to assess active ROM of the ankle joint without weight bearing. The study's findings revealed that the usability of the DijiA app is satisfactory and beyond industry standards. Smartphone ankle ROM assessment apps allow patients to monitor their possible risk factors without purchasing pricey hardware. This encourages patients to engage in enthusiastic self-rehabilitation and allows for the identification of risk factors in individuals suffering from hindfoot discomfort. Patients， physiotherapists，and doctors can use these apps to remotely monitor ROM at home or in the clinic using a mobile Smartphone. The findings of this study may influence practice guidelines for the management of hindfoot pain and the usage of Smartphone apps for injury prevention.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 11:05:15", "endTime": "2024/09/24 11:10:33", "cost": 317.545}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:34", "update_time": "2024-09-23 19:10:33", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 19:05:15"}

Data were collected at four-time points：week 10 after surgery， week 20 after surgery， week 30 after surgery， week 40 after surgery (follow-up).\n\n【3】Results： There was improvement in IKDC，week 10=43.68 and week 40= 85.05； Cincinnati Knee Score， week 10= 63 and week 40=80). Functional tests also showed higher values at the end of treatment： 10 MWT (week 10= 1.52 m/s and week 40=3.55 m/s)， jump test (week 10=117 cm and week 40= 180 cm)， SLHT (week 20=387 cm and week 40=526cm) and SLTHT (week 20= 387 cm and week 40=526cm).\n\n【4】Conclusion： Adding exergaming to conventional physiotherapy may be beneficial to achieve functional improvements after ACL reconstruction.\n\n【5】Keywords： Anterior cruciate ligament； Rehabilitation； Virtual reality； Knee\n\n【6】Introduction\n\n【7】The rehabilitation of the Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) injury is a prevailing condition on the routine of knee treatment. An ACL injury is a common sports injury and also occurs during recreational physical activities . The ACL contributes to knee joint stability and neuromuscular control. ACL rupture maylimit functional movements that involve cutting， jumping， andpivoting. Also， collateral medialligament rupture and meniscal tears frequently occur in association with ACL ruptures . Surgical reconstruction is recommended after ACL rupture for elite athletes and for those whose knee instability persists after conservative treatment . The rehabilitation should be initiated soon after surgical reconstruction .\n\n【8】The rehabilitation process after ACL reconstruction is divided into different stages. The initial procedures aim to control edema， muscles strengthening， restore the range of motion， and enhance functional movements . The last phase of rehabilitation is based on the gesture performed in real-life sports ， andbalance training . Individuals with ACL rupture usuallypresent balance deficits after ACL reconstruction， and balance training needs to be included during the rehabilitation period. Several resources are used for balance training， such as exercises on the ground， on unstable surfaces， and exercises with visual biofeedback through exergaming devices . Exergaming is one exercise modality that allows the user to interact directly with a simulated environment through a television screen . The multidimensional interaction with the environment， multi- sensory experience through visual， audio， and haptic sensations， increasing attention， motivation and adherence are advantages of the exergaming . There are also increased body awareness， motor coordination， postural balance，and strength .\n\n【9】Studies reported positively on the use of modern technology via computer， video games， and virtual reality in the rehabilitation of patients with neurological diseases and balance disorders . Nonetheless， it is still a growing prospect on the application in the orthopedic field . Exergaming using Nintendo Wii has been used to provide a realistic environment in physiotherapy settings . However， only two studies have reported the use of Nintendo Wii in the ACL post-operative rehabilitation . Further， no study evaluated the effects of virtual reality on the hop tests. Therefore， it is necessary to report the functional outcomes of patients who had undergone ACL reconstruction， using conventional physiotherapy and exergaming in an associated program. The intervention used in the current case report can be a potential therapeutic strategy in future studies. Thus， this study aimed to describe the effects of the combination of exergaming and conventional physiotherapy on the functionality of a patient with ACL reconstruction.\n\n【10】Materialand Methods\n\n【11】A 43-years-old male patient， an employee of the xxx，recreational athlete， sought medical treatment on June 12h，2009， after a traumatic sprained right knee in football， with clinical symptoms compatible with ACL rupture. Imaging exam showed complete ACL rupture， a grade I rupture of the medial collateral ligament and medial meniscus tear. ACL reconstruction surgery was performed with double gracilis and semitendinosus flexor tendon graft and partial meniscectomy in the xxx on May 25h，2010. The participant signed a written informed consent before the inclusion. The study was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee of xxx and performed in compliance with the Helsinki Declaration for research in humans.\n\n【12】The outcome measures included subiective assessment of the knee and objective measures of the lower extremity. The subjective assessments were performed by two self-reported instruments(International Knee Documentation Committee Subiective Knee Evaluation Form -IKDC， and The Cincinnati Knee Score). The objective assessments included the maximum walking speed during the 10-metre walk test， the vertical jump test， the single-leg hop test， and the single-leg triple hop test. Data were collected at four time points： baseline (week 10 after surgery)， during the treatment (week20 after surgery)， end of treatment (week 30 after surgery)， and follow-up (week 40 after surgery). The single-leg triple hop test was not assessed on week 10 because the patient was afraid to perform the test.\n\n【13】A physiotherapist with three years of clinical experience in the musculoskeletal rehabilitation xxx performed the intervention from July to December 2010. Each session lasted approximately45 min， and the intervention was performed twice weekly. All sessions occurred in the physiotherapy outpatient clinic at xxx. The intervention included two phases： Conventional physiotherapy and exergaming using the Nintendo Wii. Each phase of the physiotherapy program was performed in 10 weeks. Conventional physiotherapy included electrotherapy (i.e.， functional electrical stimulation for muscle strength)， myofascial technique， knee joint mobilization， stretching， and therapeutic exercises with weight and elastic bands. Subsequently， exergaming using Wii-rehab included lower limb strengthening and balance exercises through the Wii Fit Plus game. A detailed description of the Wii-rehab exercises is provided in Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Figure 1A-1H.\n\n【14】Aerobic exercise in a stationary bike was added on week 12， and strength training started on week 14. During this phase， additional devices such as ankle weights， balance boards， and mini trampoline were added in some exercises. The Wii Fit Plus exercises were similar to those routinely used for ACL injury rehabilitation . There were no adverse events during the study. Descriptive statistical analysis of the data was performed in Prism software version 7.0 (GraphPad Software， Inc.， CA，and USA).\n\n【15】Results\n\n【16】The subjective assessment demonstrated an improvement in both instruments. The IKDC scores increased from 43.68 (week 10) to85.05 (week 40) out of 100 points， and the Cincinnati Scale scores from 63 (week 10) to 80 (week 40) out of 100 points .\n\n【17】The obiective assessment showed increased maximum walking speed for the 10-metre walk test： 1.52 m/s (week 10)， 2.67 m/s (week20)， and 4.84 m/s (week 30). Despite that， the follow-up assessment presented lower walking speed (week 40= 3.55 m/s). Besides， the vertical jump test demonstrated improvements [week 10 (1.17 m)， week 20 (1.36 m)， week 30 (1.59 m)， week 40 (1.80 m)] .\n\n【18】Single-leg hop testand single-legtriple hop test distance presented an improvement during the treatment， which persisted at follow-up evaluation for the injured side. The tests scores related to uninvolved healthy side values remained higher than the involved side in the single-leg hop test (week 10=172 cm； week 20= 145 cm； week 30=157 cm； week 40=160 cm) and single-leg triple hop test (week 10=not performed； week 20= 387 cm； week 30= 428 cm； week 40= 526cm) . The highest leg symmetry of the hop tests was 77%， measured by the lower leg symmetry (involved side performance/uninvolved performance x100%).\n\n【19】Discussion\n\n【20】This study aimed to describe the effects of adding exergaming to a conventional rehabilitation program. The combination of the exergaming and conventional physiotherapy presented subjective and objective improvement after the rehabilitation period. The subjective measures demonstrated progressive improvement. The walking speed increased up to the end oftreatment and reduced at the follow-up evaluation. The hop tests evidenced continuous improvement， and the single-leg hop tests showed a trend to reach similar results compared to the healthy side. Although the combination of the exergaming and the conservative treatment achieved satisfactory results， the case reported did not reach the recommended value for the limb symmetry (90%) in the hop tests .\n\n【21】There are few studies on Wii-rehabilitation in traumatology and orthopedic physiotherapy . A previous study presented no difference between exergaming using Nintendo Wii and conventional treatment on functional tests . The two approaches had similar improvement in patients after ACL reconstruction. Moreover， a protocol combining Nintendo Wii and conventional physiotherapy found similar findings related to knee range of motion in patients after ACL reconstruction and total knee arthroplasty surgery compared to conventional physiotherapy.\n\n【22】Jir case1presented satisfactory results in the subjective assessment. For instance， the IKDC score was 85 out of 100 at week40， which is similar to the mean of IKDC score (88.4) among subjects who returned to the sport after the ACL rehabilitation program . The IKDC and the Cincinnati Knee Score are considered essential tools to evaluate knee function during the rehabilitation program. Exergaming may play a role as an alternative approach for knee rehabilitation . The Wii-rehabilitation could favor patient adherence to sessions due to the playfulness of the games .\n\n【23】Our findings demonstrated that the patient still improved in the functional tests， which can be associated with the restoration of the normal activities of daily living. Functional tests have been used in clinical settings to evaluate lower extremities performance and predict a return to sport . Wii-rehabilitation could be used as an alternative tool for physiotherapists. The program may contribute to physical improvements as well as a conventional rehabilitation program . We encourage further research with a larger sample size to provide new therapeutic strategies involving exergaming in musculoskeletal rehabilitation. In the current study， we offered treatment for an extended period， which probably contributed to functional advances observed on obiective and subjective assessments. An exergaming rehabilitation program is feasible， safe， and cheap . Thus， the exergaming may be used to improve functional tasks as squat， single-leg weight-bearing， and balancing training. The functional outcome of patients suggests that adding exergaming in rehabilitation can be a beneficial adjuvant for patients undergoing surgery for ACL reconstruction and partial meniscectomy. The case reported in the current study was a 43-years-old male， non-professional athlete，and these characteristics may limit the use of the rehabilitation protocol in different populations. ACL injury is usually related to younger adults and athletes. Furthermore， the improvement observed in the functional test was low (limb symmetry<90%) despite the tendency to increase at follow-up and may be affected by the number of sessions per week. Future studies should compare groups with a different frequency of sessions to clarify this issue.\n\n【24】Conclusion\n\n【25】The patient functional outcomes suggest that adding exergaming in rehabilitation can be a beneficial adjuvant for patients undergoing surgery for ACL reconstruction and partial meniscectomy.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 10:59:24", "endTime": "2024/09/24 11:00:23", "cost": 58.343}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:34", "update_time": "2024-09-23 19:00:21", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 18:59:22"}

Although it is widely used and has proven to have unmatched efficacy for treating recalcitrant nodulocystic acne ， it does not come without a price. Initially only indicated for severe nodular acne， it is now used much more commonly for moderate acne and acne that is unresponsive to other therapies. The usual side effects of this drug are similar in the picture to hypervitaminosis A. A popular side effect is it being teratogenic as Stern RS et al.  pointed out in their study that about half of the pregnancies exposed to isotretinoin resulted in spontaneous abortion， while one out of four infants presented with cardiovascular and/or skeletal birth defects . iPledge was put into effect in the USA in 2006 that closely monitors cases on isotretinoin under mandatory use of two effective contraceptive methods and two negative pregnancy tests before starting therapy .\n\n【4】Although following its launch on the market in 1982， there has been a high incidence of its use with depression， behavioral changes， psychoses， and suicidal ideation， but this association remains controversial . However， in a recent study， Oliveria et al.  stated that patients with a family history of mental disorder are more vulnerable to depression or worsening already existing depressive symptoms . Thus it is imperative to mandate mental health screening and identified patients be promptly referred to a mental health professional before and during the treatment to rule out any psychiatric comorbidity.\n\n【5】A thorough literature searches on PubMed revealed only a few studies covering this drug and its adverse effect profile in Pakistan despite its growing use in acne management. Considering the teratogenic nature of this drug and its suspected association with mental health issues in a subset of people， clinicians need to adopt the iPledge program strategy that ensures that women of childbearing age are not pregnant before the start and following one month after cessation of therapy. It is achieved by compulsory pregnancy testing and remaining strictly adherent to efficacious contraceptive methods during treatment. All this could get accomplished by appropriate counseling of patients regarding the adverse effects associated with the drug. Furthermore， to prevent any psychiatric symptoms in patients， clinicians should take advantage of their monthly appointments to also assess the mental health status of the patient receiving the drug.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 11:44:11", "endTime": "2024/09/24 11:44:23", "cost": 11.947}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:34", "update_time": "2024-09-23 19:44:23", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 19:44:11"}

Studies have established similaritiesbetween the immunopathologyof COVID-19and mycobacterial Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome (IRIS). Innate immune component of both COVID-19 and IRIS centers on aberrant activation and signaling of macrophages and monocytes， by the immunomodulatory effects of cytokines produced， particularly interleukin-18.\n\n【2】Case Presentation\n\n【3】A 1-year 9-month-old boy presented with fever (100-102 F) for 10 days along with neck stiffness and extreme irritability. The caretaker of the child was diagnosed with tuberculosis two months back with sputum beingpositive foracid fastbacilliand GeneXpert detecting thepresenceofMycobacterium tuberculosis sensitive to Rifampicin. Subsequently， the parents had recovered from COVID-19about six weeks back. In view of baby having CNS symptoms along with history of contact with a patient of tuberculosis， the baby was suspected to have TB meningitis and relevant investigations were sent accordingly. Computed Tomography (CT) chest revealed necrotic mediastinal nodes. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) brain showed moderate communicating hydrocephalus with meningeal enhancement. Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) study revealed lymphocytic pleocytosis (Cell count- 640/cmm，lymphocytes 98% and neutrophils 2%) with elevated protein (1463 mg/100 ml) and normal glucose (75 mg/100 ml). CBNAAT from sputum and CSF was negative. In addition， COVID IgG antibody was positive. He was diagnosed as tubercular meningitis and started on 4Anti-Tubercular Drugs (ATD) along with oral prednisolone. Baby was afebrile and playful within a week and repeat MRI brain after one month showed moderate communicating hydrocephalus with mild reduction in the ventricular size and regression ofperiventricular interstitial edema. Clinically the baby remained asymptomatic， ATD were continued， and steroid was gradually tapered off over next 4 weeks.\n\n【4】Six weeks after stoppage of prednisolone， the baby developed cough and was found to be COVID RT-PCR positive. Over the next 4 days he became lethargic， and sensorium deteriorated， with drooling of saliva， decreased urination and had to be hospitalized. Within a day， he developed left sided facialpalsy and drowsiness increased. MRI Brain revealed  multiple conglomerated rings enhancing lesions in the pontine and medullary regions with perifocal edema and meningeal enhancement along with an increase in the hydrocephalus.\n\n【5】He was started on intravenous dexamethasone (0.6 mg/kg/day in 4 divided doses) in view of immune reactivation and ATD were continued. Looking at the new onset lesions in the brain stem possibility of drug resistant TB was considered， the primary contact was traced， and she was found to have recovered. Thus， drug resistance seemed unlikely and initial therapy was continued along with steroids. Gradually over a period of 7 days， mentation improved along with the facial palsy and child was discharged with a plan of continuing oral prednisolone for another month. He remains asymptomatic on follow up.\n\n【6】Discussion\n\n【7】We report a case of tubercular meningitis stable on 3 months of ATD that flared after second episode of COVID-19 infection presenting with new onset bulbar palsy and left sided facial palsy. MRI brain showed multiple new onset tuberculomas in the medulla and pons that raised the possibility of flaring up of TB post-COVID-19. The bulbar and facial palsy improved on administration of dexamethasone thus pointing towards an immune reactivation， best explained by an IRIS-type reaction.\n\n【8】IRIS is a condition seen in responsetorapidimmunereconstitution. Two forms have been described . In unmasking IRIS， the immune reconstitution unmasks a previously undiagnosed infection. Paradoxical IRIS refers to the worsening of previous infection after the commencement of therapy. A typical feature of this syndrome is the recurrence of original lesions in a more pronounced version and rapid clinical improvement following corticosteroid therapy . The radiological and clinical features of paradoxical IRIS were both present in our patient's presentation.\n\n【9】Previously Mertens et al. reported a case of steroid sensitive COVID-19Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndromeinduced ARDS following COVID-19 infection in a 54-year-old male . As per a study by Seddiki et al.，COVID-19 and Mycobacterial IRIS share similar immunopathology and suppression of inflammatory response by corticosteroid therapy is effective in both cases. In addition， the study also established the central role of Interleukin-18 and hence should be investigated further as a possible therapeutic target .\n\n【10】Corticosteroids (prednisolone 1.5 mg/kg/day tapered over four to six weeks) are considered as the first line therapy for IRIS. Duration of therapy depends on severity and recurrence of symptoms but continuation beyond four-six months is discouraged.

This infection can be acquired intrauterine when the first infection of pregnant woman occurs and the Toxoplasma gondii reaches the fetus by transplacental via. The damage to the fetus can compromise the pregnancy and life quality of the infected individual. Early diagnosis of infection allows emergency therapeutic intervention with reduction of the transmission rate and also the severity of the sequelae. Different methodologies are available for the diagnosis of acute gestational toxoplasmosis with detection of IgG and IgM anti-T. gondii antibodies. The methodologies differ mainly by specificity and sensitivity values reached， as well as execution facility and time required. These parameters can decisively influence the choice of the most appropriate technique by the municipal health polices， in public health strategies. The main ofthe present review is to synthesize the major characteristics of serological tests for congenital toxoplasmosis.\n\n【2】Keywords： Congenital toxoplasmosis； Gestational toxoplasmosis； Public health； Serology\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Toxoplasmosis is a protozoonosis worldwide distributed； its etiologic agent is Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondit)， a protozoan belonging to the phylum Apicomplexa， class Sporozoasida， order Eucoccidiorida， family Sarcocystidae， genus Toxoplasma and single species， T. gondii . The parasite exhibits a heteroxene cycle， with sexual reproduction in the intestines of felids， and asexual reproduction in all warm-blooded animals， such as birds and mammals， which act as intermediate hosts .\n\n【5】The asexual cycle begins with the ingestion of oocysts that have been eliminated by the feces of the infected cats or tissue cysts containing bradyzoites present in the raw or uncooked meat of the intermediate hosts . After ingestion， the external wall of the oocysts or tissue cysts is ruptured by enzymatic degradation and the infective， sporozoite and bradyzoite evolutionary forms (slow-growing forms)， respectively， are released into the intestinal lumen where they rapidly invade the host cells and differentiate in tachyzoites (forms of rapid multiplication) by asexual division . The tachyzoites can invade any nucleated cell and form a parasitoid vacuole， where they undergo rapid and successive divisions by endodiogenia， originating new tachyzoites， which break the parasitized cell and invade healthy cells， which characterizes this phase as proliferative .\n\n【6】The dissemination ofthis parasite in the organism occurs through freeor intracellular tachyzoites through the lymph， or blood， and can give rise to a polysymptomatic picture， with varying severity according to the parasite load， the parasite strain and the susceptibility of the host .\n\n【7】The frequency of infection may vary according to age， eating habits， cultural patterns and the urban or rural origin of the individual. The prevalence can vary between parts worldwide， with higher taxes in Latin America， parts of Eastern/Central Europe， the Middle East， South-East Asia and Africa . The infection can occur by the ingestion of food or water contaminated with oocysts， or ingestion of undercooked or raw meat with cysts bradyzoites， or the tachyzoites bytransplacental via， nevertheless， the human toxoplasmosis has been associated with low socioeconomic conditions .\n\n【8】This increased risk may be due to changes in the placenta. In early pregnancy， the placental barrier reaches a thickness of 50 to 100um and progressively decreases to 2.5-5 um at the end of pregnancy， allowing parasites to more easily invade trophoblasts.\n\n【9】According to the gestational age on the first infection with T. gondii， the damage to the fetus can vary due to the morphogenesis phase when affected by the parasite， therefore， in 80.0% to 90.0%of infections in immunocompetent individuals there is no clinical manifestation； however， when there is the infection in the first trimester of gestation， fetal death is common， and when in the second and third trimesters of gestation it may lead to prematurity and Sabin's tetrad， which associates microcephaly，retinocoriditis，cerebral calcifications and mental deficiency . In 50.0% of congenital infections， fetal alterations such as hydrocephalus and periventricular necrosis with macro or microcephaly are reported. In 90.0% of patients there is marked retinal destruction and retinocoriditis， in69.0% cerebral calcifications are developed and in 60.0% of the cases are generated mental retardation or neurological disorders with signs of encephalitis and with seizures .\n\n【10】The chance of congenital in fection is estimated between 4.5% and15.0% when there is toxoplasmosis in the first trimester， followed by 17.3% to 30.0% in the second third， and 60.0% to 75.0% in the last period . This increase in the rate of infection according to gestational age is due to the morphological changes of the placenta， because in the first trimester of pregnancy， the placenta has reduced dimensions and the chance of the parasite reaching the fetus is small， in contrast， as in this phase happens the organogenesis， when there is differentiation of the germinative leaflets， ectoderm， mesoderm and endoderm giving rise to the internal organs of the organism， aggravating the infection， that can lead to fetal death .\n\n【11】In the second trimester， increased placenta reflects a greater chance of infection， however， in this period， the infection becomes less severe， since almost all organogenesis has already occurred， meantime， it can result in important damages such as Sabin's Tetrad， in which the fetus presents retinocoriditis， cerebral calcifications， mental retardation or neurological disorders and hydrocephalus， with macro or microcephaly . In the third trimester， the placenta presents the largest dimensions of the period， consequently， the chance ofinfection is higher and， in contrast， the chance of developing serious damage at birth is remote， with manifestations of the disease such as fever， body spots， blindness， in a few days， weeks or months after birth .\n\n【12】The reduction in incidence， as well as morbidity and mortality rates associated with congenital toxoplasmosis can be achieved in the presence ofcollaborative efforts among pregnant women， researchers， doctors and health policy managers， on the adoption of primary and secondary health preventive measures in the gestation .\n\n【13】The diagnosis of acute T. gondii infection in the gestationalperiod is crucial to define the risk of fetal involvement . For this，prenatal care should be carried out continuously from the gestational diagnosis， in order to avoid congenital toxoplasmosis and also the other risks associated with the life of the pregnant woman and the fetus . In Brazil，health professionals who work in the care ofpregnant women who perform prenatal care through the Unified Health System (SUS)， comply with the protocols established by the Ministry of Health， which guide the serological monitoring for primary infection by T. gondii . Confirmation of toxoplasmosis is based on indirect or immunological methods， since the direct demonstration of the protozoan by culture， inoculation， immunohistochemistry and pathology is in frequent .\n\n【14】The molecular techniques with direct detection of T. gondii tachyzoite is possible during the acute phase of infection and can confirm fetal infection from different body fluids such as blood， amniotic fluid， cerebrospinal fluid， aqueous humor，bronchial lavage fluid alveolar and even urine by PCR technique with a sensitivity of up to 92.0%， which makes this the method of choice in cases of low parasitemic， on the other hand， in the chronic phase of infection， as in cases of cysts in brain or pulmonary tissue， the technique will not be useful .\n\n【15】Indirect or serological techniques， through the detection of antibodies of the IgM， IgG， IgE and IgA classes， do not require invasive procedures that pose a risk to the fetus such as amniocentesis and can be performed at any time during pregnancy. Several methods are available for the serological diagnosis of gestational toxoplasmosis such as the Sabin-Feldman technique， Immunofluorescence antibody test (IFAT)， Hemagglutination (HA)， complement fixation (FC)， enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)， immunoblotting and Imunosorbent Agglutination Assay (ISAGA)， with differences between the values of sensitivity and specificity reached .\n\n【16】It is important that the serological tests for specific anti-T.gondii antibodies are performed at the first prenatal visit with serial analysis in the second and third trimester of gestation and the pregnant woman should receive guidance on the preventive measures of infection .\n\n【17】In the serological diagnosis， specific IgM class antibodies are usually the first to be detected， whereas IgG antibodies appear later， with high titers during the acute phase and gradual reduction with persistence of low titers in the majority of cases， throughout the individual's life， both in the latency phase and in the chronic phase. IgM antibodies may be detectable for long periods， months to years after the acute phase of infection only by highly sensitive diagnostic methods. However， when this antibody is not detected by traditional techniques， or inability to observe IgG seroconversion during pregnancy， the expression of increased IgG titers in serial samples obtained at least three weeks apart， and in tests may suggest the diagnosis of the acute phase of T. gondii infection. Among the techniques for identification of recent T. gondii infection in pregnant women is the IgG and IgM capture ELISA .\n\n【18】In immunocompetent individuals， serological tests with IgG and IgM screening are sufficient for diagnosis because they are sensitive， specific and easy to perform .\n\n【19】Serological screening has several advantages， such as the identification of seronegative pregnant women， which provides the opportunity for health professionals to act in the preventive education of gestational and congenital toxoplasmosis， since eating habits and personal hygiene practices are identified as factors associated with the risk of infection. On the other hand， the identification of asymptomatic patients allows the establishment of adequate therapeutic measures， while the early detection of maternal seroconversion during pregnancy makes it possible to monitor and treat fetal infection and newborns .\n\n【20】The mechanisms by which parasites overpass the maternal-fetus interface remains poorly understood and may reinforce the importance of the screening serological tests to a successful gestation and to minimize the outcomes in the pregnancy due to congenital or gestational toxoplasmosis.\n\n【21】The main characteristics of the techniques used to diagnose T. gondii infection in prenatal care were the object of our study and are summarized in this mini review of qualitative literature， made up of scientific articles and books， available online， on the theme\"serological diagnosis for gestational and congenital toxoplasmosis\".\n\n【22】Major characteristics of the methods for anti-T. gondii antibodies detection\n\n【23】Sabin-feldman dye test： The Sabin-Feldman reaction or dye test was described by Sabin & Feldman， in 1948 and is a differential serological test， where there is specific neutralization of the viable parasite in the presence of antibodies and complement. This method is considered excellent for the diagnosis of individual toxoplasmosis in the acute or chronic phase and also for epidemiological surveys， on account of its high sensitivity， indicating IgG antibodies in serum dilutions up to 1：16000 and specificity with little cross-reaction with other diseases， however， due to the need to manipulate the parasite in its infecting form， is not used as first option for routine diagnosis. Currently， for biological safety， the technique has been replaced by Indirect Immunofluorescence which also has lower cost and also detects IgG and IgM antibodies . Besides the conventional Sabin-Feldman dye test are the gold stand for human toxoplasmosis， the conventional test using in vivo tachyzoites is the highest percent of toxoplasmosis detection in human serum when compared the results when using cell culture-derived T. gondii tachyzoites and when test indirect immunofluorescent antibody tests (IFAT) using in vivo and in vitro tachyzoites.\n\n【24】The Microparticle Enzymelmmunoassay(MEIA)technique\n\n【25】The MEIA1Imakes quantitative determination of IgG and IgM anti-T. gondii antibodies in human serum or plasma. The immunoassay works on a random and continuous way in an Abbott company machine (AXSYM)， and for the IgM antibodies detection a rheumatoid factor neutralization solution is required to remove no specific antibodies avoiding false positive results. At the end of the reaction， the immune complex bound to the alkaline phosphatase-labeled conjugate reacts with the substrate to generate fluorescence of intensity proportional to the antibody concentration of the analyzed sample .\n\n【26】The Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELFA)\n\n【27】The ELFA is an automated test in the VIDAS system of the company Bio-Mérieux， used for IgG and IgM antibodies anti-T. gondii detection， through the immunoenzymatic method with a final fluorescence detection as the main reaction， named immunocapture， where the IgM antibodies present in the immunocomplexare labeled with alkaline phosphatase. This method， when compared to the ISAGA (Immunosorbent Agglutination Assay)， demonstrated agreement of 98.9%， sensitivity of 93.5% and specificity of 99.3%.\n\n【28】The Indirect Fluorescent Antibody Test (IFAT)\n\n【29】IFAT is indicated for serological surveys and diagnosis ofacquired infection， because it can reach sensitivity up to 95.0%， however， false positive reactions with antinuclear factor (FAN) and false negative in the presence of low IgG titers can occurs .\n\n【30】Enzimed Link Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA\n\n【31】The ELISA is an immunoenzymatic assay can reach up to 80.0%\n\n【32】of positivity and identifies early infection， with special importance for the diagnosis of congenital toxoplasmosis. The technique eliminates the interference of IgG and rheumatoid factor that are present in IFAT and can be standardized for detection of different classes of antibodies. When ELISA is used for IgG detection， a high positivity index has been observed in the Brazilian population， however， it is not possible to predict whether the infection is acute or chronic .\n\n【33】In regions were the cost of the kits is expansive for screening proposes， some in-house ELISA for the detection of toxoplasma antibody demonstrated sensitivity and specificity as the commercial kit used in the study with a better cost-effective diagnostic .To detect recent infection， the research is directed to the identification of IgA， which remain with high titers for at least 24 months and， because they do not cross the placenta and are not eliminated through breast milk， increase the importance to the use of this technique for the diagnosis of toxoplasmosis in the newborn .\n\n【34】The ELISA is available as commercialkits andrequires an Analyzer for the detection of specific IgG against T. gondii. Briefly， the serum-specific IgG against the parasite is linked to T. gondii coated antigen on the surface of reagent wells， forming an antigen-antibody complex The goat anti-human IgG labeled with horse radish peroxidase can be used as the secondary antibody to the antigen-antibody complex and after incubation and wash， as a chromogenic substrate is added to each well. The process should be stopped using a stop solution of 1N of H，SO . The Optical Density (OD) is recorded at 450 nm in the analyzer equipment. Calibrator and positive/negative control sera are used in each test set and the immune status ratio value of each sample is calculated by dividing OD of the sample by the cutoff value (cutoff is the mean OD of the calibrators x correction factor). Results were interpreted based on the manufacturer's recommendations as non-reactive， equivocal， or reactive .\n\n【35】The ELISA (for the qualitative determination of specific IgM antibodies anti T. gondii in dry blood samples collected on filter paper for in vitro diagnostic use only)， MEIA and ELFA have been used to improve the diagnosis of toxoplasmosis， which has demonstrated to be useful for the diagnosis of toxoplasmosis， as they show greater sensitivity and specificity .\n\n【36】The lgG avidity test\n\n【37】IgG Avidity concerns on the observation that， in most patients， during acute T. gondii infection， IgG antibodies bind poorly to the antigen that is low avidity， whereas in the chronification of the infection， the bond strength increases and high avidity can develop. These antibodies with high avidity reflect the fact that the primary infection occurred in the distant past， estimated about more than three months， although this method cannot determine if the infection was recent， since eventually low titers can persist for long periods， such as after antiparasitic treatment， which can maintain low avidity for more than four months. Thus， the test is especially indicated for the first trimester of gestation in IgG and IgM reagent women for screening serology， when it was shown to be the best marker ofacute infection in patients with positive IgM .\n\n【38】The Immunobloting Test\n\n【39】Immunoblotting is performed by segregation of the protein antigens components through the polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis The proteins are transferred to a nitrocellulose paper and processed against the serum to be tested， which， in the presence of reaction， can be visualized. The test is used to determine antigens involved in the different stages of infection，however， it is not a routine test .\n\n【40】Conclusion\n\n【41】The serological screening for gestational toxoplasmosis is essential for the identification of susceptible pregnant women and fast detection of IgM seroconversion， with monitoring since the first trimester of pregnancy for the efficient prevention of congenital toxoplasmosis. Among the techniques for detection of anti-T. gondii antibodies in pregnant women， the sensitivity and specificity of antibodies， verified by MEIA， ELFA and ELISA techniques were higher when compared to IFAT detection. The recent infection in the first trimester of gestation should be confirmed by the avidity test.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 10:52:03", "endTime": "2024/09/24 10:53:00", "cost": 56.992}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:34", "update_time": "2024-09-23 18:52:59", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 18:52:01"}

The scope of this review is to establish the role of various inflammation-based markers as prognostic tools in Colorectal Cancer (CRC).\n\n【2】Methods： A literature search was performed for articles that reported on the prognostic and predictive value of the Neutrophil-Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR)， Platelet-Lymphocyte Ratio (PLR)， Lymphocyte-Monocyte Ratio (LMR)，and Glasgow Prognostic Score as well as the modified Glasgow Prognostic Score (GPS/mGPS) in relation to CRC.\n\n【3】Conclusion： Further prospective studies may result in better risk stratification in patients eligible for curative surgery， limiting the administration of neo-adjuvant and adjuvant therapy to high-risk candidates. In patients with unresectable metastatic disease， inflammation markers can be used as a tool for predicting chemotherapeutic outcomes and monitoring tumor progression.\n\n【4】Introduction and Background\n\n【5】Colorectal Cancer (CRC) is a significant public health issue； currently， it is the third most prevalent cancer with 1，931，590 cases diagnosed in 2020 behind breast and lung cancer. In 2020colorectal cancer accounted for 9.4% of the total cancer-related deaths with 935，173 deaths. These numbers are predicted to increase to 3.2 million new cases and 1.6 million deaths per year by 2040. Despite advancements in surgical methods， adjuvant and neoadjuvant therapy dose， and scheduling， the 5-year survival rate for patients with CRC ranges from 90% to 10% with tumor . Currently，the International Union Against Cancer(UICC-TNM) and American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC)  staging categories are used to predict the prognosis of newly diagnosed CRC patients. Several parameters for predicting survival in CRC patients have been identified， including patient characteristics (performance status， age， gender) and tumor characteristics (TNM stage， biomarkers， gene mutations)， but it is well known that survival time can vary even among patients with the same characteristics and disease stage at diagnosis. The host inflammatory response to tumors is currently one of the most intriguing areas of clinical investigation. In many cancer forms， systemic inflammation has been shown to be significantly related to the risk and amount of metastatic involvement . A series of studies have shown that inflammation may play an important role in cancer growth and metastasis because inflammatory mediators enhance vascular permeability， allowing cancer cells to infiltrate lymphatic and blood arteries. Additionally， these cytokines contribute to tumor angiogenesis and protumoral immune cell recruitment .\n\n【6】Although several cytokines are involved in the systemic inflammatory response， Interleukin-6(IL-6) plays a critical role due to its capacity to boost the synthesis of acute phase proteins， notably C-Reactive Protein (CRP)， while decreasing albumin production in the liver. It also accelerates the development of megakaryocytes into platelets， is implicated in neutrophil recruitment， and can boost thrombopoietin synthesis， resulting in increased platelet numbers . Another important cytokine in the antitumoral systemic inflammatory response is TGF-B which polarizes antitumoral neutrophils into protumoral neutrophils. This polarization creates a tumor immune microenvironment conducive to tumoral growth and invasion . Numerous studies have evaluated the role of inflammatory response in the tumor microenvironment and as a result， an increasing number of inflammatory scores have been proposed for predicting survival in several tumor types. Several of these inflammatory biomarkers have been included in colorectal prognostication models such as Glasgow Prognostic Score (GPS) and modified Glasgow Prognostic Score(mGPS)， others biomarkers such as Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR)， Platelet-to-Lymphocyte Ratio (PLR) and Lymphocyte-to-Monocyte Ratio (LMR) have been extensively researched as independent prognostic factors for survival in patients with colorectal cancer.\n\n【7】The aim of the current review is to provide an overview of the role of inflammatory biomarkers in colorectal cancer prognosis.\n\n【8】Methods\n\n【9】A literature search evaluating the prognostic role of Glasgow PrognosisScore(GPS)， modified GPS(mGPS)， Neutrophil-Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR)， Platelet-Lymphocyte Ratio (PLR)， and Lymphocyte-Monocyte Ratio (LMR) was conducted in the National Library of Medicine (MEDLINE)， the Excerpta Medica database(EMBASE)， and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews(CDSR). The inclusion criteria consisted of only English-language research articles that reported on the prognostic value of the aforementioned biomarkers. We examined the title and abstract of each identified study， and the full text of the study was obtained for relevant studies.\n\n【10】Glasgow PrognosticScore (GPS)and modified Glasgow Prognostic Score (mGPS)\n\n【11】The Glasgow Prognosis Score (GPS)， an inflammation-based cancer-prognostic marker constituted of serum CRP elevation and albumin concentration decrease， is considered to reflect the host systemicinflammatory response as well as his metabolicstress，andhas been demonstrated to be a helpful prognostic factor in the survival of patients with colorectal cancer . According to the GPS individuals with both increased CRP (>10 mg/l) and hypoalbuminemia (3.5 g/dL receive a score of 2； individuals with just one parameter or none of these biochemical abnormalities receive a score of 1 or O， respectively. Since hypoalbuminemia alone does not have prognostic value the GPS has been modified as follows： The mGPS score can have a value of 0 for patients with low CRP ≤ 10 mg/L and any value of albumin，1 for patients with CRP>10 mg/L and albumin ≥ 3.5 g/dL， and 2 for patients with CRP>10 mg/L and albumin <3.5 g/dL .\n\n【12】Numerous studies have suggested that GPS/mGPS isan important prognostic factor for survival in patients diagnosed with CRC. A retrospective study that included 105 patients diagnosed with stage I-IV CRC showed that patients with elevated GPS/mGPS had a lower rate of survival independently from other common factors that influence survival such as TNM stage and tumor differentiation . Another similar retrospective study which included 271 patients with stage I-IV CRC showed that an elevated mGPS had a lower 5-year survival rate (mGPS 2 vs. mGPS 1 vs. mGPS O； 35.2% vs. 74.9% vs.92.6%，p=0.0001).\n\n【13】A high GPS score has been shown to reflect metabolic stress， more precisely malnutrition in patients with CRC . Richards et al. assessed 174 patients with CRC from stage I to III and discovered a tight connection between high mGPS and sarcopenia (p=0.001). However， there was no link between CRP and the total fat index， subcutaneous fat index， or visceral fat index. Albumin had no relationship with the total fat index or the subcutaneous fat index， but it did have a significant positive link with the visceral fat index (p=0.02) and the skeletal muscle index (p=0.001) . Mauricio et al. reported in a prospective study that all patients with a GPS 2 were malnourished according to the Subjective Global Assessment (SGA)， while 80.9% of patients with GPS 0 had no signs of malnutrition. There was a significant correlation between the three SGA categories(A-wel1l1nourished， B-moderately malnourished， C-severely malnourished)and GPS/mGPS score， suggesting inflammation's role in cancer-induced cachexia .\n\n【14】Several studies have shown that GPS/mGPS is a useful prognostic model in resectable early-stage CRC， in terms of both postoperative complications as well as survival . Moyes et al. reported an association between postoperative complications such as infectious complications， pulmonary embolism， cardiac complications， and a higher GPS . Similarly， Park et al. conducted a comprehensive retrospective analysis to assess the predictive impact of mGPS and its association with other prognostic markers in 1，000 patients with early-stage CRC (stage I to III) undergoing possibly curative surgery. A high mGPS level was linked with aging and emergency presentation(both p<0.001)， primary site， increasing T and TNM stage， poor tumor differentiation， surgical margin involvement， peritoneal involvement， and tumor perforation (all p=0.001). Cancer-Specific Survival (CSS) ranged from 80% in patients with mGPS=0 to 61% in people with mGPS =2. Overall Survival (OS) was also reduced with a5-year OS of 70% for patients with a mGPS=0 to 46% in patients with mGPS=2 .\n\n【15】The role of adjuvant chemotherapy is uncertain in stage II CRC， so newly validated prognostic models can be useful for better patient selection. A retrospective study done on 99 patients with stage II CRC who underwent curative surgery has shown that patients with a mGPS of O had a 5-year OS of 83.6%， while patients with a mGPS of 1 and 2 had a 5-year OS of 75.9% and 33.3%， respectively . A retrospective study by Sugimoto et al. reported that after multivariate analysis mGPS was the strongest prognostic factor for CSS in patients with stage II CRC， in stage III CRC therre was no significant correlation between CSS and mGPS . Some studies have reported that a higher GPS score is associated with a higher risk of distant metastasis.\n\n【16】Palliative surgical resections are advised in some patients with metastatic CRC (mCRC) to ease symptoms such as blockage， perforation， or bleeding. Kishiki et al. investigated the predictive value of mGPS in 79 mCRC patients who underwent palliative surgical procedures (resection of a main lesion alone， bypass surgery， or colostomy). The presence of lung metastases， peritoneal spread， distant metastases， low hemoglobin， elevated CRP levels， decreased albumin， and prior chemotherapy were all associated with lower overall survival. Tumor excision， adjuvant chemotherapy， and mGPS were all used. When the population was separated into three groups based on mGPS score， significant differences in mean survival time were found： with mGPS=0/1/2， CSS was 24， 18， and 8 months， respectively (95% CI of 19 to 37 months， 7 to 41 months， and 1 to 9months， respectively) .\n\n【17】A retrospective study by Adachi et al. with a cohort of 65patients with mCRC who received surgical intervention and systemic chemotherapy showed that mGPS is an independent predictor of fatality rate. A greater 3-month death rate was associated with a higher mGPS score (p=0.00001) and multivariate analysis demonstrated that mGPS (0/1，2) was an independent risk factor . Furukawa et al. investigated the role of GPS in 40 patients with unresectable synchronous and metachronous liver metastases from CRC . The absence of initial tumor resection and systemic treatment，blood CEA>100 ng/ml， serum CA19-9 100 U/ml，and GPS=2 (p=0.0362) were significant predictors of inferior outcome. Recent research has revealed that mGPS can predict outcomes in mCRC patients who have undergone chemotherapy. Ishizuka et al. conducted a retrospective study of a cohort of 112 patients who were taking chemotherapy for advanced or recurrent CRC with regimens such as FOLFIRI (5-Fluorouracil/Leucovorin/Irinotecan hydrochloride) or FOLFOX (5-Fluorouracil/l-Leucovorin/Oxaliplatin) and found that a mGPS=2 predicted a greater risk of mortality than mGPS=0 or 1(p<0.001).Only mGPS was found to be an independent risk factor of death in multivariate analyses that included neutrophil ratio， CA 19-9，CRP，albumin， and mGPS.\n\n【18】Dreanic et al. investigated the predictive effect of GPS in49 patients with mCRC who were receiving 5-fluorouracil with cetuximab and oxaliplatin (60%) or irinotecan (30%).55%，29%， and 16% of patients had GPS values of 0， 1， and 2， respectively，at the time of diagnosis. In the first group， median Progression-Free Survival (PFS) and median Overall Survival (OS) were considerably longer (p=0.0084 and 0.0093， respectively). GPS was also tested in a group of 80 patients with mCRC who were taking bevacizumab and 5-fluorouracil plus oxaliplatin (51%) or irinotecan (34%). At diagnosis，56%，31%，and 13% of patients had GPS values of 0， 1，and2， respectively. The median PFS in these groups was 10.1， 6.5， and5.6 months， respectively (p=0.16). The median OS was 20.1， 11.4， and 6.5 months (p=0.004)， respectively. Sharma et al. investigated 55patients with mCRC undertaking first-line oral capecitabine mono chemotherapy. GPS (p=0.016)， colonic primary (p=0.022)， high CEA (p=0.027)， and hypoalbuminemia (p=0.008) were significant predictors of CSS on univariate analysis； patients with GPS scores equal to 2 had a lower OS compared to those with GPS scores of 0or 1.\n\n【19】Neutrophil-to-Lym phocyte Ratio as a Prognostic Factor in CRC\n\n【20】The antitumoral inflammatory response is distinguished by an increase in circulating neutrophil levels and a decrease in circulating lymphocyte levels. Because a high concentration of neutrophils is known to promote tumor progression and to suppress the antitumor effect of lymphocytes， the Neutrophil-Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR) may be regarded as the balance between pro-tumor inflammatory status and antitumor immune status. NLR is calculated by dividing the absolute neutrophil count by the absolute lymphocyte count. Several studies suggested that an imbalance of neutrophils and lymphocytes in peripheral blood is correlated with the imbalance of the same cells in the tumor microenvironment and that this imbalance can be associated with tumor development . Although the NLR is associated with survival， the GPS/mGPS appears to be a better predictor of survival. In a large cohort study (Glasgow Inflammation Outcome Study)， mGPS outperformed the NLR. Although an advantage of NLR is that it can distinguish between good and bad prognostic groups in a range of tumor types， including CRC . A retrospective study by Inamoto et al. showed that the combination of the NLR and GPS/mGPS into a novel prognostic model for CRC survival was superior to the NLR and GPS/mGPS alone. Because of its ease of calculation， the preoperative NLR is gaining popularity as a prognostic marker； its relevance in predicting disease recurrence and postoperative problems has been explored at length in the literature. Interestingly， several studies have revealed that assessing local lymphocyte response， which is defined as a prominent lymphocytic reaction near the invasive boundary， is related to a lower NLR and thus a better prognosis . Cook et al. discovered that a high NLR value on the first postoperative day is a good predictor of postoperative complications. In this study， the NLR cut-off was high with a cut-off value of 9.3， one argument for this high cut-off value is its proximity to the surgery .\n\nIn a retrospective investigation of 524 patients with stage II-III CRC who underwent curative laparotomic resection， Kubo et al. developed a novel NLR score based on both preoperative and postoperative neutrophil and lymphocyte counts. Adjuvant chemotherapy was administered according to their risk class，156 individuals with stage III CRC and 38 patients with stage II received the treatment. Patients with R1 and R2 resections and those undergoing emergency intervention， laparoscopic surgery， multiple carcinomas， inflammatory bowel disease， preoperative clinical evidence of infection， or other inflammatory conditions were excluded. Neutrophil and lymphocyte counts were performed as follows： Before surgery， on the first postoperative day， and on the third or fourth postoperative day. Patients were categorized into two groups： Those with a low perioperative NLR (score of 0 or 1) and those with a high perioperative NLR (score of 2 or 3). NLR score was found to be an independent risk factor for both DFS (HR=1.53，95%CI 1.37； p=0.02) and CSS (HR=1.71，95% CI 1.88；p=0.04) in multivariate analyses |43.\n\n【22】In a retrospective study performed by Yasui et al. on 568 stage I-III CRC patients， patients were stratified by inflammation status：Preoperative low NLR (normal group)， preoperatively high NLR but normalized after surgery (normalized group)， and persistently high NLR (elevated group). They reported an OS time superior for the normal and normalized group compared to the elevated group .\n\n【23】The function of NLR in resectable CRC liver metastases was explored in a retrospective study of 169 patients who had liver resection after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The previously established NLR cut-off number was 2.5.HigherNLR was linked with both lower OS (HR=1.17； 95% CI， 1.03-132；p=0.011)and increased probability ofextrahepatic/multifocal recurrence (p=0.007)，implying a decreased post-recurrence survival (HR=1.24， 95% CI， 1.52； p=0.032). Similarly in another retrospective study of 289 patients with resectable liver metastases， patients with high NLR had significantly lower 5-year survival than patients with lower NLR (22% vs. 43%， p<0.001). On both univariate and multivariate analysis， high NLR was associated with a poorer survival outcome (p<0.001).\n\n【24】Ganhim et al. conducted a prospective study on 52 patients who were candidates for the first excision of CRC pulmonary metastases. Neutrophil and lymphocyte counts were measured upon admission to the hospital， prior to surgery or any other procedure. The NLR cut-off value was determined to be 4. Patients were divided into two groups， an inflammatory phenotype group (high NLR and mGPS value)， and a non-inflammatory phenotype group (no signs of systemic inflammation). The inflammatory phenotype group had a shorter median OS time as well as a shorter time to recurrence .\n\n【25】A series of retrospective studies reported that NLR could have predictive value for liver recurrence after metastasectomy. Giakoustidis et al. reported that patients with an elevated NLR had a higher risk of hepatic recurrence . Verter et al. showed that a high NLR value after metastasectomy was associated with a higher rate of extrahepatic recurrence .\n\n【26】Elevated NLR appears to be a strong predictor of poor response to palliative chemotherapy in individuals with unresectable mCRC， regardless of treatment. A retrospective by Chua et al. evaluated the prognostic role of NLR in a study that included 349 patients with unresectable mCRC who were receiving first-line palliative care chemotherapy .\n\n【27】Another retrospective study performed by Kaneko et al. included50 patients with metastatic CRC treated with oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy. After ROC curve analysis the NLR cut-off value was set to 4. In univariate analysis， a higher NLR value，hypoalbuminemia， and worse performance status was correlated with a shorter OS and PFS. In multivariate analysis， NLR (HR=4.39， 95% CI 1.7， p=0.0013) and thrombocytosis (HR=5.02， 95% CI 1.4； p=0.0066) were the only variables that were significantly associated with OS .\n\n【28】A retrospective analysis of104 patients with CRCwithunresectable liver metastases who were treated with liver radioembolization after failing first and second-line chemotherapy found that NLR could be a valuable biomarker for predicting outcome in these patients. A cutoff value of 5 was determined using ROC analysis. The median survival time for patients with elevated NLR was 5.6 vs. 10.6 months. A high NLR value， a lack of radiographic response after radioembolization， and the presence of extrahepatic illness were all independently correlated with an increased risk of death in a multivariate analysisJ.\n\n【29】Platelet-to-Lym phocyte Ratio (PLR)\n\n【30】Similar to neutrophils platelets are a common blood component with a significant role in the antitumoral inflammatory response. Thrombocytosis is frequently detected in solid tumor patients with persistent inflammation . Platelets can stimulate tumor growth by secreting a variety of cytokines and growth factors in the tumor microenvironment that are conducive to tumor growth and invasion. The main cytokines are proangiogenic factors such as Vascular Epidermal Growth Factor (VEGF) and Transforming Growth Factor-Beta (TGF-B). PLR is a well-known prognostic factor for CRC， an increase in platelet count is usually associated with a decrease in lymphocyte count.\n\n【31】Most studies assessed or compared the Platelet-Lymphocyte Ratio (PLR) to the NLR. In a retrospective study conducted by Emir et al.， PLR was assessed in three groups of patients： The first with only colorectal polyps (n=100； Group A)， the second with CRC (n=113； Group B)， and the third with solely healthy people (n=124； Group C). Patients in group B had a higher median NLR and PLR value compared to patients in groups A and C. There was no significant difference between groups A and C regarding NLR and PLR .\n\n【32】Ishizuka et al. assessed the predictive value of an inflammation-based prognostic score which includes platelet count and the NLR in retrospective research on 490 patients with resectable CRC. The COP-NLR (Combination of Platelet count and Neutrophil to Lymphocyte Ratio)， was calculated as follows： Patients with elevated NLR (>3) and elevated platelet count (>30×104mm) were allocated 2 points， and patients with only one parameter elevated parameter had a score of 1. Patients with no elevated parameters had a score of 0. In both univariate and multivariate analyses， the COP-NLR score showed a significant correlation with CSS .\n\n【33】Patients with stage II CRC and low preoperative PLR who have undergone curative surgery had no high risk of recurrence and did not benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy exhibited significantly better CSS and PFS compared to patients with high preoperative PLR .\n\n【34】He et al. looked at the prognostic and predictive value of NLR and PLR in 243 patients with newly diagnosed mCRC， excluding those with infection， hematological illness， hyperpyrexia， or intestinal obstruction. While only the NLR was verified as an independent predictive factor for OS in multivariate analysis， elevated levels of both the NLRand PLR were related to a shorter OS time in univariate analysis， showing that the NLR is preferable to the PLR as a prognostic factor for survival in CRC patients .\n\n【35】Ir.a retrospective study by Erstad et al.， 151 patients with Colorectal Liver Metastases (CRLM) who underwent liver resection a PLR>220 and an NLR>5 were independent variables that decreased OS in both univariate as well as multivariate analysis .\n\n【36】The role of PLR as a predictive factor for patients with resected CRLM was evaluated in a retrospective study by Neofytou et al.； preoperative NLR was high (>2.4) in 53 patients while preoperative PLR was high (>150) in 58 patients. Elevated NLR and PLR were associated with decreased OS and PFS in univariate analysis， while only PLR remained significantly associated with PFS and OS in multivariate analysis.\n\n【37】Lym phocyte-to-Monocyte Ratio (LMR)\n\n【38】Monocytes play a vital role in tumor growth in the tumor microenvironment. Tumor-Associated Macrophages (TAMs) are formed when monocytes differentiate into protumoral macrophages as a result of the tumor microenvironment. TAMs can contribute to tumor infiltration and metastasis. Circulating lymphocytes， on the other hand， can transform into Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes(TILs) by migrating into the tumor microenvironment； it has been established that stage III CRC patients with a high number of TILs had a better prognosis .\n\n【39】Zhang et al. reported in a study done on 270 patients with resected T3N0M0 CRC that an elevated monocyte count(>595/mm) was correlated with poor OS and DFS . Similarly， Sasaki et al. reported that an elevated monocyte count(>300/mm’) was associated with poor CSS in CRC patients with liver metastases who underwent Imetastasectomy .\n\n【40】A study of 372 patients with stage II and III colon cancer found that patients with preoperative LMR>2.83 had significantly better time-to-recurrence and OS than patients with LMR≤2.83 and that the benefit of adjuvant 5-FU-based chemotherapy was limited to patients with LMR>2.83. Increased preoperative LMR was associated with longer time-to-recurrence (HR=0.47， 95% CI： 0.29-0.76， p=0.002) and OS (HR=0.48， 95% CI： 0.29-0.78，p=0.003) in univariate analysis and remained significant in multivariate analysis for both time-to-recurrence and OS .\n\n【41】Chang et al. were the first to use SIS as a predictive factor in patients with renal cell carcinoma. SIS is a novelprognostic modelthat uses the serum albumin level and LMR. Patients with albumin >4.0 g/dL and LMR>4.44 were assigned a score of 0， patients with albumin>4.0 g/dL and LMR>4.44 were assigned a score of 2， and everyone else was assigned a score of 1 . Suzuki et al. examined 727 stages I-IV CRC patients who underwent curative resection and found that higher SIS and higher mGPS scores were both independently related to a worse prognosis . By using a time-dependent ROC curve to assess the prediction abilities of SIS and mGPS， they discovered that SIS was a better prognostic model for OS than mGPS.\n\n【42】CRP-Related Markers\n\n【43】CRP is an excellent biomarker to evaluate the inflammation status of cancer patients. As a prognostic factor in CRC Koike et al. evaluated 300 patients with CRC and showed that a high preoperative value ofCRP (>0.5 mg/dL) wasan independent predictor ofprognosis. Another CRP-related prognostic marker is the Lymphocyte-C-Reactive protein ratio (LCR). In a large retrospective study by Suzuki et al.， they evaluated the prognostic value of 16 inflammation-related markers such as NLR， LMR， PLR， Neutrophil-to-Albumin Ratio(NAR)， Monocyte-Albumin (MAR)， Platelet-Albumin Ratio (PAR) and LCR in 1303 patients with stage II-III CRC. The study reported that a low LCR value (≤ 12，980) was associated with a lower OS and DFS median time .\n\n【44】A similar prognostic marker to LCR for CRC survival is CAR(C-reactive protein-to-albumin ratio). Several studies have evaluated the role of CAR in postoperative CRC survival， the main consensus is that a higher value is significantly correlated to a shorter OS and CSS .\n\n【45】Discussion\n\n【46】One of the most important indications of tumor development ISthe cancer-associatedsystemic inflammatory response.The relationship between hematological indicators of the systemic inflammatory response and survival outcomes in cancer patients has been an intensely studied subject. One of the most important indications of tumor development is the cancer-associated systemic inflammatory response. Numerous previous studies have identified serum systemic inflammatory markers that can be used to predict prognoses， such as the Glasgow Prognostic Score and the modified Glasgow Prognostic (GPS/mGPS)， Neutrophil-Lymphocyte Ratio(NLR)， Lymphocyte-Monocyte Ratio (LMR)， Platelet-Lymphocyte Ratio (PLR)， LCR (Lymphocyte-C-Reactive protein ratio)， SIS(Systemic Inflammation Score). One of the biggest advantages of these markers is their availability by use of routine blood examinations.\n\n【47】Despite these advantages， the majority of studies that evaluated potential inflammatory prognostic markers are retrospective in nature and do not have a shared platform of exclusion criteria regarding patient pathologies or treatments that could skew the blood cell count. Also， the best cut-off value can vary between patient groups and cancer types， which makes any conclusion regarding the clinical utility of these scores difficult. However， the results of the studies presented in this review suggest that inflammatory biomarkers of prognosis have value in patients treated with curative intent， in patients with advanced CRC that receive palliative chemotherapy where inflammation scores have been associated with PFS， and in patients with resectable liver or lung metastases where inflammation scores seem to be associated with a poor DFS.\n\n【48】In this review， we have analyzed the main inflammatory biomarkers that havebeen developed andvalidated，and accumulating evidence suggests that inflammation-based biomarkers appear to be independent powerful prognostic indicators； thus， combining these criteria with traditional clinicopathological markers may be beneficial. Further prospective research is needed to find the optimal cut-off values.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 11:12:36", "endTime": "2024/09/24 11:12:46", "cost": 10.55}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:34", "update_time": "2024-09-23 19:12:44", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 19:12:33"}

Often， these tumors will present as hematuria- which is regarded as benign. Because of this presentation， pediatric patients often are not diagnosed until years after their initial presentation. We present a 4-year-old female patient who presented initially at 6 months with progressive hematuria that ultimately ended up being diagnosed with a bladder teratoma. In conclusion， bladder teratomas should be included in the initial work-up when presenting with hematuria.\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Bladder tumors are uncommon in children with an incidence of 0.1% to 0.4% during the first two decades of life . Malignant teratomas， yolk sac tumors， and all germ cell tumors in pediatric patients are exceedingly rare and most often affect females . There has been no specific genetics identified for bladder teratomas specifically， but there have been familial cases of ovarian teratomas identified in several subsequent generations .\n\n【4】Teratomas are the most common germ celltumor and are defined histologically as a combination of ectoderm， mesoderm， and endoderm as well as being grossly heterogeneous with both solid and cystic features . Most mature cystic teratomas are composed of ectoderm-derived epidermis， sebaceous glands and hair follicles and mesoderm-derived dermal stromal elements. However，there have been rare cases of teratomas Containing Gastrointestinal (GI) epithelium and an organized GI tract which is true in this case . The most common teratomas are sacrococcygeal and ovarian in origin， with bladder teratomas being exceptionallyrare . Teratomas are primarily asymptomatic and often found incidentally on imaging. When allowed to grow undiscovered， they have been shown to have mass effects in the affecting organ. When localized to the urinary system，teratomas have been shown to emulate bladder and ureteral calculi such as lower urinary tract symptoms， hematuria， and urinary retention . The most pathognomonic symptom of bladder teratoma in pilimiction， the passage of hair in urine .\n\n【5】There is little known about bladder tumors in the pediatric population，so it can lead to a delay in diagnosis and deleterious therapy . Although the surgical management ofthese tumors is well reported， there is no consensus on the surveillance or follow-up of these patients . We report the case of a 4-year-old child presenting with a bladder teratoma and discuss the diagnostic and therapeutic aspects of bladder tumors in children.\n\n【6】Case Presentation\n\n【7】This is a 4-year-old female child， with no notable pathological history， referred from a regional hospital to our department for gross hematuria with clots. This clinical picture evolved from the age of 6 months with initial intermittent terminal hematuria then progressing to total hematuria associated withhypogastric pain. She had been hospitalized several times in different hospital systems without any definitive etiology being attributed to this hematuria before being referred. On physical examination， the patient presented with pale mucous membranes， hypogastric tenderness， and a soiled diaper with observed blood clots. A biological assessment had demonstrated a microcvtic hypochromic anemia at 4.8 g/dl with a hematocrit of 12%. An Emmel test performed came back positive. The kidney workup was unremarkable. An ultrasound of the urinary tree indicated an irregular peripheral tissue thickening of the bladder wall， vascularized by Doppler， suggesting a bladder tumor. A uroscan was performed and revealed a tumor of the bladder dome associated with right inguinal and external iliac lymph nodes . A cystoscopy under general anesthesia b) Frontal Reconstruction b) Internal Face was performed preoperatively and revealed an ulcerative budding tumor of the dome and of the right anterolateral wall of the bladder. The surgical intervention was performed by a median infra-umbilical laparotomy and revealed a vascular tumor of the dome and of the anterolateral wall of the right bladder . We performed a partial cystectomy up to 1.5 cm of the ureteral meatus. The operative part measured 7cm×5 cm×2 cm . Postoperatively，therewas a disappearance of hematuria and anemia with a hemoglobin level of13.1 g/dl. The post-operative follow-up ultrasound revealed a normal bladder. Anatomopathological examination of the surgical specimens revealed ulceration on the bladder surface. It also revealed edematous dissociation of the bladder chorion including hyperplasia of blood lymphatic vessels and capillaries giving a cavernous appearance； this is typically associated with intestinal metaplasia supporting the diagnosis of a bladder teratoma. At 7 months postoperative， there was a recurrence of hematuria which prompted the performance of a cystoscopy under general anesthesia. The cystoscopy demonstrated localized neovascularization in the bladder without tun0T recurrence. One month later at 8 months postoperative， the patient reports normal urination with disappearance of hematuria as well as satisfactory continence.\n\n【8】Discussion\n\n【9】The benign nature of hematuria misleads clinicians when approaching a diagnosis of bladder teratoma. However， the most frequent reason for consultation for a bladder tumor is hematuria as seen in our patient . Teratomas typically have a median age presentation of 30 years old which why this differential not expected. Contributing to the complexity of this case， teratomas have an insidious nature growing at a slow-rate with an average of 1.8 mm per year subsequently further delaying their diagnosis .\n\n【10】The first-line examination in children is the ultrasound of the urinary tract， given its accessibility . Cystoscopy allows a definite diagnosis， but is rarely used in children given the need for general anesthesia and the risk of urethral injury . Cystoscopy was used in our patient preoperatively .\n\n【11】Treatment for bladder tumors includes partial cystectomy versu radical cystectomy. Partial cystectomy has obvious advantages over radical cystectomy. Namely， its bladder-saving approach avoids the need for urinary diversion， maintains erectile function in males， can be done under regional anesthesia， and is associated with lower morbidity and mortality . In our patient， we used the partial cystectomy approach. Several other cases of bladder teratomas also used partial cystectomy approaches with success . The prognosis for bladder tumors is often favorable as shown by a meta-analysis with a recurrence rate of 3.4% and death rate of 1%.\n\n【12】Conclusion\n\n【13】Despite the often-benign nature of hematuria in children， it is essential that any practitioner eliminate a bladder tumor. An ultrasound and a cystoscopy will confirm the diagnosis. The evolution is favorable after resection of the tumor. The follow-up must include investigation with serial ultrasounds and cystoscopies in front of any recurrence of the signs.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 11:33:56", "endTime": "2024/09/24 11:34:39", "cost": 43.274}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:34", "update_time": "2024-09-23 19:34:38", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 19:33:55"}

Hypercalcemia develops in approximately 10% of the sarcoidosis patients while it has also been described in patients with other granulomatous diseases such as tuberculosis. This abnormality of calcium metabolism is caused by the dysregulated production of calcitriol by activated macrophages in the granulomatous foci of sarcoidosis. Undetected hypercalcemia may have deleterious sequela in sarcoidosis patients， especially without a previous diagnosis， such as nephrocalcinosis and renal failure. This metabolic defect may be exacerbated by sun exposure，phosphorus or vitamin D intake.\n\n【2】We present seven cases of sarcoidosis to define the clinical features of such patients who are prone to develop hypercalcemia induced by vitamin D treatment. While only two of our patients had a previously diagnosed sarcoidosis， it was detected in the others while investigating the cause of hypercalcemia. Given the rarity of hypercalcemia due to sarcoidosis and its crucial consequences， it is an imperative that the clinicians should definitely consider the possibility of sarcoidosis before commencing vitamin D treatment to their patients. The sarcoidosis features of our case series reveal the criteria required for clinicians to suspect a possible sarcoidosis disease antecedently and to determine the diagnosis before iatrogenic hypercalcemia develops.\n\n【3】Keywords： Sarcoidosis； Hypercalcemia； Vitamin D； Iatrogenic hypercalcemia\n\n【4】Introduction\n\n【5】Hypercalcemia is a relatively common clinical problem that results when the entry of calcium into the circulation exceeds the excretion of calcium into the urine or deposition in bone. It has been described mostly in patients with granulomatous diseases . Among them， sarcoidosis  and tuberculosis  are probably the most common. Sarcoidosis is a chronic granulomatous disorder of unknown origin characterized by the presence of non-classified granulomas in various organs including lung disease in 95% of the patients while eyes， skin and lymph nodes are other commonly involved organs . Hypercalcemia occurs in 4% to 11% of the sarcoidosis patients caused by the increased conversion of 25-hydroxyvitamin D to 1，25-hydroxyvitamin D by the enzyme 25-hydroxyvitamin-D-1a-hydroxylase in the macrophages of pulmonary alveoli and granulomas .\n\n【6】We report seven cases of sarcoidosis patients who presented with hypercalcemia due to prior vitamin D treatment. Hypercalcemia is a well-known metabolic feature of sarcoidosis that may lead to serious clinical consequences if undetected. In patients with a previously known or unknown sarcoidosis diagnosis， clinicians should be meticulous for hypercalcemia in regard to its significant challenges before commencing vitamin D treatment to their patients. In this case series， the clinical manifestations of sarcoidosis patients with iatrogenic hypercalcemia are investigated. Our aim is to define the clinical features of sarcoidosis patients who are prone to develop a possible iatrogenic hypercalcemia thereby to predict and prevent the occurrence of high serum calcium levels beforehand in patients with or without a previously known sarcoidosis diagnosis.\n\n【7】Case 1 cited. A 42-year-old male presented with a 2-weeks history of fever and dysuria. He was a non- smoker. Past history included sarcoidosis of ten years and a surgical resection for thyroid carcinoma six years ago. His father and brother had sarcoidosis. The patient had been commenced on oral vitamin D treatment for deficiency four weeks ago. His vital signs revealed an intermittent fever of 37.8C， blood pressure of 140/70 mmHg， a heart rate of 84 beats/min and a respiratory rate of 14 breaths/min. Serum biochemistry and blood count tests were normal except for an elevated serum calcium (13.6 mg/dl) level. Tuberculin test was negative.

Histopathology of the cutaneous biopsy demonstrated non-classified granulomas in the dermis with epithelioid histiocytes and CD4+ T lymphocytes. Ophthalmologic examination revealed anterior uveitis. Final diagnosis was stage III sarcoidosis with associated hypercalcemia ocular and cutaneous involvement. Methylprednisolone 32mgwas commenced for sarcoidosis treatment.\n\n【20】Discussion\n\n【21】Hypercalcemia is an uncommon medical condition that primarily occurs due to primary hyperparathyroidism and malignancy associated with bone metastasis or paraneoplastic syndromes. It has also been described in granulomatous disorders such as sarcoidosis， tuberculosis， berylliosis and leprosy . Sarcoidosis is a chronic disease characterized by granulomatous inflammation and the presence of non-classified granulomas in the involved organs， mainly the lungs， lymph nodes and skin . Hypercalcemia is detected in approximately 10% of the sarcoidosis patients due to the abnormal calcium metabolism secondary to increased synthesis of calcitriol by macrophages . We present seven cases ofiatrogenic hypercalcemia due to vitamin D treatment in patients with or without a previously known sarcoidosis diagnosis.\n\n【22】The most crucial feature of these patients was the presence of sarcoidosis associated hypercalcemia that was exacerbated due to the prior vitamin D treatment commenced for osteoporosis or vitamin D deficiency. The second point was the presence of advanced sarcoidosis designated as stage III in all patients. The third hallmark was the existence of three organ sarcoidosis in these cases. Following steroid treatment， the clinical course of sarcoidosis became stable while the calcium levels returning to normal in each patient. The triangulation point of these cases was the necessityto undergoa thorough evaluation in terms sarcoidosis， that may lead to iatrogenichypercalcemia， for all patients who are be treated with vitamin D since it is well-known that unnoticed or in discriminable hypercalcemia may lead to deleterious effects. As the results of our study indicate， some clinical features of sarcoidosis appear to be useful in predetermining the probability of iatrogenic hypercalcemia that may develop following vitamin D treatment in sarcoidosis patients with or without a previous known diagnosis. hypercalcemia in sarcoidosis . Albright et al. have shown that hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria in sarcoidosis was due to the elevated levels of vitamin D . Bell et al. have revealed that levels of 1，25-dihyroxy vitamin D was the cause for abnormal calcium metabolism in sarcoidosis patients . Since vitamin D production is substrate-dependent， the development of hypercalcemia due to vitamin Dtreatment in patients with sarcoidosis is a great possibility. It is well-known that special care is required in sarcoidosis patients who are to be supplemented with vitamin D or calcium  and thereby close monitoring of serum calcium levels is required to prevent the occurrence ofhypercalcemia in these patients. Seven cases developed hypercalcemia due to the vitamin D treatment while only one of these had a previously diagnosed sarcoidosis in our case series. Presence of unidentified sarcoidosis in patients to be treated with vitamin D appears to be a crucial risk for iatrogenic hypercalcemia. Such a possibility should always be considered by clinicians.\n\n【23】In patients with a medical history of sarcoidosis in their background， the effects of vitamin D treatment can be easily monitored. The problem arises inpatients with a previously undiagnosed sarcoidosis when exogenous vitamin D supplementation is commenced. The deleterious outcome of high serum calcium may occur through organs such as the heart. Drawback becomes extremely crucial especially if patients are in an asymptomatic clinical profile for sarcoidosis that may lead to severe consequences if unnoticed or if a delay occurs for diagnosis. In our case series of seven patients， the greatest problem was that only two of the patients had a previously identified sarcoidosis while all of the patients were completely asymptomatic and did not even show the slightest clue relevant to sarcoidosis. The hallmark of these cases is that it may be necessary to evaluate patients for sarcoidosis before starting vitamin D treatment to avoid the serious clinical side effects of iatrogenic hypercalcemia.\n\n【24】There are some points associated with the weakness of our case series size. The first is the small sample size consisting of only seven patients. This is probably related tothelow incidence ofhypercalcemia in sarcoidosis patients. The other point is that all patients in our series were of Caucasian origin. It is well-known that sarcoidosis may exhibit many different manifestations according to race or genetic differences in terms of the clinical profile， involved organs，treatment response and disease course. Consequently， studies including a large number of patients from different races with distinct genetic characteristics are required to achieve more precise and explicit results. Whether the patients had a previous diagnosis of sarcoidosis or not， it would be extremely useful to define the clinical criteria to predict the probability of iatrogenic hypercalcemia in such cases， as only two ofthe patients had a previously identified sarcoidosis.\n\n【25】The important hallmark of our case series is the common features and the mutual clinical profle shared by all ofour sarcoidosis patients who developed hypercalcemia due to vitamin Dtreatment. The first is that they had advanced sarcoidosis compatible with stage III disease. Second， each subject had a chronic and persistent sarcoidosis profile that required steroid treatment. The third point was that the patients had three organ involvement including lung， eye， skin or lymph node. The fourth and perhaps the most interesting aspect of our cases was that the patients presented with atypical symptoms or with a bizarre clinical profile that were not easily to be attributed to sarcoidosis although they had stage III disease. Hypercalcemia in sarcoidosis is caused by the abnormality of the calcium metabolism induced by the increased synthesis of calcitriol or vitamin D by macrophages of the granulomatous lesions. High levels of active vitamin D due to hydroxylase activity in macrophages is the most probable cause of hypercalcemia but overproduction of bone resorbing cytokines and parathyroid-related peptide may also play a role . As hypercalcemia is due to the abnormal calcium metabolism secondary to increased synthesis of calcitriol by macrophages that are abundant in granulomas， patients with multiple organ involvement appear to carry a more significant risk of hypercalcemia due to the high load of granulomatous tissue. As clearly seen from our cases， the risk of hypercalcemia in sarcoidosis may have arisen due to the high granuloma load due to three organ involvement. The hazard of may also be associated advanced sarcoidosis stage. The presence of these two aforementioned criteria appears to be extremely helpful to anticipate hypercalcemia in such patients. Sarcoidosis associated hypercalcemia can present with an insidious clinical picture that may cause a diagnostic challenge for the clinician and thereby requires a great suspicion for its identification. Existence of previously undiagnosed sarcoidosis should always be considered for patients for whom vitamin D treatment is to be commenced.Common clinical features of sarcoidosis patients in our case series appear to be useful in predicting or identifying the patients who carry a risk of iatrogenic hypercalcemia.\n\n【26】Conclusion\n\n【27】Sarcoidosis may occur unnoticed due to its asymptomatic and insidious clinical nature. In patients with a previously diagnosed or undiagnosed sarcoidosis， clinicians should bear in mind the possibility for the existence of this disorder because vitamin D treatment may lead to significantly high serum calcium levels that may cause deleterious effects. Hypercalcemia of sarcoidosis is due to the abnormal calcium metabolism secondary to increased synthesis of calcitriol by macrophages that are abundant in granulomatous lesions or tissues. Consequently， advanced disease and triple organ involvement in sarcoidosis patients appears to carry a significant hazard for vitamin D induced hypercalcemia due to the higher burden of granulomas comprising numerous macrophages that lead to increased synthesis of calcitriol. Clinical features of sarcoidosis identified among our sarcoidosis case series can be useful to identify patients that carry a high risk of developing iatrogenic hypercalcemia who are to be treated with calcitriol whether or not they present with a prior diagnosis of sarcoidosis. Clinicians should also bear in mind that patients may be completely asymptomatic， may appear with symptoms or a clinical profile that cannot be easily predicated to sarcoidosis.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 10:44:35", "endTime": "2024/09/24 10:44:43", "cost": 8.706}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:34", "update_time": "2024-09-23 18:44:41", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 18:44:32"}

The sputum constituted of saliva and phlegm in various proportions. No hemorrhage was noted. He suffers from COPD and is on inhalers， nebulization by bronchodilators and steroids since 1996. Since last one year， he is also on nistami powder - a combination of indacaterol and glycopyrronium inhalation. Despite cough there was no sense of constriction in chest， neither any spasmodic component he was familiar with. On that particular day， he had not taken any dose of inhaler as he had not felt any necessity for it. During the bout of cough， however， he decided to inhale nistami powder. There was some relief but still the impulse to cough continued. He sucked in some lozenges thereafter. It really had no effect but before lying down， he decided to take in Foracort (formoterol and budesonide) inhaler in apprehension of disturbed sleep. As he inhaled， he coughed out a single piece of gram seed of about5 mm x5 mm.  indicating the real cause of his cough The patient recalled a bout of cough during the dinner on 1.7.2021， when he had eaten a vegetable preparation containing gram seeds.\n\n【2】Patient does not suffer from any neurological disease but has a habit ofeating fast.\n\n【3】In the past history， a similar episode had occurred following ingestion of small garlic of similar size. During that bout the material was coughed out about 6 h to 7 h after the episode.\n\n【4】In both cases， patient had no further untoward effect.\n\n【5】Discussion\n\n【6】Inhalation of foreign body in airway is more common in children than adults . Statistics related to spontaneous expulsion of foreign body are almost valueless as it is difficult to detect whether it was lodged in larynx or lower down in bronchi1. Many a times no history is available. In this particular patient， confusion could have arisen as he is a COPD patient. These patients also have bouts of cough with a feeling of constriction in chest and bronchial spasm.

The chest x-ray suggested cardiomegaly and bilateral pleural effusions both of which were new compared to 2 years ago. Inflammatory markers were raised. Sepsis 6 protocols were followed including treatment with broad spectrum antibiotics. A CTPA was performed and showed bilateral pleural effusions and a moderate globalpericardialeffusion. Bedside echocardiographythe next morning confirmed a moderate global pericardial effusion. No clear echocardiographic features of tamponade were present and no pulsus paradoxus elicited but in view of her resistant hypotension requiring inotropes despite adequate filling a decision was made to perform urgent pericardiocentesis. An urgent pericardiocentesis was performed and an immediate improvement in blood pressure was observed. The pericardial fluid had an unusual creamy color and slightly viscous consistency. Pericardial fluid cultures later confirmed the presence of Haemophilus Influenzae. A Mirena coil was inserted one month prior to admission. A high vaginal swab from the intrauterine mirena coil revealed H. Influenzae infection and prompted removal of the device and full recovery of the patient. We have reviewed PubMed and found 10 cases of H. Influenzae pericardial effusion and tamponade in adults. This appears to be the first reported case where the primary focus of Haemophilus Influenzae appears to have been related to an intrauterine device. It also illustrates the importance of considering tamponade where classical physical and echocardiographic signs are not present.\n\n【2】Keywords： Haemophilus influenzae； Pericarditis\n\n【3】Patient Presentation\n\n【4】An otherwise healthy 47 year old lady was admitted to the medical admissions unit of our District General Hospital with a one week history ofpericarditis chest pain， followed by collapse. She normally kept fit， with regular horse riding. Two weeks prior to admission she started experiencing periodical chills， rigors and night sweating. She then developed pericarditis chest pain and a non-productive cough with associated pleuritic chest pain. She was treated for a lower respiratory tract infection by her GP but she did not improve and on the day of the admission she collapsed， prompting her to visit the emergency department The only past medical history was of hypertension and uterine fibroids with associated heavy periods. A Mirena Coil device had been implanted one month prior to presentation. There had been no recent foreign travel or known contact with infectious illness. She had no known drug allergies and took no regular medication.\n\n【5】On initial assessment the patient was found to be profoundlyhypotensive (BP 80/60) and pyrexial(37.6). She was tachycardia (116/min)， oliguric， tachypnoeic (26/min) and hypoxic with saturation by pulse oximetry of 94% on 28% oxygen. Sepsis six protocols were followed in accordance with local guidelines. A full set of bloods was sent including lactate and she was established on fluid resuscitation (3 L over the first hour). She was catheterised to monitor urine output. Broad spectrum antibiotics were administered.\n\n【6】Physical examination revealed her to be peripherally cool with no peripheral signs of endocarditis. Heart sounds were normal with no murmur or rub evident. Kussmaul’s sign was negative and pulsus paradoxus was not evident either. Respiratory and abdominal examinations were unremarkable.\n\n【7】Laboratory studies were notable for a white blood cell count of 17，000 with 85% neutrophils， hematocrit of 40.1%， platelet count of 435，000， blood urea nitrogen of 16.5 mmol/L， acute kidney injury with creatinine of 166 umol/L and an eGFR of 29， (ALT：122 i.u/L； ALP： 144 i.u/L， bilirubin：\n\n【8】Table 1： Timeline.\n\n| Day  | Events  |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1  | Patient presents acutely with one week history of pericarditis chest pain， followed by collapse.  |\n| 1  | Initial assessment suggested septic shock and she was transferred to ICU.  |\n| 1  | Hypotensive： adrenaline infusion commenced and broad spectrum antibiotics.  |\n| 2  | Worsening hypotension-increasing adrenaline requirements.

Cardiac biomarkers were negative for myocardial injury.\n\n【13】ECG showed sinus rhythm with a heart rate of 116 bpm and widespread， concave， ST elevation with PR segment depression， consistent with pericarditis .\n\n【14】A chest x-ray showed a globular heart and bilateral pleural effusions.\n\n【15】Despite the initial aggressive fluid resuscitation she remained hypotensive and was commenced on inotropes to maintain an adequate blood pressure. She was treated as sepsis ofunknown origin with IV ceftriaxone and metronidazole.\n\n【16】As the initial investigations revealed acute kidney injury and the ECG were felt to be in keeping with pericarditis， an urgent CT-Thorax was ordered to assess the patient as an echocardiogram was not available out of hours. The CT-thorax demonstrated small bilateral effusions and a global pericardial effusion with estimated volume 250ml to 500 ml .\n\n【17】The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit for continued inotropic support and the following day despite use of inotropes she remained hypotensive， therefore an urgent echocardiogram and Cardiology review were sought in order to exclude tamponade in view of the CT result. This showed 1.3 cm circumferential pericardial effusion .\n\n【18】No clear echocardiographic features of tamponade were present and no pulsus paradoxus elicited but in view of her resistant hypotension requiring inotropesdespite adequate filling the cardiologist elected to perform urgent pericardiocentesis.\n\n【19】670 ml of an unusual creamy color and slightly viscous consistency pericardial fluid was drained. A sample was sent off for culture. Notably her Mean Blood Pressure (MAP) and urine output immediately improved post procedure and she was fully weaned off inotropes by 2 hours after the drain insertion .\n\n【20】A CT of thorax，abdomen and pelvis after the effusion was drained showed that the pericardial effusion had resolved， moderate bilateral pleural effusions remained and a high density uterine mass (7.5cm) was noted and thought to be consistent with a large fibroid. An intrauterine device in situ was also seen. No abscess or other source of infection identified. Cultures of the pleural effusions and high vaginal swabs were also performed.\n\n【21】In the next 24 hours all cultures sent (pericardial fluid， pleural effusion and high vaginal swab) came back positive for H. Influenzae. The Mirena Coil was identified as the cause of the infection and it was removed by the Gynaecology team. She was started on the appropriate antibiotics and thereafter patient made a speedy recovery. At3，6and12 month follow up there has been no evidence of pericardial effusion or constriction.\n\n【22】The following tests were also normal or negative： abdominal ultrasound，bloodcultures，HIVtest，PCRforRSV，parainfluenza virus type 1-4， Adenovirus， Mycoplasma pneumonia， Metapneumovirus， Rhinovirus， Chlamydia， gonorrhea， Leptospira and serology for EBV and Lyme.\n\n【23】Discussion\n\n【24】In the era of antibiotics Haemophilus Influenzae related bacterial pericarditis is rare with only 10-15 cases report to date， with majority of these relating to the pre-antibiotic era .\n\n【25】We have searched PubMed for similar cases of purulent pericarditis and tamponade secondary to Haemophilus. We found8 pediatric cases and 8 cases in adults. We believe his is the first case report of Haemophilus Influenzae pericarditis with associated pericardial tamponade secondary to an infected intrauterine device in an immunologically competent adult.\n\n【26】There are two previous cases of associated pericardial tamponade. Drainage of the effusion hastens recovery and normalization of the haemodynamics. Although previously pericardiectomy or formation of pericardial window was common practice in such cases ， in this case pericardial drainage with antibiotics had a completely successful outcome with no constrictive pericarditis on follow up so far.\n\n【27】Although Haemophilus Influenzae most commonly affects the respiratory tract in adults， other source of infection should be actively sought as evidenced by the mirena coil device being the culprit in this case 5.\n\n【28】This case demonstrates Haemophilus Influenzae pericarditis with pericardial tamponade although rare can present with severe sepsis which is poorly responsive to inotropes . It also illustrates the importance of considering tamponade where classical physical and echocardiographic signs are not present.\n\n【29】Conclusion\n\n【30】Bacterial pericarditis due to Haemophilus Influenzae can lead to pericardial effusion with haemodynamic compromise even when the classical clinical or echocardiography signs are not present.\n\n【31】Prompt treatment with antibiotics along with drainage of the pericardial effusion and identification of the source bacteraemia is vital to complete resolution. Cultures of all effusions and in situ devices (when possible) are essential.\n\n【32】In this case the outcome was excellent with early antibiotic treatment. Constrictive pericarditis post Haemophilus Influenzae pericarditis did not occur but focussed follow-up echo is important.

Tramadol undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism by a number of pathways including CYP2D6， CYP3A4 and by conjugation with subsequent renal excretion. Tramadol is composed of 1：1 racemic mixture of± enantiomers and± enantiomers.\n\n【5】±Tramadol inhibits serotonin reuptake and -Tramadol inhibits Norepinephrine reuptake. The major metabolite of ± Tramadol activates mu (p) receptor . The range of blood levels in adults is approximately 100 ng/ml to 300 ng/ml (0.1 ug/ml to 0.2 ug/ml). The recommended dose of400 mg/day is considered as maximum approved dose . Tramadol hydrochloride is a lipophilic substance that completely penetrates the barrier between blood and brain. The level of plasma besieges peak around 1.5 h after taking and 5 h to 6 h is the half life of plasma exclusion. One of the complications of the tramadol use is the seizure which is most often generalized tonic-clonic . Here we are presenting a case report of a 29-year-old male patient， who had an episode of seizure， following single oral dose of Tramadol.\n\n【6】Case Presentation\n\n【7】A 29 year old male patient came to the orthopedic OPD， with history of low back pain following fall from height. He was prescribed oral tablet tramadol hydrochloride 37.5 mg twice daily for five days. After one hour oftaking first dose oftablet tramadol， he developed morbilliform rashes all over the body. One day later he developed generalized tonic clonic seizure followed by loss of consciousness for 5 min. The patient was rushed to emergency department and managed conservatively with injection lorazepam and tramadol was stopped. He had no history of similar episode in the past. On examination the patient was conscious， oriented to time， place and person. The temperature was 39°C， the heart rate 136 beats per min， the blood pressure 130/80 mmHg， and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. On neurological examination， the patient's mental status was normal. There was no involvement of cranial nerve. Motor testing revealed full symmetric strength in the arms and legs. Deep-tendon reflexes were2+ and symmetric. Other systematic examinations were also normal. Blood levels of electrolytes， glucose， vitamin B12 (cobalamin) were normal， as were results of tests of kidney， liver， and thyroid function. The complete blood count， erythrocyte sedimentation rate， and creatine kinase level were normal. His Electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed atrial fibrillation with controlled ventricular rate. Computed Tomography(CT) of the head，performed after theintravenous administration of contrast material， was normal. An Electroencephalogram (EEG) was done after neurology consultation and revealed normal study. Cardiology consultation was taken for atrial fibrillation and was advised for transthoracic echocardiography which revealed normal study. The repeat ECG was done on day 2 of admission and showed normal sinus rhythm . Patient improved with the conservative management and was discharged uneventfully and was found to be doing well at regular follow-ups.\n\n【8】Discussion\n\n【9】Tramadol is a“bimodal agent that possesses activity at opioid and monoaminergic (serotonergic and non-adrenergic) pathways in the CNS. Tramadol is commonly used in place of other potent opioid analgesics for treatment of moderate to moderately severe pain associated with osteoarthritis， rheumatoid arthritis， and low back pain and neuropathic conditions . There are controversies about the seizure inducing effect oftramadol. Some earlier studies suggested that Tramadol when given in overdose in patients with extant disorder of seizure or when used along with antidepressants， alcohol etc. instigates seizure . It was also disclosed from other studies that Tramadol also instigates seizure when used as monotherapy in approved dose. It has also been found that appearance of seizure following tramadol use is not dose dependant . However， in our patient the seizure occurred at a dose of 37.5 mg oral tramadol hydrochloride. Tramadol-induced seizures have been reported to be generalized tonic-clonic in nature， without aura and focal deficit， as seen in our patient. Tramadol has very less abuse potential when compared to other opioids. So， it is prescribed very commonly in clinical practice. A recent cross-sectional study conducted by Labate et al.  in 2005 examined 106 patients with tramadol induced seizure found the entire patient had tonic clonic seizure within 12 h of oral intake of tramadol in supratherapeutic and recommended doses. Among those， 13% had history of epilepsy which was well controlled and didn’t recur before one year of their evaluation. Tramadol induced seizure may be associated with agitation， tachycardia， confusion and hypertension， leading to serotonin syndrome . In the present case， the continuing tachycardia ranging from 120 bpm to140 bpm was found to be the only salient observation that could be accountable to low serotonergic action.\n\n【10】Conclusion\n\n【11】Tramadol has been otherwise a safe drug over many years； however with evidence of serious reaction like seizure even at low doses， the scientific community should consider ensuring strict pharmacovigilance with respect to its use especially in the developing countries where such monitoring systems are inadequate.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 11:15:28", "endTime": "2024/09/24 11:15:58", "cost": 30.695}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:34", "update_time": "2024-09-23 19:15:56", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 19:15:25"}

The patient died one month later.\n\n【3】Keywords： Gastric cancer； Tonsilar metastasis； Malignant tumors\n\n【4】Introduction\n\n【5】Malignant tumors in the palatine tonsils are mostly primary malignancies. Metastatic carcinoma of the tonsil is uncommon，but tonsillar metastasis from gastric cancer is very rare. The review of the literature reports only 12 cases of tonsillar metastasis of gastric carcinoma . To our knowledge， this is the first reported case that combines tonsillar and cutaneous metastases. We report a case of metastasis to palatine tonsil from a primary gastric signet-ring cell carcinoma. A review of the literature discussed.\n\n【6】Case Presentation\n\n【7】We present the case of a 66-year-old man treated for gastric cancer in 2014 - the diagnosis made by upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. The Pre-operative CT scan showed no evidence of distant metastasis. He underwent a subtotal gastrectomy with a D1， five lymph node dissection. Histologically， the tumor was a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with signet ring cells invading the subserosa without lymph node metastasis. Additional histologic findings were venous and lymphatic vessel invasion. After the surgery， a concomitant chemo-radiotherapy was indicated. The treatment was well tolerated. Two years and three months after， the patient developed a locoregional recurrence. He underwent surgery and post-operative chemotherapy by 12 courses of flox regimen including 5FU， folinic acid， and oxaliplatin. Grade 2 neuropathy was reported.\n\n【8】During the follow-up period， one year and nine months after the recurrence， the patient presented pharyngeal discomfort. A mass of 4 cm was observed in the palatine tonsil with multiple cutaneous mass of the head. The CT scan showed a left adrenal metastasis. The biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma， a metastasis from gastric cancer. The cutaneous nodules were also a metastasis of gastric cancer. The patient died after the diagnosis of tonsillar metastasis.\n\n【9】Discussion\n\n【10】Metastatic tumors to tonsil are rare. Gallo et al. reported that there were 100 cases published in the English-literature . Many tonsillar metastases are from head and neck cancer . Theories on the mechanisms of metastasis to the tonsils include： Haematogenous metastasis， lymphatic metastasis and direct seeding to the tonsil due to regurgitation of the gastric content . APUBMED research using the keywords “tonsillar metastasis\"and“gastric cancer\" found 12 case reports with available data.

Three patients underwent surgery (1 case combined with chemotherapy and 1 case combined with radiotherapy) and there was 1 case treated only with chemotherapy. BSC was provided to another 7 patients. The longest survival was 30 months， with a mean survival of 14.6 month for the patients who was treated. The survival of our patient did not exceed one month. This can be explained by the presence in addition to the cutaneous metastasis which are darkened the prognosis in the gastric adenocarcinomas.\n\n【13】Although for the patients receiving BSC，the mean survival was 3.8months.

This is asymptomatic condition with normal life expectancy. It should be emphasized since in certain medical and surgical management knowledge of mirror location of organs is essential. A 45-year-old woman was admitted with shortness of breath for 1 month. After full evaluation she was diagnosed as situs inversus totalis and Mitral， Aortic regurgitation with atrial fibrillation with right heart failure. She was discharged after symptomatic improvement.\n\n【2】Keywords： Situs inversus totalis； Asymptomatic； CT； ADA\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Situs inversus is a congenital condition where all the organs of the body remain in mirrored of its anatomical position . Situs inversus with dextrocardia it is called situs inversus totalis .It may occur with heart in normal position on left when it is called situs inversus with levocardia. Situs inversus with sinusitis and bronchiectasis is termed as Kartagener Syndrome . Genotypically situs inversus is autosomal recessive， X-linked and also found in identical\"mirror\" twins . Its incidence is about 0.001 to 0.01 with a male-female ratio of 3：2 . Incidence of situs inversus totalis is more. About 3% to 5% of cardiac disease mostly in the form of transposition of great vessels is observed in situs inversus totalis of which 80% have right sided aortic arch . Heart on right side， right lung has two lobes where left lung consists of three lobes. In abdomen stomach and spleen on right side， liver， gallbladder， appendix on left side. Great vessels， lymphatic's， nerves are also transposed. There are no functional problems with these transpositions . Situs inversus with levocardia is rare and associated with congenital cardiac anomalies . In the absence of cardiac anomaly individuals with situs inversus are generally asymptomatic and have normal life expectancy in most of the cases .\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 45-year -old woman had insidious onset shortness of breath and palpitation for 15 days. There was no orthopnea or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. No previous history of shortness of breath or features of thyroid disease. No history of hypertension. On physical examination patient was dyspnic， mildly anemic， bilateral pedal pitting edema， jugular venous pressure raised， respiratory rate 26 breaths/min， pulse -112 beats/min irregularly irregular， blood pressure-100/70 mmHg. Precordium examination revealed features of dextrocardia， mitral stenosis with regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension. Chest examination revealed features of left sided pleural effusion. Abdomen examination revealed tender mild hepatomegaly. No ascites. Findings of other system examinations were normal.\n\n【7】Investigations revealed CBC- Hb 11.7 gm/dl， ESR 31 mm (1s Hour)， WBC TC-7×10%L， C reactive protein - 1.89 mg/L， total protein - 7.5 mg/dl，S. creatinine - 1.2 mg/dl， s. electrolytes &blood sugar， thyroid function， urine examination reports were unremarkable. Ultra sonogram of abdomen revealed situs inversus with mild ascites. ECG -P wave replaced by fibrillatory wavesS rhythm irregularly irregular， rSR pattern in V1， upright T in aVR， T inversion in vl to v6，reverse progression of R wave. Chest X-ray revealed dextrocardia， cardiomegaly with left sided pleural effusion . CT scan of chest revealed situs inversus totalis with cardiomegaly left sided pleural effusion . Color Doppler echocardiography revealed chronic rheumatic heart disease in the form of severe mitral stenosis with mild regurgitation. There was huge dilatation ofleft atrium， pulmonary hypertension with moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Pleural fluid was aspirated and study revealed transudate with low ADA (3.51 U/L). Patient was diagnosed as situs inversus totalis (Situs inversus with dextrocardia) with chronic rheumatic heart disease (severe mitral stenosis with mild mitral regurgitation)， pulmonary hypertension with moderate tricuspid regurgitation， and atrial fibrillation with right heart failure. Clinical parameter of patient improved after symptomatic management and was discharged with the advice to follow up.\n\n【8】Discussion\n\n【9】The underlying mechanism of situs inversus is embryologically explained but precise mechanism is yet to be established. Most of the literatures described it as a rotational disorder and controlled by a gene (PITX2) mediated protein SHH (Sonic Hedgehog) which influences the expression of transforming growth factors (Nodal and Lefty) that are responsible for rotation of organs . The exact signaling mechanism is still unclear. Its transmission mode is autosomal recessive but X-linked also found . When these patients present in the emergency there may be diagnostic problems because of unusual localization of symptoms and signs. Medical imaging can be of great assistance to reach a reliable and correct diagnosis. X-ray of abdomen， chest， sonology and CT scan can give a correct diagnosis in a patient who is unaware of own condition. Patients with situs inversus with acute abdomen that suspected to have acute appendicitis involves left iliac localization， the diagnosis is more difficult. Several cases of appendicitis in situs inversus has been reported . Fifty percent of those patients reported pain in right iliac fossa despite having situs inversus . Informing physicians and surgeons of the condition will minimize medical errors . Imaging and sonology along with laparoscopy are helpful in diagnosing these conditions and allow early management and best care to the patients without unexpected medical errors .\n\n【10】Conclusion\n\n【11】Situs inversus totalis (Situs inversus with dextrocardia) is a rare medical condition which usually remains asymptomatic.

Its characteristics imitate to that of invasive carcinoma. It mostly occurs in females at menopause or after menopause， but rare in children and men. Here we present a case report 37 years old lady having hyperprolactinemia， who came with complain of the stiffness of breast and nipple discharge of milk since 12 to 13 years. Bilateral mammography showed increased density under the left nipple without calcification and dominant mass. Ultrasound of breast evidenced few abnormally dilated ducts in the retro areolar region of left then right nipple. Therefore， the patient was diagnosed with duct ectasia. It is concluded that hyperprolactinemia can also lead to mammary duct ectasia even in women even at a pre-menopausal age.\n\n【2】Keywords： Mammary duct ectasia； Hyperprolactinemia； Nipple discharge\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Mammary duct ectasia is an inflammatory disorder in breast . The pathology behind this includes expansion of the main ducts related to intraluminal blocks of histocytes and periductal inflammation . The rate of occurrence of mammary duct ectasia can vary from 1.1% to 75.0%， according to the investigative methods utilized， which can be clinical，histopathological， or based on necropsy . Mammary duct ectasia mainly influences those females who are undertaking menopause or about to start menopause but can also take place in younger females， males， and infants .\n\n【5】Smoking is a dangerous feature for duct ectasia. It was discovered that smokers were three times more likely to develop the state of duct ectasia than non-smokers . This ailment is leading cause among other common reasons of bloody nipple discharge and sub-areolar masses， radiologically and medically imitating persistent carcinoma， while Nipple discharge， in turn， is the third significant frequent sign nearing to breast health centers， chasing lumps and pain .\n\n【6】Here， we present a case report of a female who developed duct ectasia before menopausal age with hyperprolactinemia.\n\n【7】Case Presentation\n\n【8】A 37-year-old woman known case of hypertension came at Doctors Hospital and Medical Centre Lahore Punjab， Pakistan with a history of hypertension and stiffness of breast along with the discharge of milk since last 12 to 13 years. On compression of her breast， nipple discharge of milk more on the left side was also observed. The nipple discharge was often drenching through shirts within a few minutes of throwing on them. The menarche of the patient took place at an average age， but with irregular menstrual periods. The patient married at the age of 21-year. The patient had two children. Among those children， the elder child had correctly breastfed， but the younger child had not been appropriately breastfed. The younger child breastfeeding was stopped due to increased prolactin level and bloody nipple discharge. The patient had never been smoked and did not have a family history of cancer.\n\n【9】On examination endocrinology report for prolactin levels was first done. Report showed prolactin level was 79.5 ng/ml (reference range： 5.53 ng/ml for female). Mammography was performed and evidenced by increased density under the left nipple. However， no dominant mass or suspicious calcification was seen. There was no architectural distortion of the parenchyma，while， lymph nodes were noted in both axillae . Ultrasound of breast exhibited few dilated ducts about 8 mm. in the retromolar region ofboth breasts， however abnormally dilated under the left nipple，largest measuring about 8 mm . Based on clinical signs and symptoms and clinical tests fin dings， the patient was diagnosed to have duct ectasia.\n\n【10】Discussion\n\n【11】Mammary duct ectasia is a seditious (causing inflammation) syndrome in the breast which is linked with inflammation and periductal fibrosis of differing extent . This illness is also recognized as comedomastitis， plasma cell mastitis， and cholesterol granuloma. Duct dilatation is generally not indicated in the early stages .\n\n【12】When it is indicative， mainly general medical appearance is mammary discharge . In most of the incidences， no clear abnormalities are present， but in afterward phases， tender sub-areolar masses along with skin renunciation happen， which can be detected as infiltrative carcinoma， which is wrong. The identification of Mammary Duct Ectasia is generally medical. The irregular thickening of the sub-areolar breast tissue and micro-calcifications is mostly identified via mammography. These thickenings can be imitated as carcinoma . The diameter of ducts greater than 5mm can be identified and assessed with the help of ultrasonography. Ductography is frequently performed for recognizing ductal dilatation with the multifocal luminal barrier in a dropped way， but it is bound as an investigative way for Mammary Duct Ectasia . Histopathologically， the peri-ductal inflammation is analyzed. The lymphocytes， plasma cells， or foamy histiocytes are present more often. The early stage of Mammary Duct Ectasia is illustrated through the existence of expansion of terminals of duct .\n\n【13】Afterward， the inflammation is substituted with fibrosis. Duct ectasia rarely gets better devoid of cure or by means of the utilization of temperate antibiotics and compresses. If the warnings ofectasia do not go biopsy is frequently needed， and the anomalous duct would be eliminated via surgery . Constant or repeated disorders are handled with centered surgical removal of the abnormal ducts below the nipple . A right way of surgery for duct ectasia is image guided surgery by ductal endoscopy . There are two theories with respect to the pathology of Mammary Duct Ectasia .\n\n【14】First， the main pathological route is believed to be unclear with degeneration of the ducts and glands， pursued via ducts expansion， directing to the apathy of secretion， duct burst， and inflammation. The second contributing incident is offered to exist as an inflammatory progression； periductal inflammation being the primary anomaly， pursued by duct sclerosis， obliteration， and duct ectasia. Alternatively， the etiology of duct ectasia is still unidentified. Other influencing factors consist of squamous metaplasia of the terminal duct epithelium， phenothiazine treatment，cigarette smoking， bacteriall!growth， and hyperprolactinemia.L Tobacco smoking is also a hazardous cause for ductal ectasia. While another study revealed that bacterial infection also leads to duct ectasia . However， this evidence is not enough as a cause of this disorder. An earlier study illustrated a relationship involving unusual prolactin discharge and Mammary Duct Ectasia . Shousha et al.  also analyzed that there is a linkage between specific hypothalamic/pituitary ailments， likely correlated with prolactin secretion and progress of mammary duct ectasia in postmenopausal patients. It is suggested that hyperprolactinemia may also lead to mammary duct ectasia. However， further studies are needed to elucidate the process， so that such kind of disorders can be prevented.\n\n【15】Conclusion\n\n【16】It is concluded that there is a strong relationship between hyperprolactinemia and mammary duct ectasia in a pre-menopausal age also. Increased prolactin level induces the various stages of mammaryduct ectasia.Hyperprolactinemia21increasesthe inflammation in mammary ducts.

Patients of this disorder， sometimes， present such an unusual way that diagnosis becomes very difficult. These patients， later， may face multiple consultations in different specialties or social and legal difficulties. This is the case of an adolescent boy who presented with stealing or pick-up mobile phone and facing social harassment. He was diagnosed as OCD after meticulous psychiatric assessment and treated with fluoxetine along with exposure and response prevention. Significant remission of symptoms of this adolescent was found with the intervention. Unusual presentations of OCD is not unexpected andearlyidentification and treatment can reduce the huge burden of this troublesome psychiatric disorder.\n\n【2】Keywords： Unusual presentation； Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder； Mobile stealing\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is a very distressing psychiatric condition with waxing and waning course. According to DSM-5， the presence of obsessions， compulsions or both which are time-consuming and cause clinically significant impairment is called OCD . In the Epidemiological Catchment Area Survey， OCD is the 4 most prevalent psychiatric condition， and in an early burden of disease study of all medical diseases， OCD ranked as 10h . Among children and adolescents， the prevalence of OCD is 1% to 3% . In the USA， one-year prevalence of adolescent's OCD is 0.7% . Cut-off ages are 10， 14 and 18 years for early-onset OCD . The fear of contamination (48%) is the most common obsession， succeeded by pathological doubt(47%)， need for symmetry (36%)， aggression (36%)， somatic (33%)， sexual (22%)， and others (32%). Similarly， checking is the most common compulsion (62%)， then， washing (36%)， need to confess(41%)， symmetry (40%)， counting (30%)， and hoarding (25%). Multiple obsessions (60%) and compulsions (48%) are present in most patients over time .\n\n【5】Like Developed countries， the prevalence of OCD is ranged from 1% to 2% in Bangladeshi children and adolescents . Unlike children’s age group， interference from obsessions， the mean obsession score， and extreme OCD are significantly higher in adolescents . However， sometimes OCD patients present in an unusual way that their assessment and diagnosis become so difficult and they face legal issues or multiple consultations in different specialties. This unusual presentation is not uncommon among the children and adolescent's population as evident in the contents of the miscellaneous group of OCD . Here we depicted a case of an adolescent boy presented with stealing and perfectionist behavior facing social harassment and legal difficulties later diagnosed and treated as a case of OCD.\n\n【6】Identifying Inform atio n\n\n【7】Tahsan (apseudonym)， a 15 years old boy， student of 9th grade，hailing from the semi-urban area of Cumilla， Bangladesh.\n\n【8】The main complaint“in his and mother words\"\n\n【9】“Urge to pick-up mobile phone， tendency to complete every work in an unusually perfect way， repeated checking behavior， irritability for the last two years”\n\n【10】History of present illness\n\n【11】Tahsan was quite well two years back. Then he gradually developed to practice some behaviors symmetrically following the death of his uncle. He described an urge to repeat certain actions until complete perfectly. He used to replace everything in the same places in the house. He wanted to get a \"just perfect\" feeling. If someone displaced household things he became angry with that person. He had repeated urges of certain motor acts， usually socially embarrassing ones， for example， and the urge to slap others. Tahsan also developed checking behaviors. He was unable to leave the house without lengthy repetitive checking of school bag， door locks， water taps， and electric switches. He took longer and longer so that he was often late for school. His mother gave him a mobile/cell phone so that she can contact him when he was outside the home. He used to carry the phone in his right pocket of the pant. Gradually he felt distressed that his left pocket was empty. So， he started to take his mother's phone and put it in his left pocket without noticing his mother. Then， his mother failed to connect him. So， she did not allow him to take her phone. But Tahsan felt severe distress without taking both phones into his pockets separately. For that， he went to a mobile shop in the local area and stole a phone. Shop keepers caught him with stolen mobile and beat him collectively. He was failed to explain the cause and injured badly. He hid the total incident from his mother. Tahsan also started to avoid wearing shirts that have a pocket so that he could avoid putting another phone into them. These types of incidents took place six times in the last year. He managed new places every time and shop keepers beat him every time but did not take any legal action except last time. He stole the last phone from a mobile repair shop and they took him to the local police station. Police called his mother and handed over him without taking anylegal action after taking a written promise from his mother that it will not happen again. All these problems were associated with considerable impairment and disability in terms of role functioning， educational productivity， disability days as well as social embarrassment. After that incident， Tahsan convinced his mother that mobile stealing was not intentionally happened rather he had been suffering from a disease. They went for psychiatric consultation and wanted to know what was wrong with him.\n\n【12】Other relevant history\n\n【13】Tahsan came from a middle-class family. He was the only son of his parents. His father， 46 years， lived in Saudi Arabia for a job for14 years， and his mother， 38 years， was a housewife. Consanguinity of marriage was absent. His paternal uncle had been suffering from psychotic illness but could not mention the name of the disease. The patient was born and raised in the Cumilla district of Bangladesh. His birth and early development were uneventful. Tahsan first experienced obsessive-compulsive symptoms when he was at 10years of age. He would tell his mother to repeat some words， like“Assalamualikum (Hello)\"and“Ami Valo Achi (I am fine)\". He also got into bed with a fixed way to avoid happening of bad things. These behaviors did not cause any significant impairment in his daily life. Mother was very strict and he was often physically punished by the mother. He was a good student since early childhood and had very few friends due to his mother's strict rules and they were not allowed to his place. Tahsan never took any substance and never fell in trouble with the law. He had no psychiatric disorder and his medical history was uneventful particularly before the present problems. His predominant mood used to be within normal range with a good attitude to seniors and juniors though he was relatively less sociable with poor peer relationships. He passed his COVID-19 related leisure period bylearning to drive a motorcycle and Facebooking.\n\n【14】Mental status and other relevant exam inations on the first visit\n\n【15】An adolescent boy with an average body built and nutritional status was sitting on a chair. He put on a T-shirt without any pockets and a pant which was culturally and seasonally accepted. His skin， clothes， and hair reflected that overall hygiene was maintained. He looked anxious a little. Though his gaze was forward， eye-to-eye contact was possible and maintained. Rapport was established and sustained. He was cooperative during the interview and aware about surroundings. There was no oddity of gesture，posture， and behavior.\n\n【16】The boy described his mood as irritable which was predominant， persistent， and pervasive in all situations. Affect was also irritable， moderate in intensity， appropriate to the settings， and congruous to the mood. He talked spontaneously； the answers were relevant. The rate， rhythm， volume， fluency， and tone of the speech were normal. There was no oddity of speech. There was no delusion， suicidal ideation. Hehad obsessive impulses and thought of doubt with themes of the need for symmetry. He， also， had compulsions in the form of checking and ordering/arranging things. However， he recognized that both obsessions and compulsions were of his own thought and action， intrusive in nature， senseless， definitely not true and tried to resist and control but failed， spending three to four hours per day which causes distress and severe functional impairment in daily life. His perception， cognitive function， and judgment were normal. His general and systemic including neurological examinations were normal. Routine and relevant special laboratory investigations were also within the normalrange.Forpsychometric evaluation， we applied Bangla validated Childrens Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive scale. His total， obsessions， and compulsions scores were 31， 14 and17 respectively.\n\n【17】Differential diagnoses\n\n【18】Diagnostic impression\n\n【19】From history， examinations， and investigations， Tahsan had been suffering from Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder with fair insight as he had both time-consuming obsessions and compulsions which causes severe distress with social and educational impairment and there was sufficient evidence that they were not due to any substance or another medical condition or another psychiatric disorder. Psychometric evaluation supported that his disorder was severe in intensity.\n\n【20】Treatment plan a. Problems： Urge to pick up mobile phone， want to complete every work in a perfect way， repeated checking behavior， Irritability which results in educational and social problems. b. Goals： Not picking up phone from shop， reduction of perfectionist behavior， reduction of checking behavior which was time-consuming， improvement of educational and social problems.\n\n【21】Interventions a. Child Focus： Explanation， advice， and support to Tahsan. Psychological interventions included relaxation exercise， Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP)， thought stopping， and daily work program. Pharmacotherapy provided by capsule Fluoxetine started with 20 mg titrated to 40 mg daily . b. Family Focus： Psychoeducation， Family counseling with special emphasis on the role of the parents. Here， mother worked as a co-therapist. c. School Focus： Liaison with school authority with providing a letter which described the disorder， current interventions， and asking help from class teachers and peer groups. d. Social Focus： The psychiatrist gave a letter to the Police Station and Chairman of the Union Council (Local Government Body) describing the psychiatric problem that the boy had been suffered.\n\n【22】Follow-up and outcome\n\n【23】The boy was advised to follow up fortnightly for the first three months. Initial increment of anxiety and restlessness was successfully managed by short-term use of clonazepam. The patient's initial improvement was achieved after one month. CY-BOCS Bangla score was 26，21 and 11 at the end of the 15，2n and 3 month respectively with regular ERP sessions and 40 mg of fluoxetine. At that time， the patient was distress-free and was able to do his daily works including education.\n\n【24】Discussion\n\n【25】Children and adolescents with OCD are typically presented with contamination， fear of harm， blasphemous， sometimes somatic thought . However， Pediatric OCD occasionally presents in such a way that does not fall into one of these themes. When symptoms appear as atypical or unusual， they may not be recognized as OCD and lead to delay in diagnosis and treatment.\n\n【26】In one study of OCD in Bangladesh， patients presented with unusual presentations such as headache (56%)， decreased sexual behavior (16%)， chronic cough (9.6%)， pain (8%)， vomiting (8%)， increase frequency of micturition (2.4%) and deliberate self-harm(1.6%) were later diagnosed as OCD . In another study of pediatric patients， they describe 24 children with OCD. Twelve children had obsessions related to fearsome experiences of places or people and led to contamination obsessions. Twelve other children had obsessions of primary sensory experiences which later linked to objects or people， leading to compulsive behaviors to avoid that distressful sensory stimulus . Rasmussen and Eisen described another case of a woman who was compelled to let the telephone ring continuously， sometimes up to 40 times， until she got the just-right feeling to her ear Our case， Tahsan， had prominent obsessions as wwell as compulsions. He discussed both his obsession and compulsions in the first visit， though many patients are less spontaneously revealing in early sessions. For that， an assessment of pediatric OCD requires specific questions that can allow different insights to discuss thoughts and actions which can be embarrassing. Tahsan reported multiple obsessions such as symmetry (Thought of exactness in arranging phone， household things)， doubt (Uncertainty about previous actions of common daily activities)， and repeated urges to carry out actions which were recurrent， persistent， intrusive， and unwanted thoughts， naturally induce anxiety or distress. He also had several compulsions such as checking behaviors， ordering/arranging things(All the pockets of the clothes should have mobile phones) which are repetitive behavior in response to obsessions. These behaviors were aimed at reducing distress and also excessive or realistically unconnected to the anticipated event. These symptoms were time-consuming (3 h to 4 h/day) and caused distress and impairment in Tahsan's educational， social andpersonal life. Not only his symptoms were time-consuming but he appeared to be a socially embarrassed， isolated adolescent whose life had been significantly ravaged by OCD. It is important to explore whether OCD symptoms can be attributable to a substance， medication， or other psychiatric conditions. From history， it appeared that Tahsan had no such history including Kleptomania and Conduct Disorder. To subcategorize OCD， Thasan had no history of Tic Disorder. Another specified related to insight， Tahsan appeared to understand his obsessional beliefs are untrue and so would fall into the insightful category.\n\n【27】Tahsan may be biologically vulnerable to develop OCD due to one of his paternal uncles had been suffering from psychotic illness. Furthermore， he appeared to have an anxious temperament. Stressful life events such as the current stressful COVID-19 situation， strict rules of his mother may have predisposed Tahsan to develop psychopathology. Compulsive symptoms of Tahsan linked to the mobile phone (Need for symmetry) may be due to easy availability of phone to child and adolescent students for attaining online class during COVID-19 related lockdown， passing leisure period by Facebooking during long school closure due to COVID-19. This symmetry phenomenology is commonly expressed by OCD patients and discussed in the literature on child and adolescents OCD . Valleni-Basile et al.  described that the most common compulsion(Over 50%) in adolescent OCD patients was ordering and arranging things . Pick-up mobile phone due to reducing distress was defined as Not Just Right Experiences’ (NJREs) . Though he had subclinical symptoms during middle childhood， Tahsan had gradual onset of OCD following the death of his relative. His illness was exacerbated by stressful conditions like upcoming school assignments， physical assault after pick-up the phone. Moreover， excitement related to learning to drive motorcycle was act as a salient trigger factor. Despite the vicious cycle of OCD， Tahsan had numerous protective factors including a supportive mother， well financial condition， achieving well at school， and average intelligence. So， if he continued his current intervention accordingly， he may lead a better life.\n\n【28】Conclusion\n\n【29】Obsessive-compulsive disorder is usually an easily diagnosable psychiatric disorder but not always and sometimes its presentation is atypical， especially， in children and adolescents. That may result in delayed diagnosis which causes long-suffering of the patient， sometimes after legal and social harassment. Awareness of mental health problems， meticulous clinical assessment can reduce over or under diagnosis of this high impacting psychiatric disorder.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 10:43:43", "endTime": "2024/09/24 10:44:02", "cost": 18.864}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:34", "update_time": "2024-09-23 18:44:00", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 18:43:40"}

The successful management of infants with ARMs starts with disease recognition. The newborn nursery must deliver high quality care to a high volume of mostly well babies on a day-to-day basis. A reliance on high-reliability principles that fosters teamwork， communication and continuous learning is crucial to this mission.\n\n【2】Upon recognizing an ARM within a newborn patient， clinical team members must be prepared to initiate a tailored， multi-disciplinary workup to ascertain the etiology of and inform the planning for long-term care of these infants.\n\n【3】Case Report\n\n【4】You are rounding in the newborn nursery when the nurse alerts you to a concerning physical finding she noticed during a diaper change. The patient is a two day old term infant female born via uncomplicated vaginal delivery. The mother’s prenatal course was notable only for excessive maternal weight gain in pregnancy but with normal glucose tolerance test. The infant’s birth weight ras appropriate for gestational age. There were no concerns on fetal ultrasound， and mother's prenatal labs were all within normal limits. Review of the chart indicates that the child has passed meconium and urine and she is breastfeeding well.\n\n【5】The child's physical examination is unremarkable except for multiple pink， raised soft tissue protuberances around the anus which expand in size when the infant valsalvas (e.g. during crying). The protuberances immediately reduce when the infant calms. The nursery medical team suspects external hemorrhoids， so pediatric gastroenterology was consulted.\n\n【6】The consultant team confirms the finding and recommends abdominopelvic ultrasound. The concern was for the possibility of an intra-abdominal or hepatic arteriovenous malformation.\n\n【7】At 2 weeks of life， the thriving infant was seen in the pediatric gastroenterology clinic. The ultrasound was unremarkable. The infant had no signs ofexternal hemorrhoids at that time.\n\n【8】Discussion\n\n【9】Neonatal hemorrhoids fall under the broad category ofanorectal malformations ofthe newborn. ARMs can be associated with portal hypertension or anatomic anomalies (e.g. rectal polyps， malignancy，etc) which can obstruct venous outflow. Benign etiologies include impaired venous return caused by prolonged pressure on the newborn during delivery. Given that our patient thrived and had normal imaging， we suspect that alterations in venous tone- especially with exposure to maternal hormones during the delivery process-s could be at play.\n\n【10】Conclusion\n\n【11】While neonatal hemorrhoids are most commonly a benign finding， medical teams must consider each patient’s case on an individual basis in order to triage what imaging and other diagnostic workup is indicated.

It presents with an unpredictable， chronic， and recurrent course， affecting 0.2% to 1% of the adult population between30 and 60 years. It is more common among females in a ratio of two women to one man， with no racial predisposition. Sporadic in character， rare are the reports of familial cases， which are of earlier onset and have a recurrent course. The disease can affect all skin types， with a predilection for the oral and genital mucosae .\n\n【9】The skin， appendages and mucosae play a role in protecting against aggression from external agents， such as invasion by microorganisms， exposure to allergens， and also mechanical protection against trauma， in order to ensure the integrity of the organism and its homeostasis. For this reason， the cutaneous-mucous epithelium acts like the first line of physical and immunological defense， which constitutes an essential part of the immune system. Biological processes affecting the skin's barrier function and interfering with its differentiation and repair process can lead to the development of LP . The disease starts off with cellular damage to the keratinocytes in the basal layer， secondary to autoimmune stimulation. This reaction is mediated by T lymphocytes that normally do not respond to the skin. However， when they are stimulated by exogenous agents that bind to the lymphocyte receptor by a mechanism of molecular mimicry， an aggression reaction to keratinocytes is triggered， which leads to their apoptosis .\n\n【10】Its clinical forms can be divided into linear， hypertrophic， atrophic， and annular. It presents with an acute course and a predilection for the flexor surface of the wrists. A typical lesion is characterized by a purple-colored papule having a polygonal contour and flat surface surmounted by thin， off-white lines， conferring on the lesion a lace-like pattern， also known as Wickham’s striae . Its clinical manifestation varies and is determined by the affected topography， epidermis' respective peculiarities， time of progression， which interferes in the thickness and color of the lesion， and by the severity of the condition， i.e. a more severe condition may progress with erosions and blisters， depending on how aggressively the basal layer has been affected. The condition may be associated with the Koebner phenomenon， as represented by the appearance of lesions following local trauma .\n\n【11】Mucosal involvement is present in 45% of males and 53% of females， with the genital region being especially affected in males. LP lesions can adopt different clinical presentations according to the time of progression， location， and severity. The clinical forms of mucosal LP are classified into reticular， annular， erosive， bullous， and atrophic types， and may be the only manifestation of the disease . The oral mucosa is the most affected site， followed by the genital track. However， LP can affect any mucous site， such as the eyes， tympanum，esophagus， and trachea. The symptoms vary， with pruritus being the most common symptom，reported in cases of一either asymptomatic or painful lesions， or with a burning sensation. Genital Lichen Planus (GLP) is found in 25% of the male population with LP， and its morbidity is due to the possibility of it progressing with stenosis， genital synechia， and even carcinoma，in addition to the psychological impact of a sexual nature resulting from this chronic and recurrent genital dermatosis， whose diagnosis is often made late， thereby causing great anxiety in the patient .\n\n【12】LP has been observed in association with other comorbidities， especially those involving immune disorders. The correlation between LP and Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infection is well described， especially when erosive oral lesions are present . The relationship between this dermatosis and the presence of the Hepatitis B Virus(HBV)， active hepatitis A， and vaccination for hepatitis B has also been described . There are reports on the relationship between the disease and ulcerative colitis， alopecia areata， dermatomyositis， morphea， lichen sclerosus， lupus erythematosus， pemphigus， and hematological neoplasms ， corroborating the hypothesis of autoimmune etiology. Medicines， ingestion of quinine in tonic water， and alergy to the metals used in dental restorations lead to clinically indistinguishable lesions of LP， which is characterized by lichenoid eruptions， the topography， histopathology， and progression of which have particular features .\n\n【13】The diagnosis is based on clinical and histological aspects. Classic cases can be diagnosed clinically， yet an anatomopathological study is often necessary. The histological findings that are representative of LP involve keratinocyte damage (keratinocyte damage apoptosis at the dermoepidermal junction， which leads to hydropic degeneration of the basal layer with subsequent pigmentary incontinence) and lymphocytic infiltrate (superficial perivascular， and/or with a band-like arrangement， called lichenoid infiltrate)， giving rise to typical changes in the epidermis and the dermoepidermal junction， such as orthokeratotic hyperkeratosis，hypergranulosis (which represents the clinical finding of striations)， and acanthosis .\n\n【14】We propose an iconographic presentation describing the clinical and histological characteristics of patients with GLP treated at a tertiary hospital in the city of Sao Paulo/Brazil， in order to assist urologists and dermatologists to improve the diagnosis ofskin lesions.\n\n【15】Methodology\n\n【16】This is a retrospective study with male patients who received treatment at a dermatology clinic of a tertiary hospital in the city of Sao Paulo， Brazil， between January 2009 and December 2019. All patients having a clinical and histopathological diagnosis of genital lichen planus were included.\n\n【17】The following aspects were analyzed in these patients： Age and comorbidities， presence of extragenital involvement of the skin and/or mucosa， time of progression， location， clinical form， and lace-like pattern (Wickham's striae， or the lack thereof) of the genitallesion.\n\n【18】The findings were included on a Microsoft Excel  spreadsheet in order to compare the clinical and histological data with each other.\n\n【19】Results\n\n【20】Seven patients were included， with a median age of 30.5 years and a mean age of 39.42±16.53 years. The lesion's median time of progression was six months， and the lesion's mean time ofprogression was 27.71±48.72 months. Four patients (57%) presented with some comorbidity， and the locations on the genital were： Glans penis (57%)， prepuce (28%)， balanopreputial sulcus (42%)， penis shaft (71%)， and penis base (14%)， with only one patient having a lesion in only one single anatomical site of his genital. All patients had a lace-like pattern corresponding to Wickham's striae， and the clinical forms present on the genital were： Annular (71%)， hypertrophic (14%)， and erosive (14%). Two patients (14%)had concomitant extragenital involvement of the skin and one patient， of the oral mucosa. Patients clinical aspects are illustrated in Figure 1， and their clinical data are shown in Table 1.\n\n【21】In regard to histological aspects， all patients presented with keratinocyte apoptosis at the dermoepidermal junction (100%)， with six cases (85%) having been observed in isolation and， in one patient (14%)， in a confluent manner. In all cases (100%) hydropic degeneration of the basal layer， acanthosis， hypergranulosis， and orthokeratotic hyperkeratosis were present. Lichenoid superficial perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate and pigmentary incontinence were also observed in all patients (100%). Band-like lymphocytic infiltrate was found in six cases (71%) in varying degrees； and in two cases (14%)， only an outline of this finding was observed； whereas in three cases (42%) this finding was observed in a more robust manner. Histological aspects are shown in Table 2 and Figure 2 illustrates the findings described.\n\n【22】In relation to laboratory tests， HIV， hepatitis C， hepatitis B， Anti-Nucleus Factor (ANA) serologies and a non-treponemal test for screening syphilis (VDRL) were conducted. Three patients (42%)had undergone complete laboratory screening， two (28%) had incomplete laboratorytests； and another two (28%)had undergone no laboratory screening tests. Three patients (42%)， who were coincidentally those having all laboratory test results， tested negative for all aspects surveyed. One patient (14%) tested negative for HIV， hepatitis and VDRL， but his other parameters had not been tested. One patient(14%) had hepatitis C and syphilis， coincidentally， with no other tests having been performed. Patients'laboratory results are shown in Table 3.\n\n【23】Discussion\n\n【24】Genital lesions are a common complaint in a physician's office， and most doctors and patients tend to instinctively associate those with sexually transmitted infections. However， most complaints are actually due to inflammatory diseases such as balanitis， eczema， and lichenoid diseases . In a study conducted in the United Kingdom with 226 patients receiving treatment over a three-year period， only ten received a clinical diagnosis (i.e. without a biopsy) of genital lichen planus . In another study also carried out in the United Kingdom with 600 patients， in turn， 7.3% were diagnosed with genital lichen planus， of which only 11 were confirmed with a biopsy. Such data put into perspective the findings demonstrated herein， in which the seven cases were clinically diagnosed and confirmed by means of a histopathological examination.\n\n【25】Table 1：Description of the clinical aspects of seven cases of genital lichen planus.\n\n|  | Patient's Characteristics  |  |  | ExtragenitalInvolvement  |  | Genital Involvement  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Case  | Age(years)  | Time of progression(months)  | Comorbidities  | Cutaneous  | Mucosa  | Location  | Clinical Form  | Striations  |\n| A  | 30  | 2  | Peripheral venous insufficiency.Occasionaluse of dipyrone  | Disseminated throughout the  | Jugal mucosa(erosive form)  | Glans penis， prepuce  | Annular  | Present  |\n| A  | 30  | 2  | Peripheral venous insufficiency.Occasionaluse of dipyrone  | body.

On the other hand， GLP patients concomitantlyhave extra-genital manifestations of the disease on the skin in about 20% of cases . Of the cases herein presented， onlytwo patients had extra-genital skin lesions， a proportion that was similar to that described in the literature. Concomitant genital lesions and in the oral mucosa are rare and found in only 1.36% of cases  of those seven patients， only one had his oral mucosa affected.\n\n【32】The most common clinical presentation of GLP is annular and preferably on the glans penis . Of the cases shown here， five are annular； one is erosive， and one is hypertrophic. Of the annular cases， four involved the glans penis and one affected the shaft of the penis； other clinical presentations， in turn， affect the shaft of the penis. This shows the importance of epithelium involvement for the clinical expression of the disease， since the glans is composed of a semi-mucosa of non-keratinized， stratified flat epithelium and the shaft of the penis， in turn， is composed of keratinized， stratified flat epithelium skin . Elakis and Hall  in 2017 analyzed the presence of genital dermatosis and the circumcision status and noted that the incidence of changes is significantly higher in uncircumcised patients： Among the 386 patients studied， 16 had GLP， 67% of who were patients with an intact foreskin. The presence of foreskin promotes the formation of an intertriginous region between the inner prepuce， the balanopreputial sulcus and the glans penis， which favors inflammatory processes in this region due to the accumulation of substances . This situation favors a disorder of epithelial differentiation， already proven to be related to genital lichen planus in previous molecular studies . All cases presented in this study are of uncircumcised patients， a common situation in Brazil .\n\n【33】Lichen planus canbe diagnosed clinically in classic cases，although biopsy is useful for confirming the diagnosis and is necessary in less typical presentations. Histology shows a characteristic“sawtooth”acanthosis pattern in epidermal hyperplasia，hyperparakeratosis with thickening of the granular cell layer and vacuolar alteration of the basal layer of the epidermis， with intense infiltration (mainly T cells) in the dermal-epidermal junction that can cause in apoptosis of some keratinocytes . All the cases studied had the elements described. In case No. 2 in particular， whose clinical presentation was erosive genital lichen planus， the biopsy was not performed on the ulcerated region， but rather on the perilesional skin， where intact epidermis and the clinically characteristic violet lace-like were found. Thus， the histological findings were compatible with the classic description， since the epidermis was represented in the sample sent to the laboratory. It is worth mentioning that performing the biopsy on the lace-like pattern (Wickham’s striae) is important in order to make any sign of hypergranulosis more evident in the histopathological exam.\n\n【34】In regard to the patients’ laboratory test results， only three patients underwent a thorough investigation， i.e. had their HIV， Hepatitis B and C， ANF serologies investigated tested for syphilis by means of a non-treponemal test. Of the five patients whose Hepatitis C serology was investigated， only one tested positive. Such laboratory investigation is carried out in lichen planus cases， since there are studies demonstrating a significant causal relationship between Hepatitis C virus and lichen planus . In a study conducted with66 patients with lichen planus who had their Hepatitis C serology investigated， 7.5% tested positive vs. 0.69% of 44，947 blood donors from the same institution， which demonstrate a clear and statistically higher prevalence of infection in patients with lichen planus when compared to blood donors at the same hospital . It is worth mentioning that the clinical erosive form of the mucosa is the one that is most related to positivity for hepatitis C ， a situation that was confirmed in the cases presented herein， since the only positive serology for the hepatitis C virus was the very case involving genital erosive clinical presentation.\n\n【35】Conclusion\n\n【36】The clinical aspects of dermatosis of the penis encompass multiple medical specialties. This study contributes to the field of research on genital dermatosis by presenting the clinical， histological and laboratory test aspects and discussing the findings and comparing them with the aspects described in the literature.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 11:15:19", "endTime": "2024/09/24 11:15:25", "cost": 6.576}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:34", "update_time": "2024-09-23 19:15:23", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 19:15:17"}

Rarely a right atrial thrombus can extend into left atrium through a patent foramen ovale. These thrombi require prompt diagnosis and treatment due to associated risk of pulmonary and systemic embolism. We report an unusual case of floating thrombus in right atrium extending across a patent foramen ovale in a patient of acute pulmonary embolism， diagnosed on transthoracic echocardiography and computed tomography\n\n【2】Keywords： Pulmonary thromboembolism； Atrial thrombus； Transthoracic echocardiography\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Floating thrombi in right heart can be seen in 7% to 18% cases of pulmonary embolism . As echocardiographic examination is not routinely done in all cases of pulmonary embolism， it can be assumed that the exact incidence is underreported . Prompt diagnosis of these free floating thrombi is of utmost importance as they can embolize at any moment and thus require emergency treatment. Rarely these thrombi can extend into left atrium across a patent foramen ovale . We report an unusual case of acute pulmonary embolism with presence of a floating thrombus in right atrium with extension into left atrium through a patent foramen ovale.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 54 years old male patient presented in emergency department of our institute with chief complaints of sudden onset shortness ofbreath (NYHA class IV) for lasteight hours. On examination patient had tachycardia (pulse rate of 120 beats per min) and tachypnea (respiratory rate of 28/min) with hypotension (blood pressure： 90/62 mmHg). Electrocardiography (ECG) showed sinus tachycardia with non-specific ST/T changes. Troponin-I and D-Dimer values were raised. Transthoracic echocardiographic examination showed dilated right atrium (RA)， right ventricle(RV) and main pulmonary artery. There was RV systolic dysfunction [Tricuspid Annular Plane Systolic Excursion (TAPSE) = and moderate tricuspid regurgitation (TR gradient =75 mmHg). A large right atrial thrombus was seen  which was oscillating into right ventricle in diastole via tricuspid valve . Another thrombus was seen in left atrium  with presence of a defect in interatrial septum likely suggestive of patent foramen ovale . However continuity of thrombus across patent foramen ovale could not be demonstrated on echocardiographic examination.\n\n【7】Followed by this， patient underwent non ECG gated CT pulmonary angiography， which demonstrated a large partially occlusive thrombus in main pulmonary artery extending into right and left pulmonary arteries . A linear hypodense filling defect was seen in right atrium and ventricle  suggestive of thrombus. In addition filling defect was also noted in left atrium . On coronal reformatted images， continuity of thrombus across right and left atrium was demonstrated through a defect in interatrial septum . Doppler ultrasound for bilateral lower limbs did not show any evidence of deep venous thrombosis.\n\n【8】Based upon echocardiography and CT findings， a diagnosis of floating right atrial thrombus with extension across a patent foramen ovale with acute PTE was made. Patient was started on intravenous anticoagulation (low molecular weight heparin) and referred to higher center for surgical embolectomy， in view of high risk of systemic embolization. However， repeat transthoracic echocardiography in higher center showed marked reduction in size of thrombus. Subsequently the patient was managed with systemic thrombolysis with injection tenecteplase with no evidence of systemic embolization. Patient improved clinically and was discharged after one week stay in hospital.\n\n【9】Discussion\n\n【10】Acute Pulmonary Thromboembolism (PTE) is a medical emergency with high mortality and morbidity. Combination of various diagnostic tests like plasma D-dimer levels， ventilation/perfusion lung scan， and spiral computed tomography and lower limb venous Doppler can be used to establish a diagnosis of acute PTE . In addition to the above mentioned diagnostic tests， it has been shown that transthoracic echocardiographic examination can help in early risk stratification in acute PTE， thereby influencing the management . Echocardiography gives valuable information about pulmonary arterial hypertension， RA， RV dilation and RV hypokinesia.\n\n【11】Also， echocardiographic examination can demonstrate right heart thrombi in a patient of pulmonary embolism with a reported prevalence of 7% to18% . Floating right heart thrombi are accompanied by severe pulmonary embolism and it has been shown that presence of right heart thrombi is predictive of worse outcome in cases of acute PTE . These thrombi are thought to be in transit from peripheral venous system to pulmonary circulation. In extremely rare cases these thrombi can extend into left atrium through a patent foramen ovale. It has been proposed that increased pressure in right atrium due to RV overload can cause right heart thrombi to protrude across a patent foramen ovale . This condition is life threatening due to imminent risk of pulmonary and paradoxical embolism. Although the diagnosis of a free floating thrombus is straight forward on real time echocardiographic examination， occasionally it can be difficult to differentiate from other conditions like Chiari network， persistent eustachian or thebesian valves， atrial septal aneurysms or intracardiac tumors .\n\n【12】Floating right heart thrombus is a therapeutic emergency and any delay to treatment could be lethal (with reported mortality upto40%). Treatment options include anticoagulation， thrombolytic therapy and surgical embolectomy ， but there is no consensus on ideal treatment. Thrombolytic and anticoagulant therapy is simple， rapid， non invasive and widely available. However， it may cause a fixed thrombus to dislodge， leading to pulmonary embolism and may also lead to paradoxical systemic embolism in a case of entrapped thrombus in patent foramen ovale (as in our case). Also， thrombolytic therapy is associated with risk of significant bleeding. Surgical embolectomy on the other hand is invasive and associated with inherent delay， complications of general anesthesia and inability to remove thrombus beyond central pulmonary arteries. However a patent foramen ovale can be repaired at the time of surgery thereby reducing the risk of paradoxical embolism.\n\n【13】To conclude， right heart thrombi can be seen in association with acute pulmonary embolism and in extremely rare cases can extend across patent foramen ovale.A diagnosis can be made on transthoracic echocardiography. Treatment options include anticoagulation， thrombolysis and surgery or a combination of above.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 11:14:27", "endTime": "2024/09/24 11:14:37", "cost": 9.694}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:34", "update_time": "2024-09-23 19:14:37", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 19:14:27"}

The patient was admitted to our hospital because of multiple lymph node enlargement detected by computed tomography during the physical examination. The biopsy results confirmed the diagnosis of PBL. This patient achieved partial remission after DA-EPOCH chemotherapy and received ASCT as consolidation therapy. However， disease progression occurred and the patient died 2 months after ASCT.\n\n【3】Discussion： PBL is characterized by rapid disease progression and high mortality rates. More effective treatment regimen needs to be explored.\n\n【4】Conclusion： PBL was a highly invasive rare lymphoma with poor prognosis， it is urgent to develop new targets and agents\n\n【5】Keywords： Plasmablastic lymphoma； HIV；ASCT\n\n【6】Introduction\n\n【7】Plasmablastic Lymphoma (PBL) is a rare and unique subtype of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma， which is highly aggressive and mainly occurs in Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) positive patients. Delecluse first reported 16 cases of PBL， all of which occurred in the oral cavity， of which15 cases were accompanied by HIV infection . Later， it was found that PBL also occurred in people with normal immune function . Our study demonstrated that patients with PBL were immunocompetent and the prognosis seems to be better than that reported by western countries. The pathogenesis of PBL remains largely unknown and the prognosis was still poor and it is urgent to develop new targets and agents.\n\n【8】Here， we reported a male patient with HIV V negative PBL with rapidprogression after chemotherapy followed by ASCT.\n\n【9】A 57-year-old Chinese male presented in November 2021 with multiple lymph nodes enlargement which was detected by computed tomography for lung during physical examination. No systematic symptom was observed and he was negative for HIV test. The patient was referred for 18F-FDG PET/CT examination and extensive 18F-FDG positive mass involving lymph nodes throughout the body (cervical， mediastinal and hilar) and pancreas were detected . No evidence of lymphoma was observed by bone marrow biopsy of the right iliac crest. A biopsy of the supraclavicular lymph node indicated a B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma with plasmablastic morphology and immunohistochemistry results showed that CD38， Mum-1， CD30， Bcl-2， c-Myc were positive while CD20， CD79a， Bcl-6，CD10， CD138， CD30， CD138， PAX-5， TIA-1，CD4，CD8， CD7， CD43. The ki-67 expression was nearly 100% and EBV-Encoded small RNA (EBER)-1/2 was positive.\n\n【10】Laboratory examination was as follows： White blood cells 8500/uL， hemoglobin 13.5 g/dL， platelets 340，000/uL； the lactate dehydrogenase， serum calcium and immunoglobulin levels were at normal ranges； following the PET/CT and biopsy results， the patient received 5 cycles of DA-\n\n【11】EPOCH chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide，doxorubicin， vincristine， etoposide， prednisone). The metabolic activity decreased significantly and the patient achieved partial remission as determined by PET/CT . This patient received Autologous hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (ASCT) as consolidation therapy after chemotherapy.

Research in patients with cerebral palsy undergoing cell therapy has shown improvements in the functionality and quality of life of patients. Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is an essential tool that may objectively evaluate the morphological changes in the cerebral tracts after this kind of intervention.\n\n【2】Description of Cases： Three children with a medical history of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy were presented. These patients were treated with intrathecalautologous bone marrow total nucleated cells. All three patients demonstrated clinical improvements in their neurological functions. Additionally， fMRI was performed 6， 9， and 10 months， respectively， after the intervention. An increase in anisotropy fraction was observed when evaluated by specialized MRI radiologists， which correlated with their improvements.\n\n【3】Discussion： It has been demonstrated that hematopoietic progenitor cells promote neurogenesis and angiogenesis in brain tissue affected by hypoxic-ischemic injury. This report seeks to add the idea of using fMRI to evaluate improvements after interventions where stem cells are used. However， it is necessary to extend the number of patients to determine if it is the best objective evaluation method for these patients.\n\n【4】Keywords： Functional MRI； Cerebral palsy； Stem cell therapy； Clinical improvement\n\n【5】Introduction\n\n【6】Cerebral Palsy (CP) is a non-progressive condition secondary to an insult to the central nervous system during its development. It is characterized by abnormal muscle tone that leads to posture and movement. The incidence is estimated at 2-3 per 1，000 births .\n\n【7】At present， the use of hematopoietic stem cells has generated interest in medical practice due to their regenerative， reparative， and plastic properties ， mainly when used in patients with permanent organ damage， such as in CP .\n\n【8】Evidence supports that brain functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is valuable and may evaluate the improvement of patients with CP after different treatments with SC，specifically the white matter， which can be demonstrated with the anisotropy fraction of fMRI.\n\n【9】Objective\n\n【10】To describe fMRI as an objective evaluation tool for patients with CP after administering Intrathecal (IT) autologous Bone Marrow Nucleated Cells (BM-TNC).\n\n【11】Case Description\n\n【12】We present three pediatric patients with neurological deficits due to hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. They received intrathecal autologous BM-TNCs after three days of Bone Marrow(BM) stimulation with Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor (G-CSF). Basal fMRI was obtained and compared with a second fMRI performed 6， 9， and 10 months， respectively， after treatment.\n\n| Table 1： Evaluation of corticospinal tracts by diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging with measurement of the Fraction of Anisotropy (FA) at different levels.  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | FA Right  |  | FA Left  |  |\n|  | Contral  | Baseline  | Baseline  | Control  |\n| Patient 1  |  |  |  |  |\n| Corona radiata  | 0.34  | 0.361  | 0.301  | 0.41  |\n| Posterior limb of the internal capsule  | 0.433  | 0.482  | 0.431  | 0.431  |\n| Cerebral peduncle  | 0.344  | 0.372  | 0.351  | 0.356  |\n| Patient 2  |  |  |  |  |\n| Corona radiata  | 0.38  | 0.38  | 0.27  | 0.28  |\n| Posterior limb of the internal capsule  | 0.54  | 0.55  | 0.5  | 0.58  |\n| Cerebral peduncle  | 0.39  | 0.39  | 0.51  | 0.51  |\n| Patient 3  |  |  |  |  |\n| Corona radiata  | 0.34  | 0.48  | 0.31  | 0.44  |\n| Posterior limb of the internal capsule  | 0.43  | 0.45  | 0.37  | 0.43  |\n| Cerebral peduncle  | 0.43  | 0.5  | 0.33  | 0.52  |\n\n【14】A 34-month-old male， twin pregnancy， extreme prematurity， weighting 1，150 g， Apgar score 6 and 8 at l and 5 min， respectively. Neonatal respiratory distress syndrome was treated with NCPAP and caffeine； ductus arteriosus was hemodynamically significant and treated with ibuprofen and pulmonary hyperinflation.\n\n【15】Transfontanelar Ultrasound (TUS) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) demonstrate grade 3 intraventricular hemorrhage and multicystic encephalopathy with the right cerebral hemisphere involved. The patient was admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) for 3 months. Afterward， he was diagnosed with spastic quadriparesis CP. He was not able to achieve cephalic and body trunk support， neither to feed on his own， did not communicate or interact with the environment， and was unable to follow objects with his eyes.\n\n【16】An fMRI was performed before the procedure. BM was stimulated with G-CSF at a subcutaneous dose of 10 ug/kg/day for 3 consecutive days. On the 4h day， a BM collection was performed under sedation in both posterosuperior-superior iliac crests. A volume of 8 ml/kg of weight was aspirated. The BM was centrifuged， and the buffy coat was isolated and administered IT . The number of BM-TNC cells infused was 89.76×10°CD34+ cells， as measured by flow cytometry.\n\n【17】Ten months after the therapy， he has full head and trunk support， crawling with limb support， executes simple orders， takes objects with both hands， with a predominance of the right hand， babbling， socializing， and interacting with their surroundings.\n\n【18】Baseline and control MRI comparison showed characteristics of periventricular leukomalacia secondary to a hypoxic-ischemic event， with no significant changes between the two studies. The first fMRI showed intact corticospinal tracts， with decreased thickness and size at the corona radiata level， without evident changes when comparing both studies. However， an increased anisotropy was documented in the fMRI， which was more evident in the left corona radiata. These findings correlate with the clinical improvements observed in the patient.\n\n【19】Case 2\n\n【20】A 30-month-old female，31 weeks of gestational age， 1，800 grams of weight， Apgar score 5/7 at 1/5 min； neonatal respiratory distress syndrome was treated with CPAP.\n\n【21】TUS and MRI： Cortical and coronal decrease of the corpus callosum， intraventricular hemorrhage， and enlargement of the subarachnoid spacein the frontallobes. She stayed in the NICU fortwo months. She was diagnosed with Hypoxic-Ischemic Encephalopathy(HIE) with spastic quadriparesis CP and developmental delay， clinically without head support， unable to feed herself， and unable to communicate or interact with the environment The same procedure was performed as in case 1. The total number ofBM total nucleated cells infused intrathecally was 93.0×10°CD34+cells， as measured by flow cytometry.\n\n【22】Nine months after treatment： Complete head and trunk support， improvement in communication with simple sentences of two or three words， interaction with the environment， staying in four points， and remaining seated. fMRI with Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) performed before and10 months later demonstrated findings corresponding to hypoxic-ischemic events with no significant changes between both studies. Tractography showed intact corticospinal tracts， with decreased fiber thickness at the corona radiata level without evident differences between studies. In addition， DTI was performed， comparing the anisotropy fraction， demonstrating an increase in the values of the 2nd study， which is more evident at the left posterior limb of the internal capsule level. Like the first patient， these findings correlated with the clinical improvement she presented.\n\n【23】Case 3\n\n【24】A 22-month-old female， born at 41 weeks， 3，850 grams ofweight， Apgar score of 2/4 at 1/5 min， 5/7 at 10/15 min. Neonatal respiratory distress syndrome was treated with mechanical ventilation for seven days and then with CPAP， parenteral nutrition by central venous access， and enteral feeding for 23 days.\n\n【25】TUS and MRI： Multicystic encephalomalacia， diagnosed with HIE with CP spastic quadriparesis and developmental delay. Clinically， without head and trunk support， poor management of respiratory secretions， feed by gastrostomy， absence of communication abilities， neither interaction with the environment， and inability to follow obiects.\n\n【26】Autologous BM TNCs were delivered IT the same way as the patients described above. The total amount of BM TNCs infused was11.76×10° ofCD34+ cells， as measured by flow cytometry.\n\n【27】Six months later， the patient could reduce the anticonvulsant dose per kilo of weight， interact with the environment， and has a social smile.\n\n【28】Discussion\n\n【29】TNCs have a minimal capacity for transdifferentiation into neurons compared with other progenitor cells. So， how can we explain the improvement of patients with therapy? Evidence suggests that the benefits obtained through treatments such as this one is due to immunomodulatory effects since they migrate to sites where there is inflammation and cell damage and have a chemotactic impact ， secrete many bioactive molecules that promote cell regeneration  and angiogenesis .\n\n【30】This has been evidenced by the fact that this type of cell has been used successfully in therapies of another nature， where the damaged tissue is not of the hematopoietic lineage， such as neurons ， skeletal muscles， and kidneys .\n\n【31】Conventional imaging methods have not proved to be useful for objectively measuring improvements in patients with CP. The fMRI is a more sensitive and invaluable tool that can impartially dimension the changes and improvements after stem cell therapy. In addition， this can give us better evidence of neurogenesis and angiogenesis.\n\n【32】Because CP does not have a conventional or specific treatment owing to its complexity and does not boost regardless of standard treatments， as rehabilitation， stem cell therapy could be a therapeutic option to improve the quality of life of these patients and their families.\n\n【33】We decided to use the IT route as the route of administration for several reasons. Although the IV route is better in terms of safety， the number of cells administered IV that can cross the blood-brain barrier still needs to be clarified. In addition， it must be considered a loss of cells distributed in other organs (e.g.， liver， lung， etc.) . When cells are administered IT， more of these cells are concentrated in the hypoxic areas . The IT route has proven to be safe and tolerated， with side effects such as fever， headache，nausea， vomiting， and stiffness of the neck， which do not last for more than six days. fMRI is a tool that can objectively identify changes and improvements after cell therapy， as in the 3 patients mentioned above. Unfortunately， conventional imaging methods have not proven to be very useful since the size of ischemia or edema reduction does not directly correlate with the clinical improvements observed in patients . Currently， more sophisticated methods such as fMRI， which， through anisotropy， is more sensitive and allows analysis of the restructuration of the white matter and its fascicles，provide more evidence of neurogenesis and angiogenesis . Although that brain fMRI did not show evidence of morphological changes， an increase in the anisotropy fraction of the cortical tract was found compared to the study performed before treatment . Furthermore， it was also observed an increase in white matter formation.\n\n【34】Conclusion\n\n【35】CP is a condition that does not improve despite current treatments. The application of BM-TNC can enhance neurogenesis and angiogenesis in affected hypoxic-ischemic brain tissue， which could result in an alternative treatment for patients with this condition. This was demonstrated by fMRI in the cases above and can become a powerful tool to obiectively evaluate changes in the central nervous system， specifically in the white matter tracts. However， this must be confirmed in large， comparative， randomized， blinded studies.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 10:19:37", "endTime": "2024/09/24 10:20:02", "cost": 24.416}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:34", "update_time": "2024-09-23 18:20:02", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 18:19:37"}

Despite this drug not being available over the counter， there is an underground supply mostly over the internet. We report the case of a 22-year-old healthy female who had rapid demise after ingestion of only two tablets of DNP. She was previously healthy， developed symptoms in five hours and succumbed within thirty minutes of admission. Since 1918， 1919 published deaths have been reported from developed countries. To the best of our knowledge， this is the first reported fatal case from a developing country.\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】The demand for weight loss medications is on the rise globally due to the obesity pandemic. Drugs which are not formally FDA approved may still be unfortunately procured via the internet. In 1933， at Stanford University， Maurice Tainter discovered DNP and its use as a weight loss agent . DNP increases the basal metabolic rate by burning carbohydrates and fats leading to the much-desired rapid weight loss. As reports of dangerous side effects like cataract and even death emerged， in 1938， DNP was labeled “not fit for human consumption“. The first death due to DNP was in 1918 due to occupational exposure . In 1981， a US based physician faced legal action including imprisonment for marketing DNP as a weight loss agent under the name of“Mitcal”. It has a narrow therapeutic index and is extremely dangerous in overdose . DNP has been banned in UK and US and it has been labeled as a hazardous drug under Clean Air Act . Despite all these warnings， deaths due to DNP are still being reported. We report a case of rapid demise of a healthy22-year-old female following ingestion of only two tablets of DNP.\n\n【4】Case Presentation\n\n【5】A 22-year-old female， trained classical dancer， consumed two tablets of 2，4-dinitrophenol in the afternoon on the advice of a “gym buddy\" for weight loss. Five hours later she started complaining of fatigue， diaphoresis and myalgia followed by two episodes of vomiting. There was no significant past history of cardiovascular or respiratory illness. She was referred from a local private hospital to our center the same night about seven hours after the ingestion. At our center， on presentation， the patient was conscious and oriented and she admitted to consuming the tablets.On examination， her pulse rate was 130 beats/min with a systolic blood pressure of 70 mmHg and respiratory rate of 34 breaths/min. She had high grade fever (104F) with profuse sweating and she appeared cyanosed. Systemic examination was within normal limits. Chest roentgenogram was normal. Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia. She was started on supplemental oxygen therapy at8L to 10 L/min by non-rebreather mask. Patient was given a nasogastric lavage with saline followed by activated charcoal instillation through the Ryle's tube. Patient was shifted to intensive care unit. A central line was inserted and central venous pressure was measured at 4 cm to 6 cm of H，O. Appropriate intravenous fluid resuscitation was initiated followed by inotropes. The patient needed endotracheal intubation with mechanical ventilation with a FiO. of 100%.Despite adequate resuscitation， the patient relentlessly deteriorated and eventually succumbed within 30 min of presentation. Immediately after death， the body became stiff and rigid within 10 min. A medico-legal case being already registered， the body was sent for post mortem. The kidneys on histopathology showed cloudy degeneration with maintained corticomedullary differentiation . Thelungs showed pulmonary edema with the alveolar interstitial septa showing congested vessels . Histopathology of the heart was unremarkable.\n\n【6】Discussion\n\n【7】DNP is marketed illegally over the internet as a weight loss agent . It is available as a yellow crystalline powder or in tablet form . A typical regime is to start it at a low dose and then titrate it to a high dose taken for total period of two weeks. It acts by uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation and causes hyperthermia in the process similar to cyanide poisoning. The most serious adverse event is death. In review of literature since 2001， 20 deaths have been reported. Of these， in 13 cases it was used for weight loss； in 7 cases it was used with suicidal intent . Most common side effect reported is severe exfoliative dermatitis . Others include gastroenteritis， anorexia， renal failure， pancytopenia， confusion， agitation， coma， and convulsion . The average time of presentation is 8 h and average time of death is 14 h from consumption . Our patient developed symptoms within five hours and succumbed within eight hours of ingestion. The earliest complaint is diaphoresis followed bytachypnea，tachycardia and heart failure as was evident in our patient. There have been few reports of early rigor mortis as seen in our patient. The release of calcium from the cytosol secondaryto depleted adenosine triphosphate is the cause of the same . There is no specific antidote and outcome depends on early recognition. The treatment is mainly supportive in the form of activated charcoal wash， aggressive fluid therapy， anti-seizure measures， benzodiazepines as sedatives， rapid cooling， inotropes and early intubation . Antidotes used in cyanide poisoning like sodium thiosulfate， nitrates and hydroxocobalamin have not been mentioned in the reviews of treatment of DNP poisoning .\n\n【8】Conclusion\n\n【9】What actually decides the fatality in an individual consuming DNP is a million-dollar question. The innocent consumption oftwo tablets of 2，4-DNP on a friendly advice resulted in the death of our22-year-old healthy patient. Our patient did not have any evidence of premorbid conditions like muscle enzyme deficiency， cardiovascular or respiratory illness. The rapidity with which deaths due to DNP occur makes it mandatory to put in place stringent measures to stop the illegal sale of this banned drug via the internet. Wide publicity as regards the fatal consequences of 2，4-DNP (however innocently consumed) is the need of the hour.

She had no previous or family history of breast or ovarian cancer. Elastic hard mass was palpable in her right breast. Mammography and ultrasound revealed a lobulated shaped mass in the breast and multiple enlarged lymph nodes in the right axilla suspicious of breast cancer with multiple axillary lymph node metastases. The internal echo was homogeneous on ultrasound. The MRI appearance was of a lobulated mass surrounded by slight rim and septal enhancement within the tumor. Biopsy of the lesion revealed invasive ductal carcinoma.\n\n【7】The patient underwent 'F-FDG PET/CT of the right breast and axillary lesions as part of the preoperative work-up. Scanning was performed using a digital PET/CT scanner (Discovery MI； GE Medical Systems， Milwaukee， WI) about 60 min after the intravenous administration of 5.49MBq/kg oflF-FDG. PET was performed from the skull base to the proximal thigh with the patient in the supine position； the patient was then moved into the prone position using a hand-made breast positioning device， and single-bed PET/CT was performed of the breast region alone. The CT and PET acquisition parameters were as follows. Non-contrast whole-body and additional regional CT scans were obtained at 120 kV with automatic dose modulation， and PET was performed with acquisition time of 2.10 min per bed position in three-dimensional mode. The PET images were then reconstructed using Q.Clear (GE Medical Systems； B=400) with attenuation correction. The interval between the two PET/CT scans was 17 min. The images revealed marked focal IF-FDG uptake with SUVmax of 27.9 that corresponded to the breast lesion identified on other modalities. The tumor appeared heterogeneous accumulation on PET image . No distant metastases were detected. The clinical staging was T2N1M0 Stage II. Right modified radical mastectomy was performed. Histological analysis revealed invasive ductal carcinoma， mixed type， with pleomorphic carcinoma components. The histological appearance was of a mixed tumor with solid and cystic components bounded by fibrous septa. Areas with abundant tumor cells in the lesion identified with Hematoxylin and Eosin (HE) staining and with Ki-67 staining matched the site of marked IF-FDG accumulation seen on the PET images， and fibrotic or cystic sites corresponded with areas of hypo-1F-FDG accumulation seen on the PET images.\n\n【8】Discussion\n\n【9】In the present case of invasive ductal carcinoma， the tumor demonstrated heterogeneous accumulation on PET that correlated to intratumoral heterogeneity histopathologically.\n\n【10】The role of PET/CT in breast cancer has been the pre-treatment systemic staging of locally advanced breast cancer. Several breast cancer guidelines have not recommended PET/CT for women with apparent early-stage breast cancer or even for those with operable stage III breast cancer . The use of PET/CT for imaging primary breast lesions is hampered by its low spatial resolution， which reduces its sensitivity by missing small lesions； in addition， it is less sensitive than sentinel lymph node biopsy for assessing axillary lymph node involvement. The low prevalence of distant metastases in these patients and the relatively high risk of false-positive findings are considered to detract from the usefulness of PET/CT for distant staging in these patients .\n\n【11】The development of dedicated Breast PET (dBPET) systems has enabled detailed high-resolution imaging by setting the detector close to breast lesion. An association between baseline tumor glycolytic activity and tumor biology have been reported. Masumoto et al. reported that intratumoral heterogeneity on dBPET can predict the malignancy grade of breast cancer . They considered that such intratumoral heterogeneity could not be demonstrated on conventional PET/CT. However， the dBPET is specialized for breast scan， it cannot obtain whole-body image at same equipment.\n\n【12】Advances in PET/CT technology have improved image quality and the ability to detect small lesions. In a previous study， the quantitation and detectability of sub-centimeter spheres was higher with a digital PET/CT system compared with conventional OSEM-based reconstruction . In the present case of invasive ductal carcinoma， PET/CT imaging acquired with a digital PET/CT system demonstrated heterogeneous 18F-FDG accumulation. A. marked abundance of tumor cells identified within the lesion histopathologically with HE staining matched the region of marked18F-FDG accumulation identified on the PET images， and fibrotic and cystic sites matched those of 1F-FDG hypo-accumulation. It is known that US and MRI have high tissue resolution； however， the present case shows the ability of digital PET/CT to evaluate the internal properties of tumors.\n\n【13】In conclusion， we report a case of invasive ductal carcinoma that demonstrated heterogeneous IF-FDG accumulation on novel digital PET/CT that correlated to histopathological intratumoral heterogeneity. Digital PET/CT imaging shows potential for evaluating the internal properties of a lesion and may enable prognostic prediction. with Ki-67 staining (c， d) that matches areas of marked 1F-FDG accumulation on the PET images. Fibrotic and cystic sites that do not contain tumor cell lesions match the sites of 1F-FDG hypo-accumulation.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 10:17:21", "endTime": "2024/09/24 10:17:29", "cost": 8.246}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:33", "update_time": "2024-09-23 18:17:30", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 18:17:21"}

In current study， the hepatoprotective aptitude of T. cordata was evaluated against Aceclofenac (ACF) instigated oxidative stress in rats. Leaves of T. cordata were extracted in methanol and various fractions were prepared by polarity-based method. Qualitative and quantitative spectrophotometric analysis along with HPLC-DAD analysis was performed on samples. Antioxidant potential of extracts was identified by DPPH method while BSA method was used to assess the anti-inflammatory activity. Rats were divided into various groups and oxidative stress was induced by ACF in liver of rats. T. cordata Methanol extract (TCM) was used to mitigate the oxidative stress. Serum analysis for liver enzymes and tissue analysis for enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants was performed. Qualitative and quantitative spectrophotometric analysis of various extracts depicted the presence of phenolics， flavonoids， andtannins. In vitro antioxidant and anti-inflammatory studies further elaborated the protective potential of plant extracts. Furthermore， treatment of rats with ACF showed decline (p<0.05) in the level of liver antioxidant enzymes， in contrast，elevation was found in the concentration ofhydrogen peroxide and nitrite in hepatic tissues. Increased serum markers of the liver were revealed after ACF treatment. Hepatocyte inflammation and injuries were prominent in histopathological studies of the liver in ACF-treated rats. However， the administration of TCM to ACF-intoxicated rats reduced liver injuries and restored the levels of antioxidant enzymes and free radical towards normal rats. T. cordata possess strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory potential due to presence of polyphenols and can help in development of drug against liver injuries with strong antioxidant potential.\n\n【2】Keywords： Telosma cordata； Antioxidants； Anti-inflammatory； Oxidative stress； Aceclofenac\n\n【3】Abbreviations\n\n【4】TCM： Telosma cordata Methanol extract； ER： Endoplasmic Reticulum； TPC： Total Phenolic Content； TFC： Total Flavonoid Content； TTC： Total Tannin Content； HPLC： High Performance Liquid Chromatography； DPPH： 2，2-Diphenylpicrylhydrazyl； BSA： Bovine Serum albumin； ACF：Aceclofenac； TLC： Total Leukocyte Count； MCH： Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin； PTC： Platelets Count； MCV： Mean Corpuscular Volume； ALT： Alanine Transferase；AST： Aspartate Transaminase； ALP： Alkaline Phosphate； SOD： Superoxide Dismutase； POD： peroxidase； CAT： Catalase\n\n【5】Introduction\n\n【6】Oxidative stress is illustrated as over production of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS)， resulting in injury to molecules like proteins， lipids， and DNA . ROS have the ability to initiate lipid peroxidation， known as a chain reaction， and cause oxidation of other cellular components， such as DNA and proteins. The main cause of liver ailment is lipid peroxidation which arises due to prolonged exposure to hepatotoxins. These free radicals enhance the production of Thiobarbituric Reactive Substances (TBARS)，when they interact with the polyunsaturated fatty acids，henceleading to necrosis. Therefore， Oxidative stress causes several ailments i.e.， cancer， atherosclerosis， nervous disorder， diabetes， idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis， asthma， and liver fibrosis. General metabolic reactions and some biological factors including air containments aid in the production of ROS in living organisms .\n\n【7】Aceclofenac (ACF)； a Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drug (NSAID)， is a well-known orally administered phenylacetic acid derivative that has been reported as potential drug for treatment of certain conditions like osteoarthritis . Injury to the gastrointestinal mucosa， bleeding peptic ulcer， gastrointestinal complications， and inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis is directly linked to the continued intake of ACF. Biotransformation of ACF into diclofenac leads to selective inhibition of COX-2. Furthermore， some previous research on NSAIDs has discovered that these drugs can cause liver toxicity and other side effects； however， the extent of these side effects is uncertain .\n\n【8】Silymarin is an extract of Silybum marianum (milk thistle) containing polyphenolic flavonoid compound， silybin being the most important one. It acts as a radical scavenger and therapeutic agent by reducing free radical production and ameliorating damage caused by xenobiotics. Silymarin is used to treat liver injuries and severe hepatitis . Studies have shown that silymarin shows protective aptitude towards hepatic， renal and gastric damage . Silymarin has ability to stabilize cell membranes and enhance protein production. In vivo investigations have shown a remarkable hepatoprotective effect of silymarin on liver injuries of diverse etiology .\n\n【9】In normal bodyconditions， endogenous antioxidants are involved in controlling ROS production. The main reason of oxidative stress is loss of proportion between ROS production and antioxidants； thus， this oxidative stress interferes with a lot of cellular functions and leads to different pathological conditions such as inflammation， asthma， aging， and carcinogenesis . Vitamins also known as antioxidants， such as vitamin C， are also important in regulating metabolic signaling pathways that lead to the organs'perfect activities. Synthetic medicines for treating liver injuries can be less efficient and have disastrous effects. Different natural plants and microbes are used as the main component in the manufacturing process of medicinal products. Plants naturally contain different nutrients and antioxidants that integrate into their defense system to protect the plant itself and other organisms from damage induced by reactive substances. The world has recognized the importance of plant-based antioxidants， i.e.， phenols and flavonoids as a treatment for tissue ailments and injuries .\n\n【10】Telosma cordata (Burm. f.) Merr， locally known as Chinese Violet， is a perennial creeper and belongs to the family Apocynaceae， a native plant of South China， India， Burma， and Indochina . It is generally cultivated in different parts of Southeast Asia， especially in Thailand， Malaysia， and Vietnam. T. cordata is used as an antidote， tranquilizer， and antipyretic agent. In vitro cytotoxicity of methanolic extract of leaves of T. cordata was found against Hep-G2 (haptonema carcinoma). It is found to be effective against backache and hematuria. In this study， we evaluated the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of T. cordata against Aceclofenac-induced hepatotoxicity in rats.\n\n【11】Methodology\n\n【12】Plant material\n\n【13】Fresh leaves of T. cordata were collected from the area near the Faisal Mosque of Islamabad， Pakistan in September 2018 and was identified by Dr. Syed Afzal Shah. A voucher specimen (#130430) was deposited at the Pakistan Herbarium， Quaid-i-Azam， University， Islamabad.\n\n【14】Extract preparation： Leaves were air dried under shade in a non-humid area for almost 22 days， and then the dried plant was converted to a fine powder (1.3 kg) by a 60-mesh size willy-mill. Ninety five percent methanol was used at a ratio of 1：3 to soak plant powder and reflexed for 72 h (thrice). Filtration was carried out to remove solid material and desired fractions viz n-Hexane (TCH)， Chloroform(TCC)， Ethyl acetate (TCE)， and n-Butanol (TCB)， Aqueous (TCA) were prepared according to the standard protocol of Toma et al. All the fractions were dried and kept at -4°C for further investigations.\n\n【15】In vitro studies\n\n【16】Qualitative phytochemical screening： The identification of phytochemical constitutes such as alkaloids， phenols， flavonoids， cardiac glycosides， coumarins， saponin， tannin， anthraquinone， flavonoid， and triterpenes was assessed in various prepared fractions of T. cordata by using standard procedures described by Saima et al. Plant extracts were boiled with distilled water and relevant solutions were prepared for qualitative phytochemical analysis.\n\n【17】Quantitative phytochemical evaluation： Total tannin，phenolic， and flavonoid content of various extracts of T. cordata were evaluated by standard methods of Van Buren and Robinson， Danilewicz， and Park et al.， respectively . The calibration curve of rutin(y=0.0013x+0.0914： R²=0.9914) for flavonoid while gallic acid curve(y=0.0016x+0.1459，R’=0.9815) for phenol and tannin content was constructed and values were represented as milligrams of RE/g and GAE/g respectively.\n\n【18】1，1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay： The protocol designed by Chan et al. was used to calculate the radical scavenging ability ofplant extracts against free radicals produced by DPPH.500 ul of various concentrations (31.25 ug/ml to 1000 ug/ml) of plant fractions and crude extract were mixed with 1 ml of DPPH solution(0.1 mM). DPPH was added to 500 ul of methanol and taken as a control. Experiment was performed in triplicates and the following formula was applied to find out the percentage scavenging activity of extracts against DPPH：\n\n【19】Scavenging activity ={1-Absorbance of the sample}/Absorbance of controlx100\n\n【20】Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) assay： Assay protocol of the BSA test described by Williams et al. was used with some amendments to ascertain the anti-inflammatory properties of the plant fractions. BSA (5%) was dissolved in Tris Buffered Saline to prepare the BSA solution. Different concentrations of plant extracts (300 ul)and positive control (aspirin) were mixed with 1000 ul of BSA solution. A. mixture of BSA solution and buffer was taken as a control. Protein denaturation was initiated by heating the solution at 70°C for 15 min. The solution was given incubation for 10 min at ambient temperature. The activity of the solutions (level of protein precipitation) was measured at 660 nm. The experiments were conducted in triplicate and the percentage of inhibition of protein denaturation was evaluated by using the following equation：\n\n【21】% Anti-Denaturation Activity = (Absorbance of control -Absorbance of sample)/Absorbance of control×100\n\n【22】High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC)：Flavonoids and phenolics analysis of TCM extract by HPLC method was carried out using an Agilent 1200 series， Germany， particle size； 5 um and capacity for separation is 25 ml， equipped with UV detector. The sample was dissolved with chromatographic-grade methanol. The test solution and standard were passed through 0.45um membrane filter paper for filtration. Separation of polyphenols in each sample was performed using a column Zorbex plus RSC8(Agilent U.S.A)， reverse phase analytical at 25℃. Mobile phases A：Acetonitrile (5%)； methanol (10%)； water (85%)； acetic acid (1%) and phase B： methanol (60%)； acetonitrile (40%)； acetic acid (1%). The applied flow rate and injection volume was kept as 20 ul/min and 1.20 ml respectively. Standard peaks were used for the quantification of various compounds at different wavelengths. in vivo studies\n\n【23】Ethical statement： The ethical committee of Quaid-i-Azam University， Pakistan provided the ethical approval (Bch# 311)， and all the investigations were carried out by following the standard US guidelines.\n\n【24】Acute toxicity study： Before starting the experimentation， acute toxicity test was performed by following the guidelines of OECD. Female rats (n=6) weighing 130 g to 150 g body weight (bw) were used for the study and the experiment was started at an initial dose of 50 mg/kg bw of TCM for 14 days. The experiment was further extended on male rats (n=6) for 14 days with different concentrations of TCM (100 mg/kg， 500 mg/kg， 1000 mg/kg， 1500 mg/kg， 3000 mg/kg bw) as no signs of distress， pain， or toxicity were found at the initial stage. All the rats were observed on daily basis and no sign of toxicity was found， hence 150 mg/kg and 300 mg/kg bw doses were chosen Was to analyze the hepatoprotective potency of TCM . Moreover， blood samples were collected on the last day of the experiment， and hematological profile was studied.\n\n【25】Study design\n\n【26】Methanol extract of T. cordata (TCM) was selected for in vivo studies. Forty-two Sprague-Dawley male rats with weights ranging between 160 gto 210g were selected from the Animal Primate Facility of Quaid-i-Azam University. Basal diet and water were provided to rats and temperature was maintained at (25℃± 2C) with a 12 h dark/light cycle.\n\n【27】Dose plan： Rats were segregated into seven different groups and supply of feed and water to the rat’s cages was halted one day before initiating this experiment.\n\n【28】Group I： received 0.9% saline and labeled as control.\n\n【29】Group II： ACF (60 mg/kg b.w.)\n\n【30】Group III： ACF and Silymarin (200 mg/kg b.w.)\n\n【31】Group IV： ACF and TCM (150 mg/kgb.w.)\n\n【32】Group V： ACF and TCM (300 mg/kg b.w.)\n\n【33】Group VI： TCM (150 mg/kg b.w.) alone\n\n【34】Group VII： TCM (300 mg/kg b.w.) alone\n\n【35】Total 18 doses were administered after every 24 h gap for 36 days and after completion of experiment， rats were dissected. Blood was collected from ventral side of heart and liver was removed， washed with chilled saline， and weighed. One piece of each organ was stored for biochemical analysis and the second piece was preserved in 10%formalin for histopathological studies.\n\n【36】Body and organ weight： Weight of all the rats was observed at the start and then on the last day of the experiment. Initial and final body weights were compared to calculate the percentage increase in body weight of rats. On the time of liver removal from dissected body， relative weight of liver was measured separately.\n\n【37】Biochemical assessmentt of serum： Serum markers such as Alanine Transaminase (ALT)， Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP)， Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST)， total bilirubin and albumin were analyzed by AMP Diagnostic kits (Krenngasse 8010 Graz， Austria) after collection of serum by centrifugation of blood at a specific speed of 3000 xg for 20 min.\n\n【38】Preparation of homogenate： For the preparation of liver homogenate， 100 mg of liver tissue was taken and homogenized in already prepared 1 ml of K，PO buffer with a molarity of 100 mM and containing EDTA with a molarity of 1 mM(pH=7.4). Prepared homogenate was then centrifuged at 1500 xg at a maintained temp of4°C for half an hour. After centrifugation， pellet was discarded， and the supernatant was collected for enzymatic assays.\n\n【39】Protein estimation： The method of Lowry and Rosebrough was followed for the estimation of total soluble protein in liver homogenate. BSA was used as a standard to measure the protein contents.\n\n【40】Antioxidant enzyme evaluation： Standard protocols of Chance and Maehly， Kakkar et al.， and Jollow et al. were followed to evaluate the activity of in vivo antioxidant enzymes including Catalase (CAT)， Superoxide Dismutase (SOD)， Peroxidase (POD)， and reduced Glutathione (GSH)， respectively . Estimation of enzyme activity was done by recording absorbance change of reaction mixture as 0.01/min of activity and presented as Unit/mg of protein for CAT， SOD， and POD assay and uM GSH of protein for glutathione assay.\n\n【41】Estimation of lipid peroxidation and hydrogen peroxide(H，O，)： Estimation of levels of Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Species(TBARS) was done by adding 0.1 M phosphate buffer， homogenate，100 mM ascorbate， and 100 mM ferric chloride solution to test tube. Absorbance change of reaction mixture was noted at 535 nm. Activity was designated as nM TBARS/min/mg tissue. Levels of Hydrogen Peroxide (H，O，) were determined by the ability of horse reddish peroxidase to oxidize phenol red by H，O， . Calculation was done by comparing absorbance change of reaction mixture with blank at 610 nm and expressed as H，O，/min/mg tissue.\n\n【42】Nitrite assay： To estimate the level of nitrite， Griess reagent dependentGrishamet2 methodologyWasapplied. Homogenate was dissolved in 3.0 M NaOH and 5% ZnSO solution. After centrifugation at 6400 xg， supernatant was dissolved in Griess reagent. Absorbance was observed at 540 nm whereas calibration curve was drawn against sodium nitrite to define the concentration of nitrites.\n\n【43】Histopathologicalexamination of tissues： For histopathological investigation，liver tissues were preserved in 10% formalin. Washing of those tissues was done in increasing concentration of alcohol i.e.，50%， 70%， 90% and 100%. 4 um to 5 um thin tissue sections were embedded in paraffin and hematoxylin/eosin dye was used for staining the tissies. Light microscope (DIALUX 20 EB) was used to examine the slides at 40x magnification.\n\n【44】Statistical analysis\n\n【45】Results are represented as means±standard deviation. For the determination of significance among variables， one-way ANOVA was performed by using statistics 8.1 software. A p-value of≤0.05was assumed to be significant in Tukey HSD Post hoc comparison. Results are analyzed and presented using Graph prism 5.0 and Microsoft excel 2010.\n\n【46】Results\n\n【47】Yield of fractions of Telosma cordata\n\n【48】The extraction yield of methanolic extract of plant was approximately 55 g.

Results of these studies are illustrated in Table 1. Tannins， phenols， and coumarins were found in each fraction of the plant sample whereas alkaloids were found only in aqueous fraction (TCA). Presence of saponins in each fraction except TCE was ensured by these assays. Flavonoids were majorly observed in two fractions including TCM and TCB but absent in all other fractions. TCA， TCB and TCE fractions did not contain anthraquinone though other three fractions contained these phytochemical contents.\n\n【57】Quantitative identification\n\n【58】The quantitative phytochemical analysis of T. cordata indicated (Mean ±SD)； Different superscripts specify significance at p<0.05BSA： Bovine Serum Albumin that TCC and TCM have a high amount of flavonoid， phenol， and tannin content (57.89±1.77 and 44.82±0.88 mg RE/g)， (334.64±1.91 and 296.10±3.14 mg GAE/g)，and (301.61±1.68 and 309.56±1.27 mg GAE/g) respectively. At the same time， TCH exhibited the lowest amount of phenolics， flavonoids， andtannins. The quantitative percent yield of phytochemicals for various extracts of T. cordata are shown in Table 2.\n\n【59】Table 3： Antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity of T. cordata\n\n|  | DPPH assay ICso (ug/ml)  | BSA assay ICso (rg/ml)  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| TCM  | 212.2±3.6  | 229.7±3.11  |\n| TCH  | 702.6±4.2a  | 797.6±4.3  |\n| TCE  | 576.3±2.8c  | 543.3±2.4c  |\n| TCC  | 649.8±3.4  | 718.8±4.6b  |\n| TCB  | 380.3±2.9  | 489.9±2.6  |\n| TCA  | 261.3±3.1  | 310.6±1.8  |\n| Ascorbic acid  | 131.7±3.99  |  |\n| Aspirin  |  | 61.48±1.1g  |\n\n【61】Free radical scavenging potential of T. cordata\n\n【62】The crude extract and fractions of T. cordata converted the stable， purple-colored DPPH into diphenyl hydrazine (yellow) due to its scavenging power against DPPH. Figure 1 represents the % inhibition of free radicals by T. cordata fractions. Among all the extracts， methanol extract of plant exhibited the highest % inhibition of free radical (highest scavenging activity) at all doses； however， TCM was considerably (p<0.05) less effective than the scavenging activity of ascorbic acid.

In contrast， silymarin treatment showed ameliorating effects against ACF-induced toxicity as body and organ weights of this group were similar to normal rats. Co-administration ofTCM (150 mg/kg bw and 300 mg/kg bw) with ACF suppressed the toxic effects of ACF and showed an increase in body weight whereas restoration of absolute and relative liver weight was also observed. Administration of rats with only plant dose (150 mg/kg bw and 300 mg/kg bw) depicted a significant (p<0.05) elevation in body weight .\n\n【85】T. cordata restored serum markers in liver\n\n【86】After administration of ACF， an increase in levels of specific liver serum enzymes such as ALP， AST， ALT， and total bilirubin was observed . Though， albumin showed a significant decrease in its level. Increased levels of various serum enzymes are associated with hepatic damage with loss of integrity of cells. By contrast， co-administration of ACF with silymarin significantly (p<0.05) restored the level of these serum enzymes towards the control rats. Likewise， simultaneous treatment of Aceclofenac and TCM doses (150 mg/kg bw and 300 mg/kg bw) showed a remarkable effect (p<0.05) in repressing the levels of serum markers， yet an increase in albumin level was also notable.\n\n【87】T. cordata restored antioxidant enzymes in liver\n\n【88】CAT： Catalase； SOD： Superoxide Dismutase： POD： Peroxidase： GSH：Reduced Glutathione\n\n【89】T. cordata reduced toxicity in liver tissues\n\n【90】Table 7 summarizes the hepatoprotective ability of TCM on levels of H，O。 nitrite， TBARS， and total protein. Total protein was decreased， while a significant (p<0.05) increase in H，O。 nitrite， and TBARS was noticed in ACF-treated rats compared to normal rats. TCM administration with ACF markedly (p<0.05) reduced the concentration of biochemical markers while an elevation was observed in protein level. Rats treated with TCM alone did not affect the levels of biochemical markers. By reducing the hepatotoxicity caused by ACF， silymarin administration showed a significant(p<0.05) restoration of nitrites， TBARS， H，O， and total protein toward the normallevel.\n\n【91】Protective role of T. cordata on histology of liver\n\n【92】Liver of normal rats showed a normal architecture with intact hepatocytes， central vein and equally distributed cytoplasm. Liver of ACF treated rats showed severe injuries such as sinusoidal obstructions， necrosis， fibrosis， and hepatocellular degeneration as alterations were prominent in morphology of tissue. Administration of high dose of TCM with ACF showed improvement in morphological structure of liver by reducing the liver damages and injuries hence showing protection against liver toxicity while rats administered with low dose of plant TCM along with ACF showed necrosis and some injuries. Liver of rats from TCM alone treated groups had shown normal morphological features of liver . Silymarin (200 mg/kg bw)， a standard drug， was given to restore structural abnormalities and cellular anomalies as shown in Figure 3 and 5C.\n\n【93】Discussion\n\n【94】Toxic chemical substances cause liver injuries in body which induces oxidative stress and inflammation. Natural antioxidants and food additives help to reduce induced stress and toxic effects of xenobiotics by scavenging free radicals. Humans have been using plants as a source of conventional medicines for hundreds of vears. Many herbal extracts， prepared from plants， have been examined for their antioxidant， anti-inflammatory， andhepatoprotective properties against liver injuries in various experimental animal models . In the present study， a phytochemical qualitative study confirmed the presence of alkaloids， flavonoids， tannins， coumarins， phenols， and saponins in T. cordata fractions.\n\n【95】The production of ROS is correlated with a number of severe and persistent body disorders which embraces liver， pulmonary， neurodegenerative， and digestive infections. Diet is a rich source of antioxidants and can help the body to regulate the deficiency of antioxidants endogenously and thus restore all the damage caused because of oxidative stress.\n\n【96】Phenolics and flavonoids such as rutin， quercetin， gallic acid， catechin and caffeic acid were found in the HPLC analysis of TCM. Rutin is a well-known standard antioxidantandprotective compound against toxicity and getting recognition due to its medicinalproperties. On the other hand， catechin shows strong activity against free radicals thus having antioxidant activities . Thus， the presence of these compounds in TCM extract could be the reason for scavenging free radicals when evaluated against DPPH and showing antioxidant activity. The presence of antioxidants in TCM is also linked with the inhibition of denaturation of bovine serum albumin and showing anti-inflammatory potential. Our findings are similar to the studies of Naz et al. which claimed that phytochemicals of Pilea umbrosa have antioxidant properties .\n\n【97】ACF has been identifieddascommonly associated with hepatotoxicity and oxidative stress and it is also assumed as the major cause of cellular disorder by damaging the antioxidant enzymatic system， acute hepatitis， and increasing peroxidation of lipids. Hepatotoxicity from NSAIDs can be found at any time after initiation of treatment， but like most severe drug reactions， it occurs after 6 to12 weeks after administration. In the liver， ACF causes activate lipid peroxidation， necrotic and apoptotic cell death， and deterioration of membranal structure leading to the secretion of enzymatic components in blood. According to previous research， a significant increase in levels of biochemical markers i.e.，ALP， ALT，and AST can be seen after oral induction ofanimal models with Aceclofenac . Toaccess the protective potential ofour plant， an Aceclofenac exposed system is created in rats. Our research has clearly demonstrated that treating the animal models with Aceclofenac at higher dose for about eight weeks on alternate days resulted in the induction of hepatic damage and oxidative stress， while T. cordata showed promising protective results against stress and organ damage. Our results are in line with a previous study .\n\n【98】This study has also found that TCM did not cause injurious alterations in hematological markers， including the count of HB， MCV， WBC， HCT，RBC，and platelets in rats， even at a high dose of3000 mg/kg. TCM is found to be non-toxic， as any signs of discomfort or pain was not obvious in TCM-treated rats. Similar results for the methanolic extract of the plant are declared by previous findings .\n\n【99】Body weight is an important factor in the conflicting effects of hepatotoxins and is replicated as an element that limits toxicity studies. In the current study， the percent increase in body weight of rats was reduced， whereas absolute and relative liver weight was enhanced with ACF administration. Basically， NSAIDs induce oxidative stress by producing free radicals in the body that cause an increase in the organ weight by affecting the metabolic process of different organs. Same results are represented by previous research Bort et al.\n\n【100】Naturally， our body has a specific antioxidant defense mechanism that includes endogenous enzymatic antioxidants such as CAT， SOD， POD， and glutathione. These enzymes along with exogenous antioxidants protect the organ and body from damage caused by oxidative stress by capturing ROS. Catalase has ability to neutralize hydrogen peroxide H.O， via a catalytic transformation or through peroxidation metabolism  while superoxide dismutase is a metallic enzyme that helps in the conversion of superoxide radicals to H，O， and O， by dismutase reaction to reduce the toxicity . Glutathione peroxidase causes the neutralization of peroxides and thus providing protection against toxicity of ROS. Abnormal necrosis in liver is stimulated by decreased levels of GSH . All these antioxidant enzymes and GSH level in cells were reduced markedly in ACF treated group， which have caused injury in liver cells through deposition of ROS. Administration of TCM along with ACF has significantly restored antioxidant enzyme concentration near to normal range. TCM contains many bioactive components which are efficient in balancing the levels of antioxidants as well as in combating different infectious diseases. Increasedlipid peroxidation is associated with higher levels of TBARS that result in tissue destruction and failure of antioxidant defense mechanisms . ACF-intoxicated rats treated with TCM (300 mg/kg) reduced the lipid peroxide levels compared with rats treated with ACF only.\n\n【101】An extreme notch of disruptions in hepatic cells consisting of cellular hypertrophy， intrusion of inflammatory cells， intrusion of the central lobule，and sinusoidal obstruction was observed in rats treated with ACF dose through histological examination of tissues.Low/high doses of TCM with ACF dose reduced these losses in the bodytissues. No morphological changes were observed in the liver anatomy of groups treated with TCM doses alone. Similar results have been declared by Gupta and Pandey， who claimed that Terminalia bellirica fruit extract has a protective aptitude against Aceclofenac endured hepatic damage . Many biocomponents and polyphenols are present in TCM extract， which have potential antioxidant properties and thus help the plant to prevent tissue damage by reducing peroxidation of lipids in body organs， including the liver.\n\n【102】Conclusion\n\n【103】The current study illustrated the potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory propensity of T. cordata extract. The presence of flavonoids and polyphenols are claimed for the possible antioxidant， anti-inflammatory and hepatoprotective mechanism of T. cordata. Our data also revealed protective effect of TCM by regulating the levels of enzymatic markers， anti-inflammatory mediators and serum markers against the intoxicated effects of ACF. Moreover， TCM reduces the injuries of liver architecture， hence restoring the hepatic morphology.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 11:45:33", "endTime": "2024/09/24 11:46:19", "cost": 45.577}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:33", "update_time": "2024-09-23 19:46:19", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 19:45:33"}

Her past medical history included heart transplant8 years ago for cardiomyopathy， hypertension and a recent open umbilical hernia repair with mesh. Her medications included oral immunosuppressive medications (tacrolimus and mycophenalate) and anti-hypertensive's (amlodipone). She was not known to have any allergies.\n\n【2】Routine observations on admission were normal. Abdominal examination demonstrated a non-distended abdomen with localized guarding and rebound tenderness in the right iliac fossa.\n\n【3】ECG was in sinus rhythm with heartbeat of 96 Beats per Minute (BPM). A recent echocardiogram demonstrated normal ventricular and valvular function. Routine biochemistry was largely unremarkable with a mildly raised CRP at 38 but normal white cell count and no evidence of neutrophilia. Computerized tomography showed uncomplicated acute appendicitis and a post-operative seroma around her previous open umbilical hernia repair site.\n\n【4】Broad spectrum intravenous antimicrobial treatment was commenced prior to surgery and the case was discussed with the patient's transplant team. It was advised that immunosuppressant agents be continued as per her usual dose. Additional treatment with steroids or anti-fungals was not recommended.\n\n【5】An open appendicectomy was performed. The appendix was divided and delivered through a Lanz incision using an Alexi's wound protector. The patient remained hemodynamically stable throughout the procedure with systolic BP ranging from 98 mmHg to 118 mmHg. She was admitted to a general surgical ward post-operatively where she made an unremarkable recovery and was discharged three days later. The patient returned 2 weeks post-operatively for a planned wound review and was noted to have a clean well-healing scar. No major complications were recorded within the 30-day post-operative period and histological examination of the specimen confirmed acute appendicitis.\n\n【6】Discussion\n\n【7】A clear understandingand appreciation ofthe altered physiology in particular cardiac physiology in transplant patients is vital. This knowledge is crucial to the general surgeon and will help guide with decisions such as the best approach to intra-abdominal surgery. In addition it is important to recognize that transplant patients are often on of a cocktail of immunosuppressive medications and the impact this may have on post-operative complications， in particular surgical site infections. Effective management of such a patient is best approached with the aid of a multidisciplinary team.\n\n【8】Altered cardiac physiology in transplant patients and the impact on intra-abdominal surgery\n\n【9】The transplanted heart lacks both sympathetic as well as parasympathetic innervation. The loss of vagal tone results in a higher resting heart rate； between 90-110 Beats per Minute (BPM) . Another key change in physiology is that the transplanted heart depends entirely on venous return. It is said to be pre-load dependant'. In normal cardiac physiology，hypovolaemia results in an increase in cardiac output by increasing heart rate and increasing contractility. This is achieved by the stimulation of neurohormonal pathways as well as the activation of Frank-Starling mechanism.\n\n【10】A transplanted heart cannot respond to sympathetic and parasympathetic stimuli， and is therefore dependant entirely on venous return . This is an important consideration in intra-abdominal surgery， as many gold standard approaches are laparoscopic . Laparoscopic surgery involves establishing pneumoperitoneum. The increase in intra-abdominal pressures during surgery may decrease venous return and this in turn may reduce heart rate. Unfortunately a denervated heart will be unable to compensate by utilizing neurohormonal pathways due to the reasons discussed above . In the case reported here， this altered cardiac physiology was the primary reason an open approach was adopted. Whilst laparoscopic appendicectomy， is now the gold standard approach， in this case an open approach was in the patient's best interest.\n\n【11】Immunosuppression： surgical considerations\n\n【12】To reduce the risk of rejection， transplanted patients are on a combination of immunosuppressant medications. The commonest combination is tacrolimus and mycophenalate with or without prednisolone . Whilst an important， anti-rejection strategy， one of the key considerations post-operatively is the increased risk of infections. In particular the increased risk of surgical site infections. In our case this was an important consideration for several reasons. Firstly not only was our patient immunosuppressed， an additional factor to consider was the surgical approach. An open approach is associated with increased risk of surgical site infections. To reduce this risk， intra-operatively an Alexi's wound retractor was used. This offered protection to the wound edge during the operation， in particular during dissection of the acutely inflamed appendix. An additional advantage of using an Alexi’s wound retractor was to confer better visibility intra-operatively facilitating the identification of the appendix prior to dissection.\n\n【13】Effective multidisciplinary approach\n\n【14】In order to effectively manage transplant patients it is important to involve a number of teams.\n\n【15】Pre-operatively， as per Enhanced Recovery after Surgery (ERAS) protocol， the patient was counseled. Information regarding the approach was discussed with the patient and consent was obtained for an open appendicectomy， due to reasons discussed above. Additionally， advice was sought from the patient’s transplant team. In particular， guidance was sought over the need to continue immunosuppression pre and post operatively. Furthermore a clear direction was sought for the need to start steroid and initiate anti-fungal therapy. The need for anti-microbials was also discussed with the microbiologists.\n\n【16】Pre-operatively， the case was discussed with cardiologist and cardiac physiologists to ensure that the transplanted heart was optimized prior to general anesthesia. All essential imaging and cardiac physiology tests (echocardiogram， ECG) were conducted to the highest standard. Anesthetic opinion was sought both pre-operatively and intra-operatively， paying particular regard to goal directed fluid management and effective use of pain management. In accordance with ERAS intra-operative protocols， the incision was deliberately made as small as possible and care was taken to ensure strict aseptic control was maintained throughout. Despite a small incision， surgical visibility was adequate due to the use of the Alexis wound retractor.\n\n【17】Post-operatively，thepatient Was discussed with the physiotherapists and early mobilization was encouraged with good oral pain control. Once again in keeping with the ERAS protocols， the patient was encouraged to start oral intake early and effective pain management was prescribed.\n\n【18】Effective management of such patients is dependent on input from a number of specialties. Strict adherence to the ERAS protocols pre， peri and post-operatively ensures that patients are offered the best possible care allowing them to return to their normal activities of daily life sooner and decreasing post-operative complications.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 10:49:23", "endTime": "2024/09/24 10:49:49", "cost": 26.34}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:33", "update_time": "2024-09-23 18:49:47", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 18:49:21"}

The cumulative rate of work disability was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The relationship between socioeconomic and demographic data， self-reported quality of life， clinical features (clinical manifestations， diagnostic criteria， disease activity， damage， co-morbidities) and work disabilities were examined with univariable and multivariable analysis.\n\n【4】Results： Fifty-five (24%) patients were work-disabled. The cumulative rate (standard error) of work disability was 5% (0.018) at one year， 25%(0.039) at five years and 54%(0.058) at 10 years. In the multivariable analysis， a lower socio-economic status (OR=1.984；95% CI 1.410) and quality oflife (OR=0.953，95% CI 0.914-0.993) were associated with work disability.\n\n【5】Introduction\n\n【6】As a chronic condition， Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) can inflict significant and， sometimes， irreversible morbidity that may impact not only the patients overall clinical status but also in their ability to work.\n\n【7】As SLE affects patients during their productive years of life， work disability may impose an important economic burden  that will be reflected beyond the individual patient， meaning the household and the society level.\n\n【8】A systematic review published in 2009 showed that at least 30% of patients participating in different cohort studies， mainly from Europe and the United States， become work disabled at some point during the disease course . There are， however， scarce data on work disability rates in patients with SLE from South America.\n\n【9】In this study， we pursue to determine the cumulative rate and the variables associated with work disability in the Province of Cordoba， Argentina.\n\n【10】Patients and Methods\n\n【11】This was a cross-sectional，multicenter study of patients with SLE in the Province of Cordoba，Argentina. All participating patients must meet the 1987 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria for the classification of SLE  with no time limits in their disease duration. The Institutional Review Board of each participating center approved the study， and written informed consent was obtained from each subject according to the declaration of Helsinki and local regulations. Data were gathered through a patient interview and medical records review.\n\n【12】Variables\n\n【13】Work disability was defined by patients’ self-report of their inability to work because of their health status through the answer of four questions：\n\n【14】Were you employed with a paid job at diagnosis of Lupus?\n\n【15】Are you now employed with a paid job?\n\n【16】Is the Lupus the reason of your unemployment?\n\n【17】When did you stop working?\n\n【18】We also examinedvariables from the following domains：socioeconomic-demographic， clinical and1 patient self-reported health-related quality of life.\n\n【19】Variables from the socioeconomic-demographic domain were age at diagnosis， gender and socio-economic status ascertained with the Graffar scale .\n\n【20】Clinical variables included the number of the 1987 ACR criteria both， at diagnosis and cumulative over time， disease duration， disease manifestations according to the 1987 ACR criteria  and disease activity assessed as per the SELENA-SLEDAI at the patient enrollment.\n\n【21】The SELENA-SLEDAI  is a cumulative and weighted index used to assess disease activity across 24 different disease descriptors in patients with SLE. The SELENA-SLEDAI is a validated tool for measuring disease activity in patients with SLE. This assessment can be completed to objectively assess the patient's current state of disease. All SLE-related descriptors (16 clinical manifestations and eightlaboratoryparameters) that are present at the time of the visit or within the previous 10 days are scored. Physicians also grade disease activity using a semi-quantitative scale where 0 is no disease activity and 3 represents severe disease activity.\n\n【22】Comorbidities were assessed as per the SLICC Damage Index and the Charlson Index. The Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics (SLICC) Damage Index (SDI)  documents cumulative and irreversible damage irrespective of its cause in 12 different organ systems. To be scored， each manifestation must be present for at least six months， unless otherwise noted in the instructions accompanying this instrument.\n\n【23】The Charlson's clinical comorbidity index  is a weighted index that takes into account the number and the seriousness of comorbid diseases including 19 categories. The components of the weighted index are then computed giving a final count that ranges from zero to 37， zero accounting for no comorbidity and 37 for the sum of all possible comorbidities included in the index. In this study， we used a modified version， deleting the connective tissue disease category； therefore， diminishing the maximum possible value of the sum to 36.\n\n【24】Finally，self-reported quality of life was ascertained with the Lupus PRO . Lupus PRO is a disease-targeted，patient-reported outcome measure that was developed and validated in the United States of America among patients with SLE. Lupus PRO has two constructs：Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) and Non-Health-Related Quality of Life (Non-HRQoL). Individual domains， total HRQoL and total non-HRQoL scores range from 0 to 100， where higher scores indicate better health. In this study， we used a Spanish-translated and validated version . This Spanish Lupus PRO version has demonstrated fair psychometric properties.\n\n【25】All the variables were ascertained at study entry， except for cumulative lupus manifestations and co-morbidities that were gathered retrospectively.\n\n【26】Statistical analyses\n\n【27】The cumulative rate of work disability was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The relationship between socioeconomic-demographic， self-reported quality of life (as per the Lupus PRO) as well as clinical data (clinical manifestations， diagnostic criteria as per the 1987 ACR criteria， disease activity as per the SELENA-SLEDAI， damage as per the SLICC Damage Index， co-morbidities as per the Charlson Index) and work disability was examined with Chi-Square and Mann-Whitney U test. Variables with a p value ≤0.10 in these analyses were then examined by multivariable logistic regression with work disability as the dependent variable. Variables with a p value≤ 0.05 were considered statistically significant. The analyses were performed using the IBM SPSS statistics package， version 20.0.\n\n【28】Results\n\n【29】Two-hundred twenty-five SLE patients were studied. Patients were predominantly females (89%) with a median (Interquartile Range， IQR) age at diagnosis of 26.0 (16.0) years. Median (IQR) disease duration was 96.0 (144.0) months.\n\n【30】Work disability\n\n【31】One hundred twelve (49%) patients were working at disease diagnosis. Thirty-nine (17%) patients reported themselves to become work disabled at the time of the diagnosis while 17 (7%) sometime afterwards， summing a total of 55 (24%) patients with work disability specifically attributed to the disease.\n\n【32】The cumulative rate (standard error) of work disability was 5%(0.018) at one year，25%(0.039) at five years and 54% (0.058) at 10years .\n\n【33】Univariable analyses\n\n【34】Disabled patients were more likely to be of low socio-economic status and to have lower levels of quality of life. Hematological and immunological criteria were more frequent among disabled patients. They also exhibited higher levels of disease activity at study entry and a higher number of cumulative diagnostic criteria. Among the comorbidities， congestive heart failure and peptic ulcer disease were more frequent among disabled patients. These data are depicted in Table 1 and Supplemental Table.\n\n【35】Multivariable analysis\n\n【36】As noted in Table 2， variables predictive of work disability were a low socio-economic status [Odds Ratio (OR)=1.984；95% Confidence Interval (CI) 1. and a lower self-reported quality of life(OR=0.953， 95% CI 0.914-0.993). None of the clinical variables were retained in the model.\n\n【37】Discussion\n\n【38】In this study we found that 25% of the patients with SLE become work disabled specifically attributed to the disease at five years and half of them at 10 vears. We also found that socioeconomic status and a lower self-reported quality of life， rather than disease manifestations and co-morbidities， were associated with work disability.\n\n【39】Work disability was reported to be higher among patients with SLE compared to the general population  reaching a third of the patients at some point during the disease course. Although most of these studies were performed mainly in Europe ， Canada and the United States ， these data are consistent with ours. There is， however， one study that have addressed work disability among the Hispanic population in the United States ； in that study， the rate of work disability among this ethnic group was 20%， similar to our study.\n\n【40】Although ethnicity and age  was consistently found to affect the patients ability to work， there are some other socio-demographic variables that are associated with the extend of work disability： Education  and poverty among them . This is not surprising since these two variables are also associated with the rate of employment in the general population . In our study， socioeconomic status was measured with a composite index that reflects not only the patient’s and family income but also the level of education .\n\n【41】According to the latest study performed in Argentina by the National Institute of Statistics and Census in 2018， 11.8% of the\n\n【42】Table 1： Socioeconomic-demographic， clinical features and quality of life of lupus patients according to their work disability status.\n\n| Feature  | Work disability  |  | p value  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Feature  | Yes n=55  | Non=170  |  |\n| Sex， Female%  | 90.7  | 95.1  |  |\n| Age， years，median (IQR)  | 25.0(19.0)  | 21.0(21.0)  |  |\n| Low socio-economic status，%  | 61.8  | 36.3  | 0.034  |\n| Total disease duration， months， median(IQR)  | 99.0(138.0)  | 84.0(151.0)  | 0.047  |\n| Classification criteria， median (IQR)t  | 6.0(3.0)  | 5.0(1.0)  | 0.026  |\n| Organ-system involvement，%T  |  |  |  |\n| Malar rash  | 64.8  | 61.1  |  |\n| Discoid rash  | 16.7  | 11.4  |  |\n| Photosensitivity  | 79.6  | 77.2  |  |\n| Oral ulcers  | 57.4  | 44.3  |  |\n| Arthritis  | 92.6  | 83.5  |  |\n| Serosal  | 20.4  | 17.7  |  |\n| Renal  | 44.4  | 32.9  |  |\n| Neurological  | 5.6  | 12.7  |  |\n| Hematological  | 51.9  | 30.4  | 0.013  |\n| Immunological  | 90.7  | 77.2  | 0.043  |\n| Disease activity， median (IQR)#  | 4.0(8.0)  | 1.0(4.0)  | <0.026  |\n| Patient's global assessment， median(IQR)  | 4.5(3.4)  | 3.2(2.8)  | 0.03  |\n| Self-reported quality of lifes  | 67.7(14.4)  | 75.1(23.8)  | <0.001  |\n| Health-related quality of life  | 60.5(19.5)  | 81.7(24.5)  | <0.001  |\n| Non health-related quality of life  | 72.3(21.3)  | 76.6(31.3)  | 0.094  |\n\n【44】Rheumatolagy criteria， + As per the SELENA-SLEDAI；As per the Lupus PRO inhabitants among the work force had any permanent disability；55.4% among them being unemployed . The frequency of unemployment， however， does not necessarily represents true work disability， as many other variables may be influencing this rate， the current economic situation of the country， among others.\n\n【45】Self-perceived quality of life is also found in the literature to be related to work disability among patients with different chronic conditions； rheumatoid arthritis ， multiple sclerosis ， inflammatory bowel diseases  and SLE ， among others. In our patients both， the health related and non-health related components of the LupusPRO-9 were associated with work disability， with work disabled patients reporting lower levels of quality of life.\n\n【46】Most of the studies stress that disease duration have an impact on the patient's employment status . Although longer disease duration was associated with work disability in the univariable analyses， this variable was not retained in the multivariable model in our study.\n\n【47】While reports on this topic found certain disease specific manifestations， such as integument， renal and neuropsychiatric manifestations to be associated with work disability， this was not the case in our study . Likewise， none of the classifications criteria nor the number of classification criteria were associated with work disability.\n\n【48】Other variables that influence work disability are disease activity and organ damage .

We acknowledge that this is a limitation in the design of the study that could have influence the impact of this variable on work disability. Also， we were not able to associate the presence of any comorbid condition or any type of damage with work disability； one possible explanation being that this sample of patients had， overall， accrued a low degree oforgan damage in contrast to that reported in other cohorts.\n\n【52】The study is not without limitations. Firstly， we did not compare the rate of work disability with a matching non-SLE population.\n\n【53】Table 3： Factors associated with work disability by multivariable logistic regression analysis.\n\n| Feature  | Odds Ratio  | 95% Confidence Interval  | p valuet  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Low socio-economic status  | 1.984  | 1.410  | 0.013  |\n| Total disease duration  | 0.997  | 0.002  |  |\n| Classification criteria  | 0.083  | 0.302  |  |\n| Hematological criteria  | 2.303  | 0.456  |  |\n| Immunological criteria  | 1.912  | 0.733  |  |\n| Disease activity #  | 1.055  | 0.115  |  |\n| Patient's global assessment  | 0.966  | 0.022  |  |\n| Self-reported quality of lifes  | 0.953  | 0.914-0.993  | 0.022  |\n| Congestive heart failure  | 1.542  | 0.750  |  |\n| Peptic ulcer disease  | 1.19  | 0.450  |  |\n\n【55】Adjusted by age and gender； tOnly p values s 0.05 are noted； +As per the SELENA-SLEDAl； 5As per the Lupus PRO\n\n【56】However， the last population census performed in 2010 in the Province of Cordoba， Argentina， reported that 10% ofthe work force population has some degree or permanent limitation in their ability to work. This number is certainly much higher among patients with SLE. Secondly， we performed a cross sectional study. This type of design may have precluded some variables to be associated with work disability， disease activity， among others. As deceased patients were not examined， it is also possible that both， the rate and the variables of work disability， would have been slightly different if this group of patients were analyzed.\n\n【57】In conclusion， in this sample of patients with SLE we found that almost a quarter of the patients become work disabled at any point of the disease course. None of the clinical variables were associated with this outcome. On the contrary， a lower socio-economic status and self-perceived quality of life influenced the patients' ability to work. Measures should be undertaken at the individual and， specially， the society level in order to lower the work disability rate among this population of patients.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 11:34:50", "endTime": "2024/09/24 11:35:49", "cost": 59.515}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:33", "update_time": "2024-09-23 19:35:49", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 19:34:49"}

Changes in mean gait parameters appear universal in all neurological deficits ， increasing its impact soon after orthopedic surgical interventions. Gait disturbances can lead to impaired mobility， disability， fear of falling or falls， which can result in lower quality of life . The gait abnormalities are mainly caused by spasticity or abnormal muscle tone， decreased motor control and impaired balance. However，because gait abnormalities are primarily caused by spasticity or abnormal muscle tone， often resulting in continued life-course abnormalities if left untreated ， surgery should be considered in order to improve mobility， the walking potential and quality of life of these patients . Throughout an individual's growth， gait abnormalities are compounded by the progressive development of skeletal deformities， soft tissue contractures of musculotendinous units and capsular structures， and dynamic deformities caused by unbalanced abnormal muscle forces .\n\n【10】The gait analysis is a useful tool for surgical planning and evaluation of factors associated with pathological gait， rehabilitation and treatment interventions. Although three-dimensional gait analysis provides detailed information on kinematic and kinetic parameters， these systems are limited to laboratory use. In contrast， Inertial Sensor Gait Analysis Systems (ISGAS) facilitate gait analysis in an unobstructed outdoor environment and outside a conventional walkinglaboratory . Several studies have shown the possibility of using portable and user-friendly solutions， obtaining different types of data acquisition， sharing and information available during the gait， including the kinematics of the individual .\n\n【11】Table 1： Values of spatio-temporal parameters.\n\n| Parameter  | Pre-surgery  | Post-surgery  | Post-physiotherapy  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Gaitspeed (m/s)  | 1.62  | 0.26  | 1.68  |\n| Cadence (steps/min)  | 109  | 55.1  | 108  |\n|  | Left mean value/ Right mean value  | Left mean value/ Right mean value  | Left mean value/ Right mean value  |\n| Gaitcycleduration (s)  | 1.13/1.13  | 2.46/2.50  | 1.13/1.14  |\n| Stridelength (m)  | 1.81/1.83  | 0.65/0.66  | 1.89/1.92  |\n| % Stridelenght (%height)  | 110.4/111.5  | 39.4/40.1  | 115.3/116.8  |\n| Steplenght (% stridelenght)  | 50.7/49.3  | 59.8/40.2  | 51.9/48.1  |\n| Stancephase (% cycle)  | 52.7/62.1  | 46.4/65.8  | 51.6/60.9  |\n| Swing phase (% cycle)  | 47.3/37.9  | 53.6/34.2  | 48.4/39.1  |\n| First double support phase (% cycle)  | 7.6/6.6  | 6.8/6.3  | 6.6/6.3  |\n| Single supportphase (% cycle)  | 38.5/47.7  | 32.9/53.1  | 39.5/48.1  |\n\n【13】Table 2： Parameters of pelvic angles.\n\n| Parameter  | Pre-surgery  | Post-surgery  | Post-physiotherapy  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Tiltsymmetry index  | 44.1  | 38.1  | 27.8  |\n| Obliquitysymmetry index  | 87.1  | 44.1  | 89.2  |\n| Rotationsymmetry index  | 94.8  | 53.7  | 89.2  |\n| Range (o)  | Left mean value/ Right mean value  | Left mean value/ Right mean value  | Left mean value/ Right mean value  |\n| Tilt  | 14.9/16.1  | 6.9/8.2  | 18.2/16.9  |\n| Obliquity  | 3.9/4.7  | 2.9/3.6  | 5.0/4.3  |\n| Rotation  | 16.2/18.2  | 5.2/5.6  | 17.7/15.5  |\n\n【15】Due to the optoelectronic system (3D motion capture) restrict the measurement volume to the laboratory and thus may hinder the patient's natural gait， the gait parameters obtained through Clinical Gait Analysis (CGA) are not fully representative of the usual and daily walking habits (described as performance) of children with CP. Therefore， there is a need to objectively assess gait performance in daily-life conditions in order to complement CGA， thus enhancing therapeutic choices for children with CP based on real-life data .\n\n【16】The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the related changes in the gait pattern of the child after orthopedic surgery， providing quantitative data on gait parameters in the most appropriate set-up (outside the laboratory environment) for gait assessment of children with CP. Wearable inertial sensor was used to fulfill this need.\n\n【17】Methods\n\n【18】This study was carried out in compliance with the regulating guidelines and norms regulating research involving human subjects stipulated by the National Health Board in October 1996， and it received approval from the Human Research Ethics Committee of University under process number 2.424.085. The patient signed a statement of informed consent declaring that he was aware that the procedure to which he would receive was experimental and free of charge.\n\n【19】A male child diagnosed with spastic cerebral palsy aged 12 years(weight： 48 kg， height： 1.64 m)， functionally classified with level GMFCS II， was referred to surgical procedure of bilateral tenotomy of tendon of gastronomies muscles due to increased spasticity in the plantar flexor muscles， causing the child to walk on tiptoes. After the surgical procedure， by medical recommendation， the patient used plaster in the distal lower limbs for one month. The patient performed physiotherapy after the removal of the plaster， by his own physiotherapist， by twelve sessions， three times a week， for four weeks. Each session lasted 60 minutes and the treatment applied to the child was based on conventional techniques， such as stretching， strengthening and proprioceptive training and gait.\n\n【20】The spatio-temporal parameters were obtained with a wireless inertial detection device (G-Sensor， BTS Bioengineering s.p.a， Italy). This new wearable system based on inertial sensors and a dedicated algorithm for precise and accurate assessment of spatiotemporal gait parameters has been described and validated for gait analysis in children with CP.\n\n【21】The portable G sensor is a wireless system of inertial sensors for human motion analysis. The sensors are controlledbya data recording unit (up to 16 elements) by a zigbee type radio communication. Each sensor has 62 mmx36mmx 16 mm dimensions， weighing 60 g，and consists of a three-axis accelerometer (maximum scale ±6g)， a 3-axis gyroscope (full scale ±300°/s)， and a magnetometer of 3 axes (full scale ±6 Gauss). This device is calibrated with acceleration of gravity immediately after manufacture. For this work， only one device was used that collected the data at a sampling frequency of 50 Hz.\n\n【22】Thegait analysisS WaIsSperformedinhospitaal a and 1 clinic environment， pre and postoperative (after 1 month) and after 4weeks of physiotherapy， with the child walking a single time along a 15 m corridor at a self-selected speed and way more natural. In order for the device to acquire gait values it was necessary for the patient to perform 5 full gait cycles of gait on each leg to be recorded. The distinction of the right and left legs was recorded through the oscillations of accelerometers， gyroscopes and magnetometers during the gait analysis. The inertial sensor was attached in the lower lumbar level (covering the L4-L5 inter-vertebral space) with a semi-elastic neoprene belt. The device acquired acceleration values (along three orthogonal axes： anteroposterior，mid-lateral and super-inferior) that were transmitted in real time by bluetooth to a PC and processed with dedicated software (BTS Bioengineering G-Studio) to derive the following parameters： 1. Steplength：distance between two consecutive heel contacts of the same foot (m)；\n\n【23】2. Running speed： average instantaneous speed within the running cycle (m s-1)；\n\n【24】3. Cadence： number of steps per minute (min-1 steps)；\n\n【25】4. Position and duration of the balance phase： expressed as a percentage of the gait cycle， representing the ratio of a gait cycle involving foot support (from the heel to the foot with the same foot) and balance of the lower limb； 5. Duration of the double support： the duration of the support phase in both feet， expressed as a percentage of the walking cycle.\n\n【26】6. Pelvic angulation (inclination， obliquity and rotation).\n\n【27】Results\n\n【28】The results of the experimental tests are summarized in Tables 1and 2\n\n【29】Discussion\n\n【30】In this study， we investigated the related changes in the gait pattern of the child after orthopedic surgery using an inertial sensor. The spatio-temporal parameters found in pre-surgical and post-physiotherapeutic wasn’t well within normal ranges for their age and sex . The small variation between the left and right mean values probably occurred due to the asymmetry of the lower limbs found in the patient during his inspection (left leg 89 cm， right leg 86 cm). However， this may lead to further investigation of each experiment on foot to find out the source of variation. The spatio-temporal parameters found immediately after the surgicalintervention indicate a decrease in gait quality， which is already expected in the postoperative surgical period .\n\n【31】The displacements for tilt， obliquity and pelvic rotation and range of motion were maintained with minimal variations in relation to pelvic obliquity. The greatest variations were found in the pelvic tilt and rotation displacements .\n\n【32】The treatment ofthe child with cerebral palsy should be performed by a multidisciplinary team. The orthopedist and physiotherapist are responsible for preventing and correcting lower limb deformities， contributing to the patient being as independent as possible in his Activities of Daily Living (ADL) and in his locomotion. The results showed that walking ability was not improved after surgery and rehabilitation compared to the preoperative situation. From our point of view， this study may demonstrate the need for the follow-up of physical therapy after the orthopedic surgical procedure for a long term period. Assisting the patient in establishing motor control in the new biomechanical alignment provided by the surgical procedure and promoting better physical fitness are major goals of postoperative physical therapy .\n\n【33】The inertial sensor gait analysis has been shown to be a useful tool for rehabilitation and treatment interventions， detecting some measures of relevant results， such as kinematic parameters and functional alterations， which are insufficient at conventional physical examination. Some limitations of this study should be recognized：since we wanted to replicate a realistic use of the inertial sensor in a outside the laboratory environment setting， and extend the possibility of using portable and user-friendly solutions， obtaining different types of data acquisition， we recruited only one patient before，during and after their surgical intervention and physiotherapeutic.

Wereport the case ofa 66-year-oldwoman withprogressive renal failure inwhichunilateral hydronephrosis and pulmonary infiltrates were the first manifestation of the disease. Tissue biopsy of kidney confirms the diagnosis of ANCA-negative pauci-immune Crescentic Glomerulonephritis(CrGN). Repeated ANCA tests were always negative， and other immune markers were normal. The hydronephrosis and pulmonary infiltrates rapidly improved under immunosuppressive therapy with high-dose corticosteroids and mycophenolate mofetil oral QD. The signs and symptoms of ANCA negative vasculitis are varied， which can lead to misdiagnosis. In clinical practice， patients with progressive renal failure and hydronephrosis but ANCA negative need to be screened for vessel vasculitis also.\n\n【2】Keywords： ANCA-negative vasculitis； ANCA-negative pauci-immune CrGN； Hydronephrosis； Pulmonary infiltrates\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】ANCA-Associated Vasculitis (AAV) is a group of diseases characterized by inflammation and destruction of small-and medium-sized blood vessels and the presence of circulating ANCA . ANCA is pathogenic significance in AAV， which is involved in the occurrence， development and prognosis of the disease . In most patients， pauci-immune CrGN is a manifestation of ANCA- associated vasculitis . However， a subgroup of patients (10% to 30%) with pauci-immune CrGN was short of Anti-Neutrophil Cytoplasmic Antibodies (ANCAs) . Limited information on ANCA-negative pauci-immune CrGN is existed. Patients with ANCA-negative had fewer respiratory symptoms than those with ANCA positive . Chen et al.  found that patients who were ANCA negative had fewer systemic manifestation and less extra renal involvement than patients who were ANCA positive .\n\n【5】Here， we report a case of ANCA-negative pauci-immune CrGN presented with right kidney hydronephrosis and pulmonary infiltrates.\n\n【6】A 66-year-old female with unilateral hydronephrosis， cough， occasionally hemoptysis， renal insufficiency of unclear etiology was admitted at our institution. Patient experience rapid loss of renal function， accompanied by proteinuria， dysmorphic hematuria (40% to 50% at the beginning) and hydronephrosis. Chest CT studies ofour hospital showed large dense shadows in the middle and lower lobes of the right lung. Nodular density shadows are scattered in both lungs accompanying pleural effusion . Urinary ultrasound showed extent of hydronephrosis about 11 mm. Antinuclear Antibody (ANA) was <1：20， and the remainder of serum immune index was essentially normal . The laboratory test was suggestive of an acute-on-chronic renal failure，hemodialysis had to be initiated for worsening renal failure，and a renal biopsy was executed. Renal histopathological picture of our patient  was performed showing cellular crescent involved little or no glomerular immunoglobulin deposition.\n\n【7】Immediately， she received the treatment of Intravenous Methylprednisolone Pulse (IVMP)500mg/d for 3 days， followed by methylprednisolone 40 mg Intravenous injection(IV) QD.

A chest computed tomography showed high density shadows of the lung parenchyma was significantly improved compared with the previous film . Prednisolone cure was initiated with favorable response， but given the severity of the biopsy findings， cyclophosphamide was added (0.4 g for each time). However， gastrointestinal reaction was obvious with cyclophosphamide， so mycophenolate mofetil 0.75 g/d was added to replace cyclophosphamide. Methylprednisolone was changed to oral prednisolone on the morning of discharge Patient adhere to regular follow-up in outpatient department after discharge， a continuous systemic function improvement was evident .\n\n【11】Discussion\n\n【12】The general extra-renall manifestations of ANCA-negative vasculitis presenting fatigue， night sweats， weight loss， fever， myalgia and arthralgia . Pulmonary infiltrates are rare in ANCA-negative crescentic GN as extra-renal involvement . Due to the long time from the onset of the disease to the treatment， long-term pulmonary vasculitis can cause pleural effusion， which is also consistent with this case.\n\n【13】We reviewed the literature and found only two ANCA-negative cases reported by Kamar et al.  had unilateral hydronephrosis with granulomatous inflammation as the sole manifestation of the disease . These patients have acute or chronic kidney disease， most of which are improved by glucocorticoid or immunosuppressive therapy， and some patients need surgery to remove the obstruction. As far as we know， we are reporting on the first patient with unilateral hydronephrosis as the presenting manifestation of ANCA-negative vasculitis.\n\n【14】There is study demonstrates the ANCAs play an important role in small-vessel vasculitis.

This report provided clinical experience and improved the understanding of multiple organ injury in ANCA negative primary small vasculitis. The immunity index of ANCA-negative makes the diagnosis difficult and kidney biopsy was needed of our patient to make a correct diagnosis. Most importantly， it is necessary to integrate clinical examination， pathological findings， serologic markers to avoid misdiagnosis and misjudgment of the condition.\n\n【15】For ANCA negative vasculitis with multiple organ injury， it is necessary to conduct further research to explore different treatment methods and improve the prognosis of patients.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 10:26:36", "endTime": "2024/09/24 10:40:47", "cost": 851.177}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:33", "update_time": "2024-09-23 18:40:47", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 18:26:35"}

Moreover， such co-morbidities have an increasingly poorer outcome when associated with SARS-CoV-2infection.\n\n【2】Case Report： An 85-year-old lady presented with dyspnea a week after being treating for chest infection by general practitioner. Chest X-rays and CTPA showed bilateral airspace opacifications with organizing pattern and SARS-CoV-2 was not detected on three PCR swabs. She was managed with diuretics， antimicrobials， steroids， oxygen and non-invasive ventilation.\n\n【3】Conclusion： An acute exacerbation of ILD， decompensated CCF and CT findings of an organizing pneumonia pattern， raises the possibility of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection being thetrigger for the patient’s presentation. Nasal swabs only detect viral shedding， but not the pending cytokine storm thereby posing diagnostical difficulties.\n\n【4】Keywords： Dyspnea； SARS-CoV-2；Interstitial lung disease； CCF；COVID pneumonia\n\n【5】Abbre viations\n\n【6】COVID-19： Coronavirus disease； RT-PCR： Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction； ILD： Interstitial Lung Disease； CCF： Congestive Cardiac Failure； RA： Rheumatoid Arthritis； ED：Emergency Department； CT： Computed Tomography；O。Oxygen；CXR： Chest X-Ray；ARDS：Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome； SARS-CoV-2： Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus2； CRP： C-Reactive Protein； LDH： Lactate Dehydrogenase； CTPA： CT Pulmonary Angiogram； IV： Intravenous； PJP： Pneumocystis Jiroveci Pneumonia； FiO2： Fractional inspired Oxygen； BAL：Bronchoalveolar Lavage\n\n【7】Introduction\n\n【8】The Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) global pandemic has become a major threat to public health and has completely transformed the clinical approach to patients presenting with dyspnea and other respiratory symptoms.\n\n【9】As clinicians， it is now crucial to include COVID-19 infection and sequela in our differential when presented with all cases of new or increasing shortness of breath. This is also true in cases with negative nasopharyngeal COVID-19 Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) tests in light of the sensitivity widely acknowledged as approximately 70% \n\n【10】The diagnostic uncertainty is increased further when presented with patients with underlying lung or cardiac pathologies such as Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD) or Congestive Cardiac Failure(CCF) which can both present clinically and radiologically similarly to COVID-19 pneumonitis .\n\n【11】With up to 40% of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 having a background of cardiovascular disease this is an exceedingly common diagnostic dilemma encountered by physicians . Furthermore， patients with COVID-19 infection and CCF are particularly vulnerable to hemodynamic decompensation，ensuing additional diagnostic ambiguity.\n\n【12】Moreover， in those with ILD and CCF， it is imperative to recognize that COVID-19 infection has worse outcomes， especially in elderly population .\n\n【13】In this article， we report a case of an 85 years old lady who presented with dyspnea and features suggestive of COVID-19 infection on a background history of Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) associated ILD， asbestosis and congestive cardiac failure to highlight the above-mentioned diagnostic difficulties and the importance of multimodality imaging in patients with dyspnea ofunclear or potentially multifactorial origin.\n\n【14】Case Presentation\n\n【15】An 85 years old lady presented to Emergency Department (ED) with dyspnea on exertion， bipedal edema and facial puffiness for 2weeks. Few weeks prior to her dyspnea， she had some dry cough and was treated for lower respiratory tract infection with oral doxycycline. Her worsening dyspnea prompted her visit to ED. She had a background history of seropositive rheumatoid arthritis associated ILD， hypertension， atrial fibrillation， heart failure with preserved ejection fraction of 50% to 55% and possible asbestosis as per recent Computed Tomography (CT) imaging 4 months ago .\n\n【16】On examination， she was afebrile with a heart rate of 54 beats per minute， respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation of 75% to 80% on room air. She was dyspneic while conversing， had noticeable facial puffiness， digital clubbing and bilateral pedal edema. On auscultation， bilateral widespread coarse crackles were heard. Her oxygenation improved on 8 Littre’s of Oxygen (O2) via high-flow nasal cannula， saturating 96%.\n\n【17】An arterial blood gas on room air revealed hypoxemic respiratory alkalosis. A Chest X-Ray (CXR)  shows bilateral patchy airspace opacification with Kerley B lines raising the possibility of cardiogenic pulmonary edema and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) secondary to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was contemplated in view of prior dry cough. Initial bloods revealed raised C-Reactive Protein (CRP) of 37.19， white blood cell count 10.9， neutrophil count 9.1 and a lymphocyte count of 1.2. Her hyperinflammatory markers were mildly elevated， Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH) -484， D-Dimer 942， IL-6 202.96 and serum Ferritin 138.6.A CT Pulmonary Angiogram(CTPA) was performed  in view of her raised D-dimer revealed multiple differentials.\n\n【18】She was initially treated as a community acquired pneumonia with Intravenous (IV) co-amoxiclav 1.2 g/8h and diuresis for heart failure with IV furosemide 40 mg/12h. Due to risk of prolonged QTC interval， Clarithromycin was withheld. She was isolated pending COVID-19RT-PCRtestsby3and all 3 swabs obtained on consecutive days did not detect SARS-CoV-2. On Day 3， her antimicrobial therapy was escalated to piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5 g/6h with oral prednisolone 60 mg.\n\n【19】On Day 4， IV meropenem 1 g/8h， oral doxycycline 100 mg once daily and co-trimoxazole 80/400 mg per oral/12h to cover for Pneumocystis Jiroveci Pneumonia (PJP) were initiated following microbiology and respiratory specialist advice. increased warranting escalation to High Flow Nasal Oxygen (HFNO) with Fractional inspired O， (FiO，) of 40% to 60% with a flow rate of30 L/min to 40 L/min. However， she was unable to maintain adequate oxygenation with maximal FiO， setting and repeat portable chest X-ray  revealed disease progression. She declined invasive mechanical ventilation and passed away peacefully after 6 days.\n\n【20】Discussion\n\n【21】We report a case where an acute exacerbation of ILD and cardiogenic pulmonary edema could have been triggered by recent SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our patient had 3 negative nasopharyngeal swabs’ PCR for COVID-19 during her hospital stay. However， we reckon that her viral load may have been low to be detected by RT-PCR . In keeping with hospital policy， we went forward with only specimen collection from nasopharynx and did not opt for sputum or Bronchoalveolar Lavage (BAL) swabs.\n\n【22】We were unable to do a serum anti- SARS-CoV-2 antibody test due to restricted resources. There have been multiple studies demonstrating the varying degrees of viral shedding on different specimens， especially in elderly patients  and organizing pneumonia has also been reported to be a sequala post resolution of COVID pneumonia .\n\n【23】The patient’s arthritic symptoms were well controlled with Methotrexate 15 mg weekly and Adalimumab 40 mg subcutaneous injection fortnightly. She never had any baseline pulmonary function tests which could have predicted her outcome for any RA-ILD exacerbation .\n\n【24】There are many questions that remain unanswered with her complex case. The duration of illness seems very acute to rationalize a single diagnosis based on her CT findings. Diuresis seemed to have a good effect， but the chest X-rays revealed persistent bilateral pulmonary opacities. These opacities could have been secondary to an atypical viral， bacterial， fungal infection or drug induced pneumonitis or exacerbation of ILD.\n\n【25】This case report demonstrates a potentiality that SARS-CoV-2could have been a trigger for her acute flare of RA-ILD as she first developed dry cough a week ago and was treated as a chest infection in the community. It remains uncertain in terms of her prognosis， whether treatment with Tocilizumab coupled with mechanical ventilation would have led to a successful outcome. Nevertheless， the importance of ameliorating management of those with ILD especialy during the SARS-CoV-2 period awaits more research.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 10:45:15", "endTime": "2024/09/24 10:45:21", "cost": 6.138}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:33", "update_time": "2024-09-23 18:45:19", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 18:45:13"}

Due to his underlying chronic renal illness， children had a history ofreceiving frequentunremarkable packcelltransfusions for symptomatic anemia. He was admitted to having Hb 3.2 g/dl， a total WBCs 7.3×10/L，and a PLTs count of 180×10/L. The patient’s urea level was 40.3 mmol/L and his creatinine level was 19.3mmol/L， respectively. The blood group is O Rh positive， and antibody screening was found positive during this pre-transfusion work-up . All previously reported antibody testing came out negative. According to the worksheet，the antibody identification panel demonstrated the specificity of Anti-D with positive A/C and DAT (+1). Anti-D . Elution research wasn’t conducted. O RhD+ was compatible with his plasma.\n\n【3】Outcomes and Follow-up\n\n【4】A few days later， findings from a second antibody test were negative. He had a packed cell transfusion since his hemoglobin level at the time of his current arrival was 3.0 g/dL and there was no substantial bleeding. And Cross match compatible unit was given . There is no development of any transfusion reaction with having Anti-D antibodies in the patient’s serum， the pattern of Anti-D antibodies is given in the panel.\n\n【5】Discussion\n\n【6】Anti-D development is often rare in RhD-positive patients. So， if present， it is necessary to take into account anti-LW， partial-D， with allo Anti-D and auto Anti-D antibodies and Anti-D are the same . Since the patient in this instance is RhD+ and the antibody identification test revealed specificity Anti-D with (+1) DAT positive， LW/auto-Anti-D is a possibility. However， anti-LW and auto-Anti-D have not been validated due to repeated antibody screening that produced a negative result rate. This is most likely due to anti-LW or auto-Anti-D fleeting character. Anti-LW is not clinically significant， and auto Anti-D seldom ever causes hemolytic transfusion response. It is crucial to distinguish between the two antibodies as a result . after receiving repeated transfusions of D Rh-positive blood， certain D Rh-positive patients may have transitory auto-Anti-D with (+1) DAT positive， as was the case in the currently being discussed case. Even though auto anti-LW is rare， it may be created when LW antigens are temporarily lost or suppressed without any visible exposure. Pregnancy and several disorders， including Hodgkin's disease， lymphoma， leukemia， and sarcoma， may cause a temporary loss or suppression of LW antigens . However， these diseases can recover their normal or almost normal expression following delivery and therapy. Rh phenotyping for this patient revealed R1r with a high response . However， it is also necessary to identify weak D and incomplete D， particularly when D antigen phenotyping revealed lesser responses. In order to avoid anti-D alloimmunization， it is also necessary to distinguish anti-LW antibodies from anti-D.\n\n【7】Conclusion\n\n【8】Although the Anti-LW antibody has limited clinical significance and no major hemolytic transfusion response or hemolytic illness of the renal cell carcinoma patient has been described， it is nevertheless critical to detect Anti-LW and since Anti-D is a therapeutically relevant antibody， it was differentiated with Anti-D.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 11:01:58", "endTime": "2024/09/24 11:02:10", "cost": 11.155}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:33", "update_time": "2024-09-23 19:02:08", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 19:01:56"}

Wide excision with proper margin is still as the main modality of treatment for Malignant Phyllodes Tumor. Large postoperative defects will be a challenge for surgeons in reconstructing the chest wall after excision. Thoracoabdominal flap is one of the preferred techniques for closing the defect of breast surgery in countries with limited resources such as in Southeast Asia. This technique is relatively easy and has low complication rate.\n\n【2】Case Report： A 42-year-old woman complains of a lump in her right breast that reappeared after breast surgery one year ago. We performed a wide excision of this tumor with a margin of 2 cm and the defect was closed using a Thoracoabdominal flap. Patients have been re-educated about the importance of postoperative radiotherapy.\n\n【3】Keywords： Malignant phyllodes tumor；Thoracoabdominal flap； Recidive\n\n【4】Introduction\n\n【5】Phyllodes tumor is a fibroepithelial neoplasm of the mammary gland. This tumor is quite rare in the community. Muller， in 1838 reported that the prevalence ranged from 0.3% to 0.8% of all breast tumors in women. Meanwhile， Parker， in 2001， stated that the prevalence of this tumor is less than1% of all breast neoplasms. The literature states that 10% to 30% of cases of Phyllodes tumors are found to be malignant .\n\n【6】Malignant Phyllodes Tumor has potential to be recidive and metastatic. Surgical treatment with a wide excision technique is the best option in treating this tumor . This procedure has an impact in the form of a large postoperative defect， so this will pose a challenge for surgeons to reconstruct the chest wall. Thoracoabdominal flap can be one of the surgeon's options in the closure of large postoperative defects of the breast. Rao et al. in 2015 reported that the Thoracoabdominal flap has the same ability as skin grafts in closing large defects， but with capability to shortening operating time， have less bleeding， and good healing results. Patients can also undergo radiotherapy after defect closure is done .\n\n【7】Presented in this case report is our treatment of Recidive Malignant Phyllodes Tumor with extensive postoperative defects. Thoracoabdominal flap was chosen as a method of closing the defect with consideration of its effectiveness and good results.\n\n【8】Case Presentation\n\n【9】A 42-years-old woman came to our clinic with complains of a lump that reappeared in the right chest for 1 month ago. The lump appeared on the surgical scar initially measured 1 cm ×1 cmx1cm and rapidly growing in 1 month to 10 cmx10 cmx8 cm. The lump is painful， ulcerated， and bleeds.\n\n【10】From her history， the patient complained of a right breast lump appearing initially four years ago. The lump was located under the skin with enlarged veins on its surface， slowly growing and there were no ulcers on the surface. The patient underwent a simple right-sided mastectomy 1 year ago at district hospital and the histopathological examination revealed as a Malignant Phyllodes Tumor. The patient was advised to undergo postoperative radiotherapy， but she refused to do it because of financial problem. Four months after surgery， a lump reappeared on the right chest. It was stated that the tumor has been recidive. Regional lymph node examination， thoracic radiology and abdominal ultrasonography did not show any metastatic process .\n\n【11】The patient underwent wide excision with a free margin of 2 cm from the recidive tumor by pectoralis major muscle. including a previous surgical scar to prevent a recurrence. The operation took only 120 min. Surgical removal of the tumor is done by excisioning the pectoralis major muscle at the base of the tumor because of infiltration process of tumor . A rhombus-shaped postoperative defect was laid with an area of 440 cm’ on the right chest. We performed a Thoracoabdominal flap to close this wide defect. The flap consists of two components： the right side， and the left side. The skin on the inferior side of the defect is divided in half and an incision is made downward along the width of the defect， then continues to divide to the right and left. Those two skin flaps were raised superiorly and used to cover the surgical defect. The abdominal flap defect was closed primarily by bringing the right and left sides closer together. We also put two vacuum drains in the operating area to collect fluids and blood after surgery . The patient has been evaluated at the surgical outpatient clinic on the sixth day after operation. There were no complaints of fever， pain， or surgical infection. The flap was assessed as viable and there was no necrotic area on the wound. The results of histopathological examination revealed a Malignant Phyllodes Tumor of the breast and the tumor cells were no longer found in all excision margin. The patient was educated and scheduled to undergo radiotherapy.\n\n【12】Discussion\n\n【13】A Phyllodes Tumor is a tumor that is quite rare in the community. These tumors are classified histopathologically into 3 groups： Benign， borderline， and malignant. Anderson Cancer Center in 2012 reported the incidence of Phyllodes Tumor based on histopathology was58% for benign tumors， 12% for borderline tumors， and 30% for malignant tumors. Benign and borderline Phyllodes tumors never recur once the tumor has been completely excised (with tumor-free incision margin). Meanwhile， Malignant Phyllodes Tumors require more aggressive treatment because of the high risk of recurrence and metastasis. The recurrence rate of this tumor was recorded at 14% to21%. Surgery is the main treatment for Malignant Phyllodes Tumor. Surgeon can decide between wide excision with safety margin1 cm or simple mastectomy in manage this tumor. Those treatments will leave wide surgical defect which become a surgeon's attention after excision.\n\n【14】Broad and radical excision of the breast will leave a large defect so that primary closure usually cannot be performed. Various methods have become the surgeon's choice to reconstruct this wide defect， such as Skin Graft technique， Cutaneous flaps (ex： Thoracoabdominal Flap， Thoracoepigastric Flap， Bilateral Advancement Flap)， and Myocutaneous flaps (ex： Latissimus Dorsi Flap and Transverse Rectus Abdominis Myocutaneous Flap). The Thoracoabdominal flap (TA flap) was originally introduced by Brown in 1975. However， this flap becameless popular after the Myocutaneous flap has been introduced in 1985.\n\n【15】In principle， the TA flap is a rotational-advancement flap of skin and fascia. This flap has two bases of pivot point： The medial base and the lateral base. The medial base blood flow comes from the superior deep epigastric perforating artery， whereas the lateral base blood flow comes from branches of superficial lumbar，subcostal， intercostal and thoracic arteries. The TA flap with a medial base is also known as the Thoracoepigastric Flap (TE Flap). The two flap bases are mirrors of each other， as shown in Figure 4 .\n\n【16】Srinivasa  stated that the TA Flap procedure in post-mastectomy defects in case of locally advanced breast cancer will give satisfactory results. The TA flap is considered easy to perform for surgeons who are not familiar with myocutaneous flap procedures. This flap is not only easier but also faster healing than skin graft technique. Patients can immediately undergo radiotherapy for local control after the TA flap wound has healed. This flap is also useful in developing countries with limited resources because surgeon needs no expensive equipment .\n\n【17】Das and Choudhury  in 2013 reported that 1 in 20 patients(5%) who underwent TA flap surgery in cases of locally advanced breast cancer experienced complications such as wound dehiscence. These complications can be managed directlywith secondary suturing and wound closure. The study explained that the majority of patients were able to go home from the hospital on 3 to 4 postoperative days and underwent radiotherapy with good results. There was no recurrence in 18 months after surgery. It can be concluded that the TA flap procedure is simple，low-cost， and provides good tolerance for radiotherapy .\n\n【18】Deo et al.  in 2003 has conducted research comparing TA flaps to Myocutaneous flaps (LD and TRAM flaps) in breast cancer cases. The TA flap requires a shorter operating time， shorter hospital stay， and significantly minimal risk of blood loss compared to the Myocutaneous flap. The morbidity and risk of local recurrence were not significantly different. The study concluded that the TA flap may be the first choice in patients with extensive post-mastectomy defects . Joo Seok's study stated that the TA flap had a faster recovery time than the TE flap. Baroudi et al. wrote that TE flap was hemodynamically weak and fragile because of tissue tension on vascular. The risk of necrosis at the end of the flap is high. If this morbidity occurs， the patient must be re-debrided and followed by a skin graft to close the defect. However， this was disputed by Burattini et al.  who conducted a study on the safety and viability of the TE flap. In this study， it was found that the risk of dehiscence was only 7%. Persichetti stated that the TA flap is very useful in post-mastectomy breast defects with an area of less than 600 cm .\n\n【19】In our patient， we modified the TA flap by dividing the flap into2 sides at the inferior defect. This flap is a combination of the TA flap on the lateral side and the TE flap on the medial side. We made this modification to provide free skin mobility and to minimize necrotic risk of tissue. Both of the TA Flap base will gain vascular supply maximally with minimal tissue traction.Nowadays， there is no consensus about surgical technique to close post-mastectomy defect. It depends on the experience of the surgeon， patient preferences， facilities， and the size of the defect. However， it is universally recognized that myocutaneous flaps are still better than cutaneous flaps in terms of reducing the risk of necrosis .\n\n【20】Conclusion\n\n【21】Closure of the breast excision defect using a Thoracoabdominal flap may be an option for a surgeon who is not familiar with performing myocutaneous flaps in chest wall reconstruction. This technique has ability to minimize duration of operation， cost， has rapid healing time， and simple to do by a general surgeon.

In our case， we examined a rare case of echinococcosis localized in the gluteal region in a 36-year-old Turkish male and its treatment process. The patient without a chronic disease was admitted to our clinic with right lower quadrant abdominal pain， indigestion， and rapid weight loss complaints. According to the results of hydatid cyst hemagglutination， the patient was diagnosed with Echinococcus. After the surgery and the treatment with omnipaque， the patient's complaints disappeared.\n\n【2】Keywords： Echinococcus； Parasites； Surgery； Medication； Abdominal pain\n\n【3】Background\n\n【4】Echinococcus species are distributed globally and can be observed on every continent except Antarctica. Infections with these parasite species are mostly considered extremely serious since they result in significant morbidity， mortality and substantial economic losses in the livestock industry. Echinococcus granulosus and Echinococcus multilocularis， cause cystic echinococcosis and alveolar echinococcosis respectively， and they are the two most prevalent species of interest from the human and veterinary perspective . When an infection leads to such diseases， the parasite is partially kept under control by the host's immune system： in a case of immunocompetence the normal alveolar echinococcosis or cystic echinococcosis situation， the metacestode grows gradualy which eventually leads to the first visible clinical signs on the host， mostly years after the infection. It has been observed that in a case of impaired immunity， uncontrolled proliferation of the metacestode causes the disease to progress rapidly .\n\n【5】Adult cestodes are regarded apathogenic in hosts， while metacestode， the alveolar form， is high pathogenic for intermediate hosts. The alveolar cyst causes malign tumor-like lesions with infiltrative， proliferative， and destructive character. These lesions primarily originate in the liver， which then metastasize to other organs. If it is not treated in intermediate hosts， it can cause irreversible symptoms and death by targeting other vital organs such as lungs and brain .\n\n【6】Case Presentation\n\n【7】A 36-year-old Turkish male without a chronic disease was admitted to our clinic with a two month history of rightlower quadrant abdominal pain， indigestion， and rapid weight loss. The pain increased in severity over 36 h. Upon arrival， he was febrile and tachycardia.\n\n【8】In the physical examination， no deviations from the normal state were found. In laboratory tests， deviations from the normal state were not observed： BUN： 9 IU/ml ， AST (SGOT)：25 IU/ml ， ALT (SPGT)： 57 IU/ml ； HBsAg， Anti-HVC， and Anti-HIV results were negative. Abdominal cavity ultrasound results were also normal.\n\n【9】The CT scans showed that chest organs were normal. The scan ofthe chest， abdominal and pelvic regions was performed after intravenous contrast administration with a slice thickness of 5 mm. A well-circumscribed encapsulated mass lesion，approximately 100 mm x 55 mm in size， was detected in the adipose tissue in the gluteal region . The result of hydatid cyst hemagglutination was negative： 1/80 (<1/160). 45 ml daily dosage of omnipaque and surgery were prescribed.\n\n【10】Under sedoanalgesia， a 10 cmx10 cm mass in the upper gluteal region located in the left lumbar region was reached bypassing the skin under the skin at the prone position. The mass was cystic inconsistency. By opening the cyst， many millimeter-sized cystic lesions were observed .\n\n【11】The inside of the cyst was washed with 3% NaCl， the bladder wall was excised， and a Hemovac drain was placed. The skin was primarily repaired. On the 5h day after the surgery， the patient was discharged from the hospital without complications and in good condition.\n\n【12】Discussion\n\n【13】Cystic echinococcosis is a complex disease. Even though it is considered to be in principle， preventable and treatable， it continues to be a major public health problem in many countries. There are various unanswered questions and is a clear need for research regarding to the disease and its diagnostics as well as development of prevention and control programs.\n\n【14】Hydatid disease is mostly observed in the right lobe of the liver. Pancreatic localization is described in the literature with a frequency of only 0.2% to 2% . Among such cases， lesions are commonly located in the head of the pancreas (50% to 58%). Location in the body and tail of the pancreas is seen only in the 24% to 34% and 19%of such cases respectively . Most patients (40% to 80% of cases) have a single cysticlesion located in a single organ. Theliver is affected in 70% of the cases， the right lobe more commonly than the left. The lungs are the second most frequently affected organ and are affected in about 20% of the cases. Cysts can localize virtually in any organ and structure， such as abdominal or pleural cavities， kidney， spleen， bone，brain， eye， ovary， testis， and pancreas. Rare immune-mediated reactions such as urticaria， asthma， membranous nephropathy， and anaphylaxis have also been described in the literature . While the Echinococcus cases are more common to develop in the liver or lungs， in our case， it developed in the lumbar region.\n\n【15】In the postsurgical course， medication should be administered for at least 2 years， and in many recurrent or inoperable cases， the complications and intolerance of treatment with Alben dazole should be taken into consideration， which is， fortunately， not a frequent phenomenon.\n\n【16】Based on the exposure， clinical picture， imaging tests， and serological test results， Echinococcosis multilocularis can be diagnosed with the sensitivity of up to 90% to 100% and specificity of up to 95%to 100%. The most effective treatment is surgical treatment combined with Albendazole treatment.\n\n【17】Percutaneous drainage of a pancreatic echinococcal cyst is an alternative to surgical treatment for people with high intrasurgical risk. Surgical treatment can be radical or sparing. Radical procedures are associated with a lower risk of relapse but carry a greater risk of postsurgical complications. Postsurgical recurrence's frequency is around 2% to 5% and is most often caused by incomplete cyst excision， leaving undiagnosed cysts and the lack of protection from Albendazole.\n\n【18】Conclusion\n\n【19】The importance of early diagnosis in Echinococcosis cases in endemic regions such as Turkey is indisputable. It should be noted that with increasing awareness for early detection of echinococcal infestations in high endemic regions， the recovery rate of patients will be increased and complications will be significantly reduced.\n\n【20】Summary\n\n【21】Echinococcosis is considered to be potentially lethal zoonotic diseases that cause serious damage to hosts.

Facial asymmetry is not only bothersome to the patient but also challenging to treat for the surgeon. Identifying the cause， understanding patients concern forms an important aspect in the treatment of facial asymmetry. The present case report highlights how an untreated condylar fracture in the childhood can lead to facial asymmetry. Two stage repair was planned for the patient. First stage-simultaneous maxillomandibular distraction for correction of occlusal cant and lengthening of right ramus of mandible； second stage-genioplasty to correct the deviated chin. This method used for correction of facial asymmetry gives acceptable results.\n\n【2】Keywords： Simultaneous maxilomandibular distraction； Facial asymmetry； Molina technique\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Facial asymmetry means altered balance between the right and left sides of the face. It can be an aesthetic or a functional concern sometimes both. Understanding patients’desires and expectations is critical in treatment planning.\n\n【5】One of the various causative factors of facial asymmetry is secondary to condylar trauma. Condylar fracture in growing children can cause disturbed mandibular growth. In majority of the cases， growth and remodeling maintain the symmetry of the mandible. However， in children older than 10 years， progressive asymmetry can result . Management of pediatric fractures is predominantly conservative owing to their remodeling potential. Proper treatment planning based on fracture type and patient’s growth status is required to avoid future complications .\n\n【6】The current case report describes treatment using simultaneous maxillomandibular distraction for correction of facial asymmetry secondaryto condylar fracture. Simultaneous maxillomandibular distraction is an extension of distraction osteogenesis for mandibular lengthening described by McCarthy. This procedure utilizes the traction principle for the growth of the mandibular ramus. Maxilla follows the mandible during distraction with intermaxillary fixation in situ.\n\n【7】Case Presentation\n\n【8】A 17-year-old male reported to the department of maxillofacial surgery with a chief complaint of facial asymmetry. The patient gives a history of fall from a bicycle when he was 11 years old following which his parents noticed gradually progressing facial asymmetry along with a mild decrease in mouth opening. On extraoral examination， gross facial asymmetry was evident with fullness on the right side and elongation on the left side， chin deviated towards the right. An increase in canthus-left commissure distance was evident on the left side. Profile view examination revealed a convex profile with an obtuse chin-throat angle. Occlusal cant was seen deviating towards the left. The mouth opening was 30 mm. On intraoral examination， there was a class 2 molar relation on the right side and a class 1 molar relation on the left side.\n\n【9】Investigations\n\n【10】Orthopantomogram showed flattening of the right condylar head and shortened ramus on the right side with the tipping of lower anterior roots towards the right. Preoperative Posterior-anterior cephalogram showed Menton deviation towards the left and decreased Condylion-Antegonial point(Co-Ag) length on the right side. Preoperative CT shows a flattened condylar head on the right side with increased width suggestive of remodeling after dislocation of the condylar head post-trauma.\n\n【11】Based on the findings and patient concerns， a treatment plan was devised： simultaneous maxillomandibular distraction followed by sliding genioplasty for residual deformity as second-stage surgery.\n\n【12】Surgical technique\n\n【13】The patient was put under general anesthesia with nasotracheal intubation. Right ramus osteotomy cut was given anterior-posteriorly above the level of lingula through an extra oral post-ramal incision. A stainless steel 25 mm ramus distractor was placed and secured with screws on either side of osteotomy. Through a subcutaneous nick flexible port for distraction was brought extra orally. Following this， an intraoral incision was given in the maxillary vestibule. A procedure for modified Lefort osteotomy cut through third molar extraction sockets bilaterally (Tidemann and Trimble et al. modification) was carried out with down fracture of the maxilla. Non-rigid fixation using 3-26-gauge braided wires was done on the left side.\n\n【14】Distraction protocol\n\n【15】Post-surgery， after a latency period of 5 days the patient was put in Intermaxillary Fixation (IMF) using elastics and an upper lower Erich arch bar placed preoperatively. Distraction was initiated-0.5mm twice daily that is 1 mm/day distraction was done for 16 days. IMF was left in situ for 6 weeks for consolidation.\n\n【16】Second-stage surgery\n\n【17】Following the consolidation period patient was posted for a second-stage surgery. A sliding genioplasty and distractor removal were then performed to correct the residual chin deformity.\n\n【18】Discussion\n\n【19】Management of facial asymmetry is indicated for aesthetic and functional reasons. From a surgical point of view， Choi et al. have classified facial asymmetry according to the vector ofasymmetry into Horizontal asymmetry with chin deviation， vertical asymmetry with occlusal cant and a mixture of both . In the current scenario， the patient presented with both chin deviation and occlusal cant. Hence the aim of surgery was to correct horizontal and vertical components of asymmetry without causing the occlusal discrepancy.\n\n【20】Various osteotomies for the correction of facial asymmetry secondary to trauma are available in the literature. The traditionally used method is orthognathic surgery. In case of vertical asymmetry of the mandible， bilateral sagittal split osteotomy will not provide adequate correction of angle. For this reason， oblique intraoral vertical ramus osteotomy can be performed such that the angle is a part of the distal segment which can be rotated to achieve adequate correction of roll . There exists a possibility of proximal segment flaring in ramus osteotomies after correction of asymmetry . Modified L-shaped osteotomy with or without distraction can be used to increase the height of the ramus . All the osteotomy techniques described require a Lefort-1 osteotomy to obtain a correction of occlusal cant.\n\n【21】Salins et al described Orthomorphic osteotomy for the correction of facial asymmetry. However， when occlusal cant correction is required， orthognathic surgery should be performed first followed by orthomorphic osteotomy for residual deformity . The long-term results following orthomorphic osteotomy are yet to be studied.\n\n【22】Limitations of osteotomies are the need for bone graft and a possible second surgical site， soft tissue envelope restricting the extent of correction. These factors contribute to long-term stability causing relapse. Distraction osteogenesis can be used to overcome these limitations.\n\n【23】Distraction osteogenesis for the treatment of facial asymmetry especially in cases of hemifacial microsomia is largely followed. The advantage of using simultaneous maxillomandibular distraction is it avoids occlusal discrepancy caused by using distraction in a single jaw. Distraction osteogenesis causes simultaneous expansion of soft tissue envelope in contrast to osteotomy.\n\n【24】In the original technique described by Ortiz Monasterio et al. in 1997 ， maxillary Lefort down fracture and mandibular ramus osteotomy were done with inter-maxillary fixation during distraction and consolidation. Plaza et al. modified this technique by avoiding down fracture of the maxilla to prevent bony ankylosis . In the current case report， non-rigid fixation of bone was done on the unaffected side to avoid lengthening of the maxilla on the unaffected side.\n\n【25】After the required distraction of the maxillomandibular complex， minor chin discrepancies can be corrected with a genioplasty . There is a significant change in the occlusal cant， length of the ramus， canthus and commissure distance in the current case report with simultaneous maxillomandibular distraction followed by sliding genioplasty.\n\n【26】Disadvantages of this procedure include requiring longer hospital stays， patient compliance for treatment being of utmost importance， failure of the distractor device， and problems with a vector of distraction.\n\n【27】Conclusion\n\n【28】Weighing the risks and benefits of each technique， the best suitable procedure to meet the patients requirements should be used. With the advent of virtual surgical planning， a proper vector extent of distraction can be planned to obtain predictable outcomes. Simultaneous maxillomandibular distraction is a proven technique for the correction of facial asymmetry with favorable results.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 10:56:48", "endTime": "2024/09/24 10:57:24", "cost": 35.443}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:33", "update_time": "2024-09-23 18:57:22", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 18:56:46"}

We present a case of a47-year-old female with a rapidly growing giant Phyllodes tumor managed successfully with breast conservation and extreme oncoplastic reconstruction as an alternative to simple mastectomy which is typically recommended for lesions this size. The surgical approach utilized a split Wise pattern reduction on the affected side and standard Wise pattern on the contralateral side for symmetry. Ultimately， a complete resection with negative margins was achieved， along with satisfactory cosmesis and preserved nipple sensation for the patient. This case demonstrates the efficacy of using oncoplastic techniques in the management of a benign giant Phyllodes tumor.\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Phyllodes tumors， which derive their name from their leaf-like appearance on cross-sectional histology (from Greek Phyllon [\"leaf\"])， are fibroepithelial tumors that account for less than 1% of all breast cancers. Though Phyllodes tumors are typically benign， they boast a high recurrence rate with affected margins as an independent risk factor . Tumor diameter varies widely in size， with12% of them larger than 10 cm and called “giant Phyllodes”. These tumors present the surgeon with unique challenges， as wide excision with negative margins is critical to minimize the risk of reoccurrence . Oftentimes， mastectomy and immediate reconstruction are the only options， due to tumor size-breast ratio， to ensure negative margins and with favorable aesthetic outcomes.\n\n【4】However， when preservation of native breast tissue is desired， creative surgical strategies must be utilized to achieve curability and cosmesis that is acceptable to the patient. Oncoplastic surgery is a well-established oncologic technique to reshape the remaining breast tissue following wide excisions， to allow a more acceptable cosmetic result. While this technique is routinely used in malignant breast cancers， its application in benign tumors is infrequently reported. We present the case of a 47-year-old female with rapidly enlarging right breast giant Phyllodes tumor managed with wide tumor excision and split Wise reduction with combined contralateral standard reduction for symmetry. To our knowledge， this oncoplastic technique has not previously been reported in the literature for surgical management of a giant Phyllodes tumor.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 47-year-old female with previous diagnosis of right breast fibroadenoma (2.5 cm)， presented with a growing right breast mass that had doubled in size over 6 months.\n\n【7】The examination revealed a multilobulated and mobile right breast mass， occupying entirely the lateral quadrants of the breast， without direct skin involvement or nipple retraction.Diagnostic studies showed a 12 cm right biphasic mass with cyst-like components， in the area of the previously biopsied fibroadenoma， favoring Phyllodes tumor . Due to the patient's strong desire to pursue breast and nipple preservation， a consultation with plastic surgery was recommended， to further discuss reconstructive options.\n\n【8】Patient was ultimately managed with wide local excision of the right breast mass with oncoplastic reconstruction using a split reduction and standard left Wise pattern reduction for symmetry. The procedure started by marking the skin in a modified wise pattern on the right to allow for a wide mass excision， and a traditional wise pattern on the left . A wide local excision of the right breast mass was completed. The mass， that appeared to be multilobulated， with multiple cystic components， was removed en-block to include the skin over the anterosuperior margin. provide an additional 2 cm cephalad to the lateral incision and 7cm caudad to allow for resection of this area. The medial portion of the wise pattern was left intact. The incisions were temporarily tacked closed using surgical staples and the patient was sat upright . The shape and volume ofher breasts appeared generally symmetric despite the split wise pattern on the right and the oncoplastic reconstruction proceeded. Before closing， nipple perfusion was confirmed through piercing with an 18-gauge needle and producing bright red blood. Drains were placed bilaterally. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was discharged home the day of surgery.\n\n【9】Histopathology analysis confirmed the diagnosis of benign Phyllodes tumor， exhibiting elongated epithelial-lined clefts in a largely well-circumscribed mass with focally ill-defined edges， scattered stromal mitoses (<2/10 hpf) and negative margins .\n\n【10】At one week follow up the patient reported preserved nipple sensation bilaterally and a satisfactory cosmetic outcome . Patient remains currently disease-free at 7-month follow up， as confirmed by diagnostic imaging. Patient will be closely monitored with diagnostic imaging every six months for 3 years， to account for the elevated risk of recurrence of the disease.\n\n【11】Discussion\n\n【12】Phyllodes tumors are breast tumors primarily diagnosed in females in the fourth and fifth decades of life， and may be classified as benign， malignant， or borderline . With an incidence of 1 in100，000， they account for less than 1% of breast neoplasms . Clinical presentation of the Phyllodes tumor includes insidious onset and slow progression of a painless， round， and mobile mass. Positive surgical margins remain the primary risk factor for Phyllodes tumor recurrence， thus NCCN guidelines recommends wide excision with at least 1 cm margins. However， despite the association between narrower surgical margins and heightened local recurrence risk， this is not are not an absolute indication for mastectomy when partial mastectomy fails to achieve a margin width≥1 cm . The surgical approach depends largely on the size and location of the mass. Breast cosmesis is inversely proportional to the volume of breast tissue removed， and local deformity results in poorer cosmesis when over10% of the gland is excised . Studies have suggested that there is no statistical significance in recurrence rate between conservation and mastectomy so long as excision margins are adequate .\n\n【13】Oncoplastic breast surgery techniques are defined as tumor-specific breast reconstruction methods that apply aesthetically derived breast reduction techniques to the field of breast cancer surgery， allowing for higher volume excision with no aesthetic compromise. Preoperative planning is crucial to determine which surgical approach is appropriate， as volume of the initial breast tissue， extent， and location of tissue resection and volume of remaining available glandular tissue will equally weigh into applicability of the techniques.\n\n【14】Breast reduction and mastopexy requires additional meticulous planning to determine the appropriate resection pattern according to tumor size and location. The tumor must be included within the resection pattern. Massetti et al. outline the reduction/mastopexy oncoplastic approach as a four-step procedure consisting of parenchymal excision， parenchymal reshaping， repositioning of the Nipple-Areolar Complex (NAC)， and correction of the contralateral breast for symmetry . The most common pattern used for wide excision with reduction mammoplasty is the wise pattern， which consists of the creation of three triangles with the inferior border along the inframammary fold. When the tumors are in areas that do not normally fall within a standard-wise pattern， the pattern can be reconfigured to include the tumor， termed the “split wise”pattern. The lateral and medial triangles are then advanced upward to overlay the tumor， with the medial or lateral vertical limb of the inverted T being“split\"to accommodate the higher position of the triangle .\n\n【15】Extreme oncoplastic techniques (defined as oncoplastic surgery used in women with malignant breast cancers who otherwise require mastectomy) were employed to achieve successful resection and reconstruction. Silverstein was first to utilize the concept of extreme oncoplastic as an alternative to the more radical surgical approaches for breast cancers . Since then， recent studies have demonstrated success in extreme oncoplasty， with a low rate of recurrence， acceptable local-regional control， and higher patient satisfaction . To our knowledge， this is the first case presented in which extreme oncoplastic technique such as split wise reduction，has been employed for the resection and reconstruction of a giant Phyllodes tumor.\n\n【16】In the present report， the technique was the ideal option due to the ability to achieve tumor resection with safe margins， suitable cosmesis and patient desire for breast and nipple preservation. In cases of patients with larger and more ptotic breasts that also require a large volume of tissue replacement， such as the one presented here， techniques such as therapeutic mammoplasties or mastopexy can be employed to remove the area in question and concomitantly reshape the breast . When large volume tissue resection is required， care must be taken to reduce the risk of wound healing complications to prevent delay of possible adjuvant treatment， especially in case of malignant Phyllodes. This case demonstrates that， with close collaboration between the breast surgery and plastic surgery teams， oncoplastic techniques can be utilized to achieve completed resection and excellent cosmetic outcomes in patients with giant Phyllodes tumors requiring complex reconstruction.\n\n【17】Conclusion\n\n【18】The giant Phyllodes breast tumors require unique considerations due to challenges in diagnosis and treatment. A high frequency of recurrence makes wide excision margins necessary， resulting in large volume defects and deformities of the breast. Oncoplastic techniques， such as a split wise pattern， should be considered as an alternative to mastectomy as proven to be oncological safe， and with improved cosmetic outcome affecting positive self-image and quality oflife.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 11:30:55", "endTime": "2024/09/24 11:31:27", "cost": 31.847}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:33", "update_time": "2024-09-23 19:31:25", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 19:30:53"}

On the chest CTalarge volume of fatty tissue and bowel was seen in the anterior mediastinum. There was no history of trauma. An initial diagnosis of Larrey hernia was made and the patient was operated on. Laparotomy revealed a large defect in the tendinous centre of the diaphragm and pericardium with intrapericardial displacement of the omentum and the transverse colon. The viscera were reduced into the abdominal cavity and the defect was closed using a Teflon patch. The patient was questioned again about any trauma in the past and he remembered a car accident20 years earlier. In the early postoperative course transient atrial fibrillation occurred and next pleural and pericardial effusion was diagnosed， requiring thoracentesis and pericardiocentesis Further course was uneventful and the patient was discharged home.

Rarely， the injury is missed in the immediate period and the diagnosis may be delayed for months or years.\n\n【4】Case Presentation\n\n【5】A sixty-nine-year old male presented with epigastric discomfort and pain. Medical history was irrelevant. A physical examination did not show any evident pathology. At the chest X-ray， widening of the lower mediastinum was present， with anterior mediastinal mass seen on the lateral view . Contrast-enhanced CT of the chest and abdomen revealed large volume of fatty tissue and bowel in the anterior mediastinum .\n\n【6】An initial diagnosis of Larrey hernia was made and the patient was scheduled for surgery. Transverse laparotomy ~3 cm below the xiphoid process was made. Transverse colon and almost the whole omentum were displaced upwards and through the large defect in the diaphragm. After reduction of the viscera into the peritoneal cavity  the defect was exposed， involving the central tendon of the diaphragm and pericardium and penetrating to the pericardial sac .\n\n【7】Because of the size ofthe defect primary repair was not attempted and a Teflon patch was used to close it. Several Ethibond No 2 sutures were put around the defect， placed through the diaphragm and pericardium (and anteriorly through the costal arches). The Teflon patch was tailored to the size of the defect and the parachuting'technique was used to place it in the proper position .\n\n【8】The abdomen was closed without any drains. The patient was questioned again aboutanytrauma in the past and he remembered a car accident 20 years ago with no serious injuries diagnosed at that time. On the 2nd day after surgery atrial fibrillation occurred with symptomatic hypotonia， and was successfully treated pharmacologically. On the 7th postoperative day， a chest X-ray was performed the outpatient follow-up no recurrence of the herniation or fluid accumulation was seen.\n\n【9】Discussion due to fever and revealed fluid accumulation in the left pleural cavity. Thoracentesis was performed with 300 mL serous fluid removed. On the next day the follow-up chest X-ray showed widening of the heart silhouette and ultrasound examination confirmed pericardial fluid. Under the ultrasound guidance， cannula was inserted into the pericardial sac and 500 mL of bloody-stained fluid was removed. During the next 2 days fever subsided，50 ml serous fluid was drained from the pericardium and the cannula was removed. On the 13h postoperative day right-sided thoracentesis was performed and 300mL of serous fluid was removed. Further course was uneventful and the patient was discharged home on the 14 day after surgery. During Diaphragmatic rupture associated with pericardial.rupture resulting from the blunt torso trauma， referred to as TIPDH is a rare condition. One hundred well documented cases were described in the literature， the first two as early as in 1910 . Avast majority of these injuries are diagnosed in the acute period after trauma. On rare occasions this type of injury is missed and the diagnosis is not made until symptoms caused by displacement of viscera occur. To our best knowledge， only 45 cases of delayed presentation of TIPDH were described so far， with the delay ranging from 23 to 23 years . We describe a patient who presented with epigastric pain and discomfort20 vears after torso trauma sustained in a motor vehicle accident.\n\n【10】The reason for missing the diagnosis in the acute period may be the small size of the rupture， with no organ displacement. Surgeons focus their activity on clinical priorities， which may include different types of intra-abdominal injuries， requiring immediate repair. Also， its location deep in the upper part of the peritoneal cavity may contribute to missing it， even if laparotomy is performed. Because of constant contractions of the diaphragm a small-size rupture tends to enlarge gradually over a long time. This， together with the pressure gradient between the abdominal cavity and the chest， causes slowly progressing displacement of viscera.\n\n【11】The first review including 17 cases of TIPDH was published by Larrieu et al. ， in 1980 ， followed by 58 cases reviewed in 1986by Van Lohenhout at al. ， and 82 cases described in 2001 by Reina et al. The literature search has shown 18 more cases described in detail since then .Traumatic intrapericardial diaphragmatic hernias constitute a heterogenic group， depending on the type and location of rupture and the route of visceral displacement. They can be categorized in 4 main types .\n\n【12】Reportedly， the most often displaced organs are colon， stomach and omentum ， which was also seen in our patient. What was particularly rare in our patient is the very long time since the initial trauma to the presentation， being as long as 20 years， the second longest interval published to date. Despite a large volume of displaced omentum and colon， the patient’s symptoms were relatively mild， probably due to slowly increasing volume of displaced viscera， over a very long period of time. The patient did not report any complaints that might be associated with the bowel obstruction. It is likely， that the empty space inside the enlarged pericardial sac， resulting from reduction of the bowel and omentum into the abdominal cavity contributed to the accumulation ofexudate in the postoperativecourse. Although this condition is rare， delayed diagnosis of diaphragmatic and pericardial rupture should be taken into consideration in patients with epigastric symptoms， who sustained torso trauma in the past.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 10:43:08", "endTime": "2024/09/24 10:43:17", "cost": 8.503}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:33", "update_time": "2024-09-23 18:43:17", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 18:43:08"}

However， renal biopsy is rarely available in cancer patients who underwent systemic treatment； therefore， the renal consequences caused by inhibition of VEGF are usually underestimated. In here， we report a case of pancreatic cancer patient who developed proteinuria under the treatment of bevacizumab. The efficacy and side effects of bevacizumab were reported， and the mechanism of proteinuria and the principle of treatment were explored.\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】More than 15 years ago， anti-angiogenic therapy firstly entered clinical practice， marking the new edge of anti-cancer treatment. The representative drug is bevacizumab， a VEGF-A targeting monoclonal antibody. Combining with chemotherapies， it has been widely used in oncology therapeutic areas with eight approved indications across different types of solid tumors， including Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)， Metastatic Colorectal Cancer (mCRC)， Glioblastoma(GBM)， Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC)， Ovarian Cancer (OC) and cervical cancer .\n\n【4】However， bevacizumab has also shown efficacy in other types of solid tumors， for example， pancreatic cancer， which has very poor prognosis and causes huge disease burden for patients due to the limited options of treatment. Cutting edge researches consistently show that angiogenesis is the prerequisite for invasive tumor growth and distant metastasis. Therefore， anti-angiogenic drugs are valuable options for treatment of pancreatic cancer .\n\n【5】Several clinical trials have shown the efficacy of bevacizumab in patients with pancreatic cancer. In a phase II clinical study， bevacizumab combined with gemcitabine in the treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer achieved an obiective effective rate of 21% and a disease control rate of 46%， with median PFS 5.7 months and a median OS 8.8 months . Similarly， a phase III trial also demonstrates that combining bevacizumab with gemcitabine significantly improved PFS in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer (HR， 0.73；95% CI， 0.61 to 0.86；P=0.0002).\n\n【6】Due to the unique mechanism of inhibiting VEGF， bevacizumab has many adverse effects， including hypertension， proteinuria， bleeding， thrombosis， gastrointestinal perforation， and congestive heart failure， etc. Among them， proteinuria and hypertension are the second most common adverse effects after bleeding， and are often considered as dose limiting toxicity .\n\n【7】Considering the high incidence of proteinuria and its damage for kidney， it is urgent for clinician to notice this bevacizumab-related proteinuria.\n\n【8】Case Presentation\n\n【9】A 56-year-old female patient had a medical history of hypertension for more than 18 years， with a maximum blood pressure reading of 185/105 mmHg. Blood pressure was controlled with compound-reserpine-triamterene tablets. In March 2019， the patient underwent duodenum-preserving pancreatic head resection due to the discovery of a pancreatic head mass， and postoperative pathology revealed poorly-differentiated adenocarcinoma of the pancreas， invasion of the common bile duct， and no lymph node metastases. After surgery， 6 cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy with capecitabine were performed (March 2019 to September 2019). In March2020， examination showed elevated serum carbohydrate antigen 19-9(CA19-9)>1000 U/mL；PET-CT demonstrated the following： Abnormal increased metabolic signals in the region of the first thoracic vertebra and left acetabulum， which were considered bone metastases； pulmonary nodules with high metabolic activity in both lungs， indicating the possibility of tumor metastases； multiple areas of increased radioactive uptake in the upper abdomen， hypermetabolic activity involving the right mediastinal-hilar lymph nodes， and pleural effusion. Considering the disease progression， erlotinib combined with gemcitabine was initiated then discontinued after7 days (due to systemic pruritic rash). Subsequently， the patient was given 6 cycles of first-line chemotherapy with gemcitabine1.4 mg d1， d8 + carboplatin 300 mg d1 + bevacizumab 600 mg d2(21-day cycles) from March 2020 to August 2020. After 6 cycles of treatment， disease assessment revealed stable disease. Bevacizumab600 mg d1 (21-day cycle) maintenance therapy was performed for 2cycles from August 2020 to November 2020. During treatment， the patient had intermittent epitasis and grade I-II myelosuppression. In April 2020， routine urinalysis showed trace urinary protein and erythrocytes 90/uL. The patient reported intermittent foamy urine that became more noticeable over time since July. In October， the patient developed hypertension with a maximum of 205/105 mmHg following bevacizumab administration， and the blood pressure was poorly controlled with compound-reserpine-triamterene tablets and metoprolol. Repeat urinalyses all revealed proteinuria， specific gravity 1.040， pH 6.5， white blood cells 108.3/uL， red blood cells51.7/uL， poikilocytes 100%， and protein >3.5 g/L. 24-h urine protein quantification was 0.96 g to 2.07 g.\n\n【10】Due to persistent proteinuria， renal biopsy was performed under local anesthesia on December 2020. Pathology under light microscopy showed proliferative glomerulonephritis (moderate) with segmentalglomerulosclerosilsSwhich， wWhen considered together with immunohistochemistry findings， was consistent with IgA nephropathy grade III. Immunofluorescence： IgA+. Electron microscopy： consistent with proliferative glomerulonephritis . Therefore， following the initiation of nifedipine and losartan potassium tablets， the patient's proteinuria gradually turned negative aS St2and the hypertension was stable and well controlled. A repeat bone scan in December 2020 revealed bone metastases， and patients underwent subsequent treatment of second-line chemotherapy with pemetrexed + oxaliplatin. Urinalysis showed no definite proteinuria. The patient died from disease progression in March 2022.\n\n【11】Discussion\n\n【12】Advanced pancreatic cancer has the shortest life expectancy among solid tumors. Whether in developing or developed countries， the overall five-year survival rate is about 6% ranging from 2%to 9% . Gemcitabine acts as the backbone of chemotherapy， with a response rate of only 5% and Overall Survival (OS) of 5.7months when used alone. In addition， Gemcitabine combined with capecitabine， irinotecan or oxaliplatin， have also not showed survival advantages compared with single agent gemcitabine. Therefore， great expectations were placed on the combination of gemcitabine with novel drugs . With the combination therapy of bevacizumab and gemcitabine， our patient experienced a prolonged PFS of the first-line regimen of 8.3 months， and OS was >24 months， which proved to be a remarkable survival benefit that is rarely seen in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer.\n\n【13】Unlike conventional cytotoxic chemotherapies， bevacizumab-related proteinuria and/or hypertension occurred in up to 20% to30% of patients. The VEGF signaling pathway plays an important role in angiogenesis and maintenance of hemodynamic function. VEGF is expressed on glomerular podocytes， while its receptors are present on glomerular endothelial cells； VEGF expression is also important for maintaining glomerular structure and function， and either overexpression or down-regulation of VEGF may cause glomerular disease.\n\n【14】According to previous studies， proteinuria and/or hypertension associated with bevacizumab have the following characteristics：firstly， bevacizumab-induced proteinuria is dose dependent， with higher doses being associated with a higher incidence of proteinuria. Secondly， the severity of proteinuria does not necessarily reflect the severity of renal pathological damage； many patients with Thrombotic Microangiopathy (TMA) as the only sign of nephropathy may also have grade I-II proteinuria . In addition， animal models have suggested that renal damage caused by bevacizumab is related to high dosages， but there is no definite correlation between the severity of renal pathological changes and the severity of proteinuria associated with bevacizumab .\n\n【15】Renal biopsy pathology is the most critical tool for diagnosing bevacizumab-inducedrenal injuryandprognosis. A review of previous studies of VEGF-related renal injury showed that， of 15 cases with renal biopsy pathology findings， 9 revealed TMA， 24-h proteinuria ranged from 0.16 g/24 h to 5.3 g/24 h， and other pathological changes including collapsing-like focal segmental glomerulosclerosis(cFSGS； 2 cases)，proliferativeglomerulonephritis，immune complex glomerulonephritis， IgA nephropathy， and crescenti glomerulonephritis . In the largest-scale pathological analysis from an 8-year observational study of VEGF antibody-induced renal injury， 100 patients with proteinuria and/or hypertension/renal insufficiency underwent renal biopsy at 6.87 ± 7.18 months after treatment initiation. Anti-VEGF medications included VEGF mAb and VEGF tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Seventy-three of these patients presented with renal TMA， and the remaining 27 patients had various glomerulopathies， mainly minimal-change disease (MCN) and/or FSGS. Renal injury caused by bevacizumab was primarily TMA， with only 1 FSGS reported. Both proteinuria and hypertension recovered after bevacizumab discontinuation and initiation of antihypertensive drugs， and there were no patients with severe renal failure requiring dialysis， suggesting that glomerular lesions caused by VEGF-targeted drugs are common with the main pathological changes being TMA and MCN/cFSGS， but with an overall favorable prognosis . Therefore， careful risk assessment at an individual level is helpful to identify renal injury and determine appropriate management. In addition， the severity of proteinuria does not always mirror the severity of renal pathological changes， so it is essential to consider renal biopsy in patients with persistent proteinuria.\n\n【16】In this case report， proteinuria (graded 1 to 2 according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE] version5.0 classification) occurred after more than 6 months of bevacizumab treatment and lasted for more than 1 month. The proteinuria did not resolve immediately after bevacizumab discontinuation. Hypertension， which was emergent during bevacizumab treatment， was refractory. Therefore， renal biopsy was performed. Pathology suggested proliferative glomerulonephritis， IgA nephropathy and benign sclerosis， without severe pathological changes such as TMA. After medical intervention with Angiotensin-Converting-Enzyme Inhibitors (ACEIs) and Angiotensin Receptor Blockers (ARBs)， the patient's hypertension was well controlled and stable， and the proteinuria gradually became negative and did not recur after further chemotherapy. The outcome was consistent with pathological changes of the kidney， avoiding the implementation of overtreatment or delayed anticancer therapy and without affecting the prognosis.\n\n【17】In summary， bevacizumab-related proteinuria is not necessarily a dose-limiting toxicity. It is important to periodically monitor renal function， routine urinalysis， and blood pressure during treatment，and to proactively control blood pressure within the normal range. For patients with persistent proteinuria， renal biopsy upon discontinuing the drug is safe and reliable， which is helpful in determining the prognosis and choosing further therapeutic drugs. For patients who have benign glomerular lesions as the main feature， ACEIs and ARBs can be selected to control hypertension and reduce proteinuria.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 10:19:20", "endTime": "2024/09/24 10:19:44", "cost": 24.343}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:33", "update_time": "2024-09-23 18:19:44", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 18:19:19"}

Pharmacologic therapeutic options include tricyclic antidepressants， serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors， and gabapentin as first line treatments followed by weak (e.g.， tramadol) and strong opioids (e.g.， morphine and oxycodone) . The medication refractory CNP are treated with non-pharmacological treatment including interventional therapies(e.g.， sympathetic nerve/ganglion block， epidural steroid injection， peripheral nerve blockade)， physical therapies (e.g.， Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS))， and psychological therapies (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)) . Minimally invasive interventional procedures such as sympathetic nerve blockade/neurolysis/neuro-ablation， Transforaminal Epidural Steroid Injection (TFESI)， and Pulsed Radiofrequency (PRF) have been introduced recently for the management of chronic neurological pain including CCNP.\n\n【5】We present a rarely performed minimally invasive intervention ofbilateral lumbar sympathetic nerve block at L3 and subsequently ultrasound guided PRF of bilateral sciatic nerves at the popliteal fossa in SCI related CCNP that was refractory to medical and physical therapy.\n\n【6】Case Presentation\n\n【7】In February 2021， a female (60 to 70 years old) was referred to the Pain Clinic (Toronto， Ontario) for severe， persistent bilateralleg pain after a remote anterior spinal cord infarct 8 years ago. After her SCI she had a full recovery of her motor and sensory function but had severe bilateral burning leg pain diffusely from her hip to toes， covering both volar and dorsal aspect of the limbs. She described her pain as 10/10 constant electrical and burning pain throughout that was worse at night. In addition， her skin was extremely sensitive to touch. The pain disrupted her functional ability to ambulate，perform physical exercise， and sleep. She denied any major weakness， sensory loss， muscle movements， cramps or tremors which were concordant with the findings on physical examination. Her current sensory and motor examination did not show any neurological deficits. She did not have any allodynia on examination， but she did have diffuse hyperalgesia to pin prick in bilateral lower extremities. In the past she had trialed a few analgesics， including gabapentin (30000 mg/d to 32000 mg/d) and duloxetine (60 mg/d) without significant pain relief. The diagnosis of CCNP secondary to SCI likely involving small fiber mediated pain was made. At this time bilateral L3 lumbar sympathetic block under fluoroscopic guidance was performed with each side receiving a total of solution injected .\n\n【8】In 3 month follow up the patient reported complete pain relief of0/10 of the proximal limbs from her back to the distal thigh. She still had residual burning pain of the lowerlegs at an intensity of 7/10. She had functional improvements of increased ambulation duration and improved sleep. She was able to reduce her gabapentin dose to 1500mg/d. Physical examination revealed bilateral hyperalgesia to pin prick diffusely over her lower leg and feet. Subsequently， ultrasound guided bilateral sciatic nerve pulsed radiofrequency simulation at the popliteal fossa was performed. Procedure details： 20 g 3.5-inch needle45V 42·C2Hz 10 ms for 2 min bilaterally\n\n【9】In 3 month follow up after this procedure she had significant pain relief of her lower legs， with a severity of 4/10 and reduced sensitivity to touch. At this time， approximately 6 months after her bilateral lumbar sympathetic block， her proximal leg pain continued to be tolerable， with a severity of 3/10.\n\n【10】Discussion\n\n【11】The current findingshighlights that the multimodal and multistage approach， including targeting both the autonomic and somatic pain systems with sympathetic blocks and pulsed radiofrequency in the SCI related CCNP， which has been barely studied， can lead to lasting significant pain reduction.\n\n【12】Generally， there is no robust or sufficient evidence to support the efficacy of non-pharmacological treatment in SCI-related CCNP . Sympathetic nerve or ganglion management (including blockade， neurolysis， or ablation) with medication， neurolytic modalities， and radiofrequency ablation have been used in CNP mainly in PCNP， including pain associated with herpes zoster， post-herpetic neuralgia， diabetic peripheral neuropathy， and complex regional pain syndrome. With SCI-related CCNP， other modalities including spinal cord stimulation， intrathecal medication delivery， deep brain stimulation， and dorsal root entry zone lesion have been commonly investigated in literature. The level of evidence for this has been low and the recommendation for its use is inconclusive . However， this case report supports the individualized approach can make the seldom-or non-studied interventional options in the SCI-associated CCNP，i.e.， sympathetic nerve block， available and useful.\n\n【13】Systematic reviews and meta-analyses have yielded that PRF can lead to decreased pain， improved function， and quality of life， and reduced oral medication use in Post-Herpetic Neuralgia (PHN) ， trigeminal neuralgia ， knee osteoarthritis ， perineal pain after delivery ， while non-effective in radicular pain . Merely， one case report was found presenting the efficacy of PRF on a refractory complex regional pain syndrome due to sciatic neuropathy with a disabling pain in the unilateral lower leg and foot .\n\n【14】The current finding shows that bilateral lumbar sympathetic blockade can reduce SCI-related CCNP within the proximal bilateral lower limbs. Then with the residual bilateral lower leg neuropathic pain， PRF of the sciatic nerve bilaterally was able to reduce the unresolved pain and hyperalgesia.\n\n【15】This case spotlight that individualized， multimodal， minimally invasive interventions for CCNP can be safe and effective in achieving high quality ofpain control， and， ultimately， improve patient function and quality of life and earn patient satisfaction.

With SCI-related CCNP， other modalities including spinal cord stimulation， intrathecal medication delivery， deep brain stimulation， and dorsal root entry zone lesion have been commonly investigated in literature. The level of evidence for this has been low and the recommendation for its use is inconclusive . However， this case report supports the individualized approach can make the seldom-or non-studied interventional options in the SCI-associated CCNP，i.e.， sympathetic nerve block， available and useful.\n\n【13】Systematic reviews and meta-analyses have yielded that PRF can lead to decreased pain， improved function， and quality of life， and reduced oral medication use in Post-Herpetic Neuralgia (PHN) ， trigeminal neuralgia ， knee osteoarthritis ， perineal pain after delivery ， while non-effective in radicular pain . Merely， one case report was found presenting the efficacy of PRF on a refractory complex regional pain syndrome due to sciatic neuropathy with a disabling pain in the unilateral lower leg and foot .\n\n【14】The current finding shows that bilateral lumbar sympathetic blockade can reduce SCI-related CCNP within the proximal bilateral lower limbs. Then with the residual bilateral lower leg neuropathic pain， PRF of the sciatic nerve bilaterally was able to reduce the unresolved pain and hyperalgesia.\n\n【15】This case spotlight that individualized， multimodal， minimally invasive interventions for CCNP can be safe and effective in achieving high quality ofpain control， and， ultimately， improve patient function and quality of life and earn patient satisfaction. Lumbar sympathetic nerve blockade can be a therapeutic option for spinal cord injury related chronic central neuropathic pain and， subsequently， PRF can be effectively applied primarily to the peripheral nerve system as the second stage of the management of SCI associated central neuropathic pain.\n\n【16】StatementofAuthorship\n\n【17】SK： Generated idea， collected data， drafted， edited， and critically appraised the manuscript.\n\n【18】MP： Collecteddata， edited， and1criticalIlyaappraisedthe manuscript.\n\n【19】AS： Generated idea， collected data， drafted， edited， and critically appraised the manuscript.", "index": 8286, "show": true, "start": 8286, "end": 8582, "province": ["文本干净度", "无关文本"], "isEdit": false}], "startTime": "2024/09/24 11:38:43", "endTime": "2024/09/24 11:39:04", "cost": 21.787}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:33", "update_time": "2024-09-23 19:39:04", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 19:38:42"}

SBMA characterized by bulbar and limb muscle weakness， atrophy， and fasciculation. The weakness could be symmetrical or asymmetrical， involving proximal and distal muscles. Also， SBMA is associated with endocrine abnormalities due to resistance to androgen， causing defective spermatogenesis leading to gynecomastia and infertility .\n\n【5】William Kennedy first defined SBMA as a lower motor neuron and bulbar muscle degenerative disease in 1968. The incidence is 1/30，000 male births . It is caused by the repeated expansion of CAG on the X chromosome. The age of presentation depends on the numbers of CAG repeats， with an average of 43 years but varying from 18 to 64 years. Weakness in the limbs， cramping， and tremors， as well as dysarthria， dysphagia， tongue fasciculation， and nasal speech， are the most prevalent complaints. The progression of the disease is slow， an estimated 2% decrease in muscle strength per year， measured by quantitative muscle testing (QMT). Therefore， until late disease， these patients have good function and mobility preservation； however， involvement in the gait and hip muscles can limit the patients to a wheelchair. Usually， they have a normal life span until the involvement of bulbar and respiratory muscles， resulting in aspiration . Symptoms such as twitching of the muscle without loss of muscle strength are present in heterozygous females.\n\n【6】Since many of the clinical characteristics of SBMA are comparable to other neurodegenerative diseases such as Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and late-onset Tay-Sachs disease， a definitive diagnosis is always required . We present a unique case of a 53-year-old Hispanic patient present in our institute.\n\n【7】Case Presentation\n\n【8】A 53-year-old right-handed Hispanic man with a history ofessentialtremor presented with a 6-7month history of progressive weakness and cramps in his lower extremities followed by weakness in the upper extremities. Initially， he noticed difficulty in walking more than a block due to pain and weakness in his legs. Three months later， he developed pain in his lower back， and he realized that he could not lift his arms above his head at work because of weakness. He felt fatigued quickly with physical activity. His older brother reportedly had a similar weakness for some time.\n\n【9】On examination， he was alert and responsive. His neurologic examination showed normal denotation， but dysarthria was noted. He had bilateral facial weakness， more prominent around the orbicularis oculi， and there were fasciculation and atrophy of the tongue. Other cranial nerves were normal. His motor examination showed wasting of the bilateral triceps， biceps， and deltoid muscles. Fasciculation was noted in the right deltoid， biceps and triceps. The tremor was observed in both hands and chin. Motor strength tested on the Motor Research Council(MRC) scale was as follows： Neck Muscles： Flexion 4/5， Extension4+/5， Deltoid， Biceps， and Triceps 4/5 bilaterally.\n\n【10】Table 1： Sensory Nerve conduction study.

Reflexes， Biceps/ Triceps， and Patella were 1+ bilaterally； Ankle Jerks were absent， No Babinski noted. He was able to walk without support. Cerebellar and sensory exam was normal.\n\n【13】Diagnostic workup： MRI of the cervical and lumbar spine was ordered to evaluate possible radiculopathy given the history of back pain with weakness. MRI of the Lumbar Spine reported bilateral L5 pars defects and mild degenerative changes. MRI cervical spine showed mild to moderate degenerative spondylosis of the cervical spine with no significant focal disc herniation. Because of bulbar symptoms and facial weakness， MRI of the brain was also ordered， and it was normal. In addition，comprehensive blood work and Nerve Conduction Study (NCS)/Electromyography (EMG) was performed. Blood work was significant for mildly elevated liver enzymes and CPK. The neuropathy panel was normal， including serum and urine immunoelectrophoresis.\n\n【14】Nerve conduction study ：\n\n【15】normal peak latencies and Conduction Velocities (CVs) in the bilateral median and ulnar nerves； however， normal left radial and bilateral sural sensory responses were noted in the Lower Extremities(LE).\n\n【16】Motor Nerve Conduction Studies in multiple motor nerves in the left upper and lower extremities were normal in distal latencies， amplitudes， and CVs. There was no conduction block noted.\n\n【17】Needle EMG  performed in three limbs， and thoracic paraspinal muscles showed widespread active denervation，including fibrillation， positive waves， and fasciculation potentials. In addition， limb muscles showed large Motor Unit Action Potentials (MUAPs) with increase polyphasicunits， consistent with chronicre-innervation. MUAPs recruitment was also reduced in multiple muscles.\n\n【18】In Summary， the electrodiagnostic findings showed diffuse active and chronic denervation in multiple muscles of three limbs and in the thoracic paraspinal muscles， suggested Motor Neuron Disease(MND)； however， low Sensory Nerve Action Potentials (SNAPs) are not typically seen in MNDs such as Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis(ALS) or its variant， Progressive Muscular Atrophy (PMA).\n\n【19】During his visit for electromyography， additional clinical examination showed gynecomastia and testicular atrophy. Clinical findings in conjunction with electrodiagnostic data were consistent with the diagnosis of Kennedy Disease， which was confirmed with gene testing.\n\n【20】Discussion\n\n【21】SBMA is a rare hereditary motor neuron disorder also associated with endocrine abnormalities. Typically bulbar weakness follows the limb weakness； however，limb weakness is occasionally the presenting complaint. Involvement of the bulbar musculature may be expressed as difficulty in chewing， swallowing， and speaking .\n\n【22】Table 2： Motor Nerve Conduction Study\n\n| Nerre and site  | Lat ms  | Amp mV  | Segment  | Dist mm  | Lat Diff ms  | CV m/s  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Median.L to Abductar pallics brevis (C8-T1).L  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Wrist  | 3.2  | 7.5  | Abductar pallics brevis (C8-T1)-Wrist  | 70  | 3.2  |  |\n| Elbow  |  | 6.8  | Wrist-Elbow  | 230  | 3.8  | 61  |\n| Axilla  | 9.3  | 6.4  | Elbow-Axilla  | 160  | 2.3  | 70  |\n| Ulnar.L to Abductor digiti minimi m.(C8-T1).L  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Wrist  | 3.1  | 9.3  | Abductar digiti minimi m.(C8-T1)-Wrist  | 70  | 3.1  |  |\n| Below elbow  | 6.5  | 8.7  | Wrist-Below elbow  | 220  | 3.4  | 65  |\n| Above elbow  | 8.5  | 8.1  | Below elbow-Above elbow  | 120  | 2  | 60  |\n| Peroneal.L to Extensar digitarum brevis (L4-S1).L  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Ankle  | 3.9  | 7.1  | Extensor digitorum brevis (L4-S1)-Ankle  | 90  | 3.9  |  |\n| Fibula(head)  | 9.6  | 7  | Ankle-Fibula(head)  | 280  | 5.7  | 49  |\n| Popliteal fossa  | 11.6  | 6.7  | Fibula(head)-Popliteal fassa  | 100  | 2  | 50  |\n| Tibial.L to Abductor hallucis (S1-S2)L  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Ankle  | 3.9  | 6.4  | Abductor hallucis (S1-S2)-Ankle  | 90  | 3.9  |  |\n| Popliteal fossa  | 10.8  | 5.1  | Ankle-Popliteal fossa  | 350  | 6.9  | 51  |\n| Median.R to Abductor pallics brevis (C8-T1).R  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Wrist  | 3.1  | 7.8  | Abductor pollics brevis (C8-T1)-Wrist  | 70  | 3.1  |  |\n| Elbow  | 7.4  | 6.5  | Wrist-Elbow  | 230  | 4.3  | 53  |\n| Axilla  | 9.5  | 6.4  | Elbow-Axilla  | 140  | 2.1  | 67  |\n\n【24】Examination of the cranial nerves usually shows evidence of weakness in the facial， palatal， and tongue muscles. Fasciculations are seen easily in affected muscles. Muscle strength shows a classic pattern of proximal-greater-than-distal weakness， beginning in the legs. However， Ferrante and Wilbourn showed the variation of initial weakness ranging from symmetry to asymmetry， from proximal to distal predominant weakness， and from the upper extremity to lower extremity . Reflexes are variable， ranging from normal to depressed and are usually absent at the ankles. Generally， no upper motor neuron dysfunction occurs in these patients . The sensation is often clinically normal to the modalities of vibration perception， position sense， sharp touch， and light touch， despite the demonstration of abnormalities in electrophysiological studies .\n\n【25】Gynecomastia is probably the most common non-neurologic finding on examination， but it is not a criterion for diagnosis. Testicular atrophy and erectile dysfunction may be present and typically occur in advanced cases. The study by Alves et al.  defined the case of SBMA as tremors in extremities with weakness and fasciculation in limbs， atrophy， and fasciculation of the tongue， like our patient.\n\n【26】Diagnostic Work\n\n【27】Depending on the clinical presentation and positive familyhistory， immediate genetic testing for SBMA may be performed to confirm the diagnosis， eliminating the other tests； however， usually， like in our patient， this is not the case. Our patient was initially evaluated and treated for lumbar radiculopathy and essential tremors. His older brother probably also had SBMA； however， the diagnosis was never confirmed. In addition， appropriate initial testing is indicated because of associated conditions in these patients， such as diabetes mellitus， lipid disorders， and other endocrine disorders.\n\n【28】Some following differential diagnoses should be considered while performing diagnostic workup or if gene testing is negative.\n\n【29】2. Early presentation of ALS without the manifestation of upper motor neuron signs yet.\n\n【30】3. Adult-onset of spinal muscular atrophy\n\n【31】4.

Motor neuron syndromes in lung， breast， and other cancers can produce an indirect paraneoplastic degeneration of the motor neiirons.\n\n【34】The patients with SBMA and ALS usually have high Creatine Kinase (CK) level as it was noted in our patient  and high liver enzymes because of the rapid loss of muscle fibers secondary to denervation. Sometimes based on high CK， they are given the wrong diagnosis and treatment， such as inflammatory myopathy.\n\n【35】Electrodiagnostic studies\n\n【36】NCS and needle EMG are a standard part of the evaluation of SBMA and other motor neuron disease. EDX studies are most helpful when clinical findings to support the diagnosis of SBMA are limited.\n\n【37】In general， the electrodiagnostic evaluation includes multiple\n\n【38】Needle EMG Examination motor and sensory conduction studies in two or three limbs and detail needle EMG of multiple muscles in three or four limbs， thoracic paraspinal region， and/or bulbar region.\n\n| Muscle  | InsertionActivity  | Spontaneous Activity  |  |  |  | VolitionalMUAPs  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Muscle  | InsertionActivity  | Fiba  | PSW  | Fase  | Other  | Poly  | Amp  | Dur  | Rate  | Pattern  | Effort  |\n| 1s dorsal interasseaus (C7-T1).R  | Increasec  | 2+  | 2+  | 3+  |  | Few  | Incr  | Incr  | Norma  | Min Red  | Normal  |\n| Biceps brachii (C5-C6).R  | Increased  | 1+  | 2+  | 2+  | CRD  | Few  | Iner  | Iner  | Iner  | Min Red  | Normal  |\n| Triceps brachii (C6-C8).R  | Increased  | 3+  | 3+  | 1+  |  | None  | Incr  | Iner  | Norma  | Mod Rec  | Normal  |\n| Flexor carpi radialis (C6-C7).  | Increased  | 3+  | 2+  | 2+  | CRD  | Few  | SlIncr  | SlIncr  | Normal  | Normal  | Normal  |\n| Tibialis anterior (L4-L5).R  | Increasec  | 2+  | 3+  | 2+  |  | Few  | Sllncr  | SlIncr  | Normal  | Mod Rec  | Normal  |\n| Gastrocnemius (Medial head) (S1-S2J.R  | Increased  | 2+  | 3+  | 1+  |  | Few  | Iner  | Iner  | Normal  | Normal  | Normal  |\n| Vastus Lateralis (L2-L4).R  | Increasec  | 1+  | 2+  | 1+  | CRD  | Few  | Iner  | Iner  | Iner  | Mod Red  | Normal  |\n| Gluteus medius (L4-S1).R  | Increasec  | 2+  | 3+  |  | CRD  | Few  | Incr  | Iner  | Iner  | Min Red  | Normal  |\n| T11 paraspinal.R  | Increased  | 2+  | 2+  |  |  | None  | Normal  | Normal  | Normal  | Normal  | Normal  |\n| 1st dorsal interasseaus (C7-T1).L  | Increasec  | 0  | 2+  | 2+  |  | None  | Incr  | Incr  | Normal  | Normal  | Normal  |\n| Biceps brachii (C5-C6).L  | Increased  | 1+  | 2+  | 0  | CRD  | Few  | Iner  | Incr  | Iner  | Mod Red  | Normal  |\n| Triceps brachii (C6-C8)L  | Increased  | 2+  | 2+  | 2+  | CRD  | Few  | Incr  | Incr  | Iner  | Mod Red  | Normal  |\n\n【40】Motor nerve conduction study is usually normal； however， loss of motor axons in severely atrophic muscles can cause reduction of the CMAP amplitude， and it may be associated with mild slowing of conduction velocity. Motor conduction block should be absent.\n\n【41】Sensory nerve conduction study is typically normal in MNDs； however， in SBMA，SNAPs are usually lower despite normal sensory examination like in our patient. The literature also supports these findings. Ferrante MA， Wilbourn AJ evaluated 19 patients with Kennedy's disease and found that the SNAPs abnormalities were high.\n\n【42】The Needle EMG examination is always abnormal.It shows combined features of acute and chronic denervation and reinnervation. Acute denervation findings include fibrillations and positive sharp waves. Fasciculations should be present in multiple muscles of the limbs and thoracic paraspinal. Chronic denervation and reinnervation findings include large-amplitude； long-duration， MUAPs with neurogenic recruitment， and a reduced interference pattern should be present in multiple muscles oflimbs.\n\n【43】The EMG abnormalities noted in muscles of patients with SBMA or in other MNDs are not pathognomonic for the disease but can be seen in any disease-causing active and ongoing chronic denervation， such as in diffuse motor neuropathy or multilevel cervical and lumbar radiculopathy. However， the diagnosis should be suggested by the observation of similar abnormalities in many muscles of proximal and distal limbs， in the absence of radiologic abnormality of corresponding nerve root compression. In addition， denervation should be present in the thoracic paraspinal and bulbar muscles.\n\n【44】Histopathology examination reveals depletion of motor neuronal cell bodies in the brainstem and spinal cord. Muscle biopsy shows atrophy， splitting， centralized nuclei， and fiber degeneration of muscle fibers. There are also changes in the white brain matter that show frontal lobe hypometabolism .\n\n【45】In Summary， the EDX features of SBMA are consistent with diffuse， slowly progressive chronic degeneration ofanterior horn cells coupled with a sensory neuropathy/neuronopathy (degeneration of dorsal root ganglia).\n\n【46】Conclusion\n\n【47】The clinical findings of our case are compatible with the cases present in the literature and give an understanding that， although SBMA is uncommon， it must also be taken into consideration in the differential diagnosis of motor neuron disease . In order to obtain the right diagnosis， it is important to avoid delaying the diagnosis and ineffective treatment. In addition， it is always necessary to assess the patients clinically with thorough neurological examinations， to perform necessary testing such as appropriate labs， neuroimaging (If indicated) and electrophysiological studies along with genetic testing. As SMBA is often confused with other neurodegenerative diseases， adequate diagnosis can prevent excessive delay in management and allow appropriate genetic counseling.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 11:37:12", "endTime": "2024/09/24 11:38:40", "cost": 88.297}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:33", "update_time": "2024-09-23 19:38:40", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 19:37:11"}

We report a case of Brucellosis-associated RPGN in an elderly male and challenges in management. A 67-year-old male patient presented to clinic with weight loss， progressive renal failure， shivering and fatigue； his urinalysis revealed hematuria. Common etiologies were investigated without determination of any possible source leading to further investigation of rare infectious causes. Patient was diagnosed with Brucellosis following positive Rose-Bengal and Wright agglutination tests and prescribed with doxycycline and rifampicin.\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Rapidly Progressive Glomerulonephritis (RPGN)， also known as crescentic glomerulonephritis， is an emergency condition that may be fatal in weeks to months due to necrotizing extra capillary proliferative crescentic glomerulonephritis， thus， requiring proper diagnosis and treatment . Five main types of RPGN induding anti-glomerular basement membrane disease (type 1)， immune-complex mediated (type 2) and pauci-immune with ANCA positive vasculitis (type 3)， combination oftype 1 and 3 (type 4)，ANCA-negative， pauci-immune renal vasculitis (type 5) have been identified. Despite RPGN being the second most common histopathological diagnosis on kidney biopsies after IgA nephropathy， only single case of Brucella-associated RPGN has been reported so far， despite Brucellosis being one of the most common zoonotic infection . Although orchitis and epididymitis are the most common genitourinary presentations of Brucellosis， other types of kidney involvement including membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis， tubulointerstitial nephritis and IgA nephropathy have been reported in the course of Brucellosis . In this case report， we present a rare case of RPGN caused by Brucellosis in an elderly male patient and its’clinical outcome.\n\n【4】A 67-year-old male patient presented to our clinic with progressive renal failure， fatigue， weight loss and shivering. Past medical history was significant for hypertension controlled with three medications， ischemic heart disease that required cardiac stenting 5 years ago， aortofemoral bypass3 years ago， and tuberculosis osteomyelitis 4 years ago treated with 12 months of combination therapy. Family history was significant for ischemic heart diseases. No history of smoking or alcohol consumption was present. The patient stated that he did not consume unpasteurized milk and dairy products. Physical examination and vitals of the patient were in normal range. Laboratory analysis revealed anemia (Hb： 8.1 g/dl， Hct： 26.4%)， thrombocytopenia (110.000 cells/mm)； elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (119 mm)， C-Reactive Protein (68.6 mg/L)， blood urea nitrogen(25 mg/dl)， serum creatinine (2.58 mg/dl)， PTH (118 pg/mL)， potassium (5.2 mmol/L)， and low estimated GFR (24.83 mL/min/1，73m). Liver and thyroid function tests， uric acid levels，and other electrolytes were all in normal range. Urinalysis demonstrated hematuria (71 RBC/HPF) without proteinuria. ANA，p-ANCA，c-ANCA， and anti-ds DNA were negative. Urinary ultrasonography and renal Doppler ultrasonography revealed no pathologies； both kidneys were in normal size and parenchymal thickness. Multiple blood and urine cultures were negative. Infection serologies for hepatitis B， hepatitis C and HIV were negative. Infectious causes of patient’s symptoms including Brucella and tuberculosis were evaluated.

Patient was diagnosed as acute brucellosis and treated with doxycycline (2 mg/day x 100 mg/day) and rifampicin (2 mg/day x300 mg/day) for 6weeks.\n\n【8】At 3-month follow-up the patient was hospitalized due to worsening of fatigue， weight loss， decline in renal functions (SCr： 4.1mg/dl)， oliguria， and presence of hematuria (124 RBC/HPF). Other abnormal laboratory findings include elevated C-reactive protein (40.2 mg/L)， alkaline phosphatase (190 U/L)， blood urea nitrogen(47 mg/dl)， decreased albumin (2.3 g/dL)， complement C3c (40 mg/dL)，and a normal complement C4 (25 mg/dl). Brucella (capture) was<1/80 negative. Patient underwent hemodialysis due to decline in kidney functions and oliguria. Percutaneous kidney biopsy revealed immune complex focal segmental necrotizing glomerulonephritis.

Patient was admitted to our clinic with dizziness， headache， night sweating， dry mouth， fatigue， and worsening in kidney function (SCr： 7.6 mg/dl) at 1-year follow-up. Some laboratory findings at admission were hemoglobin 5.7 g/dl， albumin 2.7 g/dL， CRP 79.9 mg/L， and BUN 54mg/dl. Kidney biopsy was performed with the preliminary diagnosis ofacute or chronic renal failure and biopsy revealed immune complex focal segmental necrotizing glomerulonephritis. And patient received corticosteroid and rituximab therapy. On that visit Brucella (capture) was >1/5250 positive. Doxycycline (2 mg/day x100 mg/day)+rifampicin (1 mg/dayx 600 mg/day) + ceftriaxone (2 g/dayx2g/day) treatment was planned by the infectious disease department. CLI Bone marrow biopsy was performed regarding the possibility of bone marrow aplasia in response to immunosuppressive treatment， though， no pathological finding had been determined. Patient was discharged after symptomatic relief and improvement in kidney function (SCr：4.8 mg/dl) . Two months later the patient presented to clinic for routine outpatient follow-up. He had no complaints and his kidney functions were improved (SCr： 1.44 mg/dl). Follow-up of the patient for 6 months was uneventful.\n\n【10】Discussion\n\n【11】Brucellosis is the most common zoonotic infection in Turkey， primarily affects bones， lymphatic tissies， and the heart. The genitourinary involvement rate of brucellosis is around 2% to 20%. Orchitisand epididymitis are the most common types of genitourinary involvement . Symptomatic renal involvement is especially rare with limited number of cases including membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis， tubulointerstitial nephritis， IgA nephropathy， and a single case of RPGN . Only one case of RPGN associated with Brucellosis reported by Ardalan and SShoja [which demonstrated RPGN in a young male patient which responded to rifampicin + doxycycline+ corticosteroid treatment dramatically in 2weeks ， while we report RPGN case in an elderly male patient who required multiple hospitalizations during the course of treatment and became difficult to manage. Decline in kidney functions， hematuria， weight loss， requirement for RBC transfusions， multiple hospitalizations， morbidity and mortality are possible in the course of Brucellosis-associated RPGN especially， if it is not considered in the differential diagnosis or inappropriately treated. In addition， Brucellosis-associated kidney involvement may occur at any age despite most reported cases include young patients.\n\n【12】Furthermore， our case is significant by illustrating immune complex depositions which may be the primary mechanism of kidney involvement in the course of Brucellosis. Since immune complex depositions are frequently observed on kidney biopsies performed with the preliminary diagnosis of RPGN， it is important to consider Brucellosis， an infection， as a differential diagnosis of immune complex deposits especially in areas where it is endemic along with predominant causes， including systemic lupus erythematosus and other immune complex ANCA-positive vasculitis.\n\n【13】Even though renal involvement rates are low and most cases report good prognosis and general status， it is important to point out the possibility of RPGN as a manifestation in which emergency cases may develop. Low rates of Brucellosis-associated kidney involvement may also be a consequence of not being considered in the differential diagnosis in most instances. Therefore， we recommend consideration of Brucellosis in the differential diagnosis of glomerulonephritis especially in the areas where Brucellosis is endemic or in patients with specific environmental or other risk factors. Also， it may be beneficial to evaluate Brucella serology in RPGN patients with unknown etiology after elimination ofpredominant causes which could become a cost-effective approach for patient evaluation.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 11:02:19", "endTime": "2024/09/24 11:02:41", "cost": 22.605}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:33", "update_time": "2024-09-23 19:02:41", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 19:02:17"}

Data were collected through standardized Nordic MSDs questionnaire and strain index tool for distal upper extremities on selected garment workers. And also using logistic regression analysis were used to identify the factors that influence the prevalence of work-related Musculoskeletal disorders and associated risk factors for operators.\n\n【3】Result： The result showed that the prevalence rate for Musculoskeletal pain in different body regions was 93.9% in the low back， 93.3% in the upper back， 76% in the neck， 65.4% in the hip/thigh/and buttocks， 52.0% in the shoulder， 45.8% in the elbow， 40.2% in the wrist or hand， 33% in the knee and 36.9% in the ankle or feet. Moreover， the Strain Index (SI) score indicates hazardous (57%) and some risk (29%)， uncertain (21.7%)， and probably safe (3.5%) of upper extremity disorders during performing their tasks.\n\n【4】Conclusion： After analysis of the data using regression models， the result revealed that the suitability of the sitting chair with the sewing workstation， the comfort of the working environment， job satisfaction， medical history in the previous 12 months related to MSDs， working experience， education level， and gender were the most significant factors associated with the prevalence of WRMSDs among various body parts. The finding revealed the workstation of sewing machine operator andemphasized the need for ergonomic interventions to minimize the MSDs among them.\n\n【5】Keywords： MSDs (Work-Related Musculoskeletal Disorders)； Strain index； Nordic MSDs Questionnaire\n\n【6】Introduction\n\n【7】More than half of all countries in the world do not keep official statistics on work-related occupational sickness. Particularly in underdeveloped nations， there is a lack of data reporting in the domain of work-related sickness and musculoskeletal disorders. In nowadays， Garment is a rapidly growing sector in Ethiopia. Reports show that until the end of 2007 E.C. There were 102 garment industries in Ethiopia. Among these garments， 79 of them were found in Addis Ababa and 22 of them were found Oromia special zone near Addis. Approximately more than 10，000 workers (70%female) were working in this sector which became a great source of employment.\n\n【8】In the report of the Ethiopian Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs (MOLSA)， from 279establishments in the year 2014/2015， a total of 5，135 work-related accidents were reported and among which 5，092 (99.16%) were non-fatal. This resulted in a cost of.74 ETB for a medical case and an absence of 12，612 workdays by injured employees. According to MOLSA report of 2014/15 in manufacturing industries 2856 (56.62%)， victims were registered as work-related accidents and diseases， in which garment industry is one of the most hazardous sectors because mostly garment factory works are repetitive and requiring strong visual demands， improper postural requirements and involving long hours sitting or standing in one position.\n\n【9】In the sewing section， the risks for sewing machine operators have been linked to conditions such as poor workstation design， and actions should be taken to eliminate the causes of this disorder and make the workplace safe and healthy for the operators.\n\n【10】So， this paper mainly focuses on assessing the prevalence and associated risk factors of work- related musculoskeletal disorders in different body segments of operators in sewing workstations in the case company.\n\n【11】As we see in Figure 1， in Desta garment， the sewing section workstation is not scientifically looking suitable.\n\n【12】Finally， this paper conducted to fill this gap by ergonomically evaluating the prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders in different bodysegments andassociated risk factors for sewing section operators， and then using logistics regression analysis to identify which factors are significantly associated with musculoskeletal disorders.\n\n【13】Literature Review\n\n【14】Ergonomics is the process of designing or arranging workplaces， products， and systems so that they fit the people who use them， and the profession that applies theoretical principles， data， and methods to design to optimize well-being and overall performance.\n\n【15】Maintain neutral posture and ergonomics workstation\n\n【16】The neutral posture is the ergonomic standard for sitting in a chair and using the computer or standing. A posture is considered“awkward”when it moves away from the neutral posture towards the extremes in the range of motions .\n\n【17】According to Goggins et al. ， reported that Ergonomics lowers JOg costs and reduces MSD risk factors since MSDs account for 30% of all worker's comp claims and reduce indirect costs which can be up to20 times the direct costs and improves productivity by 25% through designing a job to allow for good posture，less exertion， fewer motions， and better heights and reaches， the workstation becomes more efficient and also improves employee engagement， if an employee does not experience fatigue and discomfort during their workday， it can reduce turnover， decrease absenteeism， improve morale and worker efficiency. There are three major categories of the workplace：Sitting， standing， and sit/stand.\n\n【18】Ergonomics in sewing room\n\n【19】The workingposture at sewing machines should allowthe mobility of the limbs， ergonomically favorable arrangement of working and visible zones， and a stable balanced state when performing the work process. The study stated that 70% of sewing machine operators using foot controls report back pain， 35% report persistent low back pain， 25% have suffered a work-related disorder and 49% of workers experience pain in the neck . Setting up your sewing room properly is of paramount importance regarding operators physical well-being， in sewing， cutting， and ironing operators positions that tax your posture leads to fatigue， muscle pain， and chronic or serious conditions ofthe spine .\n\n【20】Musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs)\n\n【21】At present， MSDs are one of the most important problems ergonomists encounter in the workplace all over the world and in many countries' prevention of WMSDs has become a national priority. Sitting posture mainly having pain on the low-back and it is one of the most common Musculoskeletal Disorders (MSDs) in sitting position and has been reported to occur in 50% to 90% of all adults with recurrence rates of up to 90%. Approximately 15% to20% of adults suffer from back pain each year. The operation usually requires the operator to lean forward， with a forward inclined posture of both head and trunk， to focus their attention and have better visual control of the task Generally， some studies conclude that the majority ofthe garment workers had been suffering from some kind of musculoskeletal disorder depending upon the nature of work and their posture .\n\n【22】Factors associated with work-related musculoskeletal disorders\n\n【23】Factors associated with the development of WRMSDs in garment workers are categorized in the form of demographic factors (age， sex， marital status， educational level， year of experience， and monthly salary)， personal factors (height and weight， smoking habit， habit doing exercise， and medical history of MSDs)， job-related factors(payment method， working hour， health and safety training， job satisfaction， comfort of the working environment， and fitness of sitting chair with the working machine).\n\n【24】Logistic regression analysis\n\n【25】In this paper both bivariant and multivariant logistic regression analysis has been used to determine the prevalence of WRMSDs and the significant association between the dependent and independent variables had been examined by both regression analyses Logistic regression will model the chance of an outcome based on individual characteristics. Because chance is a ratio， what will be modeled is the logarithm of the chance given by： where “丁” indicates the probability of an event and “Bo” is the regression coefficients associated with the reference group and the “Xm”explanatory variables and “er” is an error term. At this point， an important concept must be highlighted.\n\n【26】Methodology\n\n【27】Methods\n\n【28】Under the headings of what has been studied， the methods， the instrumentation used， sampling method， data collection， and data analysis， the methods and procedures used in the ergonomic evaluation forr sewingoperators intthe Ethiopianngarmenit manufacturing industry in Desta garment plc are explained. Several approaches were utilized to determine the level of awkward postures by applying logistics regression analysis， identifying which elements are strongly correlated with the severity of MSDs.\n\n【29】According to Biadgo et al. ，the researcher has been taken as the dependent variables， such as the neck， shoulder， upper back， elbows， wrist/hands， lower back， hip/thighs，knees， and ankle/feet， based on the severity of MSDs report from participants using the Standard Nordic MSD questionnaire. And this study has used this dependent variable as a response variable .\n\n【30】Independent variables：\n\n【31】Demographiicctfactorrsstage，8gender. marital status， educational level， year of experience， and monthly salary).\n\n【32】Personal factors (Body mass index， smoking habit， habit doing exercise， medical history of systematic illness， and medical history of MSDs) .\n\n【33】Job-related factors (payment method， working hour， health and safety training， job satisfaction， comfortable of the working environment， and fitness of sitting chairs with the working machine).\n\n【34】Strain index score also takes as independent variables.\n\n【35】Target population： The target population of this paper has been concerned with garment manufacturing industries in the Desta garment plc sewing section， in Ethiopia.\n\n【36】Sample proportion： According to Agresti and Coull ， the proportion of the expected frequency assumption is 50% with the estimated population for Desta garment factory has around 400sewing machine operators.\n\n【37】Then， the population is fine so we use this formula to get sample size，\n\n【38】Z： Standard or z score： 1.96 (confidence level)， P： Population proportion assume 0.5， Q (sample population)： 1-P=1-0.5=0.5=Q， Margin Error (ME)： 0.05(5%)， Population size = 400， then， n=192.36， Therefore， the researcher needed to survey 193operators of Desta Garment PLC.\n\n【39】Finally， the sample size was determined using a single population proportion and by adding a 10% non-response rate total sample size for this study is 213 .\n\n【40】Sampling technique： After the size of the sample population is determined， purposive or judgmental sampling technique has been used based on their working experience， and willingness to participate in the survey to identify the number of respondents or operators to get the relevant data on the selected area .\n\n【41】Hypothesis development： In this study， four tests had been held to determine the relationship between independent and dependent variables， as well as the level of significance of factors linked to the severity of MSD symptoms or pain in different segments of the operators bodies. All of the tests were evaluated using logistic regression analysis.\n\n【42】1. H1： There is a relation between demographic factors and the severity of MSDs in different operators body segments. So， in this case， the study formulates a hypothes is to determine the demographic factors， such as age， gender， marital status， educational level， year of experience， and monthly salary， need to check whether demographic variables have strong significance or not with the severity of MSDs， using logistics regression analysis.\n\n【43】2. H2： There is a relationship between personal factors and the severity of MSDs in different operators body segments. So， in this case， the study formulates a hypothesis to determine the personal factor (Body mass index， smoking habit， habit doing exercise，medical history of systematic illness， and medical history of MSDs) need to check whether personal variables have strong significance or not with the severity of MSDs.\n\n【44】3. H3： There is a relationship between job-related factors and the severity of MSDs in different operators body segments. So， in this case， the study formulates a hypothesis to determine the job-related factor need to check whether job-related variables have strong significance or not with the severity of MSDs.\n\n【45】4 H4： There is a relation between 4 strain index scores and the severity of MSDs in upper body segments. So， in this case， the study formulates a hypothesis to determine these 4 strain index scores need to check whether 4 strain index score has strong significance or not with the severity of upper body of MSDs.\n\n【46】Data collection\n\n【47】This paper employed both primary and secondary data collection methods to obtain relevant data throughout the last 12 months， which focuses on the ergonomic evaluation of workstations for operators in the sewing workstation.\n\n【48】Completing the strain index survey： According to Steven Moore and Garg， in the strain index， six variables need to be collected for each task； each variable is assigned a rating and a multiplier.\n\n【49】A. The intensity of exertion， an estimate of the strength required to perform the task one time. This is a function of the force required， and upper extremity posture Guidelines for assigning a rating criterion are presented table in the appendix part.\n\n【50】B. Duration of exertion is calculated by measuring the duration of all exertions during an observation period， then dividing the measured duration of exertion by the total observation time and multiplying by 100.\n\n【51】According to Drinkaus et al. tasks that attribute were recorded with a stopwatch and considering as time busy. It is defined as the time during which the operator was occupied performing a task and would be unable to perform another task at that time with that hand and it's assumed as the duration of exertions.\n\n【52】The ratio of busy time to cycle time provides insight into how much non-busy time is available to the worker. This non-busy time may be used for rest， or it may provide time to correct if an error or disruption occurs，busy time was used to determine the allocated time for each task. Allocated time for a task is the amount oftime a person is busy plus the amount of rest associated with that task. So allocated time was determined the total observation time in seconds using a stopwatch.\n\n【53】C. Efforts per minute are measured by counting the number of exertions that occur during an observation period， then dividing the number of exertions by the duration of the observation period， measured in minutes. synonymous with the frequency of exertions per minute. The number of exertions is calculated as busy time without rest in required time in minutes number of exertions Efforts per Minute =total observation time (min)\n\n【54】Hand/Wrist posture is an estimation of the position of the hand or wrist relative to the neutral position or it is the anatomical posture of the hand E. Speed of work is an estimation of how fast the worker is working.\n\n【55】F. Duration of task per day is a measure of how much of the workday is allocated to performing that task.\n\n【56】Then total strain index is calculated by multiplying all the above steps，\n\n【57】Strain Index=IExDExEMxHWPxSWxDD.\n\n【58】Based on Steven Moore and Garg， the result that getting from the strain index help to identify the level of job risk，\n\n【59】SI Scores less than or equal to 3 are probably safe.\n\n【60】SI Scores between 3 to 5 are uncertain， Job may place an individual at increased risk for distal upper extremity disorders.\n\n【61】SI Scores between 5 to 7 indicates there is some risk\n\n【62】SI Scores greater than or equal to 7 are probably hazardous.\n\n【63】According to Nagaraj et al.， a separate strain index scoring sheet was used for each operator. And these four scores of strain index considering as independent variables and logistic regression analysis has been conducted because to determine the relationship between musculoskeletal symptoms and these four-strain index score for each upper body parts during the last 12 months.\n\n【64】Questionnaire design： During the last 12 months， Standardized Nordic MSDs questionnaires employed to examine associated factors for the work-related musculoskeletal condition and its severity in various body segments.\n\n【65】The Standard Nordic Musculoskeletal Disorder Questionnaire has two parts：\n\n【66】In the first part， the questionnaires helped to collect information about independent variables or factors such as demographic factors， according to Aghili et al. ，(age)， Gender ，Nagarajet al. (marital status). According to Jahan et al.， (education level)， Abraha et al. (year of experience)， and Girma， (monthly salary). Information associated personal factors such as， according to Nagaraj et al， (Body Mass Index (BMI))， Silva et al.  (smoking habit)， Abraha et al. (habit doing exercise)， and Biadgo et al. ， (medical history of MSDs). And information associated with job-related factors such as， according to Kebede and Tafese ， (payment method)， Biadgo et al.  (working hour)， Tamene et al. (health and safety training). Mekonnen et al.(comfortable of the working environment). According to Nazerian et al， (fitness of sitting chairs with the working machine)， and according to Girma， job satisfaction was assessed using the liker scale to identify the level of satisfaction on the work， the option was 5 Likert scales (very unsatisfied， dissatisfied，neutral， satisfied， and very satisfied)， and the researcher was converted into one independent variable. These had been computed according to Macdonald's workplace job satisfaction scale.\n\n【67】In the second part， a questionnaire helped to collect information about the severity of musculoskeletal disorders in different body segments that are present while performing a task during the last 12months. According to Kuorinka et al. ， the Standardized Nordic musculoskeletal tool was not only developed for clinical diagnosis. According to Biadgo et al. ， based on the severity of MSDs report from participants and taken as the dependent variables in nine body parts (neck， shoulder， upper back， elbows， wrist/hands， lower back， hip/thighs， knees， and ankle/feet). The results from these surveys determine the amount of severity of musculoskeletal disorders in operators body segments， and using the analysis tool， determine the associated risk factors and the prevalence of MSDs that are present in the selected company.\n\n【68】Reliability test： The reliability of the Standard Nordic MSDs questionnaire and strain index was pre-tested among 20 (11%)， selected operators from participants were tested using Cronbach's alpha =0.710 and 0.762， respectively， and the reliability of this instrument was supposed to be tolerable. The 9th item job satisfaction scale questionnaire was also checked for reliability and a Cronbach's Alpha of 0.796 was found. The goodness of the model fitness has been checked using the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness oftest which showed x²=6.394 with df=8 and significant of =0.603. the Hosmer-Lemeshow test should be insignificant as the p-value at 0.05 indicates that the variable entered fits the model.\n\n【69】Data analysis\n\n【70】The demographic features， personal factors， job-related factors， and SI score linked with MSDs of the study population were reported as a number， percentages， and frequency using the IBM SPSS version26 software program for descriptive analysis.\n\n【71】Theconnection betweenmusculoskeletal symptomsand independent variables for each body part was investigated using bivariate and multivariant logistic regression analysis. To assess the effective variables of MSDs disorders， nine distinct regression models were created for nine different body areas. The association between the dependent and independent variables was examined by bivariant logistic regression analysis. The Odds Ratios (ORs)， p-value， and 95%Confidence Intervals (CIs) were calculated from bivariant logistic regression models. The statistically significant level， p<0.05 was considered for all statistical tests.\n\n【72】A Chi-square test was used for testing the hypothesis to identify the significant factors for the MSDs among the operators .

Dianat et al. stated that gender was a significant factor for upper back symptoms with an odds ratio of 10.9 for males in comparison with females.

According to Mekonnen et al.， work experience， working posture， prolonged sitting were significant factors for the prevalence of WRMSDs in the neck and shoulder in Ethiopia. But in this study the education level of sewing operators had been significantly associated， operator who had completed basic education had a chance to develop WRMSDs in shoulders than other operators who learned above primary education within an odds ratio of 1.128， {95% CI， (0.135)}.

Operators who had a medical history during the last 12 months had a 5%-time chance to develop WRMSDs in the upper back than operators who had not a medical history with an odds ratio of 0.059{95% CI， 0.005-0.687}. In the present study， from a job satisfaction survey， operators who didn’t believe that their working activity is not good for their physical healthy (63.1%)， and around 74.8% of them were had not felt their job was not good. So， operators who had not satisfied with their job had 3 times morelikely a chance to develop the work-related musculoskeletal disorder in thelower back with an odds ratio of 3.451{95%CI， 0.221}.\n\n【101】Table 7： Bivariate logistic regression analysis of factors associated with one or both hip， thigh， and buttocks， one or both knees， and one or both Ankle/feet symptoms\n\n| Table 7： Bivariate logistic regression analysis of factors associated with one or both hip， thigh， and buttocks， one or both knees， and one or both Ankle/feet symptoms or pain (n=179).  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | WRMSDs in one or both Hip， thigh， and buttocks (Yes=72，No=107)  |  |  |  | WRMSDs in one or both knees(Yes=59， No=120)  |  |  |  | WRMSDs in one or both Ankle/feet(Yes=66， No=113)  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  | 95% CI for EXP(B)  |  |  |  | 95% CI for EXP(B)  |  |  |  | 95% Cl for EXP(B)  |  |\n| Variables  | Sig.  | Exp(B)  | Lowrer  | Upper  | Sig.  | Exp(B)  | Lower  | Upper  | Sig.  | Exp(B)  | Lowrer  | Upper  |\n| Gender  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Female   | 0.11  | 1.057  | 0.002  | 1.906  | 0.999  | 0  | 0  |  | 0.385  | 4.417  | 0.155  | 126.189  |\n| Marital status?  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Married   | 0.121  | 1.054  | 0.022  | 2.273  | 0.112  | 3.076  | 0.769  | 12.306  | 0.615  | 1.497  | 0.311  | 7.208  |\n| Educational level?  | 0.679  |  |  |  | 0.805  |  |  |  | 0.92  |  |  |  |\n| Basic Edu.  | 0.848  | 0.686  | 0.015  | 3.383  | 0.999  |  |  |  | 0.999  | 0  | 0  |  |\n| Grade 1-8  | 0.64  | 2.396  | 0.067  | 5.269  | 0.42  | 2.3  | 0.303  | 17.441  | 0.518  | 2.425  | 0.166  | 35.482  |\n| Grade 9-12   | 0.629  | 1.636  | 0.222  | 2.08  | 0.915  | 1.098  | 0.199  | 6.07  | 0.829  | 1.303  | 0.117  | 14.518  |\n| Years ot experience  | 0.05  |  |  |  | 0.988  |  |  |  | 0.491  |  |  |  |\n| ≤5  | 0.125  | 1.755  | 0.344  | 2.118  | 0.999  | 0  | 0  |  | 0.415  | 4.733  | 0.113  | 198.459  |\n| 6-10  | 0.046  | 4.772  | 0.076  | 8.48  | 0.999  | 0  | 0  |  | 0.249  | 9.119  | 0.213  | 389.778  |\n| Monthly salary Up to 1500 ETB   | 0.196  | 1.466  | 0.381  | 2.643  | 0.173  | 4.316  | 0.528  | 35.29  | 0.067  | 21.568  | 1.733  | 268.455  |\n| Body Mass Index  | 0.1  |  |  |  | 0.794  |  |  |  | 0.068  |  |  |  |\n| BMI≤18  | 1  |  |  |  | 1  | 0  | 0  |  | 1  | 0  |  |  |\n| BMI18.9  | 0.999  |  |  |  | 1  | 0  | 0  |  | 1  | 0  |  |  |\n| BMI.9   | 1  |  |  |  | 1  | 0  | 0  |  | 1  | 0  | 0  |  |\n| A habit of doing physical exercise No   | 0.683  | 2.663  | 0.092  | 4.771  | 0.652  | 0.684  | 0.131  | 3.563  | 0.024  | 0.036  | 0.002  | 0.646  |\n| Medical history of MSDs yes   | 0.241  | 0.295  | 0.038  | 2.271  | 0.049  | 0.416  | 0.069  | 2.509  | 0.241  | 0.273  | 0.031  | 2.389  |\n| Working hours  | 0.915  | 1.16  | 0.075  | 2.288  | 0.178  | 0.163  | 0.012  | 2.285  | 0.344  | 0.193  | 0.006  | 5.809  |\n| Taking training for health and safety before?

And also， at the same time operators had a chance more than 3 times to develop WRMSDs in the low back with an odds ratio of 3.209 {95% CI， (0.565)}.\n\n【108】Operators who worked in this workstation had a chance more than 2 times to develop WRMSDs in the hip，thigh/ buttock， and wrist orhand，with odds ratios of 2.021，95% CI：CI(0.230)and2.\n\n|  | WRMSDs in the Neck (Yes=136，  |  |  |  | WRMSDs in the Shoulder  |  |  |  | WRMSDs in the Elbow (Yes=82，No=97)  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  | 95% C.l. for EXP (B)  |  |  |  |  | 95% C.l. forEXP (B)  |  |  |  | 95% C.l. forEXP  |\n| Variables  | Sig.  | Exp(B)  | Lower  | Upper  | Sig.  | Exp(B)  | Lowrer  | Upper  | Sig.  | Exp (B)  | Lower  | Upper  |\n| A habit of doing physical exercise No   | 0.048  | 0.12  | 0.015  | 0.982  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Educationallevel?  |  |  |  |  | 0.013  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Basic Edu.  |  |  |  |  | 0.012  | 1.128  | 0.054  | 2.135  |  |  |  |  |\n| Strain Index Score  | 0.015  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | 0.083  |  |  |  |\n| Strain Index Score   |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Strain Index Score   |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Strain Index Score   | 0.016  | 0.319  | 0.926  | 7.28  |  |  |  |  | 0.024  | 3.024  | 0.452  | 6.127  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  | (B)  | 95% C.l. for EXP  |  |  |  | 95% C.l.forEXP (B)  |  |  |  | 95% C.l. forEXP  |\n|  | Sig.  | Exp (B)  | Lower  | Upper  | Sig.  | Exp(B)  | Lower  | Upper  | Sig.  | Exp(B)  | Lowrer  | Upper  |\n| Gender Female   |  |  |  |  | 0.021  | 2.021  | 0.043  | 4.986  |  |  |  |  |\n| 6- 10 years of work   |  |  |  |  | 0.021  | 3.05  | 0.711  | 6.021  |  |  |  |  |\n| medical history of MSDs yes   |  |  |  |  | 0.024  | 0.059  | 0.005  | 0.687  |  |  |  |  |\n| Job satisfaction  |  |  |  |  | 0.036  |  |  |  | 0.016  |  |  |  |\n| Very dissatisfied   |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | 0.023  | 3.451  | 0.021  | 6.221  |\n| Comfortable of the working environment Bad   |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | 0.027  | 2.102  | 0.121  | 4.053  |\n| Fitness of sitting chair with working m/c Uncomfortable  | 0.0153  | 2.21  | 0.621  | 4.901  | 0.012  | 6.729  | 0.654  | 12.032  | 0.022  | 3.209  | 0.927  | 6.565  |\n| Strain Index Score  | 0.015  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Strain Index Score   | 0.065  | 1.032  | 0.021  | 2.092  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Strain Index Score   | 0.021  | 2.012  | 0.321  | 4.762  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Strain Index Score   | 0.018  | 2.321  | 0.311  | 4.092  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | WRMSDs in one or both Hip，thigh， and buttocks (Yes=72， No=107  |  |  |  | WRMSDs in one or both knees(Yes=59，No=120)  |  |  |  | WRMSDs in one or both Ankle/feet (Yes=66， No=113)  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  | 95% C.l. for EXP(B)  |  |  |  |  | 95%C.l.for  |  |  |  | 95%C.l. tor EXP  |\n|  | Sig.  | Exp(B)  | Lower  | Upper  | Sig.  | Exp(B)  | Lower  | Upper  | Sig.  | Exp(B)  | LOwer  | Upper  |\n| A habit of doing  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| physical exercise No   |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | 0.025  | 0.037  | 0.002  | 0.662  |\n| Comfortable of the working environment Bad   |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | 0.005  | 0.022  | 0.012  | 0.312  |\n| Fitness of sitting chair with working m/c Uncomfortable   | 0.027  | 2.021  | 0.289  | 4.23  | 0.021  | 3.271  | 0.541  | 19.545  |  |  |  |  |\n\n【110】NB： All variables included in this table are statistically significant Exp(B)=Odd ratio Numbers in bracket indicate data codding when analyzing through the SPSS tool 95% CI： CI(0.230) respectively.\n\n【111】In the current study， the prevalence of work-related MSDs in the knee， ankle， and foot was significantly associated with operators who had a medical history in the previous 12 months were 3 times more likely to develop MSD in the knees， ankles， and foot than operators who did not have a medical history， with an odds ratio of 3.271， 95%CI： (0.509). Workers who did not engage in regular physical activity were more than 2.5 times as likely to develop MSDs in one or both ankles/feet than those who did. (OR=0.037， 95% CI： (0.002-0.312.Operators who worked in an unpleasant environment were 2.2times more likely than those who worked in a pleasant environment to develop MSDs in one or both ankles/feet (OR=0.022， 95% CI：(0.002-0.312). According to Nagaraj et al.， the high frequency of repetitive action， less porosity， and uncomfortable hand posture of sitting sewing operations put roughly 60% of operators at risk of upper extremity musculoskeletal disorders. In this study， the researchers observed the level of risk in the upper extremity body and found that roughly 57% of those were in danger and 29% were at risk， indicating that more ergonomics development is needed to lower the risk of upper extremity disorders.\n\n【112】Strain index scores were found to be strongly linked with the prevalence of WRMSDs in the elbow and hand by Nagaraj et al. operators with a strain index score of 3-5 (uncertain)， 5-7 (some risk)， and greater than 7 (hazardous) were more likely to develop WRMSDs in their wrist or hand in this study， with odds of 1.032 95%CI： (0.092)， 2.012 95% CI： (0.762)， and 2.321 95% CI：(0.092)， respectively. And operators who score SI greater than7 had more than 31% times more likely to develop WRMSDs in the neck than others {OR=0.319， 95% CI： (0.280)}. Age， monthly salary， smoking habits， payment methods， and working hours were not found to be significant factors for the prevalence of MSDs in any of the operator's body parts in this study.\n\n【113】Generally， in this paper， the highest occurrence rate for the prevalence of WRMSDs was found in the lower back (93.9%)，upper back (93.3%)， neck (76%)， and hip/thigh/ buttocks (65.4%). The compatibility of a sitting chair with a sewing workstation， as well as the comfort of the working environment， were found to be the most significant factors in the prevalence of work-related MSDs.\n\n【114】Conclusion\n\n【115】From nine body regions lower back (93.9%)， upper back(93.3%)， neck (76%)， and hip/thigh/buttocks (65.4%) were the body parts that developed work-related MSDs among workers in the sewing section. The occurrence of musculoskeletal disorders was significantly associated with the suitability of the sitting chair within the sewing workstation， comfortable of the working environment， job satisfaction， gender， strain index score， a habit of doing physical exercise， working experience， and medical history in the last 12. With a high odds ratio， the suitability of a sitting chair within a sewing workstation and a comfortable working environment was a significantly linked factor to the occurrence of work-related MSDs in the low back (93.9%) and upper back (93.3%) body parts.\n\n【116】Recommendation\n\n【117】Based on the findings in this paper， there is recommendations to the garment sector and the Bureau of Labor and Social Affairs(BOLSA) to focus on maintaining workers safety and health for increasing productivity ofthe product and becoming profitable.\n\n【118】To improve productivityandprofitability in the garment in dustry， top management should examine ergonomics issues and correctly apply ergonomics in workstations on a large scale. In the garment sector， the workstation should be assessed regularly to improve the working environment， and firm owners should also provide a good working environment for their employees by addressing their demands， such as honoring a top performer.\n\n【119】Future Work\n\n【120】It may be necessary to improve ergonomically the sewing section workstation， as well as to broaden the scope of the study in order to obtain a result that reflects the rest of the Ethiopian garment companies.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 11:27:08", "endTime": "2024/09/24 11:28:06", "cost": 58.435}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:33", "update_time": "2024-09-23 19:28:06", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 19:27:06"}

A case ofa man with hypertension and diabetes mellitus presented with sudden onset of retrosternal chest pain. His ECG showed ST-segment elevation and T-wave inversion in leads II， III， and a VF. Coronary angiography was immediately performed. Before right coronary artery intervention， prophylactic temporary pacemaker was inserted. After percutaneous coronary intervention was performed for the RCA， Two-dimensional transthoracic echocardiography showed the pacemaker lead passed though patent foramen ovale and placed on the mid inferior septum on left ventricle.\n\n【2】Keywords： Malposition； Temporary pacemaker； Patent foramen ovale； Percutaneous coronary interyention\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Malposition of pacemaker lead in the left ventricle is an unusual complication . The temporary cardiac pacing may be required in acute myocardial infarction setting for the occurrence of Atrioventricular (AV) block during Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) . Inferior ST- Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI) is especially prone for AV blocks， because of the blood supplyto AV nodal tissues and the inferoposterior surface of the heart share the same arterial territory. Apical septum in Right Ventricle (RV) is usual site for pacing lead and we could check it by using by not only the characteristics of pacing rhythm but also fluoroscopic cardiac anatomy. However， there have been some case reports about inadvertent malposition of transvenous pacing lead in the Left Ventricle (LV). In this report， we describe the malpositioning oftemporary pacemaker lead on LV septum， passed through Patent Foramen Ovale (PFO)， detected by Trans Thoracic Echocardiography (TTE) after PCI.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 72-year-old man with hypertension and diabetes mellitus had a sudden onset of substernal chest pain a day before he came to the hospital. Findings on the physical examination were unremarkable. Vital signs were as follows： Temperature 36.6'C， heart rate 76 beats/min， respiratory rate 22 breaths/min， blood pressure 95/52 mmHg，and oxygen saturation 100% on room air.\n\n【7】His electrocardiogram showed ST-segment elevation and T wave inversion in leads II， III， and a VF. Laboratory evaluation revealed following： CK-MB 113.1 ng/ml； TnI above 22.78； BNP 558.4pg/ml. A heparin bolus (60 U/kg)， aspirin 300 mg and ticagrelor 180 mg were given.\n\n【8】Emergent coronary angiography was immediately performed and revealed a total occlusion in the middle of Right Coronary Artery (RCA). Before RCA intervention， prophylactic temporary pacemaker was inserted via right femoral vein approach for the AV block during the procedure. With the help of fluoroscopic images， a pacing lead was advanced until it reached RA. Then， the pacing catheter was passed smoothly to the ventricle without any resistance . PCI was performed for the RCA， and coronary blood flow recovered completely. The patient was moved to Coronary Care Unit (CCU) immediately after PCI. The patient was stable without any symptom. Surface ECG at CCU showed normal sinus rhythm with coincidental two pacing beats with Right Bundle-Branch Block (RBBB) morphology and early pre cordial transition \n\n【9】TTE performed 4-h later after PCI. The TTE showed preserved systolic function (Ejection\n\n【10】Fraction (EF)=50%) with infero-posterior a kinesis on LV.\n\n【11】On the two-chamber/four-chamber views， the pacemaker lead tip was located apical inferior septum in LV ， passed though the incidental PFO . Finally， the temporary pacemaker lead was removed with the guidance ofTTE.\n\n【12】Discussion\n\n【13】In this case， the physician didn’t have focus on the adequate pacemakerlead site during the coronary intervention procedure. This is a unique case that temporary pacemaker lead tip was crossed the PFO and located on LV septum and suggests that pacing rhythm on surface ECG and fluoroscopic images are important to guide proper lead position. Fortunately， we found RBBB morphology on surface ECG by chance at CCU. Follow-up TTE confirmed the pacemaker lead was on the LV septum and we removed it.\n\n【14】We usually establish temporary pacemaker before emergency PCI for acute inferior MI against AV block . Mostly， the pacing wire\n\n【15】PFO： Patent Foramen Ovale tip locates on RV apex only with catheter manipulation without any difficulty. In rare cases， the lead cross interatrial septum and locate on LV pass through mitral valve. If there is a PFO or ASD， the lead tip can pass through the interatrial septum easily like this case. As a standpoint of interventional cardiologists， coronary intervention is the most important procedure. So they didn’t care about the adequate site of adequate pacemaker lead site during the procedure.\n\n【16】There have been several complications related with the pacemaker leads unintentionally located on LV， such as， thromboembolic stroke and ventricular perforation . Lead malposition in the LV should be prevented by a high index of suspicion at implant. Consequently， we should at least check the pacemaker catheter tip site during procedure with the guidance of pacing ECG and fluoroscopic images. First of all， if the pacing site is RV， the pacing QRS on V is usually LBBB pattern， the other way， if it is LV， the pacing QRS on V is usualy RBBB pattern. Fluoroscopic image is another important method to check the lead site. If we could find the ostium of RCA， we could differentiate inter ventricular septum with LAO view.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 10:36:05", "endTime": "2024/09/24 10:37:27", "cost": 82.192}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:33", "update_time": "2024-09-23 18:37:25", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 18:36:02"}

SARS-CoV-2 infection also involves the eyes， and acute conjunctivitis represents the most frequently ocular manifestation currently reported. We present a clinical case of ocular venous thrombosis observed in a healthy woman affected with a pauci-symptomatic COVID-19，occurred during the pandemic peak. SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed by nasopharyngeal swab and IgG serology. Further to acute conjunctivitis， venous thrombotic events should be included in the list of possible ocular COVID-19 manifestations. COVID-19 -induced viral tissue damage， hypercoagulability， and dysregulation of immune response likely represent the main pathogenetic determinants ofthis severe ocular complication.\n\n【2】Keywords： COVID-19； Atypical manifestations； Eyes； Conjunctivitis； Ocular venous thrombosis\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】SARS-CoV-2 is a zoonotic RNA beta coronavirus rapidly spreading all over the World and causing a pandemic . The clinical impact of SARS-CoV-2-induced disease (COVID-19) has different severity in adults， from benign manifestations to fatalities (pneumonia， ARDS， multi-organ failure) . Transmission is described as occurring via close contacts through the small droplets emitted during talking， coughing or sneezing， and reaching mucosal surfaces， namely the mouth， the nose， the eyes .\n\n【5】In humans， further to typical symptoms (mainly respiratory)， COVID-19 can also develop atypical signs which sometimes may not be immediately ascribed to the SARS-CoV-2 infection，such as： Cardiovascular； embolic； neurological； gastrointestinal； hemorrhagic； olfactory and gustatory； psychiatric； cutaneous signs).\n\n【6】SARS-CoV-2 also involve the eyes， even if only a few reports are available on ocular disorders occurring during COVID-19 . Ocular manifestations include conjunctivitis， anterior uveitis， retinitis， and optic neuritis ， being acute conjunctivitis， the most frequently ocular manifestation currently reported in the literature .\n\n【7】It is the case of a 73-year-old Italian， non-smoking healthy woman， blood group A positive， without any significant comorbidity， and Leiden factor V negative who claimed red eyes， tearing， foreign-body sensation，photophobia， and increased secretions on 20h March， 2020， followed three days later by mild fever (37.6C) associated to diarrhea (both lasting only one day)， and Dysgeusia for 5 days. Ocular symptoms were assumed as due to acute conjunctivitis and self-managed at home (because in the pandemic peak) for five days with anti-inflammatory+anti-histamine eye wash medications (three times daily)， but without any significant improvement. These symptoms persisted unchanged after the pharmacological treatment. As a blurred vision complicated the original clinical picture， she underwent an ophthalmologic consultation on March 254： The conjunctivitis was confirmed by slit lamp examination， while the fundus oculi examination and the Spectral Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) were absolutely normal . Moreover， visus was 20/20， and the eye pressure 14 mmHg.\n\n【8】To note that her husband was admitted for severe COVID-19 pneumonia and ARDS on 284h March， and the lady was then quarantined (home isolation)， even if in the absence of any other extra-ocular manifestation.\n\n【9】Due to the peak of the national pandemic context (actually， pauci-symptomatic conditions were absolutely disregarded)，her RT-PCR nasopharyngeal swab was delayed to twenty days later： When tested， the swab proved positive， although by a low viral load. Plasma SARS-Cov-19 serology (namely， IgG plasma level) proved highly increased (8.35 Index (S/C； nv<1.4； by Chemiluminescence Method， Abbott C8200) in the same days， thus confirming the occurrence of the previous SARS-CoV-2 infection and the substantial expression of specific acquired immunity. Two swabs repeated four weeks later were negative.\n\n【10】On May 284 (namely， as soon as possible after the strict lock-down)， a sub-acute Branch Retinal Venous Occlusion (BRVO) was found in the right eye by ophthalmoscopy， associated with a macular edema. The visus showed the loss of 3 lines of visual acuity in the right eye. A second OCT examination and the retinal fluoroangiography confirmed the diagnosis .\n\n【11】The macular edema was treated with intravitreal administration of desamethasone 700 mcg (Ozurdex 700)， and the OCT picture proved improved significantly after eight weeks .\n\n【12】Discussion\n\n【13】At present， conjunctivitis is the ocular disorder most frequently related to COVID-19 . Its occurrence has been reported in more than 30% of cases with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection， and in about 20% of subjects with positive RT-PCR from pharyngeal and conjunctival swabs .\n\n【14】Conjunctivitis was also frequently described as the initial symptom of SARS-CoV-2 infection， and its role in tears-mediated transmission ofviral particles was progressively emphasized，together with its value for early diagnosis of COVID-19 new cases .\n\n【15】It was also stated that the eye is rarely involved in human SARS-CoV-2 infection and that the eyes do not represent a preferred portal for the infection spreading . Nevertheless， the ocular tropism of respiratory viruses had been already demonstrated in the past ， while the SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been found in conjunctival scrape samples of COVID-19 patients with conjunctivitis ，although in the absence of any typical symptom of COVID-19.\n\n【16】Furthermore， ACE2 receptors， namely the specific binding sites for SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins， that are widely expressed on the cell membranes of different human tissues， have also been found in the retina， and in choroid and conjunctival epithelia ，thus leading to the suggestion that various ocular manifestations might occur during COVID-19.\n\n【17】On the other hand， the aggressive inflammatory response due to the cytokine storm is a significant component of the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection， together with the intravasal coagulation disorders . Actually， it was also suggested that the huge formation of IgM and IgG immunocomplexes in these circumstances may contribute substantially to these events ， and in defining COVID-19 patients as “at higher risk\" to develop venous thrombo-embolic complications.\n\n【18】The present clinical report concerning the occurrence of an ocular thrombotic event during a pauci-symptomatic COVID-19 is particularly challenging for different reasons：1) COVID-19-induced ocular venous thrombosis was never previously described in the literature； 2) the role of conjunctivitis has been once more confirmed as one of the earliest symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection ；3) it has been emphasized for the first time the putative role of conjunctivitis in signaling the possible occurrence of severer and more dangerous ocular events (thrombotic inthecase)，otherwise misdiagnosed. On the other hand， it should be emphasized that COVID-19 manifestations have been described even in asymptomatic infected individuals with low viral loads in their nasopharyngeal swabs .\n\n【19】In conclusion， although not frequent as acute conjunctivitis， venousthrombotic events should alsobe included in the list of possible ocular COVID-19 manifestations， likely being viral tissue damage， hypercoagulability， and dysregulation of immune response the main pathogenetic determinants of this severe vascular complication of SARS-CoV-2 infection.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 10:48:55", "endTime": "2024/09/24 10:49:13", "cost": 18.222}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:33", "update_time": "2024-09-23 18:49:11", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 18:48:52"}

Upon examination， the Best-Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) of the right eye was Hand Movement (HM)， and the left eye demonstrated nothing in Light (NIL). The pupils of both eyes were round， the pupil diameter of the right eye was 2.5 mm， and that of the left was approximately 5 mm. More， the right eye showed a Relative Afferent Pupillary Defect (RAPD)， andboth the direct and indirectlight reflexes of theleft eye had disappeared.

The clinical manifestations include chronic headache， cranial nerves affected and epilepsy， a few patients present with bilateral or unilateral moderate visual loss. We describe the case of a patient who presented with bilateral visual loss without any other positive manifestations； the patient was initially diagnosed with Ischemic Optic Neuropathy (ION)， but further investigation revealed IHCP. This study was approved by the ethics committee of the 6h Medical Centre of Chinese People's Liberation Army General Hospital. Written informed consent forms were obtained from the patient， who gave his consent that findings and images about himself were published in the journal and associated publications.\n\n【7】Case Presentation\n\n【8】A 59-year-old male patient presented with 4-day acute painless bilateral visual loss， with no headache， eye distension， photophobia， lacrimation or diplopia. The patient denied a history of diabetes，hypertension， coronary heart disease or auto-immune disease.Ofnote，ION diagnosis was considered， and medical cared such as intramuscular injection of mouse nerve growth factor prior to hospitalization did not result in visual recovery.\n\n【9】Upon examination， the Best-Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) of the right eye was Hand Movement (HM)， and the left eye demonstrated nothing in Light (NIL). The pupils of both eyes were round， the pupil diameter of the right eye was 2.5 mm， and that of the left was approximately 5\n\n【10】0-15). The results ofother tests including routine blood， urine routine， blood biochemistry， antinuclear antibody， tuberculosis antibody， Mycobacterium tuberculosis y interferon， syphilis serum antibody， tumor screening， TORCH antibody， IgG4 antibody， and thyroid function tests were normal. The results of routine cerebrospinal fluid， biochemistry， cytology， anti-ganglioside anti-antibody， and aquaporin 4 tests were also normal. The results of other tests such as fluid tests to check for bacteria， fungi， Cryptococcus neoformans， and acid-fast bacilli were also negative. Imaging tests， including Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) with gadolinium contrast， were performed mm. More， the right eye showed a Relative Afferent Pupillary Defect(RAPD)， and both the direct and indirect light reflexes of the left eye had disappeared. Other examinations including color fundus photography， Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) of the macula and optic disc photography of the right and left eye were normal.\n\n【11】Laboratory tests showed that the C-Reactive Protein (CRP) level was 13.1 mg/L (reference value： 0 mg/L to 8 mg/L)， and the Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) was 72 mm/h (reference value： with dural enhancement along the floor of the anterior fossa， with the brain sickle visible， especially on the left side . The cavernous sinus and temporal lobe demonstrated possible aggressive signals. No significant high signal was found with diffusion-weighted imaging. In summary， the patient was considered to have IHCP based on laboratory tests and MRI data. Treatment with methylprednisolone via intravenous drip infusion was continued， followed by oral prednisone acetate tablets. Twenty days after treatment， the BCVA of the patient was significantly restored： that of the right eye reached 20/20， and that of the left eye was 20/200. Unfortunately， visual field examination showed that the visual light sensitivity in the right eye had decreased， and examination of the left eye showed that one-quarter of the visual field was completely loss.\n\n【12】Discussion\n\n【13】Hypertrophic Pachymeningitis (HP) is a chronic inflammatory disorder characterized by fibrous thickening of the cerebral and/or spinal dural mater . HP is divided into two types， Idiopathic Hypertrophic Pachymeningitis (IHP)， for which no identifiable cause has been found， and secondary HP， for which is described inassociation with trauma，infections， tumors， autoimmune/inflaarmrmatory disease and cerebrospinal fluidhypotension syndrome. IHCP， the most common features of which is chronic intermittent headache， can also be expressed as cephalagra， local or whole brain blunt pain， or progressive palsy of cranial nerves . One important reason for the ease of cranial nerve damage is the narrowing of the skull gap， in which cranial nerves pass， due to endocranial hypertrophy. The thickened dura might invade the oculomotor nerve， abductor nerve， trochlear nerve， trigeminal nerve and optic nerve . Severe injury of the optic nerve alone occurs infrequently but can lead to painless rapid bilateral visual loss. Mathew et al. ， reported one case of IHCP presenting as acute left-sided painless visual loss， and the patient complained of persistent left-sided headache and numbness on her forehead in the past few years . Our case presented as rapid bilateral visual loss as the initial clinical manifestation， and we have not found similar previous reports.\n\n【14】The diagnosis of IHCP can be made by combining clinical manifestations， imaging examination results， laboratory test results and pathological features. The pathological characteristics are diffuse fibrous hypertrophy of the dura matter and lymphocytes as well as plasma cell infiltration； IHCP can also present with glass-like changes or caseous necrosis. It can also be observed on MRI and defined pathologically on biopsy； the performance of MRI was correlated with the clinical state in 80% of cases . Imaging demonstrated the diffuse thickening of the dura； the lesions appeared hypointense or isointense on T1-weighted sequences and hypointenseT2-weighted sequences. The scope of the dura was larger on gadopentetate-enhanced T1-weighted sequences than on plain scans. According to others， laboratory findings might show increased ESR or CRP levels in patients， and some patients show positive results for auto antibodies including ANA，P-ANCA，ACA and RF .\n\n【15】Conclusion\n\n【16】Intracranial neuropathy might occur rapidly and progressively， and the damage is difficult to recover. A clear and correct diagnosis as soon as possible and timely treatment are critical. In this report， the visual acuity of the left eye in the patient was lost three days earlier than that of the right eye； as a result of treatment， the BCVA in the left eye was lower than that in the right eye. The results of this study demonstrate that we should pay attention to intracranial changes as soon as possible in patients with a sharp decline in visual acuity but with no obviously positive signs in the eyeball.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 10:24:13", "endTime": "2024/09/24 10:25:03", "cost": 49.977}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:33", "update_time": "2024-09-23 18:25:01", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 18:24:11"}

Topiramate is a first line agent for migraine prophylaxis； however25% of migraine sufferers are unable to tolerate its side effects. Topiramate can cause fatigue and cognitive dysfunction mimicking the symptoms of CFS/ME therefore there is uncertainty if this group is able to tolerate Topiramate.\n\n【2】Aim： To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of Topiramate in Migraine prophylaxis in CFS/ME patients\n\n【3】Design： A retrospective study.\n\n【4】Methods： Data was gathered from two specialist CFS/ME rehabilitation services who serve a population of >600.000 in the north of England. Patients started on Topiramate for migraine prophylaxis were contacted and their feedback regarding Topiramate including current dose， efficacy， side effects and reason for withdrawal if appropriate were noted.\n\n【5】Results： 27 patients were started on Topiramate. 24 were females with a mean age of 37(SD27). The dose ranged between 25 mg to 125 mg with mean 79 mg daily.5 patients (18.5%) could not tolerate Topiramate because of increasing fatigue； cognitive side effects and paresthesia. 3 patients had side effects of self-limiting paresthesia and continued with the medication. All remaining 22 patients reported improvement in their migraine frequency： 10 (39%) with no attacks， 9 (33%) experienced more than 50% reduction and 3(17%) experienced less than 50% reduction.\n\n【6】Discussion： Our cohort of patients with CFS/ME experienced better response rate and tolerability compared to the reported pooled data from RCTs. Concern regarding intolerance and side effects of Topiramate in CFS/ME patients suffering from migraine is unjustified. Offering clear clarification of the benefits， explanation of potential side effects and providing ongoing support may explain these positive results.\n\n【7】Keywords： Topiramate； Chronic fatigue syndrome； Myalgic encephalomyelitis； Migraine\n\n【8】Introduction\n\n【9】Chronic Fatigue Syndrome/Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME) is a common condition with an unexplained etiology . As the physical examination and investigations are invariably normal ， the diagnosis is made using diagnostic criteria such as Fukuda criteria  or Canadian consensus criteria . Symptoms such as debilitating fatigue which is not relieved by rest and is associated with post exertional malaise are the hallmarks of the illness . Other symptoms such as unrefreshing sleep， physical pain and cognitive impairment are also common. All diagnostic criteria include headaches as a common feature of CFS/ME. Headaches can present in different forms such as tension headaches， episodic or chronic migraines . More than two thirds of Migraine sufferers fulfill the criteria for diagnosis of CFS/ME  and more than 80% of CFS/ME patients complain of migraine . Recent advances in the understanding of the two conditions suggest that a common pathology may explain such strong association .\n\n【10】The focus on a vascular phenomenon as the primary pathology of migraine has proven an inadequate explanation as the complex interplay between the peripheral trigeminal vascular and the complex central networks are suggesting a much more complex pathology . Recent research has also shown that the approach to CFS/ME as a solely functional disorder with psychosocial factors predisposing， precipitating and also perpetuating the condition is a simplistic explanation for this common and disabling condition. The persistent symptoms can be at least partially explained by a central sensitisation process， a process shared with migraine， fibromyalgia and Gulf War Illness .\n\n【11】Table 1： Comparison between our cohort and the pooled data analysing topiramate use .\n\n|  | Studied cohort  | Topiramate pooled data   |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| >50% reduction in frequency of migraine attacks  | 19/27(70%)  | 46%  |\n| >75% reduction in frequency of migraine attacks  | 10/27(39%)  | 25%  |\n| Average dose  | 79mg  | 100mg  |\n| Topiramate discontinued (not tolerated)  | 5/27(18.5%)  | 25%  |\n| Side effects (total  | 8/27 (29%)  | >50%  |\n\n【13】Such strong correlation between CFS/ME and migraine is not just of interest to neuroscientists but also has significant implications in clinical practice. Stress and anxiety are strong perpetuators of both conditions and a successful reduction of its burden is likely to help both conditions . Pharmacological management of the2 conditions can be a challenge in some patients with many CFS/ME patients either having several medications to manage other symptoms such as physical pain， insomnia or mood disorders . Paradoxically， some CFS/ME patients find it difficult to tolerate many medications  especially with associated conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome， idiopathic environmental intolerance or because of the medications impact on already depleted energy levels.\n\n【14】Propranolol and Topiramate are suggested as the first line migraine prophylactic treatment in patients older than 12 years . We could not identify any scientific literature reporting on the use of either drug in migraine patients suffering also from CFS/ME. In this short paper we are reporting our experience using Topiramate in a cohort of CFS/ME for migraine prophylaxis.\n\n【15】Methods\n\n【16】Two specialist services for CFS/ME management serve a population of more than 600.000 residents (Wigan， Bolton and Bury) in the north west of England. The first author provides medical input for both services. The standard practice is to use Topiramate as a first line treatment with Propranolol and Pizotifen occasionally used if specifically needed for a clinical reason. All CFS/ME patients prescribed migraine prophylaxis in a period of 24 months were identified from the patients'electronic records. Those patients were contacted either by phone or face to face during a clinical review. The patients demographics and type of medication prescribed were documented. The patients still on the medication prescribed were asked about their response (no attacks， more than 50% improvement in frequency， less than 50% frequency or no improvement)； the patients were asked about any side effects and what the dose they are on. The patients who decided to discontinue the drug prescribed were identified and asked about the main side effects that led to discontinuation of the drug.\n\n【17】Results\n\n【18】Prophylactic management wasFprescribed for 37Ppatients but only 33 could be contacted. 3 patients decided not to start the medication. Two patients were started on Propranolol as they had poorly controlled anxiety and Propranolol was deemed uniquely suitable to tackle the anxiety as well. Both patients reported reduction of migraine frequency ofaround 50%. Another patient was started on Pizotifen because of an associated nutritional problem. The Pizotifen reduced the migraine frequency by more than 50%. Full data was available for 27 patients who started Topiramate. Their age ranged between 18-62 years with a mean 37 (SD11.9). 3 were males. 5 patients(18.5%) could not tolerate Topiramate and discontinued it (2 because of paraesthesia and 3 because of cognitive impairment).\n\n【19】Patients 22 (81.5%) on Topiramate were on doses of 25 mg to125 mg daily 79 (SD27.9). Only 3 reported self-limiting paraesthesia and the other 19 (70%) denied having any side effects. 10 patients(39%) reported complete control of their migraine， 9 (33%) reported more than 50% improvement in frequency whilst 3 (11%) reported less than 50% improvement.\n\n【20】Discussion\n\n【21】Three double blind randomised controlled trials published in 2004reported the positive impact of Topiramate in Migraine prophylaxis. MIGR 1 MIGR 2 showed Topiramate to be significantly better than placebo whilst MIGR 3 demonstrated the equivalence of both Topiramate and Propranolol in migraine prophylaxis. A daily dose of 100 mg was superior to 50 mg dose which failed to significantly improve migraine control， whilst 200 mg daily had a similar impact in the frequency of attacks. A dose of 100mg/day was duly recommended as the standard recommended dose for migraine prophylaxis .\n\n【22】The pooled data from the 3 trials was presented by D'amico in2006 . The data suggested that almost half of the patients on Topiramate should expect at least a 50% reduction in the frequency of migraine attacks. On the other hand， the pooled data highlighted the problems many of the patients may experience with side effects especially paraesthesia which affects half of the subjects； other side effects such as fatigue， speech problems and cognitive impairment are also common complications of Topiramate use. The severity and refractory nature of the side effects resulted in a high level of intolerance ofthe drug with roughly quarter of the subjects having to discontinue the drug according to the pooled data.\n\n【23】Such high levels of intolerance of Topiramate may discourage clinicians from prescribing it especially in a patient group such as CFS/ME sufferers . Problems with drug intolerance， fatigue， cognitive impairment and/or chronic pain are cardinal features of the disease ； therefore， concerns about Topiramate worsening these symptoms seems to be a valid issue when consideringtreatment strategies.\n\n【24】The comparison between the outcomes and tolerance of our cohort in comparison with the pooled data reported by D'Amico shows in . The comparison suggests at least a similar favorable response to Topiramate if not a superior control of the migraine frequency. Less patients in our cohort reported side effects or discontinued the drug compared to the pooled data as well.\n\n【25】Several aspects in our clinical practice and the nature of CFS/ME patients may explain such a positive result. Our standard practice is to initiate pharmacological management simultaneously with the CFS/ME rehabilitation programmed which often includes concepts such as stress management， relaxation techniques， pacing among other strategies that may have a positive impact on migraine management. The patient also receives detailed information about the potential side effects with explicit recommendations to build up the dose slowly with an offer for support from the team if needed. The potential for weight loss as a common side effect  is also highlighted. One would expect some patients to welcome such side effect especially that many CFS/ME patients find it difficult to control their weight because of lack of physical activity or side effects of other medications (e.g. GABA agonists).\n\n【26】We also feel that the similarities between the common side effects of Topiramate and the main symptoms of CFS/ME may paradoxically help some patients tolerate these side effects as they experience it readily. A migraine sufferer experiencing paraesthesia or cognitive impairment for the first time to may be more concerned about such symptoms and more likely to report them or discontinue the drug.\n\n【27】This is a short retrospective study reporting the outcomes of a small number of subiects. We would like to stress the caution that must be exercised when interpreting the results or attempting to generalize the conclusions. The authors are the clinicians treating the subjects so a bias from both sides (patients and clinicians) cannot be excluded. Having said that， we feel that our observations should be in the public domain to at least encourage further evaluation of the pharmacological management in such complex population of overlapping co-morbidities.\n\n【28】In conclusion， we feel that reluctance to use Topiramate for migraine prophylaxis when associated with CFS/ME because of the concerns about intolerance is unjustified. Further research evaluating pharmacological interventions in patients with complex co-morbidities is needed to provide more informed guidance for clinical practice.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 11:06:04", "endTime": "2024/09/24 11:06:47", "cost": 42.508}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:33", "update_time": "2024-09-23 19:06:45", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 19:06:02"}

Delayed bleeding is usually the result of a trachea-arterial fistula， most likely an innominate artery (TIAF). Although the risk for TIAF complications in tracheostomy is less than 1%， mortality rates are extremely high. Endovascular interventions are becoming more available worldwide， replacing the need for open surgery.\n\n【2】Objective： To describe our experience with endovascular treatments for immediate and delayed post-tracheostomy hemorrhage.\n\n【3】Methods： Retrospective case series of three patients， treated with an endovascular approach for delayed life-threatening hemorrhage due to vascular injuries following tracheostomies.\n\n【4】Results： Diagnostic imaging studies were performed on all patients and included CTA scans.

It is an important treatment modality for every multidisciplinary team treating post-tracheostomy hemorrhage. Only with proper teamwork， can we be able to rapidly diagnose and treat these patients， and to increase odds for survival.\n\n【6】Keywords： Bleeding； Trachea-innominate； Fistula； Endovascular； Stenting； Angiography\n\n【7】Introduction\n\n【8】Post-tracheostomy hemorrhage is a potentially life-threatening complication that occurs in approximately 1% of cases and requires immediate intervention . Iatrogenic vascular injury to the jugular and carotid vessels and branches of the neck during surgery is usually the cause for major bleedings during the immediate postoperative period， lasting up to 3 days. Delayed bleeding is usually the result of tracheal erosion by a major artery，leading to pseudoaneurysms or fistulae . In most cases， the innominate artery is involved， resulting in Trachea-Innominate Artery Fistula(TIAF)， with mortality rates reaching 100% . In some cases， sentinel bleeding， hemoptysis， or pulsation around the cannula may precede. In the past， the only treatment options for acute and delayed bleeding were open surgery to repair， ligate or resect the damaged vessels. Once the bleeding is controlled， repair of the tracheal fistula is indicated. Reported success rates following surgical repairs are low， with high morbidity and mortality of more than 75% . In recent years， an endovascular approach is replacing the need for surgery， with higher survival rates of over 70%and fewer complications . We sought to describe our experience with endovascular treatments for immediate and delayed post-tracheostomy hemorrhage.\n\n【9】Methods\n\n【10】The Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guidelines for reporting observational studies and the Case Report (CARE) guidelines were followed in the study.\n\n【11】Design and settings\n\n【12】After receiving the Institution Review Board (IRB) approval， a retrospective chart review was conducted. Three patients who were treated for acute life-threatening post-tracheostomy bleeding with endovascular stenting during 2014 to 2016 qualified.\n\n【13】Participants\n\n【14】All patients were admitted to the Emergency Department (ED) after stomal bleeding had already commenced at home and were treated in a single medical center with a multidisciplinary team of professionals from head and neck surgery， vascular surgery， and Interventional Radiology (IR) departments. Diagnostic imaging studies were performed on all patients and included CTA scans. Follow-up period was of up to one year with no evidence of recurrent bleeding in any of presented patients.\n\n【15】Interventional angiography\n\n【16】Emergent interventional angiography was performed through a 10Fr. sheath via a brachial or femoral approach. Stent grafts were used in all patients (Bard Fluency， C. R. Bard， Inc. New Jersey，USA)， with the additional use of a balloon expandable stent (Medtronic Assurant Cobalt， Medtronic Inc. Minneapolis， USA) in some. After the procedure， patients were closely monitored in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for several days before being discharged home.\n\n【17】Brief patient presentations and clinical findings\n\n【18】PatientA： A72-vear-old male with ischemic heart disease treated with a coronary bypass 5 years ago， developed acute pulmonary edema and respiratory distress due to severe aortic stenosis. He was intubated and later underwent tracheostomy. On the 40h day following surgery (POD 40)， the patient presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with an active bleeding exiting the stomal area. Immediately upon arrival to the hospital the tracheostomy cuff was inflated. The patient was rushed to CTA， followed by an urgent diagnostic angiography in the IR unit. A large right subclavian artery pseudoaneurysm was detected . Through a 10Fr. sheath right brachial artery approach， three stent grafts sized 12 mm to 13.5 mm， were placed in an overlapping manner. Next， a 10mm balloon expandable stent was placed in the subclavian artery origin， followed by remodeling with 12 mm balloon inflation. The patient was then transferred to the ICU and was discharged after a week.\n\n【19】No complications due to the angiography were seen. Six months following the procedure， the patient remained asymptomatic.\n\n【20】Patient B： A 75-year-old woman was brought to the ED following a sentinel bleeding from the tracheostomy cannula. She had been put on assisted ventilation and underwent tracheostomy 3 months prior due to a right-sided hemisphere stroke. Upon arrival to the ED， acute intractable bleeding begun. The patient was immediately transferred to the Operating Room (OR)， for laryngotracheoscopy. During the procedure the bleeding had already stopped， and the origin was not traced. She was then transferred to CTA， which demonstrated the source of the bleeding from a TIAF . The patient was rushed to the IR unit， where a 12 mm stent graft was inserted to the innominate and subclavian arteries， covering the right common carotid artery origin， through a 10Fr. sheath right brachial approach. A control of the bleeding was achieved. As the patient had already suffered from a right sided stroke， no sequela following the procedure was seen. A post procedural CTA demonstrated accurate stent position without evidence of residual bleeding. In the ICU the patient had undergone a successful cardiac resuscitation following an arrest， due to significant blood loss. The patient was weaned from mechanical ventilation 3 days after the procedure. On follow-up， 9months after the incident， she remained asymptomatic.\n\n【21】Patient C： An 80-year-old woman presented had undergone tracheostomy following prolonged intubation 8 months ago. She was admitted to the ED due to acute and significant bleeding from the stomal area. Hemostasis was achieved by inflating the tracheostomy balloon and local dressing pressure. An emergency angiography demonstrated TIAF . Through a 10Fr. sheath right femoral approach， a 13.5 mm stent graft was placed in the innominate artery， followed by 14 mm balloon inflation. Control of the bleeding was achieved. The patient was discharged from the ICU after a week. On one year follow-up the patient remained asymptomatic.\n\n【22】Discussion\n\n【23】Anysignificantbleedingfollowinggtracheostomyy。eeither immediate or delayed is a potential life-threatening complication. Peak incidence and the risk for bleeding are found during the first6 weeks after surgery . Most of delayed postoperative bleedings are the result of TIAF and in more than 50% of cases， a sentinel bleeding occurs. Risk factors associated with an increased risk for TIAF are low tracheal ring incisions (lower than 3ring)， which lead to cannula-induced constant arterial pressure， surgical site infection and overinflated cuff that can cause pressure necrosis to the tracheal wal . Following angiography， all three patients survived the procedures， without re-interventions. No neurological sequala was seen. Follow-up period was of up to one year with no evidence of recurrent bleeding in any of presented patients.\n\n【24】Surgery to control early and delayed postoperative bleeding in general， and specifically in cases of TIAF， is still considered the treatment of choice. Ligation or resection of the innominate artery and repair of the fistula is usually performed via a median sternotomy approach， with the use of grafts if needed . Complications following surgery include cerebral hypoperfusion that may lead to stroke， graft infection， high risks of re-bleeding and poor survival rates. Wang et al.  reported a 7% 1-year survival rate following a surgical TIAF repair .\n\n【25】Taechariyakul et al.  published in a recent literature review of 260 cases， a comparison between surgical and endovascular interventions for TIAF. Endovascular approach was associated with significantly lower complication rate of 30%， compared to 50%in open surgery. Significantly lower 30-day mortality rate of 9% in endovascular approach was also seen， compared to 23% in open surgery .\n\n【26】In a recently published systematic review by O'malley et al.  covering 27 patients who underwent endovascular interventions for TIAF， 23% of patients were hemodynamically unstable， and 96%were treated with stent grafts. They reported re-bleeding in 19% of patients， that required re-intervention， and rescue sternotomy in11%.Overall mortality rate was 30% .Our results support the use of endovascular treatments for post-tracheostomy bleeding， as a safe alternative to surgery， and further contribute to the growing body of evidence published in the literature.\n\n【27】Conclusion\n\n【28】Post tracheostomy bleeding， either acute or delayed， is a life-threatening complication that require prompt diagnosis， as well as immediate assessment for respiratory and hemodynamically instability in the patient. A multidisciplinary teamwork is needed to decide on the proper treatment in each patient， to maximize the odds for survival. In an era of bursting technological advancement， endovascular treatments offer highsuccess rates andfewer complications，compared to open surgery.\n\n【29】Authorship Statement\n\n【30】Each author has made substantial contributions to the conception or design of the study， the acquisition of data， analysis of the results and the process of drafting， revising， and approving the final version.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 10:20:06", "endTime": "2024/09/24 10:35:22", "cost": 916.322}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:33", "update_time": "2024-09-23 18:35:22", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 18:20:06"}

Probiotics are host-friendly live microorganisms those can restrengthen the intestinal microbial flora and are widely used mostly in the management of acute diarrhea. Probiotics-induced adverse drug reactions like， urticaria is an unusual incidence and here we found an event of probiotics-induced acute urticaria.\n\n【2】Case Description： An 18-month-oldpediatric patient was suffering from diarrhea for last 2 days and took the consultation of a doctor. He was prescribed with probiotics (a combination of Lactobacillus acidophilus-2 billion， Lactobacillus bulgaricus-1 billion and Bifidobacterium bifidum-1 billion) at a dose： one capsule per day orally. On the day one， the patient was experienced with probiotics-induced acute urticaria just after 3 and half hour of ingestion，and most of the symptoms of urticaria were resolved within 4 hr to 5 hrs without any anti-allergy medication. Same incidence happened in the second day. As per the doctor's advice， probiotics were discontinued and he was not experienced with any allergic reaction， after that.\n\n【3】Conclusion： Any drug may be treated as an allergen by a living human body and consequently， may develop allergic reactions such as， urticaria. Although，probiotics are considered as safe drugs， but in our case， we found a usual probiotics-induced acute urticaria case in a pediatric patient.\n\n【4】Keywords： Acute Urticaria； Probiotics； Adverse Drug Reactiona\n\n【5】Introduction\n\n【6】Acute urticaria， also known as hives， characterized by episodic， pale red， pruritic edematous lesions (wheals) on the skin， as a result of body's unpleasant symptomatic response to an allergen with or without a known etiology . Urticaria is the second most common cutaneous manifestation of adverse reaction after maculopapular drug eruption and occurs in 15% to 25% peoples at any stage of life . Probiotics are host friendly live microorganisms that are helpful for reestablishing host's beneficial microbial flora in the digestive system and this concept was established in the20h century through a hypothesis proposed by a Russian scientist and won a Nobel Prize. Both the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations (UN) have uniquely defined probiotics as live microorganisms， which， when administered in adequate amounts， confer a health benefit on the host’. Probiotics， such as L. acidophilus，L. bulgaricus and B. bifidum are widely used as probiotics  and adverse reaction with any of these probiotics is not recorded to date. We found a case of acute urticaria (an adverse drug reaction) followed by the oral administration of above mentioned probiotics in a pediatric patient.\n\n【7】A 18-month-old healthy male pediatric (toddler) patient went to a doctor (out-door) of a tertiary level hospital in Dhaka， Bangladesh with the complain of lose stool， persistently occurred for last 2 days with a frequency of 3-4 times a day and only oral rehydration saline (ORS) was administered in home. During consultation， doctor prescribed a probiotic combination in hard capsule form containing L. acidophilus (2billion)， L. bulgaricus (1 billion) and B. bifidum (1 billion)， at a dose： one capsule once a day， orally for the next 10 days for the treatment of diarrhea. Adequate ORS intake was advised for rehydration in the prescription. On that day， patients body weight was 10.8 Kg， blood pressure was 100 over 55 mmHg and pulse rate was120 beats per minute. The patient took the first dose (1 capsule) of the probiotics in the afternoon of the same day. After about 3 andhalf hour of administration， he developed acute urticaria characterized by pale red wheals with itchy and swelled feature， mostly in the chest and back . Patient looked fatigue. About 4 hr to 5 hours later， most of the pale read wheals were disappeared and itchiness reduced， significantly without taking any medication for that allergic reaction. The patient's parents were confused with that incidence of the first day and again experienced with the same incidence on the second day with probiotics ， which was again resolved after 4 hr to 5 hrs of ingestion without any sequelae except， mild itchiness in the chest and back. On the third day， parents avoided the ingestion of probiotics to their child and took him to doctor， immediately. His probiotic was stopped and by this time， his diarrhea was resolved. The pediatric patient was prescribed with syrup Chlorpheniramine Maleate (1 mg twice a day， orally) for his mild itchiness and he had not been experienced with any allergic symptom in the following days.\n\n【8】Discussion\n\n【9】Urticaria is an unpleasant adverse cutaneous reaction that may occur without any perception with a prevalence of 0.5% to 1% in population. The primary symptom of urticaria is pruritus.According to the symptoms’duration of stay and presence of stimulus/antigen， urticaria is generally classified as acute， chronic and physical . Any urticaria， size ranges from few millimeters to several centimeters in diameter，lasts for less than 6 weeks called， acute urticaria . In some cases， skin lesions may last forless than 48 hrs . It appears suddenly in response to a trigger， which may be a viral infection or an allergen， such as drug， food and insect . Drug-induced urticaria is seen in 9%of out-door patients in dermatology department and mostly reported against the most common drugs， such as penicillins， non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs， sulfonamides and Fluoroquinolones . Urticaria mostly occurs in the range of 20-40 years of age. Urticaria with a deeper swelling is called， angioedema. Generally， urticaria is occurred due to the activation of mast cell by both immunologic and non-immunologic mechanisms， which causes the release of inflammatory mediators， such as cytokines， histamine， leukotrienes and prostaglandins. These mediators increase vascular permeability which as a result， develops edema and pruritus. Mast cells are widely distributed throughout the body and possess Immunoglobulin E(IgE) receptors . A study on 411 pediatric patients found that 76.4% patients are experienced with acute urticaria . Approximately30% urticarias are chronic . An acute urticaria was observed in that pediatric patient with mild angiedema and severe pruritus， and resolved within a period of less than 48 hrs.\n\n【10】A data analysis report showed that drug-induced urticaria and fixed drug rashes are most frequently occurred with carbamazepine(16.23%)， phenytoin (15.15%) and cotrimoxazole (13.53%) . The age of the patients is an important factor for occurring any type of cutaneous drug eruptions. Geriatric patients， boys younger than 3years and girls older than 9 years have been found more susceptible to drug-induced skin eruptions. Several factors of the culprit drugs are responsible for the skin eruption likes， urticaria and factors are： route of administration， dose of the drug， frequency of dosing， duration and drug-metabolism pathways . In the current case， urticaria was developed in that boy with the ingestion of oral probiotics， significantly.\n\n【11】Probiotics are orally ingestible and nondigestible drug products that help to reestablish the naturally developed beneficiary host-microbiota in the digestive tract and synbiotics are formed when probioticsincluded inthecurrent intestinalmicrobiota .Hundreds of different bacterial species are living in the intestine and among the intestinal microbes， those are beneficial for host's health， are termed as probiotics. Probiotics strengthen the gastrointestinal microbial flora， boost-up the immune system， and reduce serum cholesterol， cancer prevention and son on . Bacteria from Lactobacillus or Bifidobacterium groups are widely used as probiotics. L. acidophilus， L. bulgaricus and B. bifidum are found with good potentiality as probiotics  and in this case， the pediatric patient found the probiotics preparation in the same combination. Considering all the studies on probiotics， it is believed that probiotics are safe， non-pathogenic beneficial organisms and that is why， globally， different combination of probiotics is used in the management of diarrheal diseases. Recently， probiotics are considered as the cost-effective， potential first line treatment option for managing acute viral diarrhea(specially， in the pediatric patients)， recurrent Clostridium difficile diarrhea and antibiotic-induced diarrhea . Epidemiological studies showed that bacteremia and sepsis is very rare with lactobacilli. To date， probiotics-induced no adverse reaction report or health hazard has been reported， worldwide . This may be the first clinical case of L. acidophilus， L. bulgaricus and B. bifidum induced adverse drug reaction (acute urticaria) that was observed in a pediatric patient.\n\n【12】Conclusion\n\n【13】Probiotics are safe and potential drug for strengthening hosts’intestinal beneficial microbial flora. Probiotics-induced adverse drug reaction is an unusual incidence to date. However， in this case， a pediatric patient was experienced with a probiotics-induced acute urticaria event.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 11:02:27", "endTime": "2024/09/24 11:02:31", "cost": 3.894}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:33", "update_time": "2024-09-23 19:02:31", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 19:02:27"}

A careful history， physical examination， radiology and endoscopy may reveal the exact pathology in respiratory track.\n\n【2】Keywords： Foreign body； Flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy； Rigid fiberoptic Laryngoscopy； Short of breath\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Young children with wheezing or stridor often wrongly diagnosed for bronchial asthma and treated for the same but without much ofabenefit. A careful history，physical examination， radiology and endoscopy may reveal the exact pathology which may be in larynx， trachea or bronchus and so with a proper diagnosis， the management is successful with a faster recovery and a cure . This misdiagnosis as asthma mayproduce a psychological trauma to parents and repeated visits to clinics will result into loss of working days and a monetary loss to parents as well as to state treasuries too. Wheezing is very common in children (40%) and by six years ofage， almost one half of children will have had at least one episode of wheezing. In children younger than 5 years， asthma is the most likely cause of recurrent wheezing but other causes should be considered in the differential diagnosis. The diagnosis ofa vocal cord dysfunction can be made using direct laryngoscopy， only during symptomatic periods or after the exercise . A stridor may be produced by other glottis pathologies like glottis cysts， vocal cord granulations， polyps and papilloma. Aspirated foreign bodies， stuck up in larynx， can lead to persistent cough with dyspnea and a stridor and by going further down it may produce a generalized wheezing， necessitating an endoscopic retrieval . Commonly found aspirated foreign bodies are food particles and seeds (70% of all episodes)， metallic or plastic pieces of toys or house hold items. The sudden onset of wheezing and choking may indicate foreign body aspiration， which warrants immediate bronchoscopy. If the history or physical examination suggests asthma， clinical guidelines recommend pulmonary function testing . Stridor with drooling suggests the diagnosis of epiglottitis and there may be congenital anomalies involving the air passages.\n\n【5】In this study， six different etiologies irrespective ofage or sex and duration or site of lesion were taken up， to understand common antilogies which may be misinterpreted as bronchial asthma but can be diagnosed correctly by simple X-rays or CT scans and an endoscopy.\n\n【6】Case Series\n\n【7】Case 1\n\n【8】(Glottis pathology-Foreign body) One year old girl was having SOB and cough for 3 months， after swallowing pieces of a cloth pin (plastic). The mother removed it from child’s mouth but the cough continued with a hoarse week crying sound and occasionally with a mild to moderate stridor. The patient was diagnosed and being treated repeatedly for asthma. The chest X-ray was found non informative. An FFL was indicated but due to its unavailability a rigid direct laryngoscopy was done which revealed a piece ofplastic cloth pin lying in between the true vocal cords， hooked at anterior commissure . Immediate after the FB extraction， the stridor disappeared and in next 3days the crying became normal.\n\n【9】Case 2\n\n【10】(Glottic pathology-papilloma) A four years old girl was being treated off and on for dyspnoea， stridor and cyanosis with a diagnosis of asthma， for about a month. The chest X-ray was found normal. Again a FFL was indicated but due to its non-availability， a rigid direct laryngoscopy was done which revealed an obstructive papillomatous growth on superior surface of both true vocal cords .\n\n【11】An emergency tracheostomy had to be performed and then through RDL， an excisional biopsy of the glottic growth was done. The histology confirmed it to be a papilloma. After a check direct laryngoscopy (before the decannulation) and with a gradual decannulation， the tracheostomy tube was removed after a week.\n\n【12】Case 3\n\n【13】(Supra glottic pathology-cyst) A four months old child， mature at birth， had persistent cough， wheeze and stridor， for two months. The chest X-ray was normal. A provisional diagnosis of Laryngomalacia/Bronchial asthma was made and due to non availability of FFL， a RFL was performed which revealed a， 0.5 cm size， round cyst on superior surface of epiglottis with its left edge extending to vallecula pushing the left side of epiglottis downwards. The cyst wall was excised and a mucoid fluid was drained. Few granulations were also seen over left false vocal cord near the arytenoid. True vocal cords， sub glottis and trachea were found normal. Post operativelythe wheezing disappeared though the hoarseness persisted for 2 weeks. Histology report from the cyst in vallecula revealed it to be a retention cyst contents with inflammatory cells and the granulations tissues from the false vocal cord showed “Fibromyxoid spindle cell proliferation”.\n\n【14】Case 4\n\n【15】(Glottic inflammatory. pathology-Sub acute inflammation) A nine months old child had a hoarse and low volume crying sound with a persistent dry cough and respiratory distress， for 2 weeks. There was no history of respiratory tract infection. The child was known to be asthmatic. Clinically and radiologically the chest was clear. The CBC was found normal. A RFL (as FFL was not available) revealed congestion and edema on true vocal cords. The child was treated for subacute Laryngitis with steroids and antibiotics and in seven days the patient recovered fully.\n\n【16】Case 5\n\n【17】(Subglottic Pathology- FB) A nine months old child had breathlessness， noisy breathings for about two weeks and fever for 1week. She was being treated for bronchial asthma without any relief. The patient had mild inspiratory stridor with bilateral conducted sounds in lungs. Incidentally a chest X-ray was advised which revealed a radio-opaque， 5 mmx3 mm， rectangular FB in subglottic region .\n\n【18】The child was taken to operation theatre for a RFL but an emergency tracheostomy had to be performed first， because of the falling oxygen saturation. Through RFL the metallic FB was extracted， from the subglottic region.\n\n【19】Case 6\n\n【20】(Oesophageal Pathology- FB) A two years old child had cough， wheezing and choking with drooling of saliva for 2 weeks， more so during getting feeds， which was liquid only. The child was being treated for suspected bronchial asthma but without any benefit so a chest X-ray was advised which revealed a coin in upper third of oesophagus . Coin found partially eroded. A RFL was used to extract the coin. The surfaces of the coin were found partially eroded and rusted due to its long stay inside the oesophagus.\n\n【21】Discussion\n\nRegarding the age factor， the cases in our study group， were in between 4 months to 4 years， similar to studies in the United States(between 1988 and 1994) which showed that the prevalence for | S.No.  | Site/age/sex  | Pathology  | Diag.by  | Remarks  | Managed by  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1  | Glottic/1 year/F  | F.B.(Plastic piece)  | RFL-  | Duration-3 Months (Cough， Hoarseness and Mild Stridor)  | RFL-Extraction  |\n| 2  | Glottic/4 years/F  | Papilloma  | RFL-  | Duration 1 Month， (off and on-SOB， Stridor andCyanosis)  | RFL-Excision  |\n| 3  | Supra-Glottic/4 months-/F  | Cyst and Granulations  | RFL-  | Duration 2 Months (Persistent Cough， Wheezes and Stridor)  | RFL-Excision  |\n| 4  | Glottic/9 months/-M  | Inflammation  | RFL  | Duration 2 Weeks， (Cough， Hoarseness and a WeakSound on Crying)  | RFL-Diagnostic  |\n\n【23】wheezing amongst two to three year olds was 26% and amongst 9to 11 year olds， it was 13%(4.5). FB aspirations， congenital laryngeal cysts and wheezes due to asthma are also common in young children， below 5 yrs of age. Regarding the sex incidence， in our study， 4 cases were females and 2 were male children but as we picked up the cases with only different pathologies and not age wise hence no inference can be drawn for the sex incidence. In other studies also no specific sex ratio has been found. Similarly a study on incidence of site and type of pathology was not possible in this study as cases were not selected for a particular period， site of lesion or as per pathology. The different sites with different pathologies were selected for the sake of discussion. In our study the symptoms and duration for all the cases was in between 2 weeks to 3 months as for this study the cases were selected who had dyspnea of recent origin with different pathologies. All the six cases in our study were being treated for asthma. These misdiagnosed asthmatic patients were later found to have a different pathology， emphasizing the importance of radiology and endoscopic investigation for a proper diagnosis. A diagnosed by rigid endoscopy was used due to non availability of a flexible fiberoptic endoscope and in radiology， plain X-rays of neck and chest were helpful. For removal of FB， rigid endoscopes were used which is still a preferred way of removing a relatively big FB from upper airway. In our study the FB seen were a coin (in oesophagus)， a ring from subglottis and a FB (plastic piece of a cloth pin) in glottis. As per the results are concerned， there was an immediate relief in case of FB extracted from glottis after excision of the glottic papilloma and when the coin was removed from upper third of oesophagus but the progress was gradual after supraglottic cyst removal and in the case of laryngitis. In the case of subglottic FB extraction， after a planned decannulation， the tracheostomy tube was removed.\n\n【24】Limitations\n\n【25】The cases were selected as per different aetiologies so this study is only for discussion of different aetiologies and their clinical confusing presentation as bronchial asthma (not in relation to incidence/sex/age).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 10:48:33", "endTime": "2024/09/24 10:52:00", "cost": 207.022}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:33", "update_time": "2024-09-23 18:52:00", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 18:48:32"}

Due to the latest evidences， endometrial cancer molecular characterization results crucial for proper risk stratification.\n\n【2】A young woman with G1 endometrioid endometrial cancer diagnosed by hysteroscopy was treated conservatively. After cancer persistence， she underwent radical surgery for advanced disease. Post-hoc immunohistochemical analysis was performed comparing the first-diagnosis biopsy (mismatch repair deficiency) to surgical specimen (mismatch repair proficiency). Interestingly， not only the cancer changed biochemically， but it also shifted from a confined tumor to an advanced disease with bulky lymph nodes and negative endometrial infiltration. Eventually， the patient was diagnosed with Lynch syndrome.\n\n【3】A wiser evaluation of the mismatch repair deficiency should have guided to the proper therapeutic algorithm， also suggesting genetic tests. This case report represents an encouragement to further investigations on molecular assessment as a predictor for endometrial cancer risk stratification in conservative management.\n\n【4】Keywords： Cancer； Endometrium； Fertility； Genital Neoplasms； Immunohistochemistry\n\n【5】Introduction\n\n【6】Endometrial Cancer (EC) is the fourth most diffuse malignancy in developed countries， also representing the most common gynecological cancer . In about 80% of cases， EC is diagnosed when the disease is still confined to the uterus. Though total hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy is considered the standard treatment， a conservative management， consisting in oral or intra-uterine progesterone with or without hysteroscopic endometrial resection and follow-up biopsies every 3 to 6 months， is recommended in women desiring off spring . Although considered a safe approach， a subgroup of patients shows no cancer regression， recurrence or progression to more advanced stages . For this reason， the study of new molecular markers able to predict response to conservative treatment is extremely important. Only a few small-population studies investigated the role of Mismatch Repair status (MMR) as a promising predictor marker for conservative treatment outcomes . In this case report， we aim to bring to attention the peculiar clinical history of a young woman diagnosed with Mismatch Repair deficiency (MMR-d) EC on hysteroscopic biopsy， treated conservatively， with a atypical disease persistence： Complete local response with spreading of cancer to pelvic and aortic Lymph Nodes (LNs)， with concurrent molecular switch into MMR-proficient immunophenotype.\n\n【7】Case Presentation\n\n【8】Medical history\n\n【9】A 37-year-old woman in good clinical conditions is referred to our attention. In her history no comorbidities or previous surgeries were reported. Family history was significant for colon cancer. The patient was nulliparous， with strong desire for offspring. In March 2017 she was diagnosed with endometrial polyposis through ultrasound， for which she underwent operative hysteroscopy in April 2017 in another hospital， with positivity for complex atypical Endometrial Hyperplasia (EAH). Histological samples from polypectomy were revised from our pathologists\n\n【10】Table 1： Results from IHC analysis： Comparison between endometrial biopsy  and surgical specimen .\n\n【11】Endometrial biopsy (September 2017) Surgery (February 2021)\n\n|  | Endometrial biopsy (September 2017)  |  | Surgery (February 2021)  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Diagnosis  | EAH (resected polyp)  | G1 eEC (endometrial sampling)  | eEC cells in metastatic LNs  |\n| MMR status  | MSH2-，MSH6+， MLH1+， PMS2+(MMR deficiency)  | MSH2-， MSH6-， MLH1+， PMS2+(MMR deficiency)  | MSH2+， MSH6+，MLH1+， PMS2+(MMRproficiency)  |\n| ER  | 1+，60%  | 1+，10%  | 1+；5%  |\n| PR  | 3+，85%  | 3+，40%  | 1+；1%  |\n| P53  | missing data  | missing data  | wild type  |\n\n【13】EAH： Endometrial Atypical Hyperplasia； G1 Well-Differentiated；eEC： endometrioid Endometrial Cancer；LNs： Lymph Nodes with expertise in gynecology oncology， with diagnosis of EAH， with focal transformation into G1 (well differentiated) endometrioid EC(eEC). On MRI a 6 mm x 15 mm polypoid-like formation without evidence of myometrial infiltration was identified. The patient underwent polypectomy and endometrial biopsy in our hospital in September 2017. The polyp was positive for EAH and the endometrial biopsy was diagnostic for G1 eEC. The patient was prescribed Medroxyprogesterone acetate and a three-monthly follow-up plan with pelvic transvaginal ultrasound and scheduled hysteroscopies was programmed. In September 2018 endometrial biopsy resulted in EAH. This finding was confirmed in the following endometrial sampling in January 2019. The patient was advised to continue Medroxyprogesterone acetate and an intrauterine progesterone-medicated device (IUD) were positioned. In May 2020， the follow-up biopsy was diagnostic for G1 eEC. At ultrasound， an 11 mm x9 mm x 11 mm hyperechogenic endometrial tissue at the uterine fundus and a minimal irregularity of the endometrial-myometrial margin at the anterior uterine wall were identified. Nevertheless， an additional endometrial biopsy in September 2020 was negative. The following histological examination in December 2020 confirmed a G1 eEC.\n\n【14】Transvaginal ultrasound (December 2020)\n\n【15】Endometrium was 5 mm thick and the medicated-IUD properly positioned. Ovaries appeared normal and no endopelvic effusions or dilatation of the renal pelvis were visible. At the aortic bifurcation，on the right， a hypoechogenic， inhomogeneous， a vascular formation of 12 mm x7 mm with regular margins was identified. Other formations with the same ultrasonographic features were visible at the left external iliac vessels (16 mmx13mm)and at the left external iliac vessels (16mmx10 mm and 9 mmx10 mm). The abovementioned lesions were to be referred in the first hypothesis to lymphadenopathies.\n\n【16】Chest-abdomen-pelvis TC scan with intravenous contrast(January 2021)\n\n【17】A 1.5 cm solid nodule suspected for lymphadenopathy was detected at the right iliac bifurcation. Along the internal iliac vessels， solid and uneven bilateral formations of 2.5 cm， suspected for pathological LNs， were identified. Non-confluent LNs of up to 1 cm was observed in the inguinal-femoral region bilaterally.\n\n【18】Oncofertility counseling\n\n【19】The patient was counseled on the clinical indication of a radical surgery. Once informed， the patient voluntarily chose to keep both ovaries.\n\n【20】Surgery (February 2021)\n\n【21】The patient underwent laparoscopic Querleu-Morrow class a radical hysterectomy， bilateral salpingectomy， ovarian suspension， systematic pelvic lymphadenectomy and removal of intercavoaortic lymphadenomegaly. Before hysterectomy， a cervical injection of indocyanine green 1 cc per side was performed， for which no fluorescent sentinel LN was identified. Lymphadenomegalies of 3cm were identified in the external iliac and obturator region on the right， and internal iliac area on the left. Hence， a bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy was performed. On examination of the para-aorto-caval region， a lymphadenomegaly of 2 cm was found at the interaortocaval level and removed. Ovaries were fixed to the psoas muscle fascia bilaterally. Surgery time was 158 min with minimal blood loss and no intraoperative complications. The postoperative stay was regular， with no complications， and the patient was discharged after three days.\n\n【22】Histological examination\n\n【23】Macroscopic， microscopic and Immunohistochemical Analysis(IHC) were performed.\n\n【24】Macroscopic and microscopic examination： The uterus was removedwithbothtubes. At theendometrialfundus， araised，necrotic hemorrhagic area of 1.5 cm was observed. Thrombized vascular structures and associated chronic inflammation with multinucleated foreign-body giant cells were recognized in its context. No residual tumor or endovascular neoplastic emboli were detected. The adjacent endometrium appeared atrophic with associated stromal pseudo-decidualization. The cervix was affected by chronic cervicitis with foci of superficial squamous and glandular metaplasia， with no evidence of neoplastic infiltration. Salpinges were negative. Out of 7 pelvic LNs removed， 2 were positive for EC metastases (1/5 at the right and 1/2 at the left). The bulky LN removed at the paraaortic region was positive for EC secondary disease.\n\n【25】Immunohistochemistry： We compareddIHC of thefirst endometrial biopsy performed in our center (September 2017) with IHC performed on the surgical specimen (February 2021).\n\n【26】Results from the comparison are shown in Table 1. IHC staining pattern for the first biopsy (September 2017) are shown in Figure 1.\n\n【27】Inguinal LNs examination\n\n【28】Due to the clinical and radiological suspicion on bilateral inguinal LNs， the patient underwent ultrasonographic-guided biopsy of one left inguinal LN localized at the 1st level of Daseler， which was the node with the most worrisome features (confluent with subverted ultrasonographic structure). Biopsy was negative for EC metastases. Nevertheless， in consideration of the highly suspected ultrasound characteristics， the patient was referred for nodal surgical staging in March 2021， during which a bulky left inguinal LN was removed and studied intraoperatively. Intraoperative analysis was negative for secondary EC disease； therefore a systematic aorticlymphadenectomy anda radicalization of the previous pelvic lymphadenectomy were performed for staging purposes. Eventually， at the definitive histological examination， over 6 aortic， 3 pelvic and 1 inguinal LNs removed， none was positive for EC metastases.\n\n【29】Genetic analysis\n\n【30】Considering the woman's family history， personal history and the aforementioned IHC features， the patient underwent germinal genetic test， which turned out to be diagnostic for Lynch syndrome.\n\n【31】Adjuvant treatment\n\n【32】In consideration of FIGO stage IIIC2， the patient was referred for adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy.\n\n【33】Discussion\n\n【34】In this case report we describetheclinicalhistoryofa youngpatient with MMR-d EC conservatively treated， with disease progression duringhormonaltreatment. We comparedtheIHC features ofthe first diagnosis biopsy with the ones on surgical specimen. Interestingly， we identified some relevant differences： on the 2017 endometrial biopsy， tumor cells exhibit MMR-d immunophenotype， whereas the 2021surgical specimen shows features of MMR-p immunophenotype. It is crucial to underline that not only the cancer has changed from a biochemical perspective， but it has also concurrently shifted from a macroscopically confined tumor (early stage) to an advanced disease with bulky aortic and pelvic LNs. Noteworthy， we observed a complete local response to treatment， with no evidence of tumor on uterine samples， with parallel spreading of EC to pelvic and aortic LNs. A post-hoc germinal genetic examination was performed and the patient was diagnosed with Lynch syndrome.\n\n【35】These data need to be reframed in perspective of the ProMisE classifier， which outlines four molecular groups of EC with different prognosis： 1) POLE-mutated (POLE-mt， goodl prognosis， very high mutational rate and mutations in the exonuclease domain of Polymerase-e)；2) Mismatch Repair-deficient (MMR-d， intermediate prognosis， high mutational rate and microsatellite-instability)； 3) p53-abnormal ；4) p53-wild-type  . In their retrospective study， Chung et al. analyzed how mismatch repair status influences response to EC fertility-sparing treatment . Among 57 patients， 9 (15.8%) had MMR-d on endometrial biopsy obtained before progesterone treatment. Results show that patients with MMR-d had a significantly lower complete response rate than those with MMR-p/p53-wt in terms of best overall response (44.4%vs. 82.2%) and complete response rate at 6 months (11.1% vs. 53.3%)， concluding that molecular classification has a prognostic significance in EC fertility sparing management， thereby enabling early risk stratification. An Italian study by Falcone et al.  investigated on the molecular features of 25 patients with EC conservatively treated， stating that ProMisE classifier application on resectoscopic specimens could be a pragmatic model for stratifying genetic risk of women with EC. Specifically， in the group of MMR-d conservatively-treated patients， for a 50% of women the presence of such mutations correlates withh；a worse outcome (persistence/progression or metachronous Lynch syndrome associated tumors). A retrospective Italian study of Raffone et al. ， investigated the association between MMR status and resistance rate to conservative treatment， recurrence rate and MMR-d reliability in predicting the risk of recurrence . Endometrial samples from 69 young women affected from AEH or mucosal-confined EC were collected before conservative approach and IHC features were examined. Results show that 8.7% of women was MMR-d. For this subset of patients， resistance to treatment was more common compared to p53-wt group (33.3% vs. 15.9%) with no statistical significance (p=0.2508) and recurrence after a complete regression occurred significantly more commonly than WOI p53-wt women (100% vs. 26.4%，p<0.0001). Moreover，MMR-d status was found to be a highly specific predictive marker for recurrence(sensitivity =22.2%， specificity =100%) . Moreover， Zakhour et al. ， observed that in young women with loss of MMR proteins by IHC there was a higher incidence of invasive cancer and a lower incidence of resolution with progestin therapy .\n\n【36】According to the few available evidences ， MMR-d status seems to be related to lower response rate to treatment， higher risk of recurrence and worst prognosis compared to p53-wt. Considering this， we may deduce that a wiser evaluation of molecular the MMR-d status should had guided to the proper therapeutic algorithm for the patient of this case report： The study of personal and family history with Lynch Syndrome blood test， a closer and more intensive follow-up program or a different surgical management.\n\n【37】This case-report spontaneously arisesquestions about the possibility to apply molecular classification in young EC patients management. The study of the role of MMR status by IHC may represent apotential stand-alone predictor marker for risk stratification in this subset of patients： EC offspring-desirers with MMR-d should be managed more intensively with the inclusion of II-level imaging in their follow-up schedule， contrariwise p53-wt women could be followed-up in accordance with current guidelines.\n\n【38】Further andlarger studies are needed for a deeper understanding of these phenomena and for a wiser application of its potential.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 10:51:11", "endTime": "2024/09/24 10:53:44", "cost": 153.139}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:33", "update_time": "2024-09-23 18:53:42", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 18:51:08"}

Because of the lower risk of intraoperative complications， possibility of using regional anesthesia， reduced infective morbidity， lesser pain and early return to routine activities， vaginal hysterectomy should be performed in preference to abdominal hysterectomy where possible. It can often be safely performed in women with prior caesarean section， nulliparity and a bulky uterus， after a thorough patient assessment. Long term follow up data from various studies show a low incidence of vault prolapse. Where feasible， the vaginal route should be preferred for hysterectomy.\n\n【2】Methods： It was a retrospective study in which the case notes of 336 patients undergoing vaginal hysterectomy at a single center over a 5 year period were retrieved. The demographic profile， intraoperative and postoperative data and five year follow up details of these patients was evaluated.\n\n【3】Results： The average age of the patients was 57 years and the most common indication for surgery was uterovaginal prolapse (81.8%). The mean duration of surgery was 61.6 min and the average blood loss was 50.1 ml. Four patients (1.2%) had intraoperative complications. Six patients (3.3%) had grade 2 or more vaginal vault prolapse at 5 year follow up.\n\n【4】Conclusion： Vaginal hysterectomy is safe and cost effective， and should be the approach of choice for hysterectomy whenever feasible in view of its advantages and lower complication rates. It can often be safely performed even in the presence of generally accepted contraindications.\n\n【5】Keywords： Vaginal Hysterectomy； Prolapse； Complications； Contraindications\n\n【6】Introduction\n\n【7】Vaginal hysterectomy is a procedure which follows all the parameters of minimally invasive surgery . It has beenlong-practiced and has even been mentioned in the descriptions of Berengario de Carpi  . When choosing the route and method of hysterectomy， safety and cost effectiveness must be kept in consideration . Because of the lower risk of intraoperative visceral injury， possibility of using regional anesthesia， reduced infective morbidity， lesser pain and earlier return to normal activities， vaginal hysterectomy should be performed in preference to abdominal hysterectomy where possible . Where this is not possible，laparoscopic hysterectomy may avoid the need for an abdominal hysterectomy. However， the length of the surgery increases as the extent ofthe surgery performed laparoscopically increases and there is a greater risk of substantial bleeding and damage to the urinary bladder and ureters when compared to vaginal hysterectomy .No benefits were found for laparoscopic versus vaginal hysterectomy in a few studies .\n\n【8】While the most common indication for a vaginal hysterectomy is pelvic organ prolapse， its use is not limited to urogynecology and pelvic floor reconstructive surgery. Other indications include uterine fibroids， adenomyosis， abnormal uterine bleeding， endometrial hyperplasia or early endometrial malignancy and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia .\n\n【9】Studies have concluded that a large uterus (>14 weeks size)， nulliparity， previous caesarean delivery， pelvic laparotomy or need for oophorectomy rarely constitute contraindications to vaginal hysterectomy . Doucette et al. have reported that if the vagina can allow access to divide the uterosacral and cardinal ligaments，uterine mobility is usually increased enough to allow vaginal hysterectomy，even in cases where there is minimal uterine descent . When the uterus is enlarged， vaginal hysterectomy often can be accomplished safely by using uterine size reduction techniques such as wedge morcellation， uterine bisection and intramyometrial coring . In patients with large uterine fibroids vaginal hysterectomy can be attempted if the surgeon is familiar with uterine morcellation， resources to convert to an abdominal route expeditiously are available， the size of the pelvis allows adequate exposure and the contour of the fibroid allows some degree of uterine descent . In a study by Davies et al， the proportion of vaginal hysterectomies performed can be increased by a factor of 6 if the criteria for vaginal hysterectomy is extended to patients without clinically significant prolapse .\n\n【10】The vaginal axis is better maintained after a vaginalorlaparoscopic hysterectomy than after an abdominal hysterectomy . Completing a procedure vaginally could substantially decrease the total operative cost， in part because of its low associated morbidity rates . It can be successfully adopted as a same-day discharge procedure .\n\n【11】Materials and Methods\n\n【12】We conducted a retrospective， descriptive， non-comparative study in women undergoing vaginal hysterectomy for various indications between January 15， 2007 to December 315， 2011 at KK Women's and Children’s Hospital， Singapore. Inclusion criteria were medical indication for vaginal hysterectomy like pelvic organ prolapse， uterine fibroid， abnormal uterine bleeding and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. Patients with concomitant vaginal mesh insertion or sacrospinous ligament fixation were excluded from the study. All surgeries were performed by the same surgical team. The Centralized Institutional Review Board (CIRB) approval was taken before the commencement of the study.\n\n【13】The medical records of these patients were retrieved and their demographic data was analyzed. The preoperative fin dings including the degree ofprolapse， as assessed by the Baden-Walker classification system were noted. The intra-operative details like concomitant surgeries， type of anesthesia， and mean duration of surgery， mean blood loss， intra-operative complications and weight of the uterus were analyzed. Postoperative complications， length of hospital stay， duration of catheterization， histology report of the uterus， readmission rate and reason for readmission were noted.\n\n【14】Patients were followed up post operatively in the urogynecology clinic at 3 days after discharge and then at 1 month， 6 months， 1，2，3，4and 5 years postoperatively. At all these visits， patients were assessed for symptoms of vaginal vault prolapse， urinary incontinence， voiding difficulty or dyspareunia and a clinical examination was done.\n\n【15】The data was analyzed using the SPSS software with frequency， mean and standard deviation used for quantitative variables. Chi square test was used for analyses in patients with concomitant procedures who had longer duration of surgery， more blood loss， longer duration of hospital stay and greater re-catheterization rates. The difference was considered significant at a P value equal to or less than 0.05.\n\n【16】Results\n\n【17】A total of 1，024 women underwent vaginal hysterectomy for various indications between January 15，2007 and December. Of these， 774 case notes could be retrieved. Four hundred and thirty eight patients underwent concomitant vaginal mesh placement or sacrospinous ligament fixation and were excluded from the study. Three hundred and thirty six patients were included in the study. The mean age of the patients was 57 years with the youngest patient being35 years old and the oldest aged 86 years. The mean parity was 2.9. Ninety-six percent of them had previous vaginal deliveries . The pre-operative symptoms included lump coming out of the vagina in 82.1 percent， voiding difficulty in 3% and stress urinary incontinence in 37.5 percent of the patients .\n\n【18】Twenty nine percent of women had grade 3 cystocele to 4cystocele on pre-operative examination， 58 percent of them had grade3 to 4 uterovaginal descent and 32.5 percent had grade 3 rectocele to 4 rectocele. Thirty eight percent of them had demonstrable stress urinary incontinence .\n\n【19】The indication for vaginal hysterectomyywas uterovaginal prolapse in 81.8 percent of these women， fibroid uterus in 14 percent， Table 1： Demographic characteristics.\n\n| Patient's Characteristics  | N=336  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Age (years) mean ± SD (range)  | 57.0±10.2  |\n| Parity mean ± SD (range)  | 2.9±1.6  |\n| Previous vaginal delivery n (%)  | 323(96.1)  |\n| Previous Caesarean delivery only n (%)  | 4(1.2)  |\n| Nulliparous n (%)  | 9(2.7)  |\n| Sexually active n(%)  | 153(45.5)  |\n| Postmenopausaln (%)  | 217(64.6)  |\n\n【21】Table 2： Preoperative symptoms.\n\n| Pre-operative Symptoms  | N=336  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Lump at Introitus n (%)  | 276(82.1)  |\n| Voiding Difficulty n(%)  | 10(3.0)  |\n| Urgencyn(%)  | 74(22.0)  |\n| Urge Incontinence n(%)  | 43(12.8)  |\n| Stress UI n (%)  | 126(37.5  |\n\n【23】Table 3： Preoperative examination.\n\n| Pre-operative Symptoms  | N=336  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Cystocele n (%)  |  |\n| (a) Grade 0  | 86(25.6)  |\n| (b) Grade 1  | 45(13.4)  |\n| (C) Grade 2  | 108(32.1)  |\n| (d) Grade 3  | 93(27.7)  |\n| (e) Grade 4  | 4(1.2)  |\n| Cervical Descent n (%)  |  |\n| (a) Grade 0  | 24(7.1)  |\n| (b) Grade 1  | 24(7.1)  |\n| (C) Grade 2  | 179(53.3)  |\n| (d) Grade 3  | 94(28.0)  |\n| (e) Grade 4  | 15(4.5)  |\n| Rectocele n (%)  |  |\n| (a) Grade 0  | 53(15.8)  |\n| (b) Grade 1  | 88(26.2)  |\n| (c) Grade 2  | 180 (53.5)  |\n| (d) Grade 3  | 13(3.9)  |\n| (e) Grade 4  | 2(0.6)  |\n| SUIn (%)  | 128(38.1)  |\n\n【25】Table 4： Intraoperative details.\n\n| Parameters  | N=336  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Indication for surgery n (%)  |  |\n| (a) Uterovaginal prolapse  | 275(81.8)  |\n| (b) Fibroids  | 47(14.0)  |\n| (C) Adenomyosis  | 19(5.7)  |\n| (d) Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia (CIN)  | 4(1.2)  |\n| Anaesthesia n (%)  |  |\n| (a) Regional  | 88(26.2)  |\n| (b) General  | 248(73.8)  |\n| Patients with concomitant surgeries n (%)  |  |\n| (a) Pelvic flaor repair  | 153(45.5)  |\n| (b) Mid urethral sling  | 131(39.0)  |\n| (c) Oophorectomy (vaginally)  | 12(3.6)  |\n| Duration of surgery (min) mean ± SD (range)  |  |\n| (a) Mean  | 61.6±21.9  |\n| (b) Vaginal Hysterectomy (VH)  | 51.9±16.6  |\n| (C) VH + Pelvic Floor Repair (PFR)  | 56.8±20.1  |\n| (d) VH + Mid urethral tape  | 71.0±22.4  |\n| Blood Loss (ml)mean ± SD (range)  |  |\n| (a) Mean  | 50.1±47.0  |\n| (b) VH  | 61.4±57.5  |\n| (C) VH + PFR  | 47.3±46.8  |\n| (d) VH + Mid urethral tape  | 48.9±42.1  |\n| Weight of uterus (g)(n=329) mean ± SD (range)  |  |\n| (a) Mean ± SD (range)  | 101.6±82.7   |\n| (b) <200n(%)  | 291(88.4)  |\n| (c) 200-<300 n (%)  | 28(8.5)  |\n| (d)≥300n(%)  | 10  |\n| Intraoperative complicationsn(%)  | 4(1.2%)  |\n| (a) Bladder Perforation  | 1  |\n| (b) Rectal Perforation  | 3  |\n| Histopathologyn (%)  |  |\n| (a) Normal  | 267(79.5)  |\n| (b) Fibroids  | 167(49.7)  |\n| (C) Adenomyosis  | 97(28.9)  |\n| (d) Endometrial hyperplasia/carcinoma  | 14(1.7)  |\n| (e) Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia (CIN)  | 7(0.9)  |\n\n【27】adenomyosis in 5.7 percent and carcinoma in situ of the cervix in 1.2percent， with some patients having more than one indication . One hundred and thirty one patients (39%) had concomitant midurethral sling insertion， 153 (45.5%) had concomitant pelvic floor repair and 12 (3.6%) had oophorectomy along with vaginal hysterectomy. None of the patients needed conversion toan abdominal approach.\n\n【28】The average duration of the surgery was 61.6 min for all cases，51.9 min in patients who underwent only vaginal hysterectomy，56.8 min for patients with concomitant pelvic floor repair and 71min for patients with concomitant midurethral sling insertion. The mean blood loss was 50.1 ml. Intra-operative complications occurred in 4 (1.2%) patients of which 1 had bladder perforation during midurethral sling insertion and 3 had rectal perforation. The average weight of the uterus was 101.6 g. The weight was more than 300 g in10 patients .\n\n【29】Table 5： Immediate postoperative details.\n\n| Parameters  | N=336  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Length of stay (days) mean ± SD (range)  | 2.9±1.2  |\n| Length of catheterization (days) mean ± SD (range)  | 2.6±3.2  |\n| Postoperative fever n (%)  | 7(2.1)  |\n| Postoperative urinary tract infection n(%)  | 10(3.0)  |\n| Readmissions n(%)  | 8(2.4)  |\n| (a) Vaiding difficulty after TVT (for tape laasening/division)  | 2  |\n| (b) Staging surgery for endometrial malignancy  | 3  |\n| (c) Pelvic hematoma  | 1  |\n| (d) Urinary tract infection  | 1  |\n| (e)Repair of rectovaginal fistula  | 1  |\n\n【31】The average length of hospital stay was 2.9 days and the average duration of catheterization was 2.6 days. Postoperative complications included fever in seven patients， urinary tract infection in 10 patients and readmission for various reasons in 8 patients .\n\n【32】The histology of the uterus revealed uterine fibroids in 49.7percent of the patients and adenomyosis in 28.9 percent. Endometrial hyperplasia or endometrial carcinoma was reported in 1.7% of the patients and carcinoma in situ of the cervix in 0.9 percent.\n\n【33】Three hundred and five patients (90.8%) complied with the 6months post-operative follow up and 180 (53.6%) complied with the 5 year post-operative follow up. The post-operative symptoms included lump at the introitus in 3 patients at 5 year postoperative follow up， de novo urgency and urge incontinence in 11 patients and stress urinary incontinence in 14 patients .\n\n【34】At the five year post-operative examination， 13 ofthe 180 patients(7.2%) had grade 2 or more cystocele. Six patients (3.3%) had grade2 or more rectocele， six (3.3%) had grade 2 or more vaginal vault descent. None of the patients had demonstrable SUI .\n\n【35】Ten of the 336 patients (3%) required repeat surgery for vaginal vault prolapse or SUI during the follow up period. Four patients underwent vaginal mesh repair and three underwent pelvic floor repair with sacrospinous ligament fixation for recurrent vaginal vault prolapse. Three patients underwent midurethral sling insertion for de novo SUI.\n\n【36】Discussion\n\n【37】Despite most literature supporting the view that vaginal hysterectomy is the safest and most cost-effective route for removal of the uterus， analysis of the US surgical data shows that abdominal hysterectomy is performed in 66% of cases， vaginal hysterectomy in 22% of cases and laparoscopic hysterectomy in 12% of cases. Teaching hospital status had minimal influence on the route of hysterectomy in one study . In a randomized trial， when residents followed specific guidelines for selection and performance of hysterectomy， the percentage of vaginal hysterectomies performed for benign conditions rose to more than 90% . In a study by Varma et al. ， the percentage of hysterectomies performed vaginally rose to 95% when a deliberate decision to perform as many hysterectomies as possible by the vaginal route was made . Moen et al.  suggested the use of the term “no-incision\"hysterectomy for vaginal hysterectomy may help patients in understanding its value in comparison to other routes of hysterectomy . blood loss between the two groups when they were analyzed based on uterine weight but patients with adenomyosis had an increased risk of bladder injury .\n\n【38】Table 6： Symptoms on postoperative follow up.\n\n【39】6 months (N=336) 1 year (N=336) 2 years (N=336) 3 years (N=336) 4 years (N=336) 5 years (N=336)\n\n| Follow-up rate n(%)  | 305(90.8)  | 283 (84.2)  | 251(74.7)  | 221(65.8)  | 193(57.4)  | 180(53.6)  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Lump at Introitus n (%)  | 1(0.3  | 5(1.8)  | 1(0.4)  | 2(0.9)  | 2(1.0)  | 3(1.7)  |\n| Vaiding Difficulty n(%)  | 0  | 0  |  |  |  |  |\n| De novo urgency n (%)  | 24(7.9)  | 23(8.1)  | 16(6.4)  | 10(4.5)  | 7(3.6)  | 11(6.1)  |\n| De novo Urge Incontinence n(%)  | 17(5.6)  | 14(4.9)  | 13(5.2)  | 8(3.6)  | 5(2.6)  | 11(6.1)  |\n| De novo SUI n (%)  | 11(3.6)  | 10(3.5)  | 8(3.2)  | 6(2.7)  | 9(4.7)  | 14(7.8)  |\n| Pain n (%)  | 1(0.3)  |  |  | 0  | 1(0.5)  | 0  |\n| Dyspareunian (%)  | 1(0.3)  | 0  | 0  | 0  |  |  |\n\n|  | 6 months (N=336)  | 1 year (N=336)  | 2 years (N=336)  | 3 years (N=336)  | 4 years (N=336)  | 5 years (N=336)  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Follow-up rate n(%)  | 305(90.8)  | 283 (84.2)  | 251(74.7)  | 221(65.8)  | 193(57.4)  | 180(53.6)  |\n| Grade ≥ 2 Cystocele n (%)  | 10(3.3)  | 11(3.9)  | 10(4.0)  | 6(2.7)  | 9(4.6)  | 13(7.2)  |\n| Grade ≥ 2 Rectocele n (%)  | 1(0.3)  | 1(0.3)  | 3(1.2)  | 4(1.8)  | 4(2.1)  | 6(3.3)  |\n| Grade ≥2 Vault descent n (%)  | 3(0.9)  | 3(0.9)  | 1(0.4)  | 2(0.9)  | 4(2.1)  | 6(3.3)  |\n| SUIn (%)  |  | 2(0.7)  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  |\n| Reoperationn (%)  |  | 1(0.3)  | 4(1.8)  | 1(0.4)  | 1(0.5)  | 3(1.7)  |\n\n【42】Reoperationn (%) 1(0.3) 4(1.8) 1(0.4) 1(0.5) 3(1.7)\n\n【43】The purpose ofthis study was to analyze the pre and perioperative factors and the outcome measures of vaginal hysterectomy. Among the patients studied， there were 9 nulliparous women and four patients with no previous vaginal deliveries， with two of them having undergone two previous caesarean sections. Vaginal hysterectomy was possible in all of these patients without any intraoperative complications. Augustine et al.  in their study on vaginal hysterectomy in nulliparous women without prolapse found that the success rate in multiparous women was more than that in nulliparous women， but the difference was not statistically significant . The difference in success rates may be explained by the technical difficulty due to a narrower vagina and lesser uterine descent in nulliparous patients. The rate of complications for nulliparous women was three fold higher in their study. Poindexter et al.  in their study did not find a higher complication rate in women with up to three previous caesarean sections undergoing vaginal hysterectomy . Similar observations were made by Unger et al.  and Sheth et al.  in their studies on women with previous caesarean section undergoing hysterectomy through the vaginal route .\n\n【44】Oophorectomy was possible vaginally in all 12 cases where it was attempted. It was done for various indications like ovarian cyst， endometrial hyperplasia or early endometrial carcinoma and on patient request. Sheth et al.  in their study reported that prophylacticoophorectomywas possible during vaginal hysterectomy in 1，510 of 1，572 cases (96%)， without laparoscopic assistance. Davies et al.  reported a 97.5% success rate in performing oophorectomy at the time of vaginal hysterectomy .\n\n【45】Pakbaz et al.  in their study on vaginal hysterectomy in women with prolapse reported an average duration of surgery of 76min and a mean blood loss of 128 ml .\n\n【46】The incidence of major intraoperative complications was 1.2%in our study. One of the patients with rectal perforation which was repaired intraoperatively developed a rectovaginal fistula and had to be readmitted for repair of the fistula . Bhattacharya et al.  reported an overall complication rate of 4% in their series of 1，105cases of vaginal hysterectomy . They reported a primary hemorrhage rate of 0.81 percent and a secondary hemorrhage rate of0.45%.Rectal perforation occurred in 9 patients. Pakbaz et al.  in their study on 941 patients undergoing vaginal hysterectomy reported9 cases of reoperation after vaginal hysterectomy for indications like intraperitoneal or retroperitoneal bleeding， bleeding from sutures， vaginal vault abscess and urinary retention after Tension free Vaginal Tape . Rizvi et al.  reported a 4.2% intraoperative hemorrhage rate and 0.2% incidence of bladder injury in 430 patients undergoing vaginal hysterectomy.12/468 (2.6%) of the patients had postoperative fever，20 (4.7%) required blood transfusion and 7(1.6%) had urinary tract infection .\n\n【47】In our study， there were 10 patients in whom the uterus weighed more than 300 grams. Vaginal hysterectomy was possible in all these cases with the weight of the largest uterus removed vaginally being825 grams. The average duration of surgery in these patients was 73.9min and the average blood loss was 78.7 ml. Sheth et al.  in their study reported that five patients needed conversion to a laparotomy when the uterine volume was more than 500 cm.Furuhashi et al. in their study comparing complications of vaginal hysterectomy in patients with leiomyomas to those with adenomyosis reported that there was no significant difference in the operative time and estimated In our study， eight patients were readmitted for various reasons like for TVT tape excision or loosening in patients who had postoperative urinary retention， staging surgery for endometrial malignancy， urinary tract infection requiring intravenous antibiotics and repair of rectovaginal fistula. In the study by Pakbaz et al. ，14 out of the 941 patients required readmission for indications like thrombosis， ileus， vaginal vault abscess and urinary retention .\n\n【48】There was no mortality in our case series. Sheth et al.  reported2 fatalities in their series ofover 5，655 vaginal hysterectomies .\n\n【49】Six (3.3%) of the 180 patients followed up till five years postoperatively developed grade 2 or more vaginal vault prolapse. Marchionni et al.  reported an 11.6 percent incidence of vault prolapse in women who had previous hysterectomy for prolapse and1.8% when hysterectomy had been performed for other indication.\n\n【50】Liang et al.  in their study on postsurgicalurinaryincontinence in continent women undergoing hysterectomy for vaginal prolapse concluded that neither urodynamics nor clinical examination predict with 100 percent certainty which women with pelvic organ prolapse will benefit from a prophylactic anti incontinence procedure during prolapse repair surgery .\n\n【51】Strengths of the present study are the large number of patients studied and the long postoperative follow up duration. Weaknesses are that it is a retrospective study and not all case notes could be retrieved.\n\n【52】Conclusion\n\n【53】In conclusion， vaginal hysterectomy is safe and cost effective， and should be the approach of choice for hysterectomy whenever feasible in view of its advantages and lower complication rates. It can often be safely performed even in the presence of generally accepted contraindications like prior caesarean section， nulliparity and bulky uterus， after a thorough patient assessment.

Preventing its risk factors， therefore，becomes fundamental in the approach to the critical patient.\n\n【2】Case Presentation： A 45 year-old male， with no known previous comorbidities， but acromegalic phenotype， presented pale， dehydrated，hypotense and tachycardic with consciousness fluctuations to the emergency service. Investigation pointed to Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA)and hypokalemia. The patient underwent neuroimaging studies and Magnetic Resonance (MRI) showed a pituitary macroadenoma with suprasellar invasion. Growth Hormone (GH) and IGF-1 (Insulin Growth Factor-1) levels were increased and diagnosis of acromegaly was then established. In the fifth day there was a peak of Creatine Kinase (CK) with progressive decrease. After 12 days of hospitalization， with resistant hyperglycemia， proximal flaccid tetra paresis and global hyporeflexia (MRC score of40 points) was noted. Clinical diagnosis of Critical Illness Myopathy (CIM) was established. After 30days of hospitalization， he was discharged with MRC score of 50 points and improves in CK levels.\n\n【3】Discussion： The presented case shows a CIM， a type of ICUAW. Some important risk factors are endocrine logical (thyroid diseases， diabetes， adrenal and pituitary dysfunctions). The patient presented hyperglycemia and underwent a prolonged period of hospitalization and use of glucocorticoid medications， increasing the risk of the disease. With clinical management and physiotherapy the patient regained autonomy.\n\n【4】Conclusion： ICUAW can bring long-term consequences， so that early identification and management as well as preventive measures are primordial to minimize chronic disability and morbidity.\n\n【5】Introduction\n\n【6】Intensive Care Unit-Acquired Weakness (ICUAW) is a growing problem in critically ill patients and is associated with a longer duration of mechanical ventilation， greater permanence and in-hospital mortality， in addition to higher costs to the health system. Preventing its risk factors， therefore， becomes fundamental in the approach to the critical patient .\n\n【7】Case Presentation\n\n【8】Male， 45 years old， with no known comorbidities or use of medications， entered the Emergency Service of Santa Casa de Sao Paulo， with a drop in general condition， fluctuation in consciousness and dehydration. Upon admission， Glasgow 14， severe dehydration and pale. Ectoscopy showing acromegalic facies， enlarged extremities， acrochordons in the cervical region， macroglossia and skin sweating. Vital signs： Blood pressure 100 mmHgx60mmHg， HR 100 bpm， SatO，97% in room air， capillary blood glucose above 500 mg/dL. Laboratory tests were performed， of which alterations are reported： plasma glucose 503 mg/dL (RV 70-99)， glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) 9.8%(RV<5.7%)， creatinine 1.9 mg/dL (RV 0.1)， plasma sodium 175 mEq/L (RV 135 to 145)， potassium 3.4mEq/L (RV 3.5 to 5.1)， CPK 8023 U/L (RV 38 to 174) and arterial blood gases： pH 7.2，pCO2 19， HCO3 6.3，BE-3.2 and lactate 3.9. Type 1 urine with 3 ketonuria crosses.\n\n【9】The patient was diagnosed with Diabetes and Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA)， starting treatment for DKA，prioritizing intravenous hydration， with care not to reduce acute sodium levels， in addition to an intravenous insulin pump， after correction of hypokalemia. Due to the fluctuation in consciousness， the patient underwent a cranial tomography， showing a lesion in the pituitary topography， progressing the investigation with Magnetic Resonance (MRI)， which showed a Pituitary Macro adenoma with suprasellar invasion， compressing optical chiasma， measuring in its largest axis 6.1 cm.\n\n【10】Pituitary hormone measurements were performed： GH>200mcg/L， IGF-1 476 ng/mL (RV 112 to 282)， Prolactin 21 mcg/L (RV up to 24)， ACTH 28p g/mL， Basal cortisol 23 mg/dL (RV>15)， TSH1.2 mUI/L (RV 0.45 to 4.5) and free T4 0.5 ng/dL (RV 0.6 to 1.3).\n\n【11】Diagnosis of Acromegaly due to hormonal changes， lesion in adenohypophysis and suggestive phenotype. Treatment with a somatostatin analogue (Octreotide) 20 mg monthly was started， in addition to a dopaminergic agonist (Cabergoline) 1.5 mg/week.\n\n【12】One day after admission， the patient evolved with a decrease in the level of consciousness requiring Orotracheal Intubation (OTI). He maintained high sodium levels， but already improving DKA. He was kept under OTI for 4 days， being extubated after normalization in sodium levels.\n\n【13】The patient refused the surgical procedure for the treatment of acromegaly. He remained with difficult glycemic control during the period of hospitalization， with improvement in intra hospital glucose levels after about 15 days of admission， using high doses of insulin (2 ui/kg/day). He also received treatment with corticosteroids(hydrocortisone 300 mg/day for 8 days， followed by prednisone 40mg/day for 18 days) due to the airway infection associated with the condition (sinusitis).\n\n【14】After 12 days of hospitalization， a picture of flaccid tetra paresis of proximal predominance (total MRC score of 40 points)， associated with global hyporeflexia， without changes in cranialnerves， sensitivity or in other modalities on neurological examination， was noted. Cerebrospinal fluid was normal. On the fourth day of hospitalization，he presented a Creatine Kinase (CK) of 12665， with a peak on the fifth day of 12888， followed by a gradual decrease during hospitalization. In the two weeks following extubation， the patient showed progressive clinical improvement in the peripheral nervous system， especially after better glycemic control. Due to the presence of generalized muscle weakness after severe， diffuse， symmetrical， flaccid pattern and without involvement of cranial nerves， associated with a sum of MRC less than 48 points， a diagnosis of myopathy of the critically ill patient was then established.\n\n【15】At the time of hospital discharge， 30 days after admission， the patient had a sum of the MRC score of 50 points， good glycemic control， using insulin， improvement in CPK， creatinine and sodium levels. Maintained GH 195 mcg/L (RV<1)and with refusal of surgical procedure. Referred to the endocrinology clinic to follow up on the diagnoses of acromegaly and diabetes； and the neurology outpatient clinic for follow-up of the diagnosis of myopathy.\n\n【16】Given the current epidemiological context， we emphasize that throughout the hospitalization period， the patient did not show any signs or symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 infection.\n\n【17】Discussion\n\n【18】In the case in question， the patient had multiple risk factors for the development ofICU-Acquired Weakness (ICUAW)and had a course of Critical Illness Myopathy (CIM). Although the pathophysiology of CIM is still being studied， the likely mechanisms include inhibition of protein synthesis， mitochondrial dysfunction， changes in the ubiquitin-proteasome system， oxidative stress and changes in intramuscular calcium homeostasis . Hyperglycemia associated or not with the use of steroids， uise of neuromuscular blockers and sepsis are the main risk factors .\n\n【19】Myopathy is worsened by multiple endocrine logical and metabolic factors. Among them， thyroid diseases， diabetes， adrenal dysfunctions and acromegaly stand out . The patient in question had hyperglycemia， with DKA，and was diagnosed with acromegaly during hospitalization. Acromegaly， characterized by high plasma levels of GH and IGF-1， has pituitary adenomas as its main etiology. It usually causes slowly progressive proximal myopathy and normal CPK levels . Myopathy presented by the patient probably was not due to the acromegaly， once there was clinical neurological improvementdespitee maintaining activity cof this disease， documented by the presence of high GH levels， even after therapy with somatostatin analog.\n\n【20】Diabetes is associated with multiple presentations of neuropathy and muscle involvement. Pathophysiology may be associated with microvascular changes in muscle and nerve regions， but neuropathies arenot common in the first years ofthe disease . Theytendtoappear after 10 years of diagnosis and are commonly associated with other micro vascular lesions typical of this disease， such as retinopathy and nephropathy . Regarding the clinical muscle condition， it has been documented in some cases that the cause of the injury is probably due to focal myonecrosis， followed by micro vascular injury .\n\n【21】Low carbohydrate diet and hydration should be instituted， in addition to the measurement of glycated Hemoglobin (HbA1c)， aiming at the previous diagnosis of diabetes， in those patients with in-hospital hyperglycemia in addition to assisting in the management of the disease at hospital discharge . The insulin prescription should ideally be performed according to the protocol of each institution or with the help of a specialist. Glycemic control aims at an intra-hospital goal between 140 and 180 mg/dl . These measures reduce overall mortality and the risk of developing polyneuropathy in critically ill patients. Values below 100 mg/dL are correlated with increased mortality， due to the risk of severe hypoglycemia and， therefore， should be avoided .\n\n【22】Myopathy mainly affects the proximal and axial muscles and makes weaning from mechanical ventilation and recovery of normal respiratory function difficult. It can be associated with elevation of muscle enzymes， such as increased Creatine Kinase (CK)， which can assist in diagnosis， as occurred in the case reported. However， CK values within normal levels can be found in mild cases or at the beginning of muscle involvement and， therefore， should not exclude the diagnosis in the face of a strong clinical suspicion .\n\n【23】In the Electroneuromyography exam， changes such as the reduction of the amplitude and duration of the action potentials of the motor unit with early recruitment stand out， in which there may be， in some cases， fibrillations and positive acute waves. In nerve conduction studies， the result is usually normal， but there may be a reduction in the amplitude of the Compound Muscle Action Potential(CMAP) with prolonged duration， suggesting MDC .\n\n【24】Muscle biopsy shows signs of myopathy with loss of myosin， severe atrophy of type 2 fast-twitch fibers and loss of the myosin heavy chain. Findings such as accumulation of inflammatory cells， glycogen or lipids are not typical of MDC and indicate the need for investigation of differential diagnosis， such as immune-mediated inflammatory myopathies， dystrophic or metabolic myopathy .\n\n【25】The patient persistently refused to perform invasive exams， as he progressed with evident clinical improvement. Such complementary exams were not performed and a diagnosis was established based on clinical criteria：“Generalized weakness developing after the onset of a serious illness； diffuse weakness (affecting the proximal and distal muscles)， symmetrical， flabby and sparing cranial nerves； the sum of the MRC-SS score <48 points， more than once with an interval>24h； and other causes of weakness unrelated to serious illnesses have been ruled out.”\n\n【26】Conclusion\n\n【27】ICUAW canbring long-term consequences. It is important to pay attention to identify it， in the ICU environment， and provide early rehabilitation in order to minimize chronic dysfunctions，morbidity and disability.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 11:26:07", "endTime": "2024/09/24 11:26:17", "cost": 9.396}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:33", "update_time": "2024-09-23 19:26:16", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 19:26:06"}

Our patient had multiple vascular variants including azygos anterior cerebral artery， hypoplasia of the left A1 segment and， anterior communicating artery， aortic origin and， hypoplasia of the left vertebral artery with left main terminal branch Posterior Inferior Cerebellar Artery (PICA)， old occlusion of the amputated basilar artery at the top with collateral circulation by bilateral Anterior Inferior Cerebellar Artery (AICA) arteries and， via PICAS.\n\n【3】Discussion： The set of brain anatomical variants found in the anterior and posterior circulation and post-infarction changes via bilateral AICA and right PICA is rare in the literature， especially about the clinical presentation of the patient. Following the above， it is important to report this case due to the low prevalence of the set of anatomical variants described and the absence of similar cases described in the literature.\n\n【4】Keywords： Brain anatomical variants； Acigos artery； Brain infarction posterior circulation； Infarction basilar artery\n\n【5】Introduction\n\n【6】Anatomical variants in the central nervous system are frequent， especially in the Willis Polygon， which has a classic structure only in 20% to 25% of people . The variants can be classified as fenestrations， duplications， hypoplasia’s， agenesis， infundibular origins and， persistent communicating anomalous anastomosis .\n\n【7】These variants are mainly found incidentally but sometimes are associated with ischemic events that tend to differ from the classically described vascular territories， the most clinically relevant variants are： 1) Bilateral infarcts by anterior Azygos and， Percheron artery 2) Infarcts of Choroidal or Heubner's arteries and，3) Stem syndromes .\n\n【8】The objective of this article is to present multiple vascular anatomical variants documented in a patient who was admitted to our hospital with a right posterior cerebral artery infarction.\n\n【9】Case Presentation\n\n【10】A 56-year-old man with a history of migraine， without cardiovascular risk factors， presented with intense holocranial headache， stabbing type， sudden loss of left peripheral vision and， left upper limb paresthesia， subsequently decreased alertness with retrograde amnesia of the event. Neurological examination showed lower left quadrantanopsy and， hypoesthesia of the left upper limb，the initial head Computed Tomography (CT) was normal .\n\n【11】Later he presented an increase of the support polygon and， lateralization in gait to the left， the Contrast-enhanced Magnetic Resonance Image (C-MRI) revealed areas of restricted diffusion in the right thalamus， posterior horns of the lateral ventricle and， right occipital lobe， compatible with acute multiple brain infarction in the right Posterior Cerebral Artery (PCA) territory . Angiotomography was performed revealing a filling defect of the Basilar Artery (AB)， absence offlow within the PCA，hypoplasia of the pre-communicating portion (A1) of the left Anterior Cerebral Artery(ACA) and， in the intracranial portion (V4) of the left Vertebral Artery (VA).\n\n【12】Additionally， a subsequent pan-angiography confirmed the occlusion at the top of the basilar artery， absence of the Posterior Communicating Arteries (PCoA) without direct cortical irrigation， since this irrigation was given by an extensive network of vascular collateralization to the ischemic territory from the Anteroinferior Cerebellar Arteries (AICAs) and， the right Posterior inferior Cerebellar Artery (PICA). It also noted a hypoplastic left vertebral artery with its origin at the aortic arch， hypoplasia of the left A1 segment and， absence of anterior communicating artery， with azygos system from A2 but dependent on the right ACA . Capillary and venous phases with normal characteristics， dural sinuses with flow pattern and normal appearance. Malformations of the brain parenchyma were not observed.\n\n【13】In the controls by clinical neurology at 3， 10， 13 months post-infarction， he did not present subsequent neurological deficit， his return to work (mechanical technician of industrial machinery) and social was without difficulties. The control paraclinical tests at11 months were positive antinuclear antibodies 1：320 fine granular pattern， positive antinuclear antibodies 1：320 centrosome pattern. Control images (pan-angiography， Doppler of renal arteries) and rheumatology evaluation were requested； however， as of the date of this case report， the patient has not had them performed.\n\n【14】In resume， the most relevant findings were right azygos ACA， absence of left A1 and， A2 segments， hypoplastic left VA with an aortic origin， absent ACoPs and， finally AB with distal flow occlusion and， extensive collateralization by AICAs and， PICAs allowing the necessary irrigation to the posterior cerebral circulation. The combination of these anatomical variants is infrequent and， even more so with the clinical findings of the patient， we started dual antiplatelet therapy with a diagnosis of minor cerebrovascular attack. Post-discharge follow-up was performed， without neurological deterioration，left lower quadrantanopsia persisted. Other studies are summarized in Table 1.\n\n【15】Discussion\n\n【16】It is important to know the cerebral vascular anatomical variants； the presences of associated cerebral vascular anatomical infarcts or arterial variants do not usually follow the classically predetermined vascular territories . We will deepen those variants presented in oiir case.\n\n【17】Anterior circulation\n\n【18】ACA asymmetry is present in 80% of people . Azygos ACA is a rare vascular variant (0.3% to 4%) ， involves segment A2 forming a single trunk in the midline， the result of an embryological persistence of the median artery ofthe corpus callosum，radiologically is classified in 4 types ， is occasionally associated with aneurysms， holoprosencephaly， neuronal migration abnormalities and， its obstruction generates a bilateral frontal syndrome .\n\n【19】Hypoplasia of segment A1 is reported in 10% of autopsies and complete absence in 2% of angiograms . The posterior communicating arteries may be of fetal origin， an infundibular residue， hypoplastic or unilateral absence， other types of anomalies are infrequent or have not been described.\n\n【20】Other anomalies of this circulation， absent in our case， include fenestration of ACA (4% of people) . Duplication of the Middle Cerebral Artery (MCA) (0.2% to 2.9%)， and its fenestration in less than 1% in autopsies and 0.17% in angiography \n\n【21】Posterior circulation\n\n【22】Of all ischemic strokes， the posterior circulation represents 25%and stems 10% of cases . Vascular variants of the posterior circulation can involve the brainstem， occipital lobes，and cerebellum， the infarcts secondary to variants are rare . Additionally， 6% to10% of all strokes are initially Diffusion-Weighted Imaging (DWI) negative， with a false-negative rate for posterior circulation strokes almost 10 times higher than that of the anterior circulation .\n\n【23】The most relevant abnormalities of this circulation are those that affect VA with asymmetry (70%)， hypoplasia (26%) and fenestration(0.3% to 2.0%). PICA is absent unilaterally in 10% and bilateral in 2%. In 10% of people， this artery arises from the BA . The basilar variants more frequent are fenestration (0.3%to 0.6% ofangiograms)， anastomosis with Carotids (0.1%)，hypoplasia， and agenesis which are rare and almost non-existent .\n\n【24】The PCA has an absence of P1 in 10% of people， had identified four variants depending on its origin and， 15% identified fetal PCA from the Carotid Artery . Percheron artery infarcts can generate bi-thalamic compromise . This anatomical variant was absent in our presented clinical case.\n\n【25】Finally， It is also important to evaluate possible differential diagnoses with a genetic component such as Fabry， MELAS(Mitochondrial Encephalomyopathy， Lactic Acidosis，and，Stroke-like episodes)， CADASIL (Cerebral Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy with Subcortical Infarcts and， Leukoencephalopathy) and， similar. Evidence of these pathologies doesn’t exist in our patient.\n\n【26】Table 1： Additional paraclinical taken during hospitalization and controls at 3 10 and 13 months.\n\n| Admission paraclinics.  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Hemogram： Leukocytes： 5510， Neutrophils： 3310， Lymphocytes： 1350， Hemoglobin： 15.3， Hematocrit： 44.6%， Platelets： 262000.  |  |\n| BUN： 18.8， creatinine： 0.95  | TP： 28， TPT：11.06， INR： 1.01  |\n| Blood glucose： 92.7，Sodium： 139  | Normal Electrocardiogram and Echocardiogram  |\n|  | Paraclinics at 6 months  |\n| CRP： 0.5， Total Bilirubin： 0.78， Direct 0.23， indirect 0.55； CPR 80 ， blood glucose 76， urea nitrogen： 20， creatinine 0.94； potassium 4.13， anticardiolipin 1gM： negative， IgA： negative， lgG： negative； homocysteine 8.92 (normal)  |  |\n| Paraclinics at 11 months  |  |\n| Lupus anticoagulant Negative， extractable Nuclear Antigen (ANE) antibody profile： negative， antinuclear antibodies： Pasitive 1：320 fine granular pattern， antinuclear antibodies： positive 1：320 centrosome pattern.  |  |\n\n【28】antinuclear antibodies： positive 1：320 centrosome pattern.\n\n【29】Conclusion\n\n【30】We present a case with multiple brain anatomical variants and， radiological findings of infarction in the posterior territory， whose infrequency makes it a unique case， with clinical-radiological dissociation given the collateral circulation of the posterior territory with structural and， hemodynamic changes described.

Recently， the state of Andhra Pradesh Visakhapatnam saw the largest styrene gas leak into the atmosphere， which LG Polymer India Company Limited caused. The LG Polymers Company produces plastics， polyesters， synthetic rubber，latex paints， and coatings. This paper discusses the risks associated with a styrene gas leak occurrence.\n\n【2】Keywords： MIC； Benzene； Hazards； Styrene； Gas leakage；Polyesters\n\n【3】Introduction Methyl Isocyanate， or MIC\n\n【4】The most significant tragedy in India occurred a few years ago， on December 2， 1984， when workers at the Union Carbide facility in Bhopal， India， were exposed to methyl isocyanate gas. The eyes， respiratory system， and skin were a few of the major organs. Acute irritating effects on the eyes and respiratory system were significant results.\n\n【5】Methyl isocyanate is a white liquid with a strong scent. Its molecular weight is 57.1， soluble in water and methylamine， and it breaks down into carbon dioxide when heated to its boiling point of39°C . The skin， eyes and respiratory membranes become immediately irritated when the human body is exposed to this gas .\n\n【6】Effects on health\n\n【7】Respiratory poisoning the upper and lower respiratory tracts were affected by this gas exposure， with the respiratory tract being the most severely impacted. The most common symptoms were coughing， a sense of suffocation and chest discomfort， dyspnea， irritation of the throat， and rhinorrhea .\n\n【8】Carcinogenicity of MIC\n\n【9】Ennever et al.  described the battery selection technique and carcinogen prediction methods to determine the MIC carcinogenicity. According to the results of several in vitro and in vivo investigations， the MIC gas had a 76% risk of being a genotoxic carcinogen， according to the studys authors. Negative assays in that test showed high specificity and low sensitivity， whereas positive assays had low specificity and high sensitivity. It suggests a mild to moderate carcinogenicity. Finally， the authors concluded that the MIC in this situation was an animal carcinogen due to its low potency. In a different research， an examination of the population-based cancer registry in Bhopal identified a relative risk of lung， buccal cavity， and oropharyngeal cancers. Because of tobacco usage， the ICMR Cancer Institute observed increased lung cancer rates and impacted parts of the tongue， mouth， and esophagus. Finally， the living style and other biological characteristics may lessen the danger of MIC exposure， according to research by the Jawaharlal Nehru Cancer Hospital and Research Center (JNCHRC) conducted in Bhopal. MIC has not been designated as a carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) or the US Environmental Protection Agency .\n\n【10】Styrene Monomer\n\n【11】On May 7h， 2020， a new natural gas leak using styrene occurred in Vizag. Numerous individuals were affected， and 12 people died. This gas influences thousands of individuals within a 5-kilometer radius . One of the most significant monomers in the contemporary petrochemical sector is styrene. In the year 1930， it was created. The most significant polymeric compounds made using styrene are polystyrene， styrene-acrylonitrile， and others. Styrene is mainly manufactured in the industry by dehydrogenating the ethylbenzene method. Styrene is a gaseous， liquid substance with no color and a strong smell. Styrene， sometimes referred to as vinyl benzene， is a crucial industrial chemical molecule utilized in producing a wide range of industrial resins， incuding polystyrene and hundreds of copolymers. One of the most significant monomers in the contemporary petrochemical sector is styrene. In the year1930， it was created. Most polymeric compounds produced with styrene include polystyrene，styrene-acrylonitrile，and others. Styrene is mainly manufactured in the industry by the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene.\n\n【12】Styrene is a gaseous， liquid substance with no color and a strong smell. Styrene was initially identified in 1831 as a Storax balsam distillation byproduct . Its molecular mass is 104.15， and its chemical formula is CH.CH=CH，. Water， ethanol， Benzene， and petroleum ether have a small amount of solubility in styrene. A substance having a high boiling point is styrene. The organic molecule styrene has the chemical formula C H. It is kept as a liquid in industries， but as it readily evaporates， it must be kept at low temperatures. One of the most significant monomers in the contemporary petrochemical sector is styrene. Polystyrene， styrene-acrylonitrile， and acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene are the three most significant polymeric compounds produced primarily from styrene(ABS). Styrene can be found in consumer goods， including drinking cups，insulation forwiring and appliances， fiberglass， plastic pipes，and vehicle parts. Styrene from the Hazards gas was recently discovered to have spilled in Vizag on May 7h， 2020. Numerous individuals were affected， and 12 people died. This gas influences thousands of people within a 5-kilometer radius .\n\n【13】Preparation of styrene\n\n【14】From Ethvl Benzene： Most styrene monomer is made from ethyl benzene ， and virtually all ethyl benzene generated globally is used to make styrene. Because ofthis， the two processes are frequently quite interwoven. A Friedel-Crafts reaction between Benzene and ethylene produces ethylbenzene. Originally， this process employed aluminum chloride as a catalyst， but in contemporary manufacture， zeolite has taken its place.\n\n【15】Bydehydrogenation： Total styrene producedby the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene is 80%. Using superheated steam and over an iron (III) oxide catalyst .\n\n【16】Finally， the crude product of ethylbenzene is purified by the distillation method. The differences in the boiling point between the two compounds were only 90°C at ambient pressure use of a series of distillation columns. It is complicated by the tendency of monomers to undergo thermally induced into polystyrene .\n\n【17】Synthesis of polystyrene\n\n【18】The polymerization of the styrene monomer creates polystyrene during its production. Styrene can be polymerized via free radical， anionic， and cationic reactions， as well as employing metal catalysts in this process.\n\n【19】Industrial gas leakage： Aswe consider the LG Polymers accident in Vizag， memories of the Bhopal Gas Leak Disaster of 1984immediately emerge. The same disregard for human life， the same disregard for conventional operating protocols， and the same absence of emergency measures. Recently， a gas leak was discovered in Vishakhapatnam， Andhra Pradesh. Numerous hazardous industries are located in the port city of Vizag， also known as Vishakhapatnam， which is found in the state of Andhra Pradesh on the southeast coast of India. The alarming news of a toxic chemical leak from a plant producing polystyrene-based products located about 15 km awayon the outskirts of the city at a private plastic manufacturing plant owned by LG Polymers Pvt. Ltd. rudely awakened five million residents of the Vizag Metropolitan Region on May 7t， 2020， early in the morning. The styrene gas leak in Vishakhapatnam resulted in severe dyspnea. Up to this point， roughly 12 persons and 32 animals have perished from being exposed to deadly styrene vapors that escaped from the factory . Over 800 of the estimated 1000+ victims of injuries who resided in nearby communities within a six-kilometer radius had to be hospitalized. A further 4，000 people were able to leave the area unharmed after being alerted to evacuate in time by a few volunteers. Nearly 10，000 more locals were compelled to flee their houses in a panic 14.\n\n【20】The death toll might have been far worse if the extremely combustible styrene vapors caught fire and the massive amount of styrene monomer housed in the plant's two giant tanks had been released. Most people living in the Vizag Metropolitan region are fortunate to have escaped the most recent calamity unhurt because， miraculously， that did not occur. Although styrene is much less toxic than MIC (Methyl-Iso-Cyanate)， the chemical that had caused the Bhopal disaster in 1984， the enormous amount of styrene that had been stored at the plant at the time of the disaster (reportedly about7，000 kiloliters compared to the 80 kiloliters of MIC at Bhopal) did have the potential to cause a massive disaster in the Vizag region that would have had much worse (Fortunately， the remaining styrene monomer in the concerned tank has been deactivated， and on May11h，2020， 5，000 kiloliters from the plant's unaffected tanks was sent back to Seoul.) Styrene is invisible， heavier than air， and very combustible. The Threshold Limit Value (TLV) for styrene， as defined by the safety guidelines established by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH)， is 20 pp， TWA (Time Tested Average) for an exposure duration of eight hours. The Short-Term Exposure Level (STEL) for styrene for fifteen minutes is 40 ppm[by comparison， the TLV of MIC is 0.02 ppm] (parts per million). While the Immediately Dangerous to Life or Health (IDLH) dose of styrene is around 700 ppm， according to the National Institute for Occupational Safety & Health (NIOSH)，USA . Styrene mayenter the body of a human by breathing， ingesting food， and skin contact. Styrene takes a few days to degrade into other compounds and pass through urine after entering the human body. Styrene impacts the stomach and eyes when it is introduced to people. Long-term impacts include central nervous system dysfunction， depression， hearing loss， and peripheral neuropathy. If exposed to styrene gas for extended periods， they risk leukemia and headaches. Styrene exposure at work has been the subject of studies， although those results have not been definitive. The United States Environmental Protection Agency has proved styrene to have low to moderate toxicity by inhalation and oral exposure in experiments， including acute exposure of rats and mice. In animal studies， styrene exposure by inhalation has been linked to effects on the neurological system， liver， kidneys， and nose discomfort. Animals exposed to chromium orally affect their liver， blood， kidneys， and stomach.\n\n【21】Exposure to styrene gas\n\n【22】Chronic low-level exposure to styrene may cause cancer. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) states that short-term exposure to low levels of styrene in humans can have gastrointestinal symptoms as well as mucous membrane and ocular irritation. On the other hand， prolonged exposure impacts the central nervous system， resulting inheadaches， weakness， exhaustion， hearing loss， nerve damage， and depression. Exposure to it can result in shortness of breath， respiratory issues， eye irritation， indigestion， and nausea， momentary loss of consciousness， unsteady walking， and giddiness. When styrene vapor is inhaled in large amounts， it irritates the skin， eyes， and lungs and makes breathing difficult. However， these disorders may worsen in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) patients and respiratory illnesses， including asthma. Exposure to styrene gas primarily affects mucosal membranes. Compared to other organic compounds， styrene takes longer to enter the blood from the lungs. According to studies， 86% of styrene that enters the body is eliminated through urine.\n\n【23】The styrene leaked in what way?\n\n【24】Humans can have gastrointestinal symptoms，mucous membrane irritation， and ocular discomfort after short-term exposure to low amounts of styrene. Styrene cannot seep into the air unless high-temperature， such as a fire or an explosion. From an LG Chem Polymers storage tank， styrene gas spilled. The plant opened its doors in 1961. In the beginning， Hindustan Polymers produced polystyrene. In 1978， it amalgamated with McDowell & Co of the UB Group， and in 1997， South Korean company LG Chem acquired and renamed it LG Polymers. Expandable polystyrene， general-purpose polystyrene， high-impact polystyrene， and engineering plastics compounds are all produced at the business. It is situated 15 kilometers outside Visakhapatnam city at RRV Puram in Gopalapatnam. A corporate representative stated that a tank with a capacity of 2，400 tones was holding 1，800 tones of styrene. The gas escaped from this tank when authorities were getting ready to reopen the plant that had been shut down for 44 days owing to the lockout. Before it could be contained， around half of the gas spilled. There are significant environmental and occupational exposures to Benzene since it has been measured in all areas of the environment and is often released in severalindustrial and transportation contexts. The most frequent exposure route is inhalation， although Benzene can contaminate food and water， quickly permeate the skin， and cause cutaneous and gastrointestinal exposures. This incident in Visakhapatnam is connected to elevated levels of Benzene and had a positive outcome.\n\n【25】Styrene monomer applications\n\n【26】One of the most significant monomers for industrial polymers and co-polymers， which are employed in many applications， is styrene. Plastics， latex paints and coatings， synthetic rubbers， and polyesters are the main uses for styrene monomer . The most common use of resins containing styrene monomer is in foams used as fillers and bolsters. Additionally， pipes， fittings， tanks， lighting fixtures， and corrosion-resistant items have applications in the construction industry. Artificial marble， flooring， throwaway dinnerware， and furniture made of plastic are examples of household items. Applications for transportation materials include car body putty， reinforced plastics， and tires. The vast majority of styrene is transformed into polystyrene resins， which may be easily molded and compatible with various colorants， modifiers， and fillers. The second-largest families of Styrene-Acrylonitrile (SAN) resins， co- polymers， and adducts are used in various moldings for appliances， automobiles， buildings， pipelines， and electronics .\n\n【27】Causes of stvrene\n\n【28】Styrene causes include a recent gas leak in Vishakhapatnam， Andhra Pradesh. In the wee hours of July 54， 2020， a leak occurred at a privately held plastic manufacturing facility operated by LG polymers Pvt. Ltd. Styrene or vinyl benzene was used to confirm the gas. It is employed in the manufacture of resins and polymers made of polystyrene. These materials are used in food packaging， rubber， plastic， etc. PVC gas is another name for it. It can enter a person's body by inhaling， eating， or skin-to-skin contact. Styrene takes a few days to degrade into other compounds and pass through urine after entering the human body. Styrene impacts the stomach and eyes when it is introduced to people. Long-term impacts include central nervous system dysfunction， depression， hearing loss， and peripheral neuropathy.\n\n【29】Styrene carcinogenicity： According to the National Toxicology Programs (NTP) to the human studies， which are based on the 2，009exposure of employees to these gases， there is only minimal evidence that styrene monomer causes cancer in people . The likelihood of developing esophageal and pancreatic cancer among these exposed monomers is also elevated； as is mortality from cancer of the lymphohematopoietic system and genetic damage in lymphocytes due to DNA adduct levels . Styrene exposure and cancer in humans are linked， however， by the discovery of DNA adducts and chromosomal abnormalities in lymphocytes from the exposed individuals.\n\n【30】Applications of polystyrene\n\n【31】In addition to being used for packing， polystyrene is used to make furniture，refrigerators， and other toys. Furthermore， the co-polymers of ABS and SAN are primarily utilized in transportation， watercraft， and the medical industry. The principal application for polystyrene foam is an insulating material for heat-sensitive goods.\n\n【32】Benzene\n\n【33】Colorless and combustible， Benzene has a lovely smell. When exposed to air， it swiftly evaporates. It serves primarily as a rav material for producing other chemicals， including plastics， rubber， dyes， medicines， lubricants， and insecticides. Additionally， it was frequently employed as an industrial solvent. Along with gasoline， cigarettes， and crude oil， Benzene is a naturally occurring component of all three.\n\n【34】Exposure locations\n\n【35】This viewpoint mentions a few locations， including the rubber industry， oil refineries， chemical factories， and gasoline-related businesses.\n\n【36】Health effects\n\n【37】This substance has the potential to be hazardous. These impacts are listed below if exposure to it can have immediate and long-term adverse health effects.\n\n【38】Short-term consequences\n\n【39】Dizziness， headaches， tremors， disorientation， and unconsciousness are short-term side effects. The neurological system can be impacted by benzene inhalation at significant concentrations. High doses of Benzene can make you throw up， make your stomach hurt， make you sleepy， and make your heart beat quickly. However， eating or breathing very high levels of Benzene can be fatal. Benzene usuallyirritates the skin， eyes，and throat when exposed to it. Redness on the skin might happen after exposure to Benzene.\n\n【40】Long-term consequences\n\n【41】The soft inside of bones， called the bone marrow， is where new blood cells are primarily harmed by exposure to Benzene. One possible outcome is anemia (which can cause a person to feel weak and tired.) Low platelet count 2. (Which can lead to excess bruising and bleeding). 3. Alow white blood cell count， potentially fatal， might make the body less able to fight infections.\n\n【42】Carcinogenicity of benzene\n\n【43】International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC)： Benzene is carcinogenic. It belongs to the WHO. Based on adequate evidence that Benzene causes Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)， Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia (ALL)， Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia(CLL)， and multiple myeloma， the IARC has classified Benzene as carcinogenic to humans.\n\n【44】The National Toxicology Program (NTP) has also designated Benzene as a substance known to cause human cancer.\n\n【45】The Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS)， a database with information on the effects of exposure to numerous environmental contaminants on human health， is maintainedby thLeeUS Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The EPA lists Benzene as a recognized human carcinogen .\n\n【46】Conclusion\n\n【47】The authors concluded by stating that all of these natural gas exposures have a negative impact on human health and， in some situations， result in fatalities. These chemical compounds were released into indoor air due to cigarette smoking and emissions from various home items. They are highly significant chemicals utilized in manufacturing a wide range of polymers， copolymers， and glass-reinforced plastics. There is also a chance of being exposed to small amounts of food. Many people were sick， and some died due to the toxic gas leak that occurred in Bhopal and Vizag. It might spread across the natural world and contaminate the air， water， animals，and even people. Therefore， we should take care of our future and defend ourselves against such risks of tragedies.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 10:45:31", "endTime": "2024/09/24 10:45:53", "cost": 21.285}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:33", "update_time": "2024-09-23 18:45:53", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 18:45:31"}

Anti-PD-1，anti-PD-L1 and anti CTLA-4 are some of the ICI agents that have been used， they act inhibiting the modulation of the response mediated by T cell lymphocytes， resulting in a better prognosis for patients with lung cancer in terms of progression free survival and overall survival in advanced disease. On the heels of the success obtained in the treatment of advanced disease， there is an attempt now to translate those benefits to the early and locally advanced stages either as adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy .\n\n【2】One more of the current challenges are the preoperative evaluation， requiring an experienced multidisciplinary team in a tertiary care environment to select ideal candidates for neoadjuvant therapy. At this time we don't have solid data in terms of ideal timing for surgery after neoadjuvant therapy， rates of recurrence， need for adjuvant therapy and if so， if this therapy should be with ICI or not. Moreover， it’s necessary to design markers and other tools that allow selecting the ideal candidates for this treatment strategy .\n\n【3】There are currently significant challenges for the recommendation of neoadjuvant immunotherapy. Among them are the selection of the agent， dose， treatment schedule， length of therapy and the decision， posterior to the surgical treatment， to continue it or not as adjuvant treatment. Surgery continues to be initially the standard of treatment whenever possible. Results obtained from clinical essays where a single drug immunotherapy was used in the context of neoadjuvant treatment have failed to show a clear benefit with such strategy； however， in the last few years several studies have been developed with combination therapy with promising results. The NADIM Phase II trial included 46 patients with stage IIIA lung cancer achieved a Major Pathological Response (MPR)， which is defined as <10% residual viable tumor after neoadjuvant chemotherapy， in 85% of the patients and a Pathological Complete Response (pCR) in 71.4% of patients， using a treatment schedule conformed by Nivolumab+Carboplatin+Nab-Paclitaxel .\n\n【4】A trial by Shu et al.  of only 18 patients with stage IB-IIIA used Atezolizumab+Nab-Paclitaxel+Carboplatin as neoadjuvant therapy achieving a RPM of 50% and a pCR of 21% ， and the NEOSTAR trial which included 44 patients in clinical stage I-IIIA reported RPM of 33.3% and pCR of 29% with the combination of Nivolumab+Ipilimumab .\n\n【5】Finally， in some of the abovementioned trials， one of the most utilized endpoints to assess the efficacy of the treatment has been the Major Pathological Response (MPR). Having a surrogate for survival， such as pathologic response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy， has the potential to improve the efficiency of trials and expedite advances .\n\n【6】Clinical Case\n\n【7】Patient is a 63 years old female with a diagnosis of Adenosquamous carcinoma of the right lung T4N1M0， clinical stage IIIB， potentially resectable， what was started on neo-adjuvant chemotherapy with 2 cycles of Atezolizumab1200 mgs. IV D1+Chemotherapy with Carboplatin 400 mg. IV D1， Paclitaxel 270 mg. IV D1 every 21 days， subsequently underwent right lower lobectomy without evidence of lymphatic or vascular invasion， the residual viable tumor was estimated at 20%， mediastinal lymphadenectomy of stations 4R ， 10 and 11R were negative， the previously reported N1 became negative in the pathology sample. Postsurgical result was pT4N0M0 Stage IIIA.\n\n【8】The histopathological study identified a residual tumor with a solid pattern， surrounded by a tumor regression area that corresponds to 20% of the viable residual tumor that is classified as partial pathological response. In the tumor regression area， typical morphological findings were found in response to immunotherapy related to tissue repair (proliferative fibrosis and neovascularization)， celldeath (cholesterol crystals and foamy macrophages) )and activation of the immune system (tertiary lymphoid structures and peri and intratumoral lymphoplasmacytic infiltration).\n\n【9】After surgery， the patient only received 1 cycle of adjuvant chemotherapy with Carboplatin， Paclitaxel and Atezolizumab due to the risk of the COVID-19 pandemic. Currently the patient is under surveillance， with good performance， last tomography did not show tumor activity with a recurrence-free interval of 9 months .\n\n【10】Discussion\n\n【11】Considering a previous outlook， there are 2 Phase II clinical trials in which neoadjuvant immunotherapy was used in resectable clinical stages with promising results. The main current challenge in the neoadjuvant treatment is the progression of the disease due to a delay in the surgical treatment. Nonetheless， there are some early studies with Nivolumab as immune， single agent， PD-L1 neoadjuvant therapy that showed that 45% of the patients had a Major Pathological Response (MPR) and that 15% of them had a Complete Pathological Response (pCR). Neoadjuvant therapy with Atezolizumab showed that 19% of patients had a MPR and 5% achieved a pCR7.\n\n【12】In particular， previous studies of neoadjuvant chemotherapy showed that the partial pathological response is more likely to occur in patients with squamous cell lung cancers (26%) than those with adenocarcinomas (12%)， possibly due to an increased response to necrosis in squamous cell carcinomas .\n\n【13】We still lack more robust Phase III studies to really assess the impact of partial response versus complete response in the primary tumor， likewise we need to know if negativization of the lymph nodes has an effect on disease free survival and if the neoadiuvant treatment with immune agents has a sustained impact in the elimination of distant micro metastasis and relevance on the Overall Survival (OS) and on Recurrence Free Survival (RFS) .\n\n【14】In our case， the patient had a MPR of 80% with a residual viable tumor of 20% without any lymphatic or vascular infiltration and without lymph node involvement according to the pathology report and although adenosquamous lung cancers are infrequent the immune activity of the therapy was significant with an 80% fibro-inflammatory stroma reported by pathology.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 10:25:06", "endTime": "2024/09/24 10:26:22", "cost": 76.274}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:33", "update_time": "2024-09-23 18:26:20", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 18:25:03"}

AIHA is a severe hematological manifestation ofCMV infection. AIHA is an erythrocyte (RBC) hematologic disorder that is rarely seen in infants and young children. Most cases are associated with viral or bacterial infection， but the immunologic events leading to hemolysis are poorly understood. We report two cases of infants who presented with severe anemia and CMV infection. The first infant had chronic refractory mixed AIHA and the second infant had anemia directly attributable to CMV infection.\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection presenting as severe anemia in infancy is rare. Auto-Immune Hemolytic Anemia (AIHA) is characterized by the presence of auto antibodies that bind to RBC membranes and lead to their premature destruction. It can be classified as primary or secondary AIHA. The latter is due to lymphoproliferative and autoimmune diseases， drugs， and severe injuries. Bacteria and viruses can be associated with AIHA in children . Amongst its various hematological manifestations， Cytomegalovirus (CMV) can cause transient neutropenia with thrombocytopenia or more severe， such as AIHA and pancytopenia. We report two cases of infants who presented with severe anemia， thrombocytopenia， and CMV infection. The first infant had chronic refractory mixed AIHA and the second infant had severe anemia and thrombocytopenia directly attributable to CMV infection.\n\n【4】Case Series\n\n【5】Case 1\n\n【6】A six-month-old male child born out of third-degree consanguineous marriage presented with new onset progressive paleness of the body and worsening respiratory difficulty in the last 20 days. He received 7 aliquots of packed RBC every 2 to 3 days in the past 20 days and was started on syrup prednisolone at 2 mg/kg/day with no response. His physical examination was remarkable for severe tachypnea (54/min)， tachycardia (166/min)， pallor， icterus with moderate hepatosplenomegaly. CBC at admission showed severe anemia with thrombocytopenia with a hemoglobin of 3.1 g/dl with a platelet count of 43，000/uL. The corrected total leukocyte count was 18，600/uL with 30%neutrophils， 68% lymphocytes， and 2% myelocytes and metamyelocytes each. Peripheral smear showed numerous spherocytes with reticulocytosis of 23%. There was indirect hyperbilirubinemia， LDH was 2150 U/L and Direct Coombs Test (DCT) was strongly positive (4+). DCT positivity was due to IgG (titer ≥ 1000) of subclasses IgG1 (titer >100) & IgG3 (titer >100) coating the red cells along with C3d， a very weak coating with IgM was also seen. A diagnosis of AIHA was made. Serologic and virologic testing revealed CMV IgM and CMV IgG positive. CMV PCR blood and urine showed 200 copies and 2120 copies， respectively. Flow cytometry for double negative TCRaB+T cells was negative.\n\n【7】He was started on intravenous ganciclovir (dose calculated as 3 x BSAx Creatinine clearance) daily for 10 days. He also received IVIg at 1g/kg daily for 2 doses with methylprednisolone at 2 mg/kg for 3 days followed byprednisone at 2 mg/kg for 2 weeks followed by a slow taper of 0.25 mg/kg/week. At discharge he was shifted to Valganciclovir. His hemolysis continued with persistent requirement of blood transfusion. He had a poor response to steroids and was started on weekly rituximab at375 mg/m. Peripheral blood PCR for CMV DNA came negative after 3 weeks of valganciclovir. His hemoglobin stabilized at 10.8 g/dl， platelet count normalized， LDH was 568 U/， and bilirubin was 0.8 mg/dl after 3 weeks of rituximab.Steroids were slowlytapered and stopped as he was in complete remission. He relapsed after 2 months of stopping steroids and 6 months after rituximab therapy. He was restarted on steroids followed by mycophenolate mofetil at a dose of400 mg/m’as the steroid sparing agent. He started responding within1 month and the steroids were tapered slowly and stopped. At his last visit to the OPD in June 2021，he was 1 year and 8 months of age， his parameters were- hemoglobin 14 g/dl， LDH 368U/L， bilirubin 0.53mg/dl.MMF is planned to be tapered slowly .\n\n【8】Case 2\n\n【9】A five-month-old male child was symptomatic from 2 months of age with pallor， decreased activity with decreased feeding. There was no history of fever， jaundice， or any bleeding. He had received 4 PRBC transfusions in the past 2 months. On examination he had pallor with moderate hepatosplenomegaly. Blood investigations revealed hemoglobin of 3.9 g/dl， normal total leukocyte count of 17100/uL， platelet count of 23，000/uL， and absolute reticulocyte count 45，000/uL. His serum bilirubin was 2.3 mg/dl， with indirect bilirubin 1.3 mg/dl， LDH was 590 U/L. DCT was negative. A bone marrow biopsy was done and revealed marked erythroid hyperplasia with unremarkable megakaryocytes and myeloid cells.\n\n【10】Presence of anemia with hepatosplenomegaly with hepatitis with marked erythroid hyperplasia in bone marrow， differential of thalassemia； CDA and infection related (TORCH) was kept. TORCH profile was positive for CMV IgM and IgG antibodies. CMV PCR revealed 2130 copies/uL. A diagnosis of CMV infection causing recurrent anemia was made. He was started on ganciclovir and received it for 18 days. He became transfusion independent and his liver and spleen regressed on ganciclovir.\n\n【11】Discussion\n\n【12】In this case series， we report two infants both with CMV infection with severe anemia， thrombocytopenia， and moderate hepatosplenomegaly. The cause of anemia in case 1 was mixed autoimmune hemolytic anemia and on the other hand， the cause of anemia in case 2 was attributed directly to CMV infection. In both these cases， thrombocytopenia improved with treatment of CMV infection. The mixed AIHA in case 1 was steroid refractory and required rituximab as secondarytreatment， further during the course， relapsed and required steroid sparing immunosuppressive therapy(mycophenolate mofetil). We would be discussing case 1 in detail.\n\n【13】Heisel et al.  evaluated prognostic factors in childhood AIHA and concluded that there are two distinct varieties of AIHA in children， the acute disease generally occurred in 2 to 12 years of age， had a sudden onset of symptoms， showed low reticulocyte counts and had normal platelet counts. This acute disease variety responded well to steroids and the disease resolved within 6 months without mortality. On the other hand， children with chronic AIHA were generally less than 2 or greater than 12 years of age， had a more prolonged onset of symptoms， had increased reticulocyte counts， and had decreased platelet counts. These children with the chronic variety had a variable response to steroids， frequently requiring other modalities of treatment and had a mortality of 25%. It also seems to be the scenario as in case number 1，he had a poor response to steroids and relapsed 6 months after Rituximab， warranting maintenance of second line steroid sparing immunosuppressive therapy.\n\n【14】Literature was reviewed regarding CMV as the cause of AIHA in children. In the largest series of pediatric AIHA patients， Aladjidi et al. ， we evaluated 265 children with AIHA and reported 6 patients with Cytomegalovirus as the causative agent for AIHA. Naithani et al. ， reported 26 patients (range， 0.2 to 17 years) with AIHA. Secondary AIHA was seen in 9 (35%)patients， with only 1 patient with CMV as the etiology. Thatikonda et al. ， in their study evaluating50 childhood AIHA patients， CMV was the causative etiology in 1patient only. In a study by Fan et al. ，7 patients out of 68 cases were EBV/CMV positive. Few case reports of CMV with AIHA are reported . All these studies suggest that CMV is a rare cause of AIHA in children. Comparing with adults， Rafailidis et al. ， we performed a systematic review of 290 immunocompetent patients with severe CMV infection， 25 patients were found to have various hematological manifestations among them only five were found to have hemolytic anemia， so AIHA secondary to CMV infection is a rare event in adults.\n\n【15】Efficacy of Rituximab in steroid refractory AIHA in children has been reported in small case series. Zecca et al. ， reported data of fifteen children (range， 0.3 to 14 years) with AIHA who were given rituximab， 375 mg/m²/dose for a median of 3 weekly doses. Three responders relapsed at 7， 8 and 10 months after rituximab infusion. Quartier et al.  reported five children with refractory idiopathic AIHA who received rituximab. All children remained in complete remission for 15 to 22 months after receiving rituximab. In adult patients， the median duration of response after Rituximab is 20 months. In our case number 1， the infant started responding to rituximab after the 3 weekly dose but relapsed after 6 months. Rituximab use is associated with absence of circulating B cells and hypogammaglobulinemia，which have implications for vaccineefficacy especially in infants. Ideally inactivated vaccines should be completed at least 1 week prior， and any live-attenuated vaccines should be completed a minimum of 4 weeks prior to commencing treatment. Due to lack of immune cell function， all future immunizations should be withheld whilst on rituximab. Post the completion of rituximab therapy， immunoglobulin and B-cell levels should be checked every 3months. Once both levels have returned to normal AND 26 months post treatment has lapsed (whichever is later)， immunization with both inactivated and live-attenuated vaccines can recommence .\n\n【16】According to the guidelinesfromAIEOP for second-linetreatment nwarm AIHA pediatric patients ， second-line treatment options for steroid dependence on a dose of prednisone ≥ 0.1 mg/kg/day to 0.2 mg/kg/day， include rituximab， immunosuppressive drugs， splenectomy， alemtuzumab and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Immunosuppressive drugs， with the exception of cyclophosphamide， are an appropriate second-line treatment， as they can be used as steroid-protective drugs in steroid-dependent patients. Given that these drugs require a long time to elicit a response， in fact， they should be infused early with the help of powerful drugs， such as steroids. Mycophenolate mofetil， a potent inhibitor of the enzyme containing 5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase， is the most widely indicated in steroid-dependent patients to reduce the dose of steroids. Panigrahi et al.  reported in 3 pediatric AIHA patients that MMF appears to be an effective and well-tolerated adjunct immunosuppressant that allows for rapid weaning of steroid usage， minimal adverse side effects to the patients， and long-term stabilization ofcounts. Therefore，this novel combination therapy may be an excellent alternative for the treatment of persistent or chronic autoimmune cytopenia's in the pediatric population. In our patient， MMF with steroids was started and the patient achieved complete response on MMF and steroids could be tapered. He tolerated MMF and had no side effects and remains in complete remission.\n\n【17】Conclusion\n\n【18】CMV infection should be considered when evaluating patients with severe anemia and thrombocytopenia. AIHA may be primary or secondary to other diseases， including infections， autoimmune disorders， and malignancies. The mixed AIHA in our case was secondary to CMV infection. It was steroid refractory and relapsed after 6 months of rituximab therapy and received MMF as the steroid sparing immunosuppressive therapy. The patient had no side effects to MMF. MMF may be an excellent alternative for the treatment of chronic AIHA in pediatric patients. Vaccination should be carefully planned in children， especially infants receiving rituximab.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 10:16:20", "endTime": "2024/09/24 10:16:34", "cost": 13.404}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:33", "update_time": "2024-09-23 18:16:34", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 18:16:20"}

Genotyping is an essential tool to predict the outcome of better treatment and control of this infection. 50 samples from patients with HCV infection within the ages from 20 to65 years were collected. HCV Ab ELISA kit was used for the detection of virus in the samples which tested 43 patients HCV RNA positive. Maximum viral load detected in patients was 9.4×10IU/mL and the minimum quantity of viral load was 1.2×105 IU/mL. The major mode of transmission of virus which caused hepatitis in patients included unsafe blood transfusion， use of unsterile needles and dental instrument. In our study 37 patients were detected with 3a genotype， 2 with 1a genotype and genotype of 4 patients was untypable. Further analysis of these patients’ genotype by Real-Time PCR revealed that they were also infected by 3a genotype. Overall assessment showed that genotype 3a is the most prevalent genotype affecting 95% patients followed by 1a. Only males were infected by genotype 1a due to travelling to neighbor countries. Comparative analysis on genotyping methodologies suggests that Real-Time PCR has advantage over traditional PCR. Conventional PCR is less effective method because of its poor resolution，less sensitivity and risk of contamination. It is time consuming process and yield results at the end point of reaction. In contrast， Real-Time PCR has enhanced rapidity， reproducibility， sensitivity and the reduced risk of contamination. In addition， it can resolve 95% of HCV genotypes and can provide data at exponential growth phase of the reaction.\n\n【2】Keywords： Hepatitis C virus； HCV-RNA； Genotyping； Real-Time PCR\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Viral hepatitis is one of leading killers across the globe since 1989. Hepatitis C virus is a blood borne virus and mainly affects the function ofliver causingacute or chronicliver diseases . Patients developing cirrhosis have high risk of HCC (1% to 4% per year) prompting liver transplantation. HCV is considered second most common cause of viral hepatitis . On the basis of Phylogenetic analysis of nucleotide sequences， multiple genotypes and subtypes of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) have been recognized . Common subtypes that cause disease are la， 1b， 2a，2b，3a，3b，4，5a，6a.\n\n【5】WHO reported that globally 3.3% people are HCV infected and causes 700，000 deaths annually? The prevalence of HCV varies by region. HCV prevalence is lower (<2%) in regions of Western Europe， the Americas and Australia. Areas of African and the eastern Mediterranean have highest percentage of HCV prevalence . Country with the highest prevalence of HCV in the world is Egypt， having more than 14% infected people . Estimates show that prevalence in Asia is about2% but it differs greatly between individual countries . As Mongolia shows the highest HCV prevalence which is above 10%， Uzbekistan and Pakistan are next having 6% of total population infected with HCV . Data on the HCV prevalence in Pakistan shows that it is highly endemic， infecting almost 6.8% population of the country. Most common HCV genotype is 3a which continues to infect almost 61.3% people in Pakistan. However， recently the frequency of subtype2a has increased in few areas of Pakistan. Subtype 2a was most common in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa infecting 17.3% population and in Sindh provinces infecting 11.3% of the total population .\n\n【6】Incredible advancement has been made over the previous years in explaining the structure and function of the Hepatitis C Infection (HCV) proteins， a large portion of which are currently effectively being sought after as antiviral targets. Discovered in 1989 ， HCV is a small enveloped virus with approximately 10 kb long plus-sense， single stranded RNA genome. It belongs to the Hepacivirus genera of Flaviviridae family . Hepatitis C contains one long Open Reading Frame(ORF) which encodes for a non-functional polyprotein of approximately 3，000 to 3，010 amino acids. This non-functional polyprotein is cleaved by signal peptidase， cellular and viral encoded proteases to yield at least 10 different viral protein products. Structural proteins which forms the viral particle， are encoded in the 5'N-terminal part of ORF and include C，E1，E2and P7， whereas the non-structural proteins are encoded in the 3part of the ORF in the order NS2， NS3，NS4A， NS4B， NS5A， NS5B. HCV enters the cells through endocytosis after binding to particular receptors. The viral genome is translated into a precursor polyprotein subsequent to uncoating， and viral RNA is incorporated by a virus encoded polymerase complex. Newly synthesized viral particles are discharged into endoplasmic reticulum and are secreted from cell passing through Golgi apparatus . Epidemiological studies revealed that the spread of HCV in Pakistan is through different modes of transmission which include blood transfusion， sexual activity， and intravenous drug abuse， unsafe use of needles， non-sterile dental instruments and hemodialysis . HCV also spreads through non-sexual household contacts， ear piercing， tattoos， and use of community barber shops .\n\n【7】Medical and public health literature in detail on the prevalence of HCV in Pakistan has been reviewed by scientists for long period. In order to decrease burden of HCV in Pakistan awareness programs are required targeting rural areas. Different genotypes of HCV have specific drug sensitivity according to which the therapy is recommended .\n\n【8】There is currently no licensed vaccine for HCV， which is a worldwide health issue， recently infecting 3 to 4 million people annually. In present HCV vaccine approaches include peptide， plasmid DNA， recombinant proteins and vector-based vaccines. HCV treatment is based on pegylated-Interferon-a (IFNa) and the nucleoside analogue ribavirin， which is expensive， toxic， prolonged(24 to 48 weeks) and leads to a Sustained Virological Response (SVR) in only 50% to 60% of patients， depending on the infecting genotype.\n\n【9】The aim ofour study was to evaluate and comparetheperformance features of two currently available HCV RNA quantification procedures including Real-time PCR based assays and conventional PCR based assays. Real-Time PCR methods are sensitive with lower limits of detection/quantification on the order of 10 to 15 HCV RNA International Units (IU)/ml， and are not prone to carryover contamination. It is done to identify the genotypes circulating in Pakistan and to determine the suitability of the HCV genomic region for routine determination of HCV genotypes. The Abbott Real-time HCV assay was used to evaluate the genotype and then it was compared to the conventional PCR method. The intrinsic and clinical performances of the recently developed Abbott m2000 real-time PCR system for HCV RNA quantification， which uses the automated Extractor m2000sp and the m2000rtdevice for automated real-time PCR amplification and detection of PCR products is examined.\n\n【10】Materialand Methods\n\n【11】Serological diagnosis\n\n【12】In order to diagnose HCV infection， plan antiviral treatment programs and evaluate virological response to antiviral therapy， serological and virological tests play a key role. Serological diagnosis of HCV infection is based on two categories of laboratory tests， namely serologic assays detecting specific antibody to HCV (anti-HCV) (indirect tests) and， molecular assays that can detect， quantify， or characterize the components of HCV viral particles， such as HCV\n\n【13】RNA and determine HCV genotype (direct tests) prior to sample collection diagnosis of patients was done. ELISA was performed to test positive antibodies to HCV.HCV-RNA detection in plasma was carried out by Qualitative RT-PCR (Abbott m2000rt) with lower limit of detection of 50 IU/ml\n\n【14】Sample collection\n\n【15】In the present study 3cc blood was collected from 50 patients with detectable HCV RNA using disposable syringes. Blood samples were properly labeled with patient’s name and Lab ID number for convenient analysis. Blood was transferred into EDTA coated vacutainer. In our study 43 patients out of 50 were tested positive for HCV， on which further diagnosis was performed.\n\n【16】Plasma separation\n\n【17】Samples were left at room temperature before centrifugation. The sample was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 15 min and 750 ml of plasma was collected. Plasma was carefully stored at -80°C to avoid contamination until further use.\n\n【18】RNA extraction by Abbott m2000sp： The automated steps of the extraction system include sample and reagent pipetting， heating and incubation， magnetic capture and washing， and elution， all of which are optimized in ready-to-use protocols 1. Sample is prepared for the extraction and concentration of RNA molecules to help amplification of target region and removal of potential inhibitors from the sample.\n\n【19】2. The Abbott m2000sp instrument prepares samples for the Abbott Real-time HCV assay using the Abbott mSample Preparation System reagents.\n\n【20】3. The Abbott m2000sp uses magnetic particle technology to attach nucleic acids and particles are washed to remove unbound components from the sample 4. The bound nucleic acids are eluted and transferred to a 96deep-well plate. The nucleic acids are then prepared for amplification.\n\n【21】5. The IC (Internal Control) is placed through the complete sample preparation procedure along with the calibrators， controls， and specimens.\n\n【22】Amplification master mix：\n\n【23】1. The Abbott m2000sp instrument automatically assembles the amplification master mix (HCV Oligonucleotide Reagent， Thermostable rTth Polymerase Enzyme， and Activation Reagent) and then transfers aliquots of the master mix to the Abbott 96-Well Optical Reaction Plate.\n\n【24】2. Nucleic acid samples are then transferred into the Abbott96-Well Optical Reaction Plate by the Abbott m2000sp from the Abbott 96 Deep-Well Plate.\n\n【25】3. The plate is fixed by the user with an Abbott Optical Adhesive Cover and set into the Abbott m2000rt instrument for PCR amplification and fluorescence detection.\n\n【26】Amplification：\n\n【27】1. During the amplification reaction on the Abbott m2000rt， the target RNA is transformed to cDNA by the activity of reverse transcriptase of the thermostable rTth DNA polymerase.\n\n【28】2 HCV and IC reverse primers anneal to their particular targets and are extended during a prolonged incubation period.\n\n【29】3. After incubation， the temperature of the reaction is raised above meltingpoint of double stranded cDNAleading to denaturation step： RNA product， a second primer anneals to the cDNA strand and is extended by the DNA polymerase activity of the rTth enzyme to create a double-strandedDNA product.\n\n【30】4. During each round of thermal cycling， amplification products dissociate to single strands at high temperature allowing primer annealing and extension as the temperature is lowered.\n\n【31】5. Exponential amplification of the product is achieved through continual cycling between high and low temperatures， resulting in a billion-fold or greater amplification oftarget sequences.\n\n【32】6. Amplification of both targets (HCV and IC) takes place simultaneously in the same reaction.\n\n【33】Quantitation：\n\n【34】1. Quantitation of HCV RNA concentration of samples and controls requires a calibration curve.\n\n【35】2. Two assay calibrators are run in replicates of three to generate a calibration curve. The calibration curve slope and intercept are calculated from the assigned HCV RNA concentration and the median observed threshold cycle for each calibrator and are stored on the instrument.\n\n【36】3. The concentration of HCV RNA in specimens and controls is calculated from the stored calibration curve， and the results are automatically reported on the Abbott m2000rt workstation.\n\n【37】4. The Abbott Real-time HCV Negative Control， Low Positive Control， and High Positive Control must be included in each run to verify run validity. The Abbott m2000rt verifies that the controls are within the assigned ranges.\n\n【38】Determination of HCV viral load\n\n【39】HCV viral load was determined by using Abbott Real-time HCV genotype II amplification reagent on real time PCR instrument Abbott m2000sp.\n\n【40】Genotyping： Primer based genotyping by core region of HCV cDNA synthesis：\n\n【41】PCR water： 2 uL\n\n【42】5x RT buffer： 4 uL\n\n【43】dNTPs 10mM： 1 uL\n\n【44】RT enzyme： 1 uL\n\n【45】Antisense Primer： 1 uL\n\n【46】RNase inhibitor： 1 pI\n\n【47】Total： 10 uL10 uL RNA+10 uL cDNA Master Mix= 20 uL\n\n【48】The extracted 10 uL RNA was added with 10 uL of cDNA Master Mix containing 4 uL of 5x RT buffer， 2 uL PCR water， 1 uL antisense primer， 1 uL dNTPs， 1 uL RNase inhibitor and 1 uL RT enzyme in eppendorf tubes and placed in Thermal Cycler.\n\n【49】Synthesis conditions are 42°C and 60 min.\n\n【50】The synthesized cDNA was stored at 4C for short term storage or -20°C for long term storage.\n\n【51】Regular PCR： A 50 uL of Regular Master Mix containing 25uL Dream Taq Master Mix， 1 uM Forward primer， 1 uM Reverse primer， 50 uL nuclease free water and 10 uL cDNA templates was prepared.

In age group 25to 35 years， 23.25% patients had genotype 3a while in age group >55years， 20.93% patients had genotype 3a. Increase in percentages for the following age groups is due to the detection of untypable genotype by Real-time PCR as genotype 3a .\n\n【102】Table 7： Genotypes in patients from different regions of Pakistan.\n\n| Area  | In-house  |  | Total  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Area  | 1a  | 3a  | Total  |\n| AJK  | 0  | 3  | 3(7%)  |\n| Attock  | 0  | 1  | 1(2.3%)  |\n| Chakwal  | 0  | 1  | 1(2.3%)  |\n| Gujar Khan  |  | 1  | 1(2.3%)  |\n| Haripur  | 0  | 1  | 1(2.3%)  |\n| Islamabac  | 1  | 19  | 20(46.5%)  |\n| Mardan  | 0  | 1  | 1(2.3%)  |\n| Murree  | 0  | 1  | 1(2.3%)  |\n| Rawalpindi  | 1  | 13  | 14(32.6%)  |\n| Total  | 2  | 41  | 43(100%)  |\n\n【104】Genotyping of patients from different regions of Pakistan\n\n【105】Genotyping of patients from nine different areas was performed.46.5% of patients from Islamabad， 32.6% patients from Rawalpindi and 7% patients from AJK had genotype 3a respectively.

Maximum viral load detected in patients was 9.4×10'IU/mL and the minimum quantity of viral load was 1.2 ×10 IU/mL. Analysis of our data showed that greater number of patients were in the category of viral load ranging from>10000000 IU/mL to 50000000 IU/mL .\n\n【108】Comparison of conventional PCR and real-time PCR\n\n【109】Through statistical analysis it was observed that genotypes of patients that were identified as Untypable (9.3%) by conventional PCR were detected with genotype 3a by Real-time PCR. Percentage of genotype 3a patients (86%) detected through conventional PCR shifts to 95% when detected through Real-time PCR .\n\n【110】Discussion\n\n【111】Hepatitis C virus is one ofthe leading causes of death and disabil ity worldwide and also getting endemic in many parts of Pakistan because very limited data on the genotyping of HCV has restricted the treatment of patients. In this study， we compared conventional PCR and Real-Time PCR genotyping methodologies of HCV to evaluate their efficiency to diagnose genotype of HCV patients.\n\n【112】In our study percentage of HCV genotype 3 was observed higher(95.3%) than genotype 1a (5%). It is proven in other studies done by， which claimed that 3a genotype is the major genotype in Pakistan followed by la genotype. Also in our study genotype 1a was second major genotype.\n\n【113】The predominance of genotype 3a in Pakistan is a good hope as it requires short duration of treatment and control of hepatitis C than genotype 1a . The occurrence of HCV 3 genotype in our population confirmedthe occurrence ofHCV genotype in neighboring countries including China， Iran， Afghanistan and India. In the west， Baluchistan shares a long border with Iran where genotype la and3a are most prevalent. It is reported that there is the high prevalence of genotype 3a and 1b in China . So， it is quite possible that other genotypes and subtypes can be transferred from surrounding countries to Pakistan. In our study， only males were infected by HCV genotype 1a while all females were infected by genotype 3a. High percentage of genotype la in males is due to traveling in neighboring countries in search of jobs， trade and developing career opportunities. Shifts in HCV genotype distribution needs to be noticed as it is an alarming signal to take major steps to reduce infections caused by other genotypes because genotype la and 4a are responsible for severe cirrhosis.\n\n【114】We compared the results of conventional PCR with Real-time PCR results. Those patients whose genotype was untypable were detected with 3a by Real-time PCR. This proved that Real-time PCR is accurate method that can detect each genotype infecting a patient.Real-time PCR in contrast to conventional PCR is rapid and reproducible method for the assessment of Hepatitis C virus load and genotype in serum samples. Quantitative PCR method such as regular or conventional PCR detects viral load and measures amplification product at the final phase of the reaction . Similar study suggests that at the exponential phase ofPCR the quantity of product is directly proportional to the initial number of template copies. As the reaction reaches plateau phase this correlation is lost. In contrast to regular PCR， Real Time PCR allows the detection and accurate knowledge of amplification product in every cycle of the reaction. Measuring kinetics at exponential phase allows the samples to be analyzed before reaction approaches the plateau phase .\n\n【115】In regular PCR， the end point varies from sample to sample and gel is insensitive to detect these variabilities， while Real-Time PCR is sensitiveenough to detect them. Moreover，conventionalPCR method is sophisticated， labor intensive and results are obtained within many days， also gel resolution is poor about ten folds. Whereas，Real-Time PCR is a speedy process and results can be obtained within hours and it can detect as little as two-fold change .\n\n【116】Conclusion and Future Recommendations\n\n【117】Our study reveals the clinical significance of genotyping of HCV patients and the accurate methods for the assessment of viral load. It is hoped that this study will help clinicians to find precise viral load in HCV positive patients and manage a better treatment plan based on correct and reliable genotyping of patients. In this we have observed that 95% of patients are infected with genotype 3a and only5% patients were infected with genotype 1a. This data shows that genotype 3a is common in Pakistan's population which can be timely treated. Furthermore， it is clear from these results that Real-Time PCR was more accurate and reliable method for HCV genotyping and measuring the amplified product.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 10:45:27", "endTime": "2024/09/24 10:46:07", "cost": 39.655}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:33", "update_time": "2024-09-23 18:46:06", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 18:45:27"}

Due to its high morbimortality， its diagnosis should be established without delay and treatment should be started immediately.\n\n【2】Its incidence has progressively decreased in our setting， thanks to the development of vaccines against most of the pathogens involved. Even so， Neisseria meningitidis and Streptococcus pneumonia continue to be the most frequently detected bacteria in children older than 3 months .\n\n【3】The most effective preventive measure for ABM due to S. pneumonia is pneumococcal conjugate vaccination ， with maximum serotype coverage. Many countries do not include serotypes associated with severe meningoencephalitis and penicillin resistance， such as serotype 19A， since they continue to administer decavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccines . It is important to know the vaccination status and the type of pneumococcal vaccine received in children upon arrival to Spain from countries with different immunization schedules.\n\n【4】Abbreviations\n\n【5】MBA： Acute Bacterial Meningitis； PCR： Polymerase Chain Reaction； CSF： Cerebrospinal Fluid； CT： Computed Axial Tomography.\n\n【6】Clinical Case\n\n【7】We present the case of a 20-month-old female infant from Iceland just arrived to Spain in June2022. She had no relevant clinical history， with vaccination up to date according to her country， including pneumococcal conjugate decavalent vaccine.\n\n【8】The patient presented at the emergency room with 48 h evolution of fever and upper respiratory symptoms，being diagnosed with a probable viral infection in a local hospital in Madrid， progressing in the next few hours to vomiting and gait disturbance. Physical examination revealed poor general condition with prolonged capillary refill time， drowsiness and neck stiffness. Given the clinical deterioration and suspicion of septic shock， initial stabilization was performed， requiring volume expansion. Blood tests and blood culture were requested and intravenous cefotaxime was started. Blood analysis showed a leukocyte count of 4，900/microliter， with 40.3% neutrophils， 9.8%lymphocytes and 2% monocytes， hypertransaminasemia (ALT 894 U/L， AST 553 UI/L， alkaline phosphatase 213 UI/L， LDH 961 UI/L). An elevation of acute phase reactants (C-reactive protein23.7 mg/dl and procalcitonin 59 ng/ml) was detected， as well as altered coagulation with INR of 1.68. Blood gas analysis showed metabolic acidosis with hyperlactatemia.\n\n【9】Due to the lack of improvement， the patient was transferred to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU)， suspecting meningoencephalitis with associated septic shock. On arrival at the PICU， she was unstable with a neurological examination compatible with intracranial hypertension. A decortication posture with anisocoria was observed， as well as generalized seizures refractory to anticonvulsant therapy. In following blood tests， values were consistent with multiorgan failure maintaining leukopenia (up to 3，300/microliter) with thrombocytopenia (16，000/microliter)， NT-proBNP 15，021 pg/ml and D-dimer of 18，243 ng/ml.\n\n【10】Brain computed axial tomography (CT) was consistent with hypoxic-ischemic encephalitis. A lumbar puncture was performed in which Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) showed bacterial meningitis(4000 red blood cells/mL， 26 cells/microliter with 52% polymorphonuclear， 628 mg/dl protein and glucose <10 mg/dl). After obtaining microbiological samples， antimicrobial treatment was changed to vancomycin， meropenem and acyclovir. Given the persistence of intracranial hypertension refractory to medical treatment， surgical intervention was decided， in which an external ventricular drainage was placed.\n\n【11】Streptococcus preumonia and Enterovirus B were detected in CSF by molecular biology technique (PCR). Despite high-dose antimicrobial treatment and optimization of supportive care， there was fulminant progression， confirming encephalic death by neurological examination，EEG and CT less than 24 h after admission.\n\n【12】After the patient’s passing， the presence of Streptococcus preuronia was confirmed in CSF culture and blood culture. Serotype determination was performed， being reported as type19A.The antibiogram showed multi-resistance to antibiotics， specifically， high level of resistance to penicillin and cefotaxime (MIC to penicillin 4 micrograms/ml and cefotaxime： 6 micrograms/dl). Immunologic work up showed immunoglobulin values within the normal range (IgG 582 mg/dl； IgA 96 mg/dl and IgM 111 mg/dl)， and a complement study indicated a discrete hypocomplementemia C4 5.1 mg/dl (normal values 11.2 mg/dl to 39.1 mg/dl)， with C3 99.5mg/dl (normal values 98.6 mg/dl to 207.9 mg/dl). A genetic panel for immunodeficiencies and necropsy could not be performed.\n\n【13】Discussion\n\n【14】Although less and less frequent， pneumococcal meningitis continues to be a major health issue in children in our environment. Both primary care and hospital pediatricians should be familiar with the clinical manifestations in order to establish an early diagnosis that allows treatment to be initiated as quickly as possible.\n\n【15】With respect to invasive pneumococcal disease， its incidence in children is higher in the group under 5 years of age， and the most frequent serotypes are 8，3，9N，19A and 22F (3 and 19A are included in the 13-valent vaccine). Although the incidence of pneumococcal meningitis has decreased over time， it is still associated with a morbidity of around 20% to 25% with a mortality of 5% to 10% at present.\n\n【16】Currently， there are two types of vaccines against S. pneumonia； polysaccharide and conjugated vaccines with a carrier protein. There are two types of conjugated vaccines marketed： tridecavalent and decavalent. Thanks to the high vaccination coverage， and to the improvement of hygienic measures， the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease has markedly decreased in Spain. Although in our setting most of the infant population has received the 13-valent conjugate vaccine， in migrant or transient population， other vaccination patterns can be found， as in the case of our patient.\n\n【17】The available polysaccharide vaccine， known as 23-valent. The polysaccharides of the pneumococcal capsule are not bound to proteins， which makes the immune less robust than with the conjugate vaccine . It causes an immune tolerance phenomenon and does not impact on nasopharyngeal colonization. It can be administered from 2 years ofage. In children， it should be reserved always after the conjugate vaccine， for patients at high risk of invasive pneumococcal disease.\n\n【18】The Fpneumococcal1conjugatevaccineecontainLsScapsular polysaccharides ofthe 13 most prevalent pneumococcal serotypes (1，3， 4，5，6A， 6B，7F，9V， 14， 18C， 19A， 19F and 23F) which， together with a carrier protein， generate an adequate and long-lasting immune response， with long-term protection. This vaccine has been included in the Spanish children's vaccination schedule since 2016， being therefore free of charge， with a 3-dose.\n\n【19】It has proven to be effective in the prevention of invasive pneumococcal disease (97% for meningitis and sepsis)， preventing infection from 80% of the circulating serotypes. Among them， serotype 19A stands out， which is characterized by its association with mastoiditis and meningitis， as well as by its high prevalence of resistance to penicillin .\n\n【20】Likewise， it is useful to rule out primary immunodeficiencies in fulminant pneumococcal infections.\n\n【21】The aim of this case is to draw attention on the still present pneumococcal meningitis in a highly immunized population of children that can have a fulminant outcome， particularly with aggressive serotypes like 19A， that may be highly resistant to penicillin and cefotaxime. It is necessary to emphasize the importance of adapting and completing the vaccination schedules of patients born outside Spain and achieving optimal immunization of the infant population.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 10:17:23", "endTime": "2024/09/24 10:17:45", "cost": 21.862}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:33", "update_time": "2024-09-23 18:17:45", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 18:17:23"}

It is still an inclined graph， and it becomes an intriguing concept to investigate in a more progressive manner. Anxiety is a mental disorder that develops in reaction to stress and worsens over time as we continue to worry about it； on the other hand， depression is a serious medical ailment that can cause a variety of emotional， mental， and physical difficulties as well as a reduction in quality of life. According to the World Health Organization (WHO)， younger adults are more likely to suffer from anxiety and depression during this ongoing pandemic， with56.2 percent of victims being 18 to 24 years old， 48.9% being 25 to 49 years old， 39.1 percent being50 to 60 years old， and 29.3 percent being 65 years and older in their age groups. Because of many challenges that occurred during this COVID-19， approximately 27% of individuals in India are suffering from stress and despair.\n\n【4】Anxiety and depression have had a significant impact on human wellbeing during COVID-19. As a result， anxiety and depression are divided into three major categories： Impact during the lockdown，people's survival， and the impact of the media .\n\n【5】People who labor for daily earnings have lost their jobs and daily work， resulting in later phases ofhunger and， with no other option， an upsurge in self-destruction attempts. According to reports， there were nearly 300 non-corona deaths， which fall under the broad category of suicides， because of this anxiety and depression.\n\n【6】Staying athome ideally resulted in numerous quarrels that escalated to social phobia， culminating in divorces， unintended separations， and family segregation etc. The student community was the most affected， during the lockdown because there were no physical educations or outdoor activities.\n\n【7】With the help of internet apps and tools， technology bridged this divide. It provided opportunities for students to learn， and it was funded by a variety of organizations. When technology is used appropriately， it is always beneficial； however， when it is used unnecessarily or becomes an addiction， it has negative consequences. As a result， continuous hours of online lessons increased students' onscreen time and fostered a sense of isolation.\n\n【8】Because of all of this， students were under a great deal of stress and displayed a variety of behavioral changes， including being annoyed， short-tempered， depressed， and nervous. Apart from that， a significant group of people emerged who were also dealing with depression and anxiety：Internet traders. Many people began crypto-trading during the lockdown period， with estimates indicating a nearly 40% increase. People， on the other hand， entered the market with little expertise. There was a strong market downturn that eventually resulted in market collapse， which was unexpected. The initial and basic losses of these new players led to anxiety and depression， which raised suicidal impulses andlong-term mental disorders. Because there were no proper treatments available during this period， human existence was a question mark， and doctors administered various combinations of medicines， which eventually revealed long-term adverse effects. According to the Indian government， there were 3.2 beds for every 10，000 persons in rural India. This number clearly shows that the uncalled COVID-19， which hit the whole world in the two waves， threw off the entire planning and arrangement by government officials， resulting in an unanticipated scenario among the populace. There was no adequate hospitalization，pharmacy， oxygen cylinders， nursing， or medical practitioner， resulting in a huge number of deaths. These all-unplanned events also created a catastrophic situation for the body's final departure .\n\n【9】Throughout all stages of COVID-19， anxiety and depression entered human life at various levels. But， with all of this， there were some good things as well； family relations improved as most skilled， grounded people left their jobs and began spending more time with their families； and， as a measure to prevent the spread of the disease， many government and private sectors prompted their staff to contribute from home， allowing people to spend more time with their families. Many individuals began assisting others in need， demonstrating that humanity is still alive. The government has made various initiatives and funds available to frontline workers as well as the general public. Finally， the COVID-19 pandemic is educating us the importance of changing our eating habits and adopting alternative diets to strengthen our immunity.

We herewith present the case of a47-years-old female patient who experienced hirsutism and amenorrhea for five years， intensified in the last year adding clitoromegaly， alopecia， increased muscle mass， and voice deepening. The biochemistry showed elevated serum total testosterone and DHEA-S. The computerized abdominal tomography showed a solid， nodular right adrenal mass deemed uncharacterizable， and an adenoma was reported on the left adrenal gland. A PET study showed low and diffuse metabolism in the right lesion and confirmed the left adenoma. The right-side adrenalectomy was performed by a laparoscopic approach. Signs and symptoms of hyperandrogenism and virilization subsided almost entirely， with decreased total testosterone and DHEA-Slevels. The diagnosis is upon clinical suspicion with signs of hyperandrogenism and virilization， elevated serum androgen levels， and imaging evidence of adrenal tissue injury. However， all these are not enough for an accurate diagnosis， being the pathology report of foremost importance for the definitive diagnosis.\n\n【2】Keywords： Adrenal tumor， Adrenalectomy， Hirsutism， Hyperandrogenism， Virilization\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Pure Androgen-Secreting Adrenal Tumors (PASATs) are sporadic and are often confused in clinical practice with adrenocortical carcinomas. Eighty percent occur in females and present with hirsutism， menstrual disorders， and virilization . The following is a clinical case of PASAT in a47-year-old woman，and a bibliographic search was carried out to update the evidence.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 47-year-old female patient with no relevant background presents with a history of 5 years of hirsutism and amenorrhea， intensified in the previous year， adding alopecia， increased muscle mass， and voice deepening . The physical examination reports an average weight， normal blood pressure， moderate hirsutism (18 on the Ferriman-Gallwey scoring system)， and clitoromegaly without elements of Cushing's syndrome nor acanthosis Nigricans syndrome.\n\n【7】Laboratory tests highlight the value of Total Testosterone of 937 ng/dl (reference value 8.4 to48.1)； serum Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) 331 pg/dl (reference value 56.2 to 282.9)； normal serum Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH)， Luteinizing Hormone (LH)， and Prolactin(PRL)； finally， a serum cortisol level of 1.6 ug/dl was obtained after a dexamethasone suppression test.\n\n【8】Imaging\n\n【9】An abdominal Computed Tomography (CT) shows a solid nodular right adrenal mass with hypodense areas inside， 40x34x32 mm， washout of 16.3%， deemed uncharacterizable. On the left adrenal， an adenoma of 12 ×10×10 mm size is reported . A Positron Emission Tomography (PET-CT) with 18F-FDG (fluorine-18 fluorode oxyglucose) shows low and diffuse metabolism in the right lesion and confirms the left adenoma .\n\n【10】Pathology\n\n【11】Given the described findings， right-side adrenalectomy by the laparoscopic approach was decided and performed without complications. Multiple pathologists analyzed the histological\n\n【12】Table 1： Weiss Score. Presence of 3 or more items is related to malignancy sample due to diagnostic doubts， and two possible etiologies were posed， nodular hyperplasia vs. cortical adenoma， without malignancy elements.\n\n【13】Postoperative outcomes\n\n【14】In the follow-up visit two months after surgery， the signs and symptoms of hyperandrogenism and virilization decreased almost entirely. The total testosterone and DHEAS levels dropped to a normal range for age and sex regarding laboratory findings.\n\n【15】Discussion\n\n【16】Epidemiology\n\n【17】Virilizing adrenocortical tumors are rare in adults. About 50%appear before puberty， 39% correspond to adenomas， and 80%are seen in women. They have a high chance of malignancy (70%) if virilization appears in adult women， with rapidly progressive symptoms and Cushing syndrome. This association was ruled out in our patient .\n\n【18】According to Moreno et al. ， PASATs make up for 2.4% of all adrenalectomies and cause 49% of women’s virilizing syndromes. In their review of 34 patients with PASAT， Gabrilove et al.  report a slight predominance ofthe right adrenal compared to the left .\n\n【19】PASATs secrete DHEA and DHEA-S rather than testosterone. On the other hand， the predominance of testosterone tends the diagnosis towards an ovarian pathology . It should be noted that there are no alterations found in the patient's ovaries. Exceptionally， there are adrenal tumors that secrete only testosterone in the absence of other androgens .\n\n【20】Clinical findings\n\n【21】The androgen excess in women clinically shows with hirsutism and progress to virilization with clitoromegaly， voice deepening， alopecia， increase of muscle mass， changes in body fat distribution， and decrease in breast volume， among others. However， other entities present similar clinical manifestations， such as Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)， ovarian tumors， and congenital adrenal hyperplasia . The literature has described cases of malignant PASAT patients without hirsutism. These cases could be explained by abrupt tumoral appearance， without leaving time for androgens to act on hair receptors and manifest this sign .\n\n【22】Diagnosis\n\n【23】A biochemical confirmation， using DHEAS and increased total testosterone (12-fold above the upper limit of normal range orients to malignancy)  will confirm the clinical suspicion. Some authors suggest that dynamic tests should be performed， such as dexamethasone androgen suppression test for establishing a differential diagnosis between an adrenal tumor and other causes of hyperandrogenism. A decrease in post-dose androgens of at least 40%allows the identification of non-tumor pathology with a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 88%， given that adrenal tumors secrete androgens autonomously without ACTH regulation .\n\n【24】Diagnosing PASATs in males represents a challenge for the clinician since they are only evident when the peripheral androgen-to-estrogen conversion is present.\n\n【25】Imaging diagnostic tools include abdominal CT as the initial approach，followed by MRI or 18F-FDG PET-CT. This last technique reveals its usefulness in evaluating intratumoral metabolic rate. In our case， due to the CT characteristics and the equipment's availability， an 18F-FDG PET-CT was requested， and it revealed low intratumoral metabolism.\n\n【26】PASATs are almost always large-sized， which is not surprising since the adrenal glands secrete few androgens compared to virilizing ovarian tumors， which are often small and may even be hidden. The maximum diameter of the adrenal mass typically predicts malignancy； however， in PASATs， the size does not always correlate with malignancy probability. A series of 9 cases presented by Tong et al. described two adenomas exceeding 9 cm . Unlike adrenal carcinomas， which generally have a larger size， the literature usually reports that most adrenal adenomas are less than 4 cm to 6 cm in diameter， confusing the diagnosis .\n\n【27】In addition to the size， the classic imaging features that guide us to tumor benignity， such as the lipid-rich nature (Hounsfield units <10) or a contrast wash-out >60% of the 10-min protocol， also generate confusion， since the PASATs do not always comply with them .\n\n【28】Treatment\n\n【29】The surgical approach is recommended in all functioning adrenal tumors. Some authors recommend the open approach in tumors larger than 10 cm with or without suspected malignancy.Otherwise， the laparoscopic approach may be considered. Complete surgical removal is the key to a good prognosis . Finally， the definitive diagnosis will be established through the pathologic report of the surgical specimen， using the Weiss criteria  .\n\n【30】Regarding the follow-up， Moreno et al. did not show an increase in androgen levels or post-surgical tumor relapse in their series of11 benign PASAT patients， who were followed for an average of 17years.\n\n【31】In summary， our case presents a 47-year-old female， without previousillness，who had a progressiveclinicalcourse OI hyperandrogenism and virilization and was diagnosed as a PASAT with no evidence of malignancy in the right adrenal gland， and an adenoma in the left adrenal gland. She had an excellent post-surgical evolution and no clinical， biochemical，or structural recurrence than the different case series findings. Provided a contralateral adenoma， a clinical follow-up is proposed， requesting a new image in case of recurrence of symptoms.\n\n【32】Conclusion\n\n【33】PASATs are rare tumors that predominate in the female sex. The diagnosis is achieved by clinical suspicion with signs of hyperandrogenism andvirilization， elevatedserum androgen levels， and imaging evidence of adrenal tissue lesion. Nevertheless， these elements are not enough to make an accurate diagnosis，being the pathological report of foremost importance for the definitive diagnosis. The 18F-FDG PET-CT is a new diagnostic tool to take into account to assess tumor characteristics. Surgical treatment is the gold standard， and the approach will depend on the size and tumor characteristics.

Telemedicine is the set of techniques and tools for health monitoring and cares implemented through systems providing rapid access to both specialists and patients， regardless of where they are located respectively. We live in the age of communication， and we have long had the problem of how to improve health in health systems. Telemedicine seems to be a viable alternative in order to eliminate the gap between human and economic resources. Due to its characteristics， it can contribute to improving access to specialized healthcare and the quality of life of people， especially in populations lacking qualified personnel， in remote or difficult access areas or patients with chronic diseases， by reducing long waiting lists and high costs for the health systems. While the telemedicine projects between different countries are developing more and more， the inherent ethical and legal problems are emerging at the same time. This article refers to telemedicine as a broad concept， including several types of distance medicine， thus identifying its strengths and weaknesses that will be the primary purpose of the medical-legal aspects. We will also describe its application in the ophthalmological field and the main issues raised by its implementation.\n\n【2】Keywords： Telemedicine； Ophthalmology； Medical Ethics； E-Health； Telecare\n\n【3】Telemedicine\n\n【4】Telemedicine is， according to the Commission of the European Communities， the provision of welfare services by using Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) in situations where the health professional and the patient (or two professionals) are not in the same location. It involves the reliable transmission of medical information and data thanks to texts， sounds， and images necessary for the prevention， diagnosis， treatment， and subsequent monitoring of patients. Telemedicine has numerous benefits for doctors， medical institutions， and patients . In this way， it plays a pivotal role in the development of medicine and the provision of health care in the world. Telemedicine allows remote group collaboration between health professionals in different places， even from different countries. It is useful for real-time interaction among the participants without a time interval between interventions. Professionals in distant positions can communicate， thus improving the quality of health services. The continuous flow of communication among health professionals is necessary due to the increasing complexity of medicine that prompts the doctors to consult with colleagues or experts in a particular issue or to need a second opinion. All thesebehaviors are considered good medical practice (considering that they will not delay an urgent procedure nor constitute a defensive medicine)， and the absence of such contacts may be considered as lack of interest and attention by the doctor. On the otherhand， today patients， who are aware of their rights and attentive to the risk of medical errors， also seek a second opinion， sometimes from doctors who have never really met， by using the telephone， the mail or even a website. In the perspective ofhealth institutions， telemedicine opens up the possibility of expanding the spectrum of available medical services， thus increasing the chances of earning and saving. Furthermore， it can be quite convenient for the patients themselves. Telemedicine facilitates direct patient access to a distant doctor， without requiring the movement of any of the participants and allowing access to some forms of medical care that would otherwise not be available. Telemedicine can be an important tool in cases where geographical distance hinders access to health care， in particular， specialized healthcare， such as in many rural areas or in developing countries with the lack of health infrastructures . Medical treatment in these scenarios would require long journeys， not always possible and usually rather expensive， time-consuming and exhausting both for doctors and patients. Therefore，patients in this situation do not access to adequate health care. Telemedicine can also be a potentially very useful tool in preventive medicine， providing patients with useful information on their health conditions. It can be used for the monitoring of chronic conditions such as diabetic retinopathy， glaucoma， age-related macular degeneration， etc. that are growing public health problems due to the increasing life expectancy and elderly population. These diseases are also increasing in the young population. By means of telemedicine， we do not need to visit the patient in the hospital setting， but we use a telemonitoring  thus avoiding long waiting lists. Moreover， it is convenient to reduce hospitalization and health care costs. Telemedicine also has enormous potential as regards the electronic prescription in order to avoid errors， such as mistakes in the tax code， the patient's age or the dosage， consequently to incomprehensible calligraphy of the doctor . The improvement of healthcare is the advantage of telemedicine. This goal materializes by means of the patient health education， the technical education of health workers by using the new e-learning technologies， and the ease of accessing a second opinion from a specialist， particularly important for people in rural areas or those who suffer from rare diseases. Notwithstanding all these advantages， telemedicine is not present in Europe. The difficulties of application are the huge costs of a telemedicine service， the difficult interoperability of technical infrastructures across countries， the privacy of health data， the lack of specific ethical standards and regulations for telemedicine， the doubts for healthcare professionals about their responsibility， and the uncertainties of the legal framework all over the world .\n\n【5】Telemedicine and Ophthalm ology\n\n【6】Telemedicinehas multipleapplications in ophthalmology because it needs visual images for the screening， diagnosis， therapy， and monitoring of the diseases. It is not surprising that ophthalmology has been so quickly adapted to changes in the cybernetic world and that it uses the telemedicine technologic system in order to access to advanced healthcare. Its practical use has shown clinical， economic， and public health benefits . For example， its use in two important pathologies， such as Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) and Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP)， shows how telemedicine can improve access to high-quality health care in these and other ophthalmological diseases. Although effective treatments for high-risk DR exist for over four decades， DR remains a major cause of blindness among adults of working age. The telemonitoring of DR is now one of the helpful specific applications of the telemedicine.\n\n【7】On the other hand， the inability of half of the population to timely access the exams has contributed to the increase of diabetes. The telemedicine programs provide access to the annual screening of DR patients through patient imaging in a setting of primary assistance. These programs have improved clinical outcomes .\n\n【8】Consequently， the spreading of the ophthalmological programs into the medical system would probably result in a suitable timing in eye care in the proportion of patients who did not access to retinal screening or eye tests with the appropriate frequency . Image-based diagnosis and telemedicine have proven to be reliable， accurate， and cost-effective for ROP and improve access to eye care for premature babies at high risk for ROP . The diagnosis and treatment ofROP are essential for successful results. There are doctors experienced in indirect ophthalmoscopy and trained in screening for ROP that can provide care for low birth weight infants. Telemedicine offers an interesting alternative， especially in the most remote areas.\n\n【9】Furthermore， imaging could improve the documentation of the retinal fundus. In this sense， telemedicine can successfully improve and extend ophthalmologic care using imaging technology. Other areas of telemedicine in ophthalmology are intraocular pressure monitoring， optic nerve analysis， macular disease monitoring， visual field analysis， and anterior segment diagnosis. Furthermore， the ability to perform remote consultations and examinations， instead of face-to-face， is gaining ground thanks to improved two-way communication technologies in emerging clinical institutions .\n\n【10】The Legal Framework of Telemedicine\n\n【11】As a health service， telemedicine is included in the scope of articles 56 and 57 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU)； therefore， it is a service， and it is subject to the general freedom concerning the free movement of services. Nonetheless， this is not the only set of rules applicable to telemedicine within the European legal system. In fact， within the framework of European law， telemedicine is both a health service and an information service(a service normally provided for a fee， at a distance and electronically at individual request). Therefore， both regulations are applicable：those relating to health care and those relating to information society services .\n\n【12】As far as information and telecommunications are concerned， we must take into consideration the following documents： Directive95/46/EU ， the Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) ， Directive 98/34/EC， the Information Society Services Directive， Directive 2000/31/EC， directive on electronic commerce ， Directive 2002/58/EC and the directive on privacy and electronic communication . About health services， the most relevant result for regulating this sector is Directive 2011/24/EU on the so-called cross-border directive . Furthermore， the European Union (EU) has developed an important series of initiatives over the years in order to increase the use of telemedicine in Europe. These initiatives aim to transform telemedicine into a standard medical service， accessible to all European patients and fully covered bythe respective social security system . The EU's efforts are also quite economically significant， as the EU has invested over E 500 million in research funding on the development of eHealth instruments. However， the undeniable value of telemedicine should not hide its many difficulties， some of which are also present in traditional medicine， but which assume a new complexity within telemedicine. For example， when health workers from different countries and different languages collaborate， there is no consensus on language to use for data recording in the patient's medical record or who is responsible for providing technical training (the so-called e-literacy) to health professionals using new communication technologies. All electronic health records (EHRs) need to integrate into a global eHealth infrastructure that is accessible from every point in the EU. Despite several working documents and position papers issued by the European institutions， we still lack a uniform set of rules to regulate telemedicine in Europe. Most of the regulatory competences in these areas still depend on the Member States， retaining the best skills in health care and medicine. However， the problem is that the approach to telemedicine varies immensely among European countries， including the perspective chosen to regulate telemedicine： some states have approached telemedicine from the point of view of the laws in the field of ICT technologies， while other laws regard the health care domain or even the social security field. Therefore， even at the national level， there are legal voids that threaten the practice of telemedicine，leaving unprotected patients and health workers 271.\n\n【13】The General Data Protection Regulation(GDPR)：Privacy in Health\n\n【14】Published in the European Official Journal on 4 May 2016， it entered into force on 24 May 2016， but its implementation took place after two years， therefore starting from 25 May 2018. Regulation2016/679 is European legislation about data protection. Since it is a regulation， it does not need for transposition by the Member States of the Union and will spread in the same way in all the States of the Union without margins of freedom in adaptation. Its purpose is the definitive harmonization of the regulation on the protection of personal data within the EU. With the Lisbon treaty， the protection of personal data has become a fundamental right of citizens， and therefore to be guaranteed in the same way throughout the territory of the union. By increasing citizens trust in the digital society， thanks to the more stringent protection， the regulation is functional to the digital development of the EU and safeguards the free movement of personal data. With the European regulation， we move from a proprietary vision of the datum (not treatable without consent) to a vision of control of the data that favors the free circulation， at the same time strengthening the rights of the interested party. There is a fundamental right of patients to the confidentiality of their information and medical records. Patient privacy should be observed unless it is revoked (i.e.， informed， non-coercive) in rare cases in which it neutralizes the public interest. The information disclosed should be limited to such information or part of the medical record. Telemedicine creates specialproblems due to the involvement ofnon-clinical staff in teleconsultations，and the vulnerability oftransmission lines to security breaches. Legislation and guidelines do not apply to anonymous information stripped of all attributes that can identify the owner. This simple distinction between the two types of information apparently is not so clear in practice. The processing of health data is subject to a specific discipline. It is carried out by healthcare professionals (excluding orthopedists， dental hygienists， nurses， obstetricians， physiotherapists， and speech therapists)， and public health organizations . The confidentiality needs to guarantee for citizens in health facilities， and the health data relating to them. Health data are data subject to special treatment， as it can reveal very intimate details ofthe person，and，for this reason，there is a generalprohibition of dissemination， as well as enhanced protection， of such data (Article4 GDPR) . Health data is all that personal information suitable to reveal a person's state of health and body and mental conditions. Genetic data and photographs taken for surgical interventions or controls are also health data. Furthermore， as established by the Court of Cassation (Civil Cassation， United Sections， judgment 12.27.2017， number 30981)， sensitive data suitable to reveal the state of health must be treated with organizational methods to protect them， such as encryption thus making the data subject unidentifiable. The European regulation provides that health data can be used only for purposes related to health (treatment purposes)， for the supervision of the National Health System and research in the public interest. These purposes allow the possibility to introduce special conditions or additional limits for treatment. In this sense， the Italian legislator has provided， with the new Privacy Code， further measures to protect health dataset by the national control authority and reviewed every two years. The article 9 (letter h) of the GDPR does not provide the consent of data processing for purposes of preventive medicine or occupational medicine， such as assessment of the employees ability to work， diagnosis， assistance， management of health， on the basis of Union or Member State law or in accordance with the health professional contract. However， the rule allows the Member States to maintain or introduce additional conditions， including limitations concerning the processing of genetic data， biometric data， or health data. The Italian legislator， with the decree to update the Privacy Code， has introduced the possibility that the Guarantor imposes specific guarantee measures (additional to the normal security measures) for the treatment of health data . The directive 680of 2016 is similar to the GDPR. Many of the rules contained are similar or equivalent to those of the new European regulation on privacy and personal data. They have a specific scope of application and concern the processing carried out by the competent authorities for prevention， investigation，detection，and prosecution of offenses， execution of criminal penalties， safeguarding and preventing threats to public security. This directive expresses the need to keep the data for the time necessary to achieve the purposes and to review the data to verify the need for storage or deletion after the deadline. About the safety of the treatment， the appointment of the data protection officer is also obligatory for the judicial authority thanks to the assistance that this figure can provide in the management of complex treatments and sensitive data. As regards the violation of the new rules， the text provides for administrative sanctions against violations concerning the methods of processing and introduces penal sanctions for the treatment operated with illegitimate purposes .\n\n【15】The Informed Consent\n\n【16】Before proceeding with data collection， it is necessary to provide the information to the patient (if necessary， it is possible to provide orally even if it is preferably written). The document indicates the subject collecting data， the purposes of the treatment， the methods of treatment， the mandatory or optional nature of the provision of data， the subjects or the categories of subjects to whom the data can be communicated， the identification details of the holder， and the methods for exercising the rights to protect your data. The Italian Ophthalmological Society has elaborated， in addition to the Guidelines， the Informed Consent Forms that regulate and define the criteria for the development of the main activities of the ophthalmologist. Informed consent is the tool through which information is disposable for the patient about the intervention and is gathered his consent to proceed. Therefore，it presupposes two distinct moments： information and then the actual consent. The Informed Consent consists of documentation： the specific information sheet of the intervention about the execution procedure， the post-treatment， advantages， disadvantages， risks， and complications. The Act of Consent remains the same for all the information sheets and does not need any specificity linked to the treatment . The article 1， in compliance with the principles， set out in articles 2， 13 and 32 of the Law 219/2017 of the Constitution， states that no medical treatment starts or continues without the free and informed consent of the interested person， except in cases expressly provided by law . However， the possibility of carrying out the treatment according to the public interest remains (for example， data processed to allow the study of a disease in order to treat other people). The Italian legal system provides for the freedom of choice of the place of care (article32 ofthe Constitution and Legislative Decree 502/92) and the freedom to undergo treatment or not (Article 1 of Law 219/2017). According to the GDPR， once the city has decided to undergo treatment， they cannot refuse consent to the processing of data for treatment and diagnosis purposes. The digital preservation process aims to make a document usable over time in all its integrity and authenticity， in its \"digital essence\" and in full compliance with the new privacy regulation (European Regulation 679 on protecting personal data). The Digital Administration Code asserts that the Information Technology (IT) document and its processing are valid and relevant for the law and recognizes the equivalence between a computerized and paper document. Decree of the President of the Council of Ministers of the Italian Republic (DPCM) of 13 November 2014 sets the technical rules for the formation of the IT document. DPCM of 3 December 2013 preceded it， published in the Official Gazette number 59 of 12 March 2014 and related to managing IT documents and their preservation. The technical rules on preservation introduce adaptation to international standards and national standards .\n\n【17】The Electronic Sanitary File (ESF)\n\n【18】The ESF， provided by article 12 oflegislative decree 179/2012， is an IT tool that combines data and documents (digital or digitized) of health and social-health type related to the patients. Its function is to share such data and the patient's medical history among various doctors or health organizations. In addition to the patient (with safe modes， e.g.， smart card)， the ESF can access doctors and authorized healthcare personnel. Since the article 12 of Decree-Law 179/2012 is active， the inclusion of data within the ESF depends on the consent of the patient (article 3 bis). In this regard， you know about who has access to your data and how these data are used. The consent to the formation of the ESF is of course， quite distinct from the treatment. The lack of consent to the establishment of the ESF or the insertion of some data in the file cannot preclude the possibility of using the treatment. The patient has the right to revoke the consent and to obscure some specific data from the ESF. Although mobile electronic medical records are beneficial， several factors contribute to their not full potential use. Training in functionality and reliable infrastructures might foster tablet implementation . The European Union of Medical Specialists (EUMS) has published a document that contains the \"European Definition of Medical Act.\" This definition， adopted for the first time in 2005， was later amended in 2006 and finally in the Brussels meeting of 25 April 2009. This is the approved version： \"The medical act covers all professional activities， for example of scientific， teaching， training， educational， organizational， clinical and medical technology，carried out in order to promote health， prevent diseases， make diagnoses and prescribe therapeutic treatments or rehabilitative treatments for patients， individuals， groups or communities， in the framework of ethical and deontological rules. The medical act is a responsibility of the qualified physician； it must be performed by the doctor or under his direct supervision andprescription.\" Patients who disclosepersonal information to their physicians must be able to trust them in order to protect the same information against other incidents to the treatment process. In this sense， there is no distinction between traditional medicine and telemedicine. The duty of confidentiality applies to all information provided to a tele-consulting doctor by a third party that may be a healthcare professional， aware ofthe patient-doctor relationship and under the same obligation of confidentiality.\n\n【19】The Information Disclosure Consent\n\n【20】Most patients understand that the primary physician responsible for their case will need to ensure that all team members have the information to fulfill their professional roles in the care process. When patients consent to the disclosure of information about them， it is necessary to ensure that they understand the reasons for disclosure. It is necessary to ensure that the patients are informed whenever information about them is likely to be disclosed to others involved in their health care and that they have the opportunity to retain information. If the doctor decides to divulge confidential information， he must be ready to explain and justify his decision. Because of the need to inform members of the support team， the law assumes the patient's implicit consent to disclose information to them. A final point concerns the circumstances in which the doctor or other authorities can cancel the patient's refusal to disclose. These circumstances arise when medical conditions ofa patient pose a severe threat to the community in general. Health status data are visible to third parties， such as relatives， family members， voluntary personnel， after the patient， if conscious， has been informed and allowed. In any case， it is necessary to respect the request of the person hospitalized to not make known even to the legitimate third parties his presence in the health facility or information on his health conditions . The issue of the access right to the patient's medical record obviously binds to the more general right of access to administrative documents(governed by the article 22 and following Law 241/1990) and to the treatment of personal health data according to the code about personal data protection referred to legislative decree number 196/2003. The public medical record is subject to the productivity of incident effects on subjective legal situations of public relevance . Theprevailing doctrine attributes juridical relevance to the medical record， as it is the only instrument capable of processing patient care information to allow communication between the various health care workers. The doctor， in charge of compilation， is a public official pursuant to article357 of the penal code， while the person responsible for the storage and good keeping is always the head of the department where the patient is undergoing treatment. The doctor has required a particular accuracy in writing all elements in the medical record： diagnosis， therapy，outcomes， etc. according to the article 24 of the Decree of the Minister of Health of 5 August 1977 and arranged according to the procedures set forth in article 26 ofthe Code of Medical Deontology. The medical record together with the related reports needs indefinite preservation， as it is an official act essential to ensure the certainty of clinical data， as well as being a valuable source of documentation for research of historical health data. In this panorama， the question of limits on access to third parties to the information contained in the medical record belonging to another subject has legal importance.\n\n【21】The Network and Inform ation Security(NIS) Directive for Health Data Protection\n\n【22】Several devices are useful for remote communication， such as video conferencing unit， e-mail， webcam， Smartphone， etc. The channel to allow communication is variable (broadband， network， wireless). The legal perspective of confidentiality focuses on the relationship between the subjects involved rather than on the systems by which they communicate， but we must pay attention to this last aspect. We consider the NIS directive as the first step in the European cyber security strategy. Approved by the EU Parliament on 6 July 2016， the directive aims to reinforce the security and IT resilience within the Old Continent. The need for NIS directive starts from a consideration： networks， systems， and information services play a vital role in today society. Without them， the internal market could not work， so it is essential for their reliability and security for economic and social activities. The NIS applies to two categories： the operators of essential services that are necessary to the maintenance of basic social and economic activities (such as health， transport and energy companies)， and the digital service operators such as search engines， e-commerce platforms， etc. Both of them need to adopt appropriate technical and organizational measures to manage risks and prevent IT incidents. In the event of default， very severe penalties will be present， ranging from a minimum of 12 thousand up to 150thousand Euros. In this regard， it is necessary， at the national level，the designation of an intervention group for cyber security in the event of an accident and national authority responsible for the security of networks and information systems. Furthermore， the NIS establishes the cooperation group composed of representatives of the Member States， the Commission and the European Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA)， a team to promote collaboration between the countries of the Union in relation to the security of networks and information systems in order to facilitate the information exchange. The two regulations， i.e.， the GDPR and the NIS directive， overlap when an IT security incident involves violation of personal data .\n\n【23】ElectronicIdentification Authentication and trust Services (eIDAS)\n\n【24】The eIDAS is the European regulation governing electronic signatures， moneyytransfers，andotherrtypes of electronic transactions in the European single market. It has allowed the creation of standards for electronic signatures， digital certificates and other forms of electronic authentication， thus allowing for the replacement of paper documents with digital equivalents that have the same legal value and official recognition in all EU countries. The member countries of the EU are required to recognize electronic signatures that meet the standards set by eIDAS. In particular， it distinguishes three types of signatures inherent sensitive data. The director adheres with local， state， federal and international guidelines for the acquisition of health information， transmission and storage of data by interfacing with electronic medical records and widely available archiving and communication systems， preferably using standards-based interoperability protocols. Imaging performance and diagnostic acquisition devices in ophthalmology should follow periodic manufacturer's recommendations. Diagnostic displays need for periodic checking and recalibration for normal function. The security， integrity， and availability of data (including backup and archiving) are the tasks ofthe IT staff. The setting， i.e.， a medical office， urgent care， emergency or community health care center， should be able to monitor the vital parameters of the test， to make a detailed medical history review， to conduct and transmit telemedicine for ophthalmological examination and to organize appropriate follow-up and care. Telemedicine exams will have different space requirements based on their use of synchronous technology or asynchronous technology. Synchronous visits require space for the patient， the local provider， and the remote provider to conduct the exam in private and discuss the results. Synchronous visits typically require audio and video equipment， a computer to transmit the necessary information about the exam and the devices and technologies to conduct a remote eye examination. Asynchronous visits require space for the necessary imaging equipment， other devices used， and space for the preparation and presentation of images and data. Generally， a small space within an existing clinical space is adequate for telemedicine examinations and consultations. There are few normative indications concerning the personnel who acquire， transmit， and interpret the data of telemedicine.\n\n【25】Each member of the team has the necessary qualifications established by the program. An activity-based (or \"function-based\") assessment of staff requirements is necessary. The reading method for image analysis should be transparent to the applicant. The reading center is responsible for reading errors. The basic requirements for staff involved in ophthalmology telemedicine in a remote imaging site are diagnostic equipment， the awareness of the risks and the clinical estimation of ocular complications due to pupillary dilatation(if imaging is under the mydriatic eyewash)， universal precautions， antiseptic technique， and informed consent. Training for safe and correct contact with patients in a clinical setting， as indicated by applicable hospital and facility standards， is necessary. They are training on specific devices and equipment to obtain the necessary certifications and adherenceto the quality control for the instruments are essential. The ophthalmologists who work as a distant doctor should receive initial training and periodic re-evaluation to meet quality standards for the activities performed. The doctor who reads the test must confirm the coverage of responsibility for medical negligence for this activity by the insurer. An expert reader， under the supervision of the physician， bases the current ophthalmology telemedicine on a store-and-forward model with image acquisition for subsequent evaluation. The most recent applications may involve home-based tests with transmission and web-based interactions by the patient.\n\n【26】Telemedicine relies heavily on the video and audio transmission of data through telecommunications networks. Secure accesses to the network and data transmission are essential for the confidentiality of personal and medical data. The promise of this network is that patient information will be electronically available to authorized personnel wherever the patient is， or information is necessary. The access needs of at least one authentication check (password). The checks ensure that access is available only for authorized users. An appointed individual is responsible for the security of a connected system. All network workers are aware of their responsibilities. All the incidents threating the security are under control. The most obvious way to reduce the risk of unauthorized access to computer data on the Internet is to control traffic through the interface between the local network and the external Internet. This is a function of a firewall. It is important to know that they cannot protect themselves from the traffic that does not cross them. There are different types of firewalls such as the network-wide firewall using a router to make decisions， i.e. what to pass or block based on network protocols， usually Internet Protocol (IP) addresses， an application layer that is a system including a Personal Computer (PC) with two ports (one for entry and the other one for outgoing traffic). A firewall is a mean of ensuring that only the right traffic passes through.\n\n【27】Telemedicine includes four main areas：\n\n【28】Live Drsynchronous aaudio-video telemedicine，一i.e bi-directional real time communication between a patient and a healthcareproviderusinggaudiovisual telecommunication technologies and data collection.\n\n【29】Store-and-forward or asynchronous telemedicine (freely translatable as \"store and return\")， i.e. electronic transmission of health data (images， text or other digital data) to a healthcare provider for the evaluation and provision of the service using methods other than real-time interaction with the patient； it is a technique in which an information， subdivided into packets in its path between the single stations (or nodes) of the network， must be totally received， before it can be retransmitted.\n\n【30】Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM)， i.e. collection of health data directly from the patient， usually during the normal activities of daily life， transmitted to a healthcare provider for analysis and possible actions.\n\n【31】Mobile Health： health care， patient communication and training based on mobile communication platforms， e.g. mobile phones， tablets， PCs，etc.\n\n【32】Encryption is， therefore， a great help to protect telemedicine transmission. There are two types of encryption algorithms. With secret key encryption， the sender and recipient both use the same key to lock and unlock the message. On the contrary， with public-key cryptography， each user has two unique keys， i.e.， a public key and a private key. In private， the key is useful to encrypt any message sent as a digital signature. The recipient can decrypt the signature with the public key to verify the identity and authenticity of the message. The power of digital signatures is that they also detect very slight changes in a message. Informed users naturally expect that the clinical information on the internet is high quality， accurate， timely， and evidence-based. Digital native users have less critical faculties. They are readily aware of the validity of what they read on the internet. Several organizations have tried to establish these principles in guidelines or codes of ethical practice for the construction of Internet sites. The Hi-Ethics consortium is a voluntary group aiming to join the websites and the most used health information providers whose goal is to gain consumer confidence in internet health services. The goals of Hi-Ethics are to offer internet services that reflect ethical and high-quality standards， to provide reliable and up-to-date health information， to keep private and secure personal information and to take special precautions for personal health information. The Hi-Ethics allows consumers to distinguish online health services following these principles from those that do not .\n\n【33】TelemedicalEquipmentand Operational Risks\n\n【34】There are two broad categories of equipment used in telemedicine for the ophthalmology program： information acquisition devices(camera，coherent optical tomography，tonometer，auto refractometer， campimeter， etc.)， image communication devices (computers， servers， network devices， etc.) to send data. The remarkable technological development of biomedical equipment for therapeutic， rehabilitative and diagnostic use has certainly brought great benefits， but it has created， in the health structures， particular problems for the protection ofpersonnel， patients and health workers， mostly from electronic risks. Before using any biomedical equipment， make sure it has undergone regular acceptance testing and that the operators have received adequate and specific training on its correct use. For a long time， the CEI EN 60601-1 standard has been the reference for manufacturers and users of electro-medical devices for the diagnosis and treatment of patients. The international work of adaptation of the norm in these last years， after some modifications published in1991 and 1995， has led to the publication of the third edition in 2006in which the concept of safety has been expanded to include the aspect of the essential performance of electromedical equipment. The experience also extends to the legal aspects of telemedical equipment. The basis of this legislative framework is the Consumer Protection Act of 1987 dealing with the general responsibility for artisanal products and applied to the teleconsultations equipment . The regulations apply to Computed Tomography (CT) scanners， X-rays， ultrasounds， etc. All these devices (including new videoconferences and related equipment) must show the European Conformity (CE) mark indicating that they comply with the appropriate safety， quality， and performance standards. The Medical Devices Agency (MDA) is also responsible for registering the manufacturer and reporting incidents， as well as for the general implementation and promotion of European directives. MDA has identified the repeated causes of adverse incidents with medical devices such as poor quality， outdated or worn-out devices， and incompatibility with auxiliary equipment， poor documentation， inappropriate use， inadequate training， maintenance errors or lack of assistance. These comments mainly refer to the malfunctions of the operational equipment . Several devices are useful to communicate remotely， such as a video conferencing unit， e-mail， webcam， or Smartphone. The channel allowing communication can be broadband， network， or wireless. The operational risks are those identified by the MDA as the main causes of adverse accidents. The analysis of these cases shows that they fall into two categories： inadequacies due to technology and those due to insufficient staff. We can distinguish four main technological risks involving：\n\n【35】The image quality： a patient has the right to expect that a consultant can draw the same correct conclusions from an image on a telemedicine screen as from a conventional face-to-face visit， particularly important for Ophthalmology surveys.\n\n【36】The lack of suitable equipment for a health service.\n\n【37】Malfunctioning equipment：thebreakdown of the computer or video equipment is unfortunately one of the most common features of telemedicine.\n\n【38】Inadequate guidelines： Guidelines are as a bridge between technology and participants in teleconsulting. The guidelines determine the teleconsultation process and the documentation provides an archive of therapy， prescriptions， dosages of drugs， plans，etc. This combination of protocol and recording of the action provides a powerful audit trail that can have considerable value in any legal dispute.\n\n【39】In Italy， the Directorate General for Medical Devices and the Pharmaceutical Service is responsible for the completion and implementation of the regulation of medical devices， including tasks related to market surveillance， accident monitoring， clinical investigations， and evaluation of technologies and address of Health Technology Assessment (HTA) activities . As regards the operational risks due to the staff， the Commission refers to the definition of \"healthcare professionals\" as defined in the article 3/f of the Directive 2011/24/EU . Healthcare professional is the doctor， the nurse responsible for the general care， the dentist， the midwife， or the pharmacist according to the Directive 2005/36/EC. We have principles to ensure that each team member is aware of his responsibilities and those of the other members. The patient should alsoknow who is responsible forhis care. These are simpleprecautions to avoid complaints of negligence. Telemedicine has sensitizedpeople on issues that underline legislative discrepancy about the problem of accreditation and qualifications of health staff to protect the patient from incompetent professionals .\n\n【40】Discussion\n\n【41】The benefits of telemedicine are promising and， mainly， in ophthalmology， that is a specialization based on diagnostic imaging. The application of telemedicine is useful for patients， for ophthalmologists and health institutions as it allows access to medical care，it avoids unnecessarylong movements，and it increasestheprofits by reaching patients， by expanding the spectrum of available services and by reducing health care costs and waiting lists. Telemedicine in ophthalmology allows collaboration between professionals from different locations， sometimes even from different countries. It simplifies， through different telecommunications channels and mobile technologies， direct patient access to ophthalmologists who practice in another city or country without requiring any of the participants to travel. However， some characteristics of telemedicine can become problematic， such as the violation of privacy， the physical distance， the inclusion of new technological methods， the purchase of expensive equipment， the weakening of the doctor/patient relationship， the involuntary increase in opportunities for incorrect behavior， the delegation of functions due to the remote nature of the treatment process， etc. Health professionals should consider that telemedicine could lead them to face further potential medical errors within a substantially more challenging standard of care. The EU has not yet issued specific rules on medical liability， despite its specific features， and this gap can jeopardize the development of telemedicine inEurope， thus denying all its benefits to European patients. However， the EU will not be able to create a uniform regulation covering all aspects of telemedicine， but it has already taken a step forward in terms of technology and privacy， which are already well-defined topics under European law. As regards the rights of patients in the field of telemedicine， the EU will be able to create some basic guidelines in the context of cross-border healthcare patients rights. The rights of European patients still lack a set of uniform rules and the standardization in such a complex area as telemedicine； perhaps it would not be the best choice. We cannot expect harmonized rules for the medical responsibility deriving from telemedicine. Member States have very different national laws to address these issues because the EU brings together models of continental law and common law models. Because of this intrinsic difference， the attempt to harmonize civil liability， especially criminal liability， will be doomed to fail. It would be the scope for each Member State to provide a legal framework for telemedicine， while the role of the EU would be limited to requiring the Member States to regulate it. Most of the legal issues we have considered so fartend to fall into two well-defined categories：problems that have a frequent basis with conventional medicine and those that are specific to telemedicine.\n\n【42】When telemedicine takes place across national borders， or in Europe， there is likely to be even more opportunity for legal discord on which laws to apply； i.e.， the laws of the country where the telepatient is present or of the country where the teleconsultation took place. What happens if telemedicine is legal to practice in one country but is not in another? We need to confirm a telemedicine task force in ophthalmology involving the academic and research world by using excellent resources， and collaboration between the Italian Ophthalmology Society， the Italian Association of Doctors Ophthalmologists and the Society of Legal Medicine in Ophthalmology to establish the legislation and guidelines of the telemedicine. Thehealth manager or health director oftelemedicine is necessary to avoid the delegation of care to less qualified subordinates and to establish their competences and responsibilities. Telemedicine is not a defined discipline to justify the professional accreditation of \"Ophthalmologist Specialist in Telemedicine.\" Tele-education or eLearning should become a standardized process with certification requirement as well as continuous courses are necessary to spread the current European legislation in telemedicine both at the Ministry of Health and Medical Orders levels in all Italian regions. In conclusion， it is a good investment of efforts and resources because the worldwide future oftelemedicine in ophthalmology undoubtedly promises well.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 10:42:18", "endTime": "2024/09/24 10:42:40", "cost": 22.425}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:32", "update_time": "2024-09-23 18:42:40", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 18:42:17"}

More than 70% of cases of Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) worldwide are caused by Sickle Cell Anemia(SCA) . Sickle-cell disease is a major global public health issue and the most common life-threatening genetic disorder worldwide. However， despite being the most prevalent genetic disease in Africa， the serious health and sociodemographic consequences are largely ignored .\n\n【2】It has been estimated that approximately 90% of the world's SCD population lives in these three countries： Nigeria， India， and the Democratic Republic of Congo ， where the disease affects 2% of the population and carriers (sickle cell trait) account for 10% to 30% of all cases . In Nigeria alone， there are estimated to be 150，000 babies born with SCD every year， which is 20 per 1000 births .\n\n【3】In SCD， the oxygen-carrying protein hemoglobin is abnormally altered in red blood cells， resulting in an autosomal recessive genetic blood disorder. Those with HbS develop deformed red blood cells (erythrocytes)， which become hard and sticky under stress and resemble a C-shaped farm tool called a 'sickle. Due to the short lifespan of sickle cells， anemia is often caused by the constant shortage of red blood cells .\n\n【4】In order to establish a clinical classification based on severity， it is necessary to search for factors responsible for the clinical variability of SCD. By using this classification， management can be optimized and follow-up matched to each patient's actual risk . As a result， understanding the genetics underlying the heritable sub-phenotypes of SCD， specifically for each population， would be useful for prognosis and could help to tailor therapeutic interventions. Numerous studies have been devoted to genetic modulating factors of SCD . Fetal Hemoglobin (HbF) concentration is one of the major modifiers of the Sickle Cell Disease which directly affects the sickle erythrocyte and is a major modulator of the phenotype of the disease . Fetal Hemoglobin (HbF) concentration is the most powerful modifier of the clinical and hematological features of the Sickle Cell Disease (SCD). Understanding the genetics underlying the heritable sub phenotypes of sickle cell anemia would be prognostically useful. This could inform personalized therapeutics， and might help the discovery of new “drug gable\" pathophysiologic targets .\n\n【5】Five typical haplotypes have been described across the B-globin gene cluster based upon the pattern of specific restriction fragment-length polymorphisms across the region . Four haplotypes are associated with HbS in Africa (Benin， Bantu/Central African Republic， Senegal and Cameroon) and the fifth is thought to have arisen in India and/or the Arabian Peninsula (Arab/Hindu) . It has been suggested that these haplotypes also have an effect on the severity of the disease through their genetically determined effect on HbF level . Verylow HbF and hematocrit are associated with SCD individuals carrying Bantu (Central African Republic) haplotype and they mostly present with severe clinical complications . Meanwhile， clinical presentations of individuals with Senegal or Arab-India haplotype are usually mild due to high levels of HbF and hematocrit. Clinical course of persons with Benin haplotype is in between the Bantu and Arab/India haplotypes. Benin haplotype， associated with low HbF level， is the predominant haplotype in Nigeria with a frequency of 93.2% to 97% . The mean HbF among Nigerian SCD patients is about 6% .\n\n【6】Genetic association at the three principalloci have been identified， SNPs in major loci that are associated with different HbF levels in patients with SCD and in healthy adults. The BCL11A gene is located on chromosome 2 (2p16) and the HBS1L-MYB intergenic region on chromosome 6(6q23).\n\n【7】The HBS1L-MYB Intergenic Polymorphisms (HMIP) are present in three Linkage Disequilibrium (LD) blocks with most of the effect on HbF levels and numbers of F cells contributed by the second block. Among the causes of unusually high HbF levels are deletions or single base substitutions in the HBB gene cluster and Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) in the genes.HBS1L-MYB： known main HbF sub-loci in this region， HMIP-2A (tagged by rs66650371). The SNP rs66650371， the functional 3-bp deletion in the MYB enhancer， is one of the most significant SNPs in the HMIP region .\n\n【8】Methodology\n\n【9】This was a cross-sectional hospital-based study to investigate the fetal hemoglobin variant HBSIL-MYB in individuals with sickle cell anemia and their phenotypic presentations with a view of providing explanations on strategy for reducing the burden of the disease in Nigeria. All suspected homozygous sickle cell patients attending Sickle cell clinics of Adeoyo Hospital and University College Hospital from age thirteen above in the period of the study was enrolled， 260blood samples of Sickle cell Patients were collected for this study.\n\n【10】Hematological and Hemoglobin analyses\n\n【11】A total of 7 ml blood sample was collected from each participant and dispensed into Ethylene Diamine Tetra Acetic acid (EDTA)， for laboratory analysis. The Packed Cell Volume (PCV) was measured to determine the proportion of the volume occupied by the Red Blood Cellsto the volume ofthe whole blood. The PCV was determinedusing the hematocrit reading device . Fetal Hemoglobin Concentration(HbF)， was determined using Betke method . The quantity of hemoglobin is measured to the proportion of alkali-resistant (fetal) hemoglobin is then calculated as a percentage of the fetal hemoglobin present.\n\n【12】Molecular analysis\n\n【13】DNA extraction was done from archived buffy coat by using Da An Gene Kit， following the manufacturers protocol. ARMS-PCR reaction was carried out in 25 uL total volume to amplify the DNA segment . ARMS is based on the use of sequence-specific PCR primers that allow amplification of test DNA only when the target allele is contained within the sample. The Amplification-Refractory Mutation System (ARMS) is a simple method for detecting any mutation involving single base change or small deletions.\n\n【14】Statistical analysis\n\n【15】Data obtained was statistically analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) software version 24.0. Chi-square was used to determine the association between HbF and the genetic variants.P values ≤ 0.05 at 95% confidence interval was considered significant. Descriptive analysis was used to present the frequencies of outcomes. Genetic association analysis was performed by multiple regression， with age and sex as covariates (SPSS v.20).\n\n【16】Results\n\n【17】The genetic variant rs66650371 (HBS1L-MYB) was genotyped from 260 SCA patients， and its effect on HbF levels， phenotypic variables and PCV were investigated. The mean age is 23.0±0.6 (SE).\n\n【18】Table 1 shows the prevalence of Vaso-occlusive crises among SCD patients across one year. Higher HbFlevels have been associated to benefit some complications of the disease than others， examples of some of its benefit include， reduced rate of acute painful episodes， fewer leg ulcers， less frequent acute chest syndromes and reduced disease severity . These Vaso-occlusive variables were the bench mark used to determine how severe and how frequent participants experience crises in this study. About 59.2% of the population experiences chest symptoms at least once in a year while only 15.2%experiences leg ulcers. The high frequency of sickle crises amongst the participants is similar to what has been reported in a previous study in Nigeria， which revealed that there is an overall increase in the frequency of Vaso-occlusive crises among SCD patients . This situation is consistent with the trend in some countries such as Britain and Saudi Arabia .\n\n【19】Table 2 shows the relationship between Vaso-occlusive variables， HbF and PCV values among SCD patients. The HbF Concentration ranged from 1.8% to 12%， the mean HbFlevel of patients in this study was 4.9 ± 2.4 percent， which is lower than what has been reported in a study in Ife， Nigeria . The mean HbF was 9.9 ±6.0 percent. This difference may be as a result of the different methods used in the estimation of fetal hemoglobin levels in both studies， or the mean age of the populations， for instance， report from Ife showed the age range recruited for their study was 1 to 15 years， at this stage， fetal hemoglobin levels are not yet stable， this might account for the discrepancy in the mean fetal hemoglobin levels of both studies. The mean Hbf of this study is close to a study that evaluated the fetal hemoglobin concentration levels of individuals in Ibadan (5.16±4.04) . There was no statistical difference in the mean HbF levels of males and females. Although， males had higher HbF levels compared to females.\n\n【20】Table 1： Prevalence of Vaso-occlusive crises in SCD patients.\n\n| Number of Crises in a year， N=260  |  | Chest painN=260  | Leg Ulcer N=260  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Once= 130 (50%)  |  | Yes=154 (59.2%)  | Yes=41 (15.8%)  |  |\n| Twice =26(10%)  |  | No= 106 (40.7%)  | No=219 (84.2%)  |  |\n| Quarterly= 104 (40%)  |  |  |  |  |\n\n【22】Table 2： Relationship between Vaso-occlusive Variables， HbF and PCV.\n\n| Vaso-occlusive Variables  | Low HbF  | High HbF  | Low PCV  | High PCV  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Leg Ulcer， Yes  | 68.30%  | 31.7%  | 71.5%  | 28.5%  |\n| No  | 53.00%  | 47.0%  | 55.5%  | 44.5%  |\n| Chest Pain， Yes  | 71.40%  | 28.5%  | 74.5%  | 25.5%  |\n| No  | 41.1  | 58.8%  | 30%  | 70%  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n\n【24】PCV count is also significantly increased in patients with high HbF levels than in patients with low HbFlevels which is also in line to a study done in Tanzania ， how the beneficial effects of elevated HbF seen in their studyreduced anemia，leukocytosis and thrombosis. Increased PCV counts reduces anemia， which is common to SCD patients. Also， the average mean of males PCV was higher compared to that of females. about 80% of them also had increased level of PCV counts， this is agreement to the genetic study of fetal hemoglobin in SCD in Nigeria. Also， there was a reduced severity of the disease in patients with rs66650371， more than two-third of the patients with rs66650371experiences mild crises about once a year，while the others experiences about twice in a year.\n\n【25】Conclusion\n\n【26】The present study demonstrated the presence and beneficial effect of fetal hemoglobin， and HBSIL-MYB gene with SCD patients. The number of Vaso-occlusive crises， such as acute chest pain，leg ulcer is significantly indirectly proportional to elevated HbF levels. Patients with reduced HbF levels， have repetitive number of Vaso-occlusive crises in a year. The 3bp deletion of rs66650371 has been associated with elevated levels of HbF and mild Vaso-occlusive crises among SCD patients in Ibadan， Nigeria.\n\n【27】Facilities for early and regular quantification of fetal hemoglobin should be made available in Sickle cell Clinics and Hospitals in Nigeria.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 10:46:09", "endTime": "2024/09/24 10:46:50", "cost": 40.443}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:32", "update_time": "2024-09-23 18:46:49", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 18:46:08"}

This should not be underestimated due to high association with other morbidity and highly recurrence rate when compared with adults .\n\n【10】The consistency of urolithiasis composed of different organic and inorganic biominerals with amorphous or crystalline structure . Stones' composition comprises nearly of 40% to 65% of calcium oxalate， 14% to 30% of calcium phosphate，10% to 20% of struvite，5%to 10% of cystine， and1% to 4% of uric acid. Rare comprise of xanthine， or 2，8-dihydroxyadenine .\n\n【11】The case of a child girl reported with renal stone who was the single sibling of her family， no previous medical problems except for recurrent urinary tract infection. Negative family history of urolithiasis was noted， presented with flank pain.\n\n【12】Laboratory examination revealed the following： hemoglobin： 18.3 g/dl， white blood cell count，6300/lL. MCV： 65.03 FL， MCH： 19.88 PG， serum phosphorus： 5.1 mg/dL， serum calcium 10.2 mg/dl， serum uric acid： 3.7 mg/dl and serum createnine： 0.53 m/dl.

It is increasing in some world regions when compared to adults and the incidence increase from one year to the next and more predominant among boys than girls .\n\n【17】The most common presenting symptoms of urolithiasis in children are abdominal or flank pain， dysuria， oliguria， hematuria， sterile pyuria， urinary tract infection and vomiting . In this regard， our case report the girl was presented with hematuria and flank pain.\n\n【18】Calcium oxalate stones are radiolucent and the main difference from uric acid stones which are also radiolucent and have identical chemical reactivity.

Positive family history is very common in most children with urolithiasis ，and considered an important factor in diagnosis of the urolithiasis ， however， in our case there was negative family history ofurolithiasis.\n\n【20】The problem of Conventional radiography which may missed small even radio-opaque stones in the kidney or ureter and gives no information about possible obstruction . So ultrasonography is first choice imaging modality for diagnosis of suspected pediatric urolithiasis . It is also recommended by the European Association of Urology and American Urological Association as the initial diagnostic imaging of choice for suspected urolithiasis in children .\n\n【21】The reasons are a lack of familiarity with DHA stones among clinicians/pathologists， the absence of practice of routine stone analysis and confusion of DHA stone with uric acid and/or xanthine stones as these are radiolucent. Although the identification of DHA on a stone analysis is highly suggestive， there can be a false identification of DHA as a kidney stone component by infrared and ultraviolet spectrophotometry and/or X-ray crystallography. Birefringent Maltese cross pattern as seen under polarized light microscopy represent either lipid particles， DHA crystals， or starch(latex gloves) .\n\n【22】By searching in data bases and health records， this is the first case to be reported in a child from Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Possible Causes of under reporting due to the lack of awareness of this disorder or inadequate patients evaluation for renal stones， or missed diagnosis where DHA crystals in urine analysis are confused with urate or oxalate， and the wrong diagnosis of radiolucent DHA stones as uric acid stones.\n\n【23】The 2，8-dihydroxyadenine (DHA) stones are rare forms of urolithiasis that occurs in patients with Adenine Phosphoribosyl Transferase (APRT) deficiency. Standard chemical and thermogravimetric analysis does not differentiate DHA stones from uric acid or xanthine stones， and either infrared or ultraviolet spectroscopy is required to make the diagnosis .\n\n【24】Conclusion\n\n【25】Renal stones could be presented even among pediatric group even with negative family history.\n\n【26】Ultrasound is the first choice imaging modality for diagnosis of suspected renal stones； CT could be used for follow up.

We report a 52-year-old woman who presented with persistent shoulder and back pain accompanied by muscular atrophy of the left upper limb， intermittent headache， and with gradual aggravation for one year. The preoperative diagnosis was difficult and the final postoperative pathological diagnosis was FVPTC. After locoregional and systemic treatments， brain metastasis initialy gradualy shrank and disappeared， but lung， bone， and brain metastases finally enlarged. Eventually， she died of malnutrition and cachexia. FVPTC always shows benign sonographic features and atypical histological and cytologic characteristics. It is easy to misdiagnose. I-131 ablation may be insufficient in patients with FVPTC at high risk， but can alleviate clinical symptoms， reduce metastasis， improve quality of life， and prolong survival.\n\n【2】Keywords： Follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma； FVPTC； Multiple metastases； I-131 treatment； survival； Papillary thyroid carcinoma\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Follicular Variant of Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma (FVPTC) accounts for 23% to 41% of PTC . FVPTC was first described by Dailey et al.  in 1950， who characterized FVPTC as having the nuclear features of conventional PTC but with a follicular growth pattern. A definitive preoperative diagnosis of FVPTC based on fine-needle aspiration cytology is not possible， because signs of malignancy depend on the typical nuclear features of conventional PTC . In addition， the features of benign and other neoplastic follicular lesions overlap， which can be affected by inter observer variability .\n\n【5】Patients with FVPTC or conventional PTC are treated similarly. The standard recommendation has been radioactive Iodine (I-131) ablation for all tumors 21 cm in diameter， and then thyroid stimulating hormone suppression and close follow-up . FVPTC is noted as being less aggressive， with a lower incidence of thyroid capsule invasion， extra thyroidal extension， and lymph node metastases . However， other studies found that FVPTC tended to have a higher rate of distant metastasis compared with conventional PTC ， a higher rate of histologic vascular invasion， and during follow-up a higher rate of recurrence . FVPTC patients with distant metastasis have a relatively poor outcome 23.\n\n【6】Here in， we report a case of FVPTC with several unique features including wide spread metastasis and difficult preoperative diagnosis. We also describe the comprehensive management of this patient.\n\n【7】Case Presentation\n\n【8】In early 2013， a52-year-old woman presented with first symptoms ofpersistent shoulder and back pain accompanied by muscular atrophy of the left upper limb and intermittent headache. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) showed space-occupying lesions in the seventh cervical vertebrae，the first thoracic and left frontal lobe. Bone and brain metastases were considered. In July 2013， the patient underwent resection of the space-occupying lesion in the spinal canal. Postoperative pathology suggested intraspinal metastatic moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma， approximately originating from the lung or thyroid. Computed Tomography (CT) scan showed multiple nodules in both lungs. The thyroid ultrasound displayed a hypoechoic nodule in her right lobe and a nodule with cystic and solid components in her left lobe，and no obvious malignant features of the thyroid nodules. Positron Emission Tomography (PET)-CT revealed multiple pulmonary， skeletal， and intracranial metastases from an unknown primary focus. After radiotherapy for cervical spine and brain metastases with a dose of40G/20F in August 2013， she still suffered intermittent headache. In November 2013， pathology indicated an intraspinal mass and metastatic thyroid carcinoma (follicular subtype).\n\n【9】In November 2013 the patient complained of intermittent headache， nausea， and vomiting and was admitted to our hospital. The physical examination found muscle atrophy of the left upper arm， fore arm and left dorsal with muscle strength； volar contracture of the ring finger and with inextensible and normal muscle strength of the lower limbs. The preliminary questionable diagnosis was thyroid cancer， lung cancer， or other malignancy. Thyroid color Doppler ultrasound examination showed a suspicious cystic solid thyroid nodule in the left lobe that might be benign； and a right lobe thyroid hypoechoic nodule that might be cancer .\n\n【10】A lymph node examined by color Doppler ultrasound showed no definite abnormality. Ultrasound-guided core needle biopsies of thyroid nodules were performed. The pathological report was benign thyroid follicles and fibro-muscular tissue . This was a clinical contradictory conclusion-the intraspinal metastasis was considered PTC metastasis by the pathological report， but no malignant figures were found in the ultrasonography and biopsy specimen. Laboratory tests revealed normal thyroid function and elevated Thyroglobulin (Tg)： Thyroglobulin (Tg) >475 ng/mL (3.5ng/mL to 77 ng/mL). The PET-CT scan showed high metabolism in the right thyroid lobe， multiple metastases in both sides of the lung， multiple bone metastases， and metastasis in the parietal lobe of the left brain . In December 2013， the patient underwent total thyroidectomy； the pathological report was papillary thyroid carcinoma of the right lobe thyroid， follicular subtype， invasion of capsule， and gross tumor size 1.5 cm x1.3 cmx 1.2 cm .\n\n【11】In August 2014， the patient was given cervical and cranial radiotherapy. I-131 treatment (200 mCi) was administered 4 times during January 2014 and November 2015. In addition， the patient received the following： Thyroid stimulating hormone inhibition therapy； targeted therapy (oral administration of sorafenib mesylate)； surgicaltreatment for bone metastases； mannitolandhormone for the treatment of brain edema；pain relief； and other supportive treatments. Brain metastases initially gradually shrank and disappeared ， and headache and vomiting were alleviated. However， the lung， bone and brain metastases were enlarged at last in November 2015. She died of malnutrition and cachexia in early June 2016.\n\n【12】Discussion\n\n【13】FVPTC is composed of cells with nuclear features ofconventional PTC with a follicular architecture . Three clinicopathological entities have been recognized in FVPTC： Encapsulated/Non-Invasive(E/NI)-FVPTC with a more indolent behavior； infiltrative FVPTC， whose behavior is closer to conventional PTC； and a multinodular/diffuse form characterized by aggressive clinical behavior， giving rise to nodal and distant metastases . In the present case， the ultrasonic manifestations of thyroid were like that of E/NI-FVPTC， but the biological behaviors were closer to the multinodular/diffuse form of FVPTC with lung， bone， and brain metastases. However， there was no cervicallymph node metastasis in this case. A verylarge proportion of FVPTCs are histologically difficult to distinguish from benign follicularlesions such as follicular adenoma， especially by fine- metastasis and right pelvic bone metastasis was enlarged. needle aspiration biopsy . This was also seen in the present case. Tg is an independent predictor of malignancy， and in patients with thyroid nodules， Tg should be determined before surgery， especially when cytology is indeterminate . The level of Tg in our patient increased significantly before thyroidectomy， which signaled thyroid malignancy. In addition， immunohistochemical examination combined with genetic tests can improve the diagnostic rate .\n\n【14】For the treatment of metastasis， we reviewed the guidelines for radio iodine therapy of differentiated thyroid cancer recommended by the Chinese Society of Nuclear Medicine (2021 edition) . For lung metastases， I-131 treatment is the first choice. Although I-131treatment may not cure bone metastases with large bone destruction， it can often significantly reduce serum Tg level， relieve pain， improve quality oflife， and prolong survival. Brain metastasis is more common in advanced elderly patients， with poor prognosis. Surgical treatment or external beam radiation therapy should be considered first. I-131treatment is an adjunct to surgeryor radiotherapy for brain metastases. In severe cases， brain hernia and other life-threatening reactions may occur. Therefore， I-131 treatment should be accompanied by glucocorticoid therapy， and patients must be closely observed. In the present case， mannitol treatment for high intracranial pressure and dexamethasone for infective brain edema were used before and after I-131. The brain metastases initially gradually shrank and disappeared and the headache and vomiting symptoms were alleviated.\n\n【15】After multiple I-131 treatments， some iodine-uptake metastases still showed disease progression within one year， including gradual growth of the lesions， emergence of new lesions， and continuous increase of Tg in serum， despite maintaining iodine-uptake ability. This is called Radioactive Iodine-Refractory (RAIR)-Differentiated Thyroid Cancer (DTC) . Lenvatinib and sorafenib have been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration， and many other drugs are in trials for the treatment of advanced metastatic RAIR-DTC . Unfortunately， the efficacy of tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment is limited due to the lack of strong cytotoxic action， fast development of resistance， and side effects . Immunotherapy is also a promising alternative option for RAIR-DTC. The anti-tumor activity of the anti-PDL1 monoclonal antibody pembrolizumab has been evaluated in advanced PD-L1-positive DTC with promising results . However， very few clinical trials have been accomplished.\n\n【16】Conclusion\n\n【17】The available options for patients with metastasizing FVPTC include surgical resection， radio iodine， thyroid stimulating hormone-suppression， locoregional and adjuvant/adjunctive and targeted treatments， immunotherapy， and other novel approaches. None of these are adequate， but the immediate and long-term prospects of individualized targeted therapy look bright.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 11:11:59", "endTime": "2024/09/24 11:13:29", "cost": 89.893}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:32", "update_time": "2024-09-23 19:13:28", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 19:11:58"}

Some of them are transient in nature， while others remain for the rest of the patient’slife. Dramatic changes do not bypass the Thyroid Gland(TG). Against the background of pregnancy， both hypo- and hyperthyroidism can develop， which should be diagnosed and treated in time. Sometimes changes in thyroid function are so unexpected that they become an unpleasant surprise for a young mother and her doctor.\n\n【2】Clinical Case\n\n【3】A 26-year-old patient with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) was admitted to the endocrinology department. T1DM was diagnosed in 2005 at the age of 10 years. At the onset of the disease， basal-bolus insulin therapy was started.\n\n【4】In October 2018， she became pregnant (at the time of pregnancy， high glycemia levels were noted with high variability from 2 mmol/l to 21 mmol/l)， however， due to an embryony diagnosed at 9 to 10 weeks of pregnancy， vacuum aspiration of the uterine cavity was performed. Due to poor control of diabetes， an insulin pump was installed.\n\n【5】For the second pregnancy careful assessment was performed， including regular TSH control. A repeated increase in TSH up to 3.1 uIU/ml to 3.3 uIU/ml (0.0) was noticed.\n\n【6】There was a decrease in thyroid tissue echogenicity and diffuse heterogeneity according to the ultrasound data. FT4 (18.46 pmol/l(8.7)) and fT3 (5.18 pmol/ (2.45)) were within the normal range with elevated Antibodies to Thyroid Peroxidase (TPOAb) 104.6 IU/ml (<60)， Antibodies to TSH receptors (TSHrAb) were not detected. Taking into account the presence of T1DM and increased TPOAb in combination with slightly elevated TSH during pregnancy planning，levothyroxine 50 mcg/day was prescribed.\n\n【7】Just before pregnancy TSH decreased to 1.3 pIU/ml. During pregnancy， there was a decrease in TSH to a minimum of <0.004 uIU/ml，levothyroxine treatment was cancelled and at the time of childbirth in July 2021 TSH level was 2.139 uIU/ml.\n\n【8】Two months after delivery there was a decrease in T'SH to 0.028pIU/ml. After another 3 months， the patient noticed a significant glycemic variability during the day and was admitted to hospital with high glycaemia.\n\n【9】A decrease in TSH to 0.008 uIU/ml was determined with increase in fT4 up to 31.7 pmol/l(8.7) and fT3 up to 12.8 pmol/l (2.45)， TSHrAb were determined (5.12 IUA (<1)). In a hospital tachycardia with heart rate up to 100 beats/min to 120 beats/min was revealed. According to ultrasound of the thyroid gland， the total volume was 6.7 cm， with diffuse changes in the tissue. So， she was diagnosed with Graves' disease.\n\n【10】Thus， the diagnosis “Autoimmune polyglandular syndrome type 3\"as a combination of T1DM and Graves disease was established. As the lactation at the time oftreatment was stopped，antithyroid therapy with thiamazole 10 mg 2 times a day was initiated. Bisoprolol 7.5 mg was prescribed as pulse-lowering therapy.\n\n【11】Approximately 1 month after starting the drug， the patient noted an allergic reaction in the form of erythema on the back ofthe hands. Thiamazole was replaced by propylthiouracil at a dose of50 mg 3 times a day. Against this background， there was a rapid trend towards normalization of the skin condition .\n\n【12】Despite the irregular intake of the drug， a dynamic study after 1and 3 months after the start of therapy showed normal fT4 and fT3and elevation ofTSH， and therefore the dosage ofpropylthiouracil was reduced to 50 mg 2 times a day. Further， the patient also took the drug irregularly. There were some fluctuations in TSH level， however， over the next 7 months， both TSH and thyroid hormones were within the reference values， TSHrAb returned to normal range. As she stopped treatment and had target TSH after 4 months of discontinuation，we didn't resume anti-thyroid treatment and continue monitoring TSH.\n\n【13】Discussion\n\n【14】Despite significant differences in the pathogenesis and clinical presentation between Autoimmune Thyroiditis (AIT) and Grave's Disease (GD) a conversion of one autoimmune disease to another is described in the literature. Observations of the transition of GD to AIT are more common， and much less frequently we can see the development of GD in a patient with AIT. According to one theory， this is due to the absence of a critical mass of thyroid tissue capable to respond to TSHrAb in people with a long history of AIT . In any case， hypothyroidism and thyrotoxicosis can occur consecutively in the same patient.\n\n【15】According to literature， it becomes obvious that the problem is quite rare in relation to the generalprevalence of autoimmune thyroid disorders， and therefore it is valuable to describe each clinical case.\n\n【16】The reasons for the switch in thyroid function are not completely clear at the moment， however， it is clear that there are several factors that， both individuallyor in combination， can influence the transition from hypo- to hyperthyroidism and vice versa. First of all， this may be due to switching between stimulating (TSAb) and blocking(TBAb) TSHrAb. It was traditionally believed that patients with thyrotoxicosis have only TSAb， and patients with hypothyroidism have only TBAb. However， both types of antibodies can circulate in the same patient. Thyroid function may fluctuate depending on predominating antibodies .\n\n【17】Exact factors leading to the switch from the production of one type of TSHrAb to others aren’t known for certain. There are observations that changes in the type of antibodies sometimes occur under the influence of levothyroxine or antithyroid drugs. During treatment period the concentration and mode of action of antibodies can change .\n\n【18】Another possible explanation for the transition from hypo- to hyperthyroidism is that the thyroid tissue， which has undergone very serious autoimmune damage that has led to hypofunction of the gland， eventually recovers sufficiently to respond to subsequent exposure to stimulating antibodies . In addition， there are theories that the thyroid function can switch under the influence of various external factors， such as viral infection， pregnancy can also trigger the changes .\n\n【19】In case of our patient， there are several options for the causes of GD manifestation after childbirth. According to one theory， pregnancy was the stimulus for the conversion of hypothyroidism into thyrotoxicosis. During pregnancy， thyroid autoantibody levels usually decrease due to immunosuppression and/or hemodilution and are the lowest shortly before delivery， especially stimulatory T'SHrAb levels. However， in the postpartum period， the levels of anti-thyroid antibodies are restored， and then can even increase .\n\n【20】According to the second theory， the conversion occurred under the influence of levothyroxine treatment. It is believed that can happen either due to the restoration of thyroid tissue and the better response to circulating TSAb， or due to a decrease in the number of TBAb during levothyroxine treatment and a comparative increase in TSAb. In our patient， mostlikely， the trigger for the development of Graves’ disease could be both the pregnancy itself and the use of levothyroxine. Unfortunately， there is no data on TSHrAb level before pregnancy， so it will not be possible to establish a precise cause retrospectively As such clinical observations occur sometimes in patients， they are really important for doctors， since in clinical practice a decrease in TSH in a patient treated with levothyroxine， in most cases will be regarded as an overdose of it， which may lead to dose reduction and loss of time， while detection of GD can significantly change the treatmentand favorably affect the prognosis ofthe disease，preventing the development of complications.\n\n【21】Whatever the genesis of the development of GD in our patient， the value of this clinical case is that a patient with T1DM got a second autoimmune disease after pregnancy-GD. Thus， we can diagnose the autoimmune polyglandular syndrome type 3. This clinical case makes us remember the increased risk of developing a second autoimmune disease in patients with T1DM， which may manifest many years after the onset of diabetes， while pregnancy may trigger its manifestation.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 11:05:05", "endTime": "2024/09/24 11:05:32", "cost": 27.401}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:32", "update_time": "2024-09-23 19:05:30", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 19:05:03"}

These disorders start early during the insufficiency Chronic Renal Disease (CRF)， they are seen from stage 3 of the chronic kidney disease. They include at least one of these three components which are often associated： Abnormalities of the metabolism of calcium， phosphorus， Parathyroid Hormone (PTH) or vitamin D， abnormalities in bone turnover， mineralization， its volume， its growth and its solidity and vascular calcifications or other soft tissue. These complications and their impact on the vital prognosis justify appropriate prevention and treatment. The objective of our study is to determine the phosphocalcic status and the prevalence of OMT in our chronic hemodialysis patients and to assess the degree of adherence to the KDIGO2017 recommendations.\n\n【8】Methods\n\n【9】We carried out a retrospective multicenter study in nine hemodialysis centers (2 CHP，6 private，1 CHU) in the region of CASABLANCA， including 658 hemodialysis patients on a 12-month urea(03/01/2017 to 02/28/2018).\n\n【10】We collected our patient data from medical records and dialysis notebooks as well as history and physical examination.\n\n【11】The socio-demographic and clinical parameters used were as follows： Age， sex， length of hemodialysis， the different hemodialysis parameters： weight sec， Systolic and Diastolic Blood Pressure (SBP， DBP)， dialysis dose (Kt/V) and number of sessions/week. The presence of functional signs including pain bone pain， arthralgia， muscle fatigue， pain during walking， itching， and the presence of a red eye， with a detailed osteoarticular examination.\n\n【12】Radiological signs of hyperparathyroidism or a dynamic osteopathy have been researched on standard radiographs by stereotypes profile skull， hands， lumbar spine and pelvis. The cardiac ultrasound allowed us to assess the condition heart and also to look for valvular calcifications. Parathyroid ultrasound was performed in all patients who had hyperparathyroidism. Parathyroid scintigraphy was not systematic； indicated in patients who had tertiary hyperparathyroidism requiring treatment surgical. Statistical analyzes were carried out with SPSS 10.0 software for Windows.\n\n【13】Results\n\n【14】The average age of our patients was 49 ± 14.6 years， with a predominance of men， and an M/F sex ratio of 1.3. Causal nephropathy was undetermined in 48.3%， diabetic in 19.3% of cases . The length of time in hemodialysis was 12 years ± 9.05.89.7% of patients were hemodialysis 3 sessions per week on arteriovenous fistulas in95.8% of cases. The average dry weight was 58.5 kg (+/-10.7)， with an average PAS of 120±20 mmHg and a kt/v at 1.2±0.2 .\n\n【15】Bone pain was present in 47.6% of patients.

In patients with hyperparathyroidism aspects the most frequently found radiological following：\n\n【25】Diffuse bone demineralization found in 40%.\n\n【26】- Vascular calcifications (excluding those objectives by the choceur) were found in 20%.\n\n【27】- The resorption under periosteum of the phalanges present in15% of cases.\n\n【28】-Geodes in 21% of cases.\n\n【29】-7 cases of spontaneous fracture during minimal trauma.\n\n【30】Cervical ultrasound routinely performed in patients with hyperparathyroidism， returning pathological in 60% of cases：parathyroid adenoma in 34% and a thyroid nodule in 25% of cases. Cardiac ultrasound is performed systematically in all our patients， systolic ejection fraction mean was 65.8% ± 10.2， a left ventricular hypertrophy found in 48.6% of cases， valvular calcifications in 10%of cases.\n\n【31】From a therapeutic standpoint， calcium supplementation based on calcium carbonate was prescribed in 78.8% of cases with an average dose of 1.8±1.3 g/d， 30.5% of patients received active vitamin D derivatives at an average dose of 1.45±2.29 ug/wk and 6%of native vitamin D， calcium-free phosphorus chelating treatments were prescribed in 15% of patients， at an average dose of 2.4 g/d±1.6，5% of patients were treated with a calcimimetic， and 7% of patients underwent parathyroidectomy. with an average age of 39.1 years±15， an average length of service in dialysis of 8 years ±6.4， and 3 times per week for 50% of patients. The indications for surgery were dominated by treatment-resistant secondary hyperparathyroidism in 90% of cases. 60% of the patients underwent a 3/4 parathyroidectomy and40% a 7/8 parathyroidectomy.\n\n【32】The compliance of phosphocalcic balance indicators at our chronic hemodialysis patients comparedto recommendations KDIGO is of the order of 63% for calcemia， 60% for phosphoremia，48% for PTH. The 3 targets recommended by the KDIGOs were achieved in only 29.3% of patients， compared to 43% who met two targets， and only 6% who did not meet any KDIGO target.\n\n【33】Discussion\n\n【34】Mineral and bone disorders result of the combination of bone turnover abnormalities. These disorders lead to the occurrence of serious systemic complications such as vascular calcifications and complications localities such as fractures， which game the functional and vital prognosis of patients hemodialysis . We are just starting to understand the pathophysiological relationships complexes existing between these different modes clinical expression of disorders metabolic rate in hemodialysis patients .\n\n【35】In our series the average rates of the parameters of the phosphocalcic balance join that of the several series studied. In our study，patients responding to KDIGO targets for serum calcium were63%. This rate is similar to that of the series studied in Mauritania， Tunisia and Senegal ， while the patients responding to the KDIGO targets for phosphoremia is 60%， which matches the targets found in the series studied in Senegal， with lower rates observed in the series from Mauritania and Tunisia， and 48% of our patients meet the KDIGO targets for THA. This rate is higher compared to what is found in the series for Mauritania and Senegal and lower compared to that of Tunisia . Simultaneously adherence to three criteria recommended by the KDIGO were only 29.3%， this matches the data of many studies where the Most patients do not meet the 3 targets of recommendations cited above.\n\n【36】This can be explained largely due to the fact that the new targets of serum calcium and of PTH have been enlarged and appear more easily achievable.\n\n【37】Moreover， these observed results remain unsatisfactory. This is easily explained by the low socio-economic level. economic benefit of our patients， who lack social security the vast majority of cases； making a support therapy based on non-calcium phosphorus chelators and/or calcimimetics often difficult or even inconceivable given their high cost， associated with non-compliance therapeutic not evaluated but certainly important in terms of taste unpleasant calcium chelators .\n\n【38】Conclusion\n\n【39】At the end of our work， which focused on 658 chronic hemodialysis patients， we underline the high frequency of mineral and bone disorders， the management of which remains a complex and constantly evolving field.\n\n【40】The latest recommendations make it possible to apply an individualized therapeutic strategy in orderto optimize the management of these disorders.

Metastasis to the placenta is an uncommon finding in pregnant women， and there is only one reported case causing placental abruption， which involved a cancer of unknown primary. Triple-negative breast cancers tend to be more aggressive overall and have a worse prognosis.\n\n【2】Results： A 35-year-old Hispanic woman was diagnosed at 24 weeks gestation with widely metastatic triple-negative breast cancer to the lungs， liver， peritoneum， lymph nodes， and thoracic spine. Chemotherapy was subsequently started with carboplatin and paclitaxel. She was induced at 36weeks and had a placental abruption despite lacking significant risk factors. Pathology of the placenta revealed intervillous malignant cells consistent with the placental spread of cancer.\n\n【3】Conclusion： Breast cancer in pregnancy can be difficult to manage regarding therapy options and timing of therapy. Chemotherapy after the first trimester is relatively safe to mother and fetus. However， common agents like trastuzumab and tamoxifen are not recommended due to their teratogenic effects. Pregnancy itself does not increase the risk of mortality in breast cancer； however， diagnosis and treatment are delayed， and pregnant women are more commonly diagnosed with advanced stages of cancer compared to their non-pregnant counterparts. Although placental involvement of cancer is rare， it relays a poor prognosis， and any underlies the importance of placental micro examination in all women with known cancer.\n\n【4】Keywords： Metastasis； Chemotherapy； Breast cancer\n\n【5】Introduction\n\n【6】One in eight women will be diagnosed with breast cancer. Unfortunately， the incidence of breast cancer in young women aged 24 to 35 is rising . Women who are diagnosed with breast cancer at age 40 or less have a higher mortality rate in Hormone-Receptor (HR) positive breast cancer . Recent data suggests that annual screening in women beginning at age 40 has greater mortality reduction than current mammogram screening recommendations . This new screening recommendation has now been endorsed by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG)， the American College of Radiologists (ACR)， the National Consortium of Breast Centers (NCBC)， the National Cancer Center Network (NCCN)， and the Society of Breast Imaging (SBI). Since the incidence of breast cancer in young women is increasing， and women are delaying childbearing until later in life， it is likely that breast cancer in pregnancy will become more common in the future . We describe a case of a 35-year-old woman who was diagnosed with aggressive， Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) at 24 weeks gestation， which metastasized to her placenta， causing placental abruption.\n\n【7】Case Presentation\n\n【8】A 35-year-old G3P2 Hispanic woman at 22 weeks and six days gestation presented to her obstetrician complaining of pain in her left breast and swelling in her axillary region for the past four days. Her physical examination revealed a large， firm and immobile mass of her left breast at the 1 o’clock region with associated lymphadenopathy of her left axilla along with areolar erythema and dimpling. The mass was confirmed by ultrasound， and a core biopsy revealed grade 3 invasive ductal carcinoma. Immunohistochemical evaluation revealed that the tumor was estrogen receptor， progesterone receptor， and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2\n\n【9】(HER2) negative. Further analysis revealed a low tumor mutational burden and 0% programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression. Additional immunohistochemical information includes positive cytokeratin (CK) 7. A CT scan of her chest revealed a large breast mass with pulmonary and hepatic metastases， pericardial effusion， ascites， peritoneal implants， a T4 lytic bone lesion， as well as hilar， axillary， and mediastinal adenopathy. An endobronchial biopsy and cytology from her ascites fluid revealed malignant cells positive for CK7 and negative for GATA3， thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1)， and ER. Shortly after， she began chemotherapy with carboplatin and paclitaxel. After three cycles of chemotherapy， repeat imaging showed a decrease in the size of her metastases. Chemotherapy was then held for her labor induction at 36 weeks and 0 days gestation. Prior to delivery， she began to have significant vaginal bleeding with worsening tachycardia and was diagnosed with placental abruption. She underwent amniotomy， and the infant was successfully delivered via forceps assisted vaginal delivery. Placental pathology revealed retroplacental hemorrhage consistent with abruption， as well as atypical intervillous cell clusters. These cells had a high mitotic rate and did not stain as trophoblastic. The cells stained positive for CK7and CK20 and were negative for GATA3， TTF-1， and ER. This was consistent with metastatic breast cancer to the placenta. The patient's health declined， and she elected comfort measures. She died shortly afterward.\n\n【10】Discussion\n\n【11】Cancer during pregnancy is not a rare phenomenon and has a reported incidence ofapproximately 1 in 1，000 women . The most common cancers reported in pregnancy are breast cancer (incidence of 1 in 3，000)， followed by cervical cancer， Hodgkin's lymphoma， and melanoma . Treatment of breast cancer in pregnancy can be a complicated decision as many common agents are teratogenic， especially older alkylating agents (e.g.， procarbazine， busulfan)， antimetabolite drugs (e.g.， aminopterin， methotrexate)， tamoxifen， and trastuzumab . The decision of when to initiate chemotherapy should be a mutual decision between the patient and physician after a thorough explanation of the risks and benefits. Teratogenic effects have been noted primarily in the first trimester， while administration of chemotherapy in the 2n and 3 trimester has been shown to have minimal fetal effects . While paclitaxel and carboplatin， the agents used in the above case， do not appear to increase fetal malformations， there have been reports of cytotoxic therapy causing growth restriction， death， prematurity， and myelosuppression . The data is limited to small numbers of case reports.\n\n【12】Pregnancy itself does not appear to lead to increased mortality， although there is an average delay of 5 to 7 months in diagnosing breast cancer in pregnant women which leads to more advanced staging and worse outcomes . A 2007 case review revealed that65% to 90% ofpregnant women would present in stage II or stage III disease compared to 45% to 66% for non-pregnant women .\n\n【13】Metastasis to the placenta is a rare occurrence. A 2003 case series showed 87 cases of placental and/or fetal metastasis between the years of 1866 and 2003 with the most common cancers being melanoma， breast， lung， leukemia， and lymphoma . Fetal metastasis is even more uncommon， with only 15 of the 87 cases involving the fetal transmission and nearly half of those cases secondary to melanoma. Placental metastasis indicates a poor prognosis for the mother， and fetal metastasis has a poor prognostic factor for the fetus . In most cases placental metastasis is limited to the intervillous space； however， there are cases reporting the villous invasion of cancer， placing the fetus at risk for involvement . There has only been one reported case of abruption from placental metastasis， which was from cancer of unknown primary associated with disseminated intravascular coagulation. In our case， the patient lacked major risk factors for abruption， including smoking， hypertension， pre-eclampsia， alcohol use， cocaine use， trauma， thrombophilia， or previous thromboembolism . Although a slightly increased risk of abruption exists in women over 35 years old， the abnormal cells at the abruption site suggest aggressive cancer as the cause of abruption.\n\n【14】Conclusion\n\n【15】Ultimately， it is predicted that more women will be affected by malignancy in pregnancy. Although rare，there is a risk for metastatic involvement of the placenta that can affect both mother and fetus. Microscopic examination of the placenta is important in all cases of abruption， especially in the setting of women with known or prior cancer. Chemotherapy remains a suitable and relatively safe option in women after the 1 trimester. Breast complaints during pregnancy are common， but they should be thoroughly evaluated as there is a notable delay in diagnosis of breast cancer in pregnant women.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 11:02:25", "endTime": "2024/09/24 11:02:51", "cost": 25.636}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:32", "update_time": "2024-09-23 19:02:49", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 19:02:23"}

Multiple Myeloma (MM) represents a malignant proliferation of plasma cells derived from a single clone. The co-occurrence of two rare malignancies CML and MM in the same patient is an extremely rare incident. We report a case of a 54 vear old female who was simultaneously detected with MM and CML. At the outset， only chemotherapy for multiple myeloma was started as bone marrow and peripheral smear were not suggestive of CML. Subsequently Dasatinib was started in view of left shift seen in peripheral smear. It was both a diagnostic dilemma due to the rarity of synchronicity of these two malignancies and a therapeutic dilemma of whether to start with Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (TKI) as both peripheral smear and bone marrow was normal.\n\n【2】Case Presentation\n\n【3】A 54-year-old female with no comorbidities， a known case of solitary plasmacytoma (with kappa restriction， CD 138 positive)，previouslytreated in July 2020 with definitive radiation therapy to the left pubic ramus. She received a dose of 50 Gy in 25 fractions from 3.6.2020 to 6.7.2020. She was on three monthly follow up since then. At the time of diagnosis， a baseline PET scan revealednoevidence of disease elsewhere， with bone marrow aspiration and biopsy were normal. Also， cytogenetic analysis by conventional karyotype was normal. In the month of June， 2021， she presented with pain in the left pubic region of three months duration. PET CT was done to evaluate disease status. It revealed a 2.8 cm x 5.6 cm lesion involving left pubic ramus and anterior acetabulum (SUV 26.1) which was 12.1 at baseline before radiation therapy. There was a cortical discontinuity with a small extra Osseous soft tissue. There was also a mention of interval development of additional small metabolically active osteolytic lesions in anterior L1 and L4 vertebra which raised the suspicion of progression to multiple myeloma. Work up for multiple myeloma was done that included bone marrow aspiration and biopsy， Serum myeloma panel [Serum Protein Electrophoresis (SPEP)， Serum Immunofixation (SIF) studies， Free Light Chain Assay (FLC)， beta 2 microglobulin] and cytogenetics. Bone marrow showed 10% plasma cells with no immature cells in myeloid lineage. SPEP showed presence of M spike in gamma region (band value： 0.52 g/dl). SIF studies showed IgG band with kappaband. Total proteins were in the range of 8.6 (normal range 6.4 g/dL to 8.2 g/dL). Ig Glevel in serum was 17.4g. Ratio of involved and uninvolved free light chains was 150 with involved kappalight chain being 465. Hence a diagnosis of Multiple myeloma was established. Routine cancer cytogenetic studies at our institute (i.e.，culture ofunstimulated bone marrow aspirate at 24h and 48h of incubation at room temperature) revealed two clones of cells- one with normal karyotype and one with t(9；22) i.e.， 46，XX，t(9；22)(q34；q11.2)/46，XX.\n\n【4】A complete blood count with peripheral smear was normal with no leukocytosis with left shift or thrombocytosis or any abnormal cells. She was started on a three drug regimen (proteasome inhibitor bortezomib， lenalidomide and Dexamethasone with bisphosphonates) as per our institutional protocol for a standard risk stage III Standard risk multiple myeloma after a thorough discussion about the treatment options including transplant. However， the family refused for transplant. At this point of time， BCR ABL mutation was being considered as a part of normal variant as marrow and peripheral smear were normal. Hence， we decided to serially monitor the peripheral smear of the patient and took a decision to not expose the patient to TKI then. She completed4 cycles of VRD (bortezomib/lenalidomide/dexona) till 20.10.21following which reassessment was done by serum myeloma panel which was suggestive of Very Good Partial Response (VGPR) as per International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria with an absent M spike， normalization of serum FLC ratio. It was decided to continue with the same chemotherapy regimen. Her peripheral smear was being serially monitored at each visit. At her visit during cycle 5-D22， her PS was suggestive of left shift with 1% blasts， 6%myelocytes， 7% metamyelocytes， 12% band forms. Now we started her on TKI (Dasatinib 100 mg once a day) after reviewing the drug interactions with other drugs being used for multiple myeloma.\n\n【5】Discussion\n\n【6】We report a case of synchronous hematological malignancies， multiple myeloma coexistent with CML. Though bone marrow was not suggestive of CML， the characteristic translocation t was present in the cells. We further did cytogenetic analysis to rule out Philadelphia positivity as a constitutional abnormality by the PHA(Phytohemagglutinin) induced peripheral blood cell culture with 72h incubation at room temperature， which showed all cells as normal karyotype， thereby proving the existence of the t(9；22) translocation in our reference case as clonal. Following the conventional karyotype report，hybridtranscript for BCR/ABL 1 was quantified by IS MMRRT PCRassay. The ratio of BCR-ABL1/ABL 1 transcript as represented in IS scale was detected to be 5.931%.Genomic breakpoint observed was e 13a2 which corresponded to p210. Other cytogenetic abnormalities seen in multiple myeloma like IGH rearrangement， p53 del， del 13q were negative. Unfortunately on conventional cytogenetics or FISH analysis it is not possible to comment on the type of cells that are carrying specific genetic aberrations. Hence a dilemma might arise as whether they were myeloma cells or leukemic cells which were harboring BCR-ABL1 translocation. Plasma cell enrichment by cell sorting of CD-138 expressing cells in bone marrow or peripheral blood by immunomagnetic methods has been widely applied for targeted molecular cytogenetic analysis of multiple myeloma cases.\n\n【7】The Philadelphia chromosome was originally detected by workers in Philadelphia as an abnormally short G-group chromosome in analysis of bone marrow metaphases from CML patients . It is the first genetic abnormality to be associated with a human cancer. Now it’s understood through chromosome banding techniques that Philadelphia chromosome was the result of a balanced translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22， denoted t(9；22)(q34.1；q11.21)， where the derivative chromosome 222 is significantly smaller. Chromosomal abnormalities can be germline (constitutional) or acquired. Germline abnormalities could be heritable or non-heritable.t(9；22) is as either non-heritable constitutional or acquired. The Philadelphia chromosome is present in hematopoietic cells from patients with CML but not in non hematopoietic cells， including bone marrow fibroblasts . BCR-ABL fusion transcripts resulting from translocation t(9；22)， are hallmarks of Philadelphia chromosome positive ph +leukemia patients. This translocation is detected in>90%patients with CML and ~20% patients with Acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients . There are three common variants of BCR ABL1， p210 BCR ABL 1： This is created by fusion of ABL 1 at a2 with a breakpoint in the major BCR region at either e13 ore14 to produce an el3a2 or e14a2 transcript that is translated into a 210 kD protein 101. This variant is present in most of the CML patients. It is present in one third of the patients with ph positive B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. p190 BCR ABL 1： This is created by fusion of ABL 1 at a2 with a breakpoint in the minor BCR region at el to produce an ela2 transcript into a 190 kD protein. This variant is present in two thirds of those with Ph+ B ALL (80% of childhood and 50% of adult Ph positive B-ALL) and a minority of patients with CML p230 BCR ABL 1： This is created by fusion of ABL 1 at a2 with a breakpoint in the mu BCR region at e19 to produce an e19a2 transcript which is translated into a 230 kD protein. This variant is seen in some patients with chronic neutrophilic leukemia.\n\n【8】There are three hypothesis that have been thought of with regard to the presence of BCR ABL rearrangement in our case.\n\n【9】The first one that we considered initially was that this rearrangement is a part of a normal variant， the significance of which could be found out on regular follow-up of this patient. A study by Jew Win Kuan et al. was done in normal population in southern Sarawak by performing quantitative PCR for BCR ABL1with ABL1 as an internal control on total white blood cells. In this they demonstrated that the BCR ABL1 fusion gene is expected to be present in approximately 0.5% to 1% of normal individuals in that area. The positive subject in this study had BCR ABL1 Fusion gene of 0.002320.0032%， which is equivalent to MR4.5. In our patient in discussion， the BCR ABL1 transcript was 5.931%.\n\n【10】Secondly， tumorigenesisafter exposure toeenvironmental carcinogens such as ionizing radiation and chlorinated solvents is a well-known phenomenon. A common insult to the bone marrow can cause irreparable DNA damage potentially leading to neoplasms of myeloid and lymphoid origin. This might partially explain as the patient had been exposed to radiation therapy for plasmacytoma one year back.\n\n【11】Thirdly， treatment of first malignancy with cytotoxic drugs or radiation can potentially lead to secondary malignant transformation. The role of melphalan and cyclophosphamide in developing secondary malignancies is well documented in literature. Various secondary malignancies in lenalidomide-treated patients have also been described. Nevertheless， this hypothesis cannot be extrapolated to our patient because the two diseases were simultaneously detected. In addition， chronic antigenic stimulation due to multiple etiological factors may be involved in the development of simultaneous myeloid and lymphoid neoplasms. Other factors such as genotypic polymorphism may also be involved.\n\n【12】The other possibility is de novo ph+ multiple myelomas， which is an extremely rare event.\n\n【13】Another possible theory is the presence of a common malignant pluripotent progenitor stem cell which can be transformed to both lymphoid and myeloid lines .\n\n【14】Also， it has been proposed that a more sustainable environment for the formation of secondary tumors is created due to the presence of myeloma cells. Studies have showed that multiple myeloma cells have pleiotropic proliferative and antiapoptotic properties .\n\n【15】At the outset we had hypothesized it to be a normal variant and decided to keep under close observation. However， subsequently we started TKI， in view ofleft shift in peripheral smear. Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) is a clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorder. The annual incidence of CML is 1.5 cases per 100，000 individuals.\n\n【16】Multiple Myeloma (MM) represents a malignant proliferation of plasma cells derived from a single clone. The co-occurrence of two rare malignancies CML and MM in the same patient is an extremely rare incident， and simultaneous diagnosis of CML and MM is reported in only five cases in the literature. Multiple Myeloma (MM) has been reported in association with a variety of myeloproliferative disorders， including polycythemia vera， myelofibrosis， essential thrombocythemia and Chronic Neutrophilic Leukemia (CNL). However， the association with Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia(CML) has been rarely reported . A retrospective study between year 2013 to 2017 was done by Rouslan Kotchetkov et al. ， in which they identified 46 patients with synchronous hematological malignancies， out of which 50% were myeloid + lymphoid 43%lymphoid + lymphoid and 7% were identified to have myeloid +myeloid synchronous malignancies， however none of them was CML with MM .\n\n【17】There are few reported cases of multiple myeloma with a Philadelphia chromosome. One reported case is of a 61-vear-old man showing BCR ABL positive bone marrow after autologous bone marrow transplantation for multiple myeloma. Anecdotal cases of patients of multiple myeloma who developed CML after treatment or occurrence of multiple myeloma in a known case of CML on follow up are reported in literature.\n\n【18】Conclusion\n\n【19】After reviewing the literature， it is possible that the coexistence of these two hematological disorders is multifactorial. The occurrence can’t be attributed to one factor alone. No formal guidelines have been established regarding the use of antimyeloma therapy along with TKIs used in the treatment for CML. In our patient we used the combination of Dasatinib with VRD regimen with good response and minimal toxicity to the patient.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 11:12:02", "endTime": "2024/09/24 11:12:13", "cost": 10.482}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:32", "update_time": "2024-09-23 19:12:13", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 19:12:02"}

Surgery， including debridement and patella truncation，had positive effects on lower extremity circulation， infection control， cavity treatment， bone destruction， surgical debridement， recovery of foot function， and nursing. After five months， the patient’s foot ulcer had healed， and walking function was preserved.\n\n【3】Conclusion： Scheduling interventional surgery and debridement are the key point in a complicated diabetic foot ulcers case， and multidisciplinary collaboration in treatment of diabetic foot is significantly important.\n\n【4】Keywords： Multidisciplinary collaboration； Diabetic foot ulcer； Timing； Interventional therapy\n\n【5】Introduction\n\n【6】In China， in 2010， the prevalence of diabetes was 11.6% ， while the proportion of diabetic patients>50 years old with lower extremity arterial disease was 19.5% ； the proportion of diabetic patients >60 years old with lower extremity arterial disease was 35.4%. The incidence of new foot ulcers in Chinese patients with diabetes during the period from 2010 to 2011 was 8.1%，and the incidence of new ulcers in patients with diabetic foot ulcers within that period was 31.6%. Diabetic foot ulcers have gradually become a challenge in clinical therapy and a leading cause of hospitalization among patients with diabetes .\n\n【7】The medical community has reached a consensus in favor of multidisciplinary collaboration in treatment of diabetic foot . The complexity of treatment for diabetic foot determines the importance of optimizing the timing of multi-disciplinary and sequential treatments. This case presentation describes a complicated process of treatment for an elderly patient with diabetic foot ulcers， who had signs of poor baseline physiology. The wounds healed， and foot function was maximally preserved.\n\n【8】Case Presentation\n\n【9】A 68-year-old man with 21-year history of type 2 diabetes presented with an ulcer on the left heel. Height was 162 cm； body weight was 69 kg； body mass index was 26.3. The patient had been diagnosed with lower extremity atherosclerotic obliterans 7 years earlier. The left lower limb has been numb for 6 years， with intermittent claudication and rest pain for 1 year. The patient reported that his sleep was affected， but his degree of pain was decreased with the intermittent use of analgesic agents. For the left lower limb with claudication， walking distance was 90 meters.\n\n【10】The patient was hospitalized on 10 July 2017. Twenty days before hospitalization， irritation and pain developed on the lateral skin of the toes of the left foot， with no obvious inducement. Purulent exudate was observed after skin ulceration， and the patient's body temperature increased to 39.5°C. During hospitalization， the five toes of the left foot were black， necrotic， and associated with aggravated rest pain. Although the dose of oral analgesics was increased， the patient’s pain was not relieved， and his sleep was severely affected.\n\n【11】The patient's appearance on initial evaluation is shown in Figure 1A， 1B. The five toes of the left上foot were almost entirely black and necrotic. The skin extending from the bottom of the foot to the5hh metatarsophalangeal joint was red and swollen， with obvious tenderness； skin temperature v S normal. The muscles of the left foot had clearly atrophied； the skin was thin， bright， and hypertonic. Incision and drainage (approx. 5.0cm long) was immediately performed between the 4h and 5h toes. Necrotic tissue， minimal purulent exudation， and limited bleeding were observed.\n\n【12】The diagnostic results on obtained on July 13 are shown. Secretion cultures displayed Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. X-ray film showed in Figure 1C， 1D revealed no obvious destruction in foot bone. The lower limb Computed Tomographic Angiography (CTA) is shown in Figure 1E.\n\n【13】The Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the foot obtained on July 14.h is shown in Figure 1F， 1G. Subcutaneous inflammatory tissue in the lateral 54h humerus bone was confirmed as an infectious submerged cavity . The first incision performed at the bedside resulted in limited purulent exudation， as well as decreased local tension and reduced foot swelling. However， progressive necrosis of the skin margin was noted .\n\n【14】On July 17， basal therapy consisted in controlling blood sugar with insulin (58 units/day). The initial antimicrobial application of ceftazidime infusion (2 gm， twice daily) was replaced by the sensitive drug Sulperazon (Cefoperazone Sodium and Sulbactam Sodium for Injection， Pfizer)， according to the bacterial culture result of the secretion， and the application of antibiotics was stopped after July22. The patient showed improved circulation and blood pressure. Treatment was maintained with protein and iron supplements.\n\n【15】On July 18h， interventional therapy was performed on the lower limb. The balloon was expanded in the superficial femoral artery， anterior tibia artery， iliac artery， and tendon. A thrombus had formed in the lower segment of the superficial femoral artery. The catheter for thrombolysis was left in place until July 20 . Skin temperature in the left foot increased， and swelling extended to the center of the foot. The amount of purulent exudation increased， as did pain and body temperature. The foot was therefore incised and drained， once more. Multiple subcavities were found .\n\n【16】On July 21， we performed patella truncation and debridement on toes 4 and 5. The procedure was performed in the operating room， with the patient under sciatic nerve block. Results are presented in Figure 4. Submerged cavities were filled with povidone-iodine gauze. The amount of nonviable tissue in the submerged cavity gradually decreased. The submerged space became shallow， and the granulation filled. All subsequent treatments were performed in the outpatient department.\n\n【17】From July 25 to September 30\"， the left foot plaster was fixed at a functional position and applied intermittently . After October 15， the plaster was removed. The patient was given diabetic shoes， and walking was guided. The first signs of wound healing were observed on November 19 .\n\n【18】Discussion Debridement schedule\n\n【19】In order to minimize adverse effects， local debridement must be initiated in an expedient fashion. In the case presented above， the foot was severely ischemic and therefore could not support local blood transport after incision. In addition， infection easily spreads along the physiological cavity extending from thelittle toe. Efforts to avoid skin necrosis and wound expansion typically render comprehensive and meticulous debridement impossible.\n\n【20】After the initialtreatment， we continued with nibbling debridement， in order to preserve as much residual tissue as possible. Debridement can be performed more thoroughly after blood transport is improved. The surgeon must continue to avoid over-injury， in order to restrict the area of infection. After the second episode of debridement ， the opening of the cavity was patent and incompletely dissected . It is also possible to cut into the subcavities of the heel  and the lateral portion of the 5tibia .\n\n【21】Intervention\n\n【22】Endovascular treatment may improve the blood supply to the lower limbs and create conditions conducive to thorough debridement and healing . Such treatment should be initiated once the local infection is restricted， and the patient is stable. However， after the intervention，improved wound circulation increases the in flammatory response. In this case， the patient underwent substantial debridement during thrombolysis， when it was discovered that the infection had spread along physiological lacunae . Blood supply to the lower extremities was not considered sufficient for skin grafting.\n\n【23】Debridement\n\n【24】The term “nibbling debridement”denotes debridement that is gradual in spatial and temporal dimensions. Debridement is generally used to treat diabetic feet， which often have insufficient blood supply. The surgeons attempted to preserve as much tissue as possible， with the extent of debridement determined by guidelines for treatment during the infection， proliferative， and healing phases. The sites of debridement included： necrotic skin margins， fascia， deeper cavities， residual tendon and inactivated tissue in shallow lances，and hyperplastic granulation (during the later stages of treatment).\n\n【25】Preservation of foot function\n\n【26】In the early stage of treatment， it is necessary to fix the functional position in order to avoid supporting and walking. Such precautions are necessary to avoid the flexion and extension of large joints. During the middle stages of treatment， joint activity may increase slightly. Once the plaster is fixed， the foot may be supported on the floor. However， walking should be forbidden， in order to avoid movement between tissues. During the latter stages of treatment， when healing is clearly underway， the patient should be given shoes tailored specifically for diabetic feet， to provide support during walking . Training sessions to improve function of thelower extremities should be completed with increasing frequency， but the use of conventional shoes is prohibited.\n\n【27】Conclusion\n\n【28】The treatment of diabetic foot ulcers is extremely complicated. During the initial stages of diagnosis， a multidisciplinaryteam should make treatment recommendations based on the severity of ischemia and the degree of infection. If the foot cannot be preserved， thorough debridement may be performed during the initial stages of treatment to reduce adverse effects on the body. In combination with standard treatment， conditions for amputation should be achieved in as expedient a fashion as possible. Multi-disciplinary cooperation and optimization of the treatment schedule are necessary if there is even a remote possibility of preserving any portion of the foot or toes.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 10:54:52", "endTime": "2024/09/24 10:55:18", "cost": 26.7}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:32", "update_time": "2024-09-23 18:55:16", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 18:54:49"}

Aging in the population certainly affects various aspects of life， such as social， economic， and health. Aging also causes the function of the body’s organs to decrease due to natural factors or due to disease. When a person reaches old age， and the children have formed their own family， the responsibility to them is relinquished. She/he returned to being as accessible and independent as she/he had been in the early days ofher/his marriage. The obligation to care for， finance，educate and supervise children is no longer carried out. But by the time freedom was obtained， she/he was already in a state of physical， biological， and psychological decline， and had lost her/his children from home.\n\n【2】Today's society has entered the era of modernization which naturally changes people's mindsets and attitudes. As a result of this change in mindset， many individuals have grown up with an individualistic perspective. Of course， this has a negative impact because it causes humans to feel content with themselves and do not need other people in their lives， even though humans were created as social beings who must actually interact with one another. But in this era， many people tend to compete to achieve their personal goals. When the younger generation brings perspectives， subconsciously they will focus more on themselves than their families. So that many older generations are getting less and less attention from their children and grandchildren. Families who are unable to care for them end up placing their seniors in a nursing home. Of course， this makes seniors feel left out when they have to be placed in a place with makeshift buildings and facilities. Sometimes， makeshift buildings and facilities make seniors feel uncomfortable and uncomfortable. However， often because there is no choice， the elderly feels compelled and unhappy， which can then cause health problems.\n\n【3】Based on statistical data for 2021， Taiwan has at least 3.8 million people aged over 65 years， and this number continues to increase every year. Some people perceive the existence of the elderly negatively and incorrectly. They consider the elderly as a burden to the family and the surrounding community. This may be caused by several cases that discuss cases of elderly people whose lives are very dependent on other people. Because of the dependency and helplessness of the elderly， it is concluded as a burden and a reason for certain families to send them to a nursing home， even being abandoned.\n\n【4】Chi Lau Lin Aged Care Co. Ltd.， instead of calling itself a nursing home， Chi Lau Lin prefers to be called aged care located in central Taiwan. In contrast to the nursing home， Chi Lau Lin is a facility for parents whose families are still able to care for the elderly at home. Chi Lu Lin provides classes， activities， events， and delicious food for the elderly to enrich their knowledge and not stop learning.\n\n【5】In addition， Chi Lau Lin also prioritizes safety and environmental design in their facilities. That way， families can entrust their parents to Chi Lau Lin when they are at work or not at home. Of course， on certain sides， there are unavoidable places that might threaten the safety of the elderly. That place is the emergency staircase on one side of Chi Lau Lin. This will be discussed further in the next section.\n\n【6】Literature Review Quality Improvement and Patient Safety (QIPS)\n\n【7】The theory of improving quality and patient safety， in general， is to encourage the implementation of service activities to patients that meet service standards， and safety and provide satisfaction to patients. In particular， to ensure that services are provided in accordance with medical and nursing service standards， as well as that services are provided in accordance with standard service standards， and patient safety and are carried out in an integrated manner according to patient needs. As well as seeking to improve service quality， patient safety and performance through increasing the ability to provide health services to develop a better monitoring system in service quality indicators.\n\n【8】Patient safety is an important element to improve the quality of health services， especially in hospitals as a form of implementation and reflection of the results of the competence of health workers， the availability of service facilities and infrastructure as well as management and administration systems in the service cycle for patients . To ensure patient safety，healthcare organizations must be able to build systems that make the patient care process safer， both for patients， health workers， and the surrounding community(family， visitors)， as well as hospital management. The patient safety system is intended to reduce risk， prevent the occurrence of injuries due to the patient care process， and prevent the recurrence of patient safety incidents by creating a patient safety culture.\n\n【9】Patient safety should be a culture in health services in health facilities. However， several cases still show that patient safety has not become a culture in their work environment. This can be seen in cases of malpractice， discrimination or other cases. Every health profession should have a code of ethics which must be an aspect of implementing patient safety culture in their work environment. By adopting a good patient safety culture， you can minimize incidents related to patient safety. Harvard School of Public Health (HSPH) research  states that of the 421 million patients treated annually worldwide， 43 million people are harmed annually due to treatment with side effects .\n\n【10】Currently， the issue of patient safety is one of the main issies in health services. Patient safety has become something far more important than just service efficiency. Various risks due to medical action can occur as part of service to patients. It turns out that the quality of service alone is not enough.\n\n【11】Health care facilities should always maintain the security of the service process for patients so that medical errors do not occur which affect the quality and service of these health care facilities. Patient safety is an effort to ensure that actions and activities in health care facilities carried out by health workers for patients are safe and do not cause adverse effects or impacts on patients that have been regulated in regulations. Patient safety is an important point in every medical action， both minor and serious medical actions. Based on research by Maghfiroh & Rochmah ， patient safety has a major influence on the image， social responsibility， morals， and performance of health workers so patient safety is related to quality issues and the image of a health service， including nursing home or even aged care facility\n\n【12】The aspects of implementing successful patient safety are as follows： a. External environment\n\n【13】Hughes stated that the external environment is something that is needed for agencies to have a high commitment to implementing the quality of patient safety. Strengths that are biased and can make changes to the orientation ofthe agency， one ofwhich is the motivation that comes from the external environment. External pressure in health agencies can come from the provisions in implementing the quality of patient safety， and competition in providing services， then ones awareness and lawsuits will increase . b.Leadership\n\n【14】Hughes gives the opinion that a nurse who can play a role in changing leadership to implement patient safety will have an effect on changing the organizational structure which is expected to be more effective in implementing safety. Leaders are required to be able to understand that external pressure is an opportunity to make changes for the better. In institutional leadership without strong encouragement， patient safety will only become a motto . Leaders can bring success or failure of quality management in the health care facilities they lead. Leadership must be one of the abilities that must be possessed by leaders to lead their organizations to continue to progress better and have positive improvements. It is important for leaders to develop their skills and demonstrate their commitment to quality and build the organization with their board， as well as set a clear direction for the organization. Leaders must also change their organization's value systems and ultimately organizational culture， policies， and structures to meet the needs of their employees and customers. c. Organizational culture\n\n【15】Patient safety culture is the foundation of patient safety. Keywords in improving quality and patient safety provide a change in patient culture from a blame culture to a safety culture. One of the strategies to develop a safety culture is to involve employees in planning and developing a safety culture. d. Management practice\n\n【16】Lower， middle， and upper-level managers have the responsibility to implement policies and procedures that have been made and agreed upon together. Managers support for the implementation of patient safety is a good thing and supports the success of the quality assurance program .\n\n【17】Person-Environment-Occupation (PEO) model\n\n【18】The PEO Model was developed to provide a framework for delivering services that focuses on a client-centered approach. Previous research notedthatthePEO model can beused to understand and develop person-centered interventions for people with dementia. PEO factors reflect participation ability among residents and dementia. When the environment and occupation are adjusted to the skills of the person，participation is assumed to be successful.\n\n【19】In a previous study， Green and Cooper  indicated that thelevel function of residents was greatly influenced by the number and type of activities offered. Green and Cooper  succeeded in recognizing how PEO interactions play an essential role in the engagement of meaningful activities. The PEO Model can accommodate the limitations of residents， and staff， and be more flexible and creative when designing individual activities.\n\n【20】Method\n\n【21】This study uses the theory of Quality Improvement and Patient Safety (QIPS) education  which has a vital role in developing healthcare professionals with the knowledge， abilities， and attitudes to improve healthcare systems. In addition， by using the PEO Model， this study aims to explore and observe the situation in Chi Lau Lin using the three elements of people， environment， and occupation models to promote a better healthcare system that can be applied in its management system.\n\n【22】Case Study： Chi Lau Lin the third age group and the implementation of local aging， hoping that all people can have a dynamic， independent， and dignified old age.\n\n【23】With one-stop overall service (the concept of three stages and five levels of publichealth)， Chi Lau Lin plans five major career directions， including colleges， associations， clubs， long-term care services， and restaurants， also links all stages of services to provide services for the third age group. People of all ethnic groups (or planning to prepare for the third age group)， whether they are healthy， sub-healthy， demented， or disabled， can regain their enthusiasm for life and save their lives. Implement the vision of developing a corporate model of people-oriented， love-based， and practice a happy life and holistic care. Below are features that promoting by Chi Lau Lin：\n\n【24】Diverse courses\n\n【25】Because knowledge is constantly updated and infinitely changing， if we don't have a new understanding of ourselves and the space to surpass our own limitations， it will be difficult for us to have the ability and ability to regenerate learning. The most important thing in self-transcendence is to establish a good habit of lifelong learning.\n\n【26】The intervention of multiple courses can effectively encourage the elderly to participate in society and provide learning motivation. It is also helpful for the development of the elderly with dementia， and it can also reduce the care pressure of the main caregiver.\n\n【27】One-stop integrated care\n\n【28】Through one-stop integratedcare services andsystematic resource links in the elderly industry， the difficulties and burdens faced by cases and their families can be solved.\n\n【29】Faculty lineup\n\n【30】Teachers in professional fields can provide continuous and effective guidance and services in dementia care， which can not only enhance the sense of achievement of seniors participating in the courses but also stabilize the emotions of the patients.\n\n【31】Chi Lau Lin creates a \"dementia\" home care service model and uses the professional training of program training in care practice， according to the care needs of individual cases and their individuality， the characteristic content of dementia care is summarized one by one from the visit process， including physical assessment， needs assessment. Assessment， case spiritual care， primary caregiver(including family members)care support， cognitive training， rehabilitation training， life story， and life course exploration， risk factor assessment， home environment risk， multi-drug assessment， and other interventional care.\n\n【32】Conclusion\n\n【33】This study resulted in a better understanding of how to care for the elderly， maintain an aged care environment to support quality and safety for residents， and also a sustainable system for aged care. In the future， it is hoped that other aged care homes or nursing homes can put forward the quality of patient safety and implement a good PEO model in an elderly care environment. Turning threats into opportunities， and changing the environment to be healthier for its inhabitants. That way， health facilities such as aged care and nursing homes will be able to become sustainable businesses.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 11:24:24", "endTime": "2024/09/24 11:25:08", "cost": 43.717}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:32", "update_time": "2024-09-23 19:25:06", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 19:24:22"}

The presented case-reports illustrate both entities and the difficulties faced in its differential diagnosis， as well as the utility of US on their detection and management. On the first case， patient presented the typical clinical features and risk factors of AVM. The US findings included the classical highly-specific signs： Multiple hypoechoic myometrial spaces with multidirectional turbulent high velocity flow seen on color Doppler US， and prominent parametrial vessels. On the second case， the clinical presentation and the background of curettages prior to the current pregnancy led the medical team to initially suspect AVM， even when the patient did present the three sonographic signs with higher PPV for RPOC diagnosis： A well-defined endometrial mass， a thickened endometrium， and endometrial vascularization. Key point on US differential diagnosis between the two entities is the presence of endometrial vascularization vs. exclusively myometrial vascularization.\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Early or late PPH are common complications in the obstetric wards worldwide. The differential diagnosis for early PPH -which happens within the first 24 h after delivery- includes uterine atony， lacerations， coagulopathies and RPOC； while for late or secondary PPH -which happens between 1day and 12 weeks after delivery-RPOC， endometritis， subinvolution of the placental implantation site， coagulopathies and AVM should be taken into consideration .\n\n【5】RPOC are intrauterine tissues developed after conception which persist after birth， miscarriage or pregnancytermination. The anatomopathological diagnosis is based on the presence of chorionic villi. Incidence of RPOC is remarkable (about 17% during the 1% term， 40% during the 2n term and 3% during 3 term deliveries， with an estimated incidence of 3% to 5% for on-term vaginal births) . The most prevalent risk factors are previous retained placenta， maternal age， previous dilation and curettage， caesarean section or uterine surgery， labor induction， pre-term birth， uterine malformation andplacental features such as velamentous cord insertion or placentalimplantation site. Complications include PPH，endometritis， and in fertility related to the formation ofintrauterine adherences and scar tissue . There is a lack of a formal consensus on diagnostic sonographic or imaging criteria regarding RPOC， although US has a key role on its detection and management when there is a clinical suspicion. Treatment options range from expectant management to medical-induced expulsion or surgical resection of RPOC (via curettage or hysteroscopy) depending on the presence and intensity of hemorrhage， the presence of concomitant infections and the sonographic characteristics of the placental remnants .\n\n【6】Acquired AVM is an infrequent cause of severe vaginal bleeding， in which uterine tissue damage -mainly caused by uterine instrumentation， or less likely in context of trophoblastic disease， diethylstilbestrol exposure， neoplasms or infections- cause an abnormal arterio-venous communication without a capillary bed in between . Patients present with intermittent or severe vaginal bleeding， sometimes debuting days after birth or uterine instrumentation . The gold standard for AVM diagnosis is angiography， showing early venous filling， with color Doppler US also being a reliable and available diagnostic tool. Active treatment for AVM is Uterine Artery Embolization (UAE) . Early differential diagnosis between RPOC and AVM may be challenging but it is key since the primary treatment for RPOC presenting with active severe bleeding (surgical resection of the remnants) may fatally worsen the hemorrhage in case of AVM.\n\n【7】Materials and Methods\n\n【8】On April 2020，a 37-year-old nullipara was admitted with Preterm Premature Rupture of Membranes (PPROM) and clinical chorioamnionitis at 17+5w. Antibiotic coverage was initiated.\n\n【9】During the expulsion of the fetus， she presented massive acute vaginal bleeding (1.4 L in 2 min). Patient underwent an emergent echo-guided suction curettage to evacuate the placenta and a Bakri Balloon was placed. Intra-surgery， she required transfusion with6 blood units and administration of vasoactive drugs to preserve hemodynamic stability. Patient was discharged asymptomatic 3days after the surgery. She was readmitted 5 days later presenting endometritis： endocervical culture was positive for E. coli BLEA. Treatment with Imipenem was started. Us showed a thickened endometrium of 69 mm with a solid mass of 28 mm x 27 mm with moderate vascularization on Doppler-US (color score 3)， compatible with RPOC .\n\n【10】A second echo-guided curettage was performed. Due to severe intra-surgical bleeding， patient required another Bakry Balloon placement and transfusion with 2 more blood units. After removing theeBakry Balloon， patient persisted asymptomatic andWas discharged. Two weeks later she was readmitted in hypovolemic shock， needing 2 more blood units and vasoactive drugs. US showed a thickened avascular endometrium of 34 mm and a heterogeneous and intensely vascularized myometrium，with important dilatation of the arcuate and radial arteries， and a nodular image of 28 mm ×13mm in its posterior wall， color score 4 with turbulent multidirectional high-velocity flow， suggestive of AVM .\n\n【11】Arteriography was performed， objectivizing hypertrophic uterine arteries with 4 points of arterio-venous fistula. Patient needed 2 consecutive embolization’s on the left and on the right uterine arteries within 20 days， both with conical-shape pushable coils， to successfully solve the AVMs. Bleeding receded and patient is currently asymptomatic.\n\n【12】On the second1 case， on December 2021， a 35-year-old nulliparous woman with an antecedent of two curettages in context of a therapeutic abortion due to fetal acrania and a posterior transfer of a cryopreserved embryo， presented early and late postpartum hemorrhage after a breech delivery instrumented with forceps at37+5w， with hemodynamic instability.\n\n【13】First transvaginal US performed in the emergency ward 16 h after delivery showed a thickened avascular endometrium of 40 mm， congruent with clots. An emergency transabdominal echo-guided suction curettage was performed 48 h afterbirth. During theprocedure， myometrial zone was seen， with pulsatile vascularization and dubious continuity with the endometrial cavity， initially suspected to be an AVM. a highly vascularized myometrial zone was sonographically detected on the upper third of the uterus， with pulsatile vascularization and dubious continuity with the endometrial cavity， initially suspected to be an AVM .\n\n【14】Due to this diagnosis suspicion and with the patient in progressive anemization (Hb 53 g/L)，angio-TCand UAE with resorbable material were performed. Vaginal bleeding receded. During the admission she was transfused with 8 blood units. A weeklater， a sonohysterography was performed， observing a 26 mm heterogeneous endometrial cavity with a solid heterogeneous formation of 53 mm x 22 mmx 41mm which appeared to depend on the left posterior-lateral uterine wall， with moderate vascularization on Doppler-US (color score 3)， suggestive of RPOC .\n\n【15】A consecutive attempt to evacuate the RPOC was made with a second echo-guided curettage， which resulted unsuccessful due to the intense vascularization of the remnants and the danger of massive bleeding， as well as the fact that they were intensely adhered to the myometrium. As the patient was asymptomatic at the time， she was discharged with a sonographic control scheduled 3 weeks later.\n\n【16】However， a week later， she restarted profuse vaginal bleeding with secondary anemization， once the UAE was no longer effective due to reabsorption of the embolizing material. She needed transfusion with2 more blood units.\n\n【17】A multidisciplinary committee decided to practice a second UAE -this time with non-resorbable material- followed by a surgical hysteroscopy， in which RPOC intimately attached tothe myometrium were completely resected with bipolar loop . The patient is now asymptomatic.\n\n【18】Results and Discussion\n\n【19】On the first case， patient presented the typical clinical features and risk factors of AVM： Massive vaginal bleeding after two consecutive curettages for RPOC. The US findings included the classical highly-specific signs： multiple hypoechoic myometrial spaces with systolic and diastolic multidirectional turbulent high-velocity flow seen on color Doppler， and prominent parametrial vessels .\n\n【20】On the second case， the US image during the first attempt of echo-guided curettage -which showed a highly vascularized myometrial zone with pulsatile vascularization in continuity with the endometrial cavity- as well as the clinical presentation and the background of curettages prior to the current pregnancy， led the medical team to initially suspect AVM. Nevertheless， the patient did present the three sonographic signs with higher PPV for a RPOC diagnosis： A well- defined endometrial mass， a thickened endometrium， and endometrial vascularization . In RPOC， endometrial vascularized component is seen， while in AVM the abnormal vascularization is located exclusively in the myometrium. This is the key point on the US differential diagnosis between the two entities. of the vascularization in RPOC and， consequentially， in anticipating its surgical-treatment associated bleeding risk. In RPOC Kamaya Scale   or Gutenberg Classification   types 2 and 3 -as the second case we present， in which endometrial moderate-intense vascularity with equal flow in the endometrium and surrounding myometrial zone was found-， it is worth considering a two-phase treatment： for instance， UAE as a first step to decrease active bleeding and/or risk of intra- surgical bleeding， followed by the final surgical -preferably hysteroscopic- resection of RPOC .\n\n【21】Conclusion performed. In the case of RPOC， US is not as specific， but it is key on the differential diagnosis， orientating whether the abnormal vascularization is located in the myometrium or in the endometrium.

However， although the BMI is more often clinically used to define nutritional status， it does not differentiate between specific body-composition components. In addition， recent studies analyzed that the Fat Free Mass (FFM) is more strongly associated with lung function in CF compared to the BMI， and an abnormal or excessive accumulation of Fat Mass (FM)， according to World Health Organization(WHO)， places the individual at risk of cardiovascular and chronic lifestyle diseases .\n\n【4】New therapeutic advancements have shown favorable effects on the quality of life and longevity among CF patients (pts). The advent of CFTR modulators， especially the most recent one， i.e.， the Elexacaftor-Tezacaftor-Ivacaftor (ETI)， has been demonstrated to reduce sweat chloride levels and risk of pulmonary exacerbations and improve respiratory function and nutritional status. This results in an increase in weight and BMI and，therefore， overweight and obesity， which are becoming areas of interest among clinical care and researchers for the first time in CF history .\n\n【5】Currently， CFTR modulators are known to improve nutritional status and increase anthropometric parameters， but very little is known about how they affect body composition over time . Hence， the objective of this study was to assess the body composition of CF pts on ETI during their first year of treatment at Ancona CF center in order to prevent obesity and chronic diseases through adequate dietetic interventions.\n\n【6】At Ancona CF center， the nutritional status of CF pts who started the commercial triple combination ETI was monitored at fixed times (T0， T1， T3， T6， T12). In this study， we analyzed the weight and body composition of F508del/Minimal Function (F/MF) (n=15) and F508del/F508del (F/F)(n=12) pts over 12 years of age who completed the assessment at 12 months (T12). Weight，BMI， and body composition parameters， in particular FM and FFM， were analyzed using a Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA).\n\n【7】What about results? Variations (A)(T0-T6；T12-T6) in weight and bodycomposition parameters of CF pts on ETI were outlined in the following graphs.\n\n【8】Despite the limited number of pts， this monocentric study showed a consistent increase at T6and a moderate increase at T12 in weight， BMl， and FM in pts on ETI. The lowest increment in weight，BMI， and FM and the highest increment in FFM in the second semester are determined by a personalized dietary intervention and increased physical activity.\n\n【9】The results of this study show that pts on ETI appear to have an increased risk of developing overweight or obesity and， consequently， cardiovascular and metabolic diseases， especially if not properly followed by a specialized CF dietitian.\n\n【10】The effects of CFTR modulators on the increasing weight，height， and BMI in individuals with CF are known and highly dependent on therapy formulation (single or combined therapy)， clinical conditions， and targeted CFTR mutation. However， current evidence regarding the impact of CFTR modulation therapy， particularly ETI， on body composition remains undefined.\n\n【11】The advent of CFTR modulation therapy has revolutionized CF care， in terms of less-severe symptoms， higher quality of life，longer survival， lower rates of hospitalization， and better nutritional status in eligible pts. Many studies have shown how these drugs improve the nutritional status of CF pts by increasing weight， height， and BMI， while only a few of them have assessed the impact of CFTR modulators on body composition. Although BMI is commonly used as an indicator of nutritional status in clinical practice， it is not able to provide information regarding body composition parameters. Indeed， a BMI in the normal range can hide a condition of“sarcopenia”or“normal weight obesity\". Despite the strong correlation between BMI and lung function in CF， recent studies have demonstrated that a high content of FM is inverselyassociated with pulmonary function and， on the other hand， FFM positively impacts respiratory strength and lung function .\n\n【12】As therapeutic advancements have significantly improved， longevity has increased and overweight and obesity have become emerged issues among the CF population. The implications of excessive weight gain and adiposity on CF clinical outcomes are unknown but may produce similar health consequences and chronic diseases as those observed in the general population .\n\n【13】According to the scientific literature， our study showed that pts on ETI increased FM more than FFM， but this increment can be identified through regular body-composition assessment and controlled by individualized dietary intervention， constant physical activity， and correct lifestyle.\n\n【14】Current nutritional guidelines state that individuals with CF may need a higher energy intake than the general population through a high calorie and fat diet. Nevertheless， these recommendations may no longer be appropriate， especially in the era of CFTR modulators. Moreover， it is important to consider that the nutritional status of many CF pts remains suboptimal， even after starting CFTR modulation therapy， and， thus， a more energy-dense diet may be necessary .\n\n【15】In conclusion， the CF nutritional approach should meet each individual's dietetic requirements and focus on diet quality in order to promote optimal health outcomes and prevent other chronic lifestyle diseases. Further research is needed to understand which method of body-composition assessment can be recommended in CF clinical care and analyze longer-term metabolic consequences of ETI .", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 11:44:02", "endTime": "2024/09/24 11:44:09", "cost": 6.652}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:32", "update_time": "2024-09-23 19:44:09", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 19:44:02"}

Non-typhoidal Salmonella infections are self-limiting diarrheal illness with low fatality cases， but in some cases can trigger an invasive disease with higher fatality cases when compared to non-invasive infection . A wide variety of domestic and wild animals and a variety of food matrices can transmit Salmonella spp. to humans. The transfer often occurs when these microorganisms are introduced into food preparation areas， as well as through direct contact with infected animals or humans. Most of the data related to human salmonellosis in Brazil come from scientific research， since the Ministry of Health does not disclose annual reports as it occurs in North America and Europe. In Brazil， the National Reference Laboratory for Enteric Diseases，Oswaldo Cruz Institute-FIOCRUZ (NRL) receives Salmonella strains from Public Health Laboratories， Universities， Food Production Industries， and other Brazilian sectors for serotyping and genotyping. This allows tracing the profile of the serovars involved in human salmonellosis over time. Here， we report the top 10 Salmonella serovars isolated from human sources between 2011and 2020.\n\n【5】Material and Methods\n\n【6】Isolates were received in NRL in Nutrient Agar and then inoculated in Costa and Vernin media， Lysine Iron Agar and sulphide-indole-motility and incubated at 37°C for 24 hr for confirmation as Salmonella enterica；serotyping was performed according to the Kauffman-White scheme .\n\n【7】Results and Discussion\n\n【8】Three thousand one hundred and thirteen isolates related to human cases were received in NRL between 2011 and 2020.

From 2015 onwards， the observed order of serovars prevalence was Typhimurium， Enteritidis， or Infantis according to the year， followed by Newport. In the United States， it was S. typhimurium， Enteritidis followed by Newport， and monophasic Typhimurium 4。 12：i：-. S. enteritidis， Typhimurium， monophasic Typhimurium1，4。12：i-， Infantis， and Newport in the European Union . Although the role of animal-based foods in the transmission of this pathogen to humans has been previously demonstrated， the prevalence of Salmonella serovars in these products is not yet fully understood. The prevalence in different food matrices varies according to countries and regions， influenced both by culture and food production practices， as well as by geographic location and economic power. Furthermore， production animals are often asymptomatic carriers， and after entering the slaughterhouse， Salmonella can be transferred to other substrates during industrial processing .\n\n【15】Salmonella typhimurium represented29.4% ofthetotal(918/3，113isolates) being the main serovar agent of salmonellosis in Brazil. The results reported here confirm that the Typhimurium serovar shows a cosmopolitan profile. It is considered an example of a generalist serovar. Therefore， these results corroborate those associated with S. typhimurium and its monophasic variant from a global point of view confirming that pork meat is the main source of this serovar. Thus， it is not surprising that it ranks second in Europe  and third in the United States  in reports of human salmonellosis. Despite the decrease in the number of diseases caused by S. Enteritidis this serovar ranked second with 20.8%(647/3，113 isolates) of the total.In this study， S. enteritidis was found to be the most prevalent serovar associated with human cases up to 2014. This is in agreement with the global increase in the incidence of this serovar since the 1980s associated with consumption of eggs and poultry and its decrease in the 2010s. It’s followed by S. Infantis with 5.1%(159/3，113 isolates). Table 1 details the top 10 serovars of each year in the analyzed period. Most of these serovars have a wide host range that can colonize several animals and are primarily transmitted to humans bv foods of animal origin， such as raw meat， pork， poultry， and eggs. Seafood， fruits and vegetables can also serve as vehicles . Several countries reported S. typhimurium， S. enteritidis， and S. Infantis as being the most related to enteric and invasive diseases in humans . In 2015 S. Heidelberg emerged among the main serotypes causing human salmonellosis with the peak of cases in 2016， becoming the second most common serovar. However， as of 2017， the frequency of serotyped strains such as S. Heidelberg from humans began to decrease， thus leaving the ranking of the 5 most frequently isolated serovars in humans as of2019.\n\n【16】In conclusion we present important data on the main Salmonella serotypes that have caused human salmonellosis in Brazil over the past ten years. Tracing the profile of circulating serotypes is the first step to understanding the epidemiology， and with this data produces actions to mitigate and control this pathogen.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 11:18:49", "endTime": "2024/09/24 11:18:57", "cost": 8.884}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:32", "update_time": "2024-09-23 19:18:57", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 19:18:48"}

The true incidence is unknown. The available estimates in literature report the range from 1/1800 to 1/2500of all caesarean delivery performed . The only risk factor is one or more previous caesarean sections. Vaginal bleeding of different degrees may be the first sign of a caesarean scar pregnancy， while pain is usually not a typical presenting symptom. Often the patient is asymptomatic and it is diagnosed when detected by the US. First-line imaging modality to diagnose caesarean pregnancy is transvaginal US especially in early pregnancy . The initial and early US (between 5 and 7weeks) are critical to avoid misdiagnosis. The differential diagnoses are： cervical pregnancy and a miscarriage in progress. US diagnosis criteria are： empty uterine cavity and emptyendocervical canal with detection of an early gestational sac and/or placenta in close proximity of the hysterotomy scar/niche， an absent or thin myometrial layer between the gestational sac and the anterior uterine wall and an abundant peri-trophoblastic blood flow at Doppler examination . In advanced pregnancy(above 12 weeks)， the US may not be decisive and final diagnosis is possible only during surgery. Moreover magnetic resonance imaging may also be useful in CSP diagnosis ， but the US provides the precise diagnosis in almost all cases with no need for additional modalities . If the pregnancy continues it may develop a placenta accreta or percreta， and it may cause very several outcomes that require lifesaving surgical procedures， such as vaginal or intra-abdominal bleeding， uterine rupture， hysterectomy and shock . The optimal management of CSP has not been completely clarified yet . The commonest clinical practice is to offer termination of pregnancy to avoid the consequences of this condition .\n\n【4】Materials and Methods\n\n【5】A 25-year-old Sri Lanka woman， GP 1001， presented herself to Pontedera Hospital for blood loss at 6+6 weeks of amenorrhea with urine pregnancy test positive. She was sent to Pisa Hospital because it was finding a heterotopic pregnancy and one of the two gestational chambers was on the hysterotomy site of the previous caesarean. The woman did a caesarean section an year before in Sri Lanka. The pregnancy was studied with transvaginal and abdominal ultrasound exam that described：“Anteverted uterus， inside which is displayed a 21 mm gestational sac on the bottom with a single embryo with BCE， 7 mm CRL and biometry corresponding to 6+2 weeks. Area of organized hematoma of 42 mm x 37 mm. Another gestational sac of 18 mm at isthmic level that reaches the hysterotomy scar， with a single embryo with BCE， 5 mm CRL. The thickness of the myometrium above the scar is regular and not invaded by the trophoblast.\" Pregnancy arising on the hysterotomy site was very dangerous for the mother and for the pregnancy itself. As pregnancy progressed， it could cause uterus rupture with consequent loss of the second gestational chamber and risk of death for the mother. Furthermore， between the two gestational chambers there was a large hematoma of unclear origin (detachment area?) which was probably the cause of the woman’s blood loss. The patient was hemodynamically stable. At first we waited three days to monitor the conditions of the woman and the twin pregnancy. The maternal blood loss progressively stopped， the two embryos grew regularly， both had a heartbeat and the hematoma between them remained stable compared to previous checks. The woman wished to continue with the intrauterine pregnancy， so we proposed her to perform selective voluntary abortion of the embryo located on the previous hysterotomy site. This attitude was intended to preserve the other pregnancy and to avoid bad consequences for the mother but it was not without risk. The abortion of the first embryo would have eliminated the risk of a future uterus rupture but could also lead to the abortion the second fetus. To carry out the abortion we decided to use aspiration of part of the sac contents and the injection of 2% KCl inside the gestational chamber because it minimizes the risks posed to the coexisting intrauterine pregnancy. We decided to abort the pregnancy on the caesarean scar but to leave the residual gestational sac in place to let it reabsorb on its own because removing it could cause the loss of the other pregnancy.\n\n【6】The operation was performed with local anesthesia and sedation. After a thorough disinfection of the vagina and external genitalia， the Criyagen transvaginal ultrasound probe was inserted and highlighted the two gestational chambers， one of which on the hysterotomy site and the hematoma organized between them. An oocyte retrieval needle was inserted through the posterior vaginal fornix with which5 cc of intracavitary fluid were aspirated and 1 cc of intracardiac KCl2 mEq/mL solution was injected into the embryo in the isthmus. We saw the arrest of the ECB of the embryo. At the end of the procedure， in the US exam the heartbeat of the embryo on the bottom was present .\n\n【7】After the procedure we carefully monitored the woman with serial clinical， blood chemistry and transvaginal ultrasound checks. The days after there was minimal blood loss that stopped after a few days. At the US exams was described on the bottom of the uterus a single embryo with BCE， increasing CRL corresponding to the weeks.\n\n【8】On the previous hysterotomy site there was a residual gestational sac in resorption. The thickness of the myometrium above the scar was regular and not invaded by the trophoblast. Upon discharge， the mother was sent back to normal pregnancy management by Pontedera Hospital. The pregnancy continued regularly， the growth of the remaining fetus was regular. The patient underwent an elective caesarean section at Lucca Hospital at 39 weeks and the fetal outcome was excellent.\n\n【9】Result and Discussion\n\n【10】The optimal management of CSP has not been completely clarified yet . It is a common clinical practice to offer termination of pregnancy in view of the reported high rate of morbidity associated. Iftheembryohas noheartbeat， it can followa waitingprocedure because a spontaneous abortion could occur. If the heartbeat is present it is better to perform an interruption of pregnancy because the risks of uterus rupture and other complications become greater. There are pharmacological treatments and surgical treatments. Operative methods include laparotomy， uterine artery embolization， hysteroscopy and curettage with suction. Dilatation and curettage with subsequent intrauterine Foley catheter insertion may be simple and effective but it is not recommended because it carries significant risk of bleeding and of secondary hysterectomy with fertility loss. Pharmacological treatment options include systemic or local administration of Methotrexate (MTX)， local administration of hyperosmolar glucose solution， chloride potassium， prostaglandin or combination of the medications. These substances can be used in laparoscopic assistance or directly injected into the gestational sac. Some authors reported local or systemic methotrexate administration as a most effective treatment but systemic methotrexate treatment can’t be used on the routine due to relatively low efficacy (fibrous tissue is poorly vascularized and drug penetration is insufficient) and high risk of various adverse effects . It is believed that MTX treatment is effective when serum bHCG levels are lower than 5000mIU/ml . Ultrasound imaging is not only used to diagnose but it is also used as a part of a combined approach. In fact， under ultrasound guidance， we can inject local methotrexate therapy in fetal sac (or both in fetal sac and in fetal pole) to end the pregnancyand to offer fertility preservation in asymptomatic pregnant patients without concomitant hemodynamic disorders . Ifthe CSP exceeding 3 cm， local methotrexate administration can be followed by laparoscopic or laparotomy surgical correction of the caesarean section scar. Promising results have also been obtained with the innovative HIFU technique that utilizes high intensity focused ultrasound. The most effective way to manage caesarean scar pregnancy is synchronous use of different treatment methods. The combination of local methotrexate with simultaneous aspiration of gestational tissues under ultrasound guidance seems one of the better and minimally invasive attitudes . It is the technique that we choose：Intracavitary fluid was aspirated and 1 cc of intracardiac KCl 2 mEq/mL solution was injected into the embryo. We have been very careful to inject methotrexate only in CSP and we have tried to be minimally invasive： Not to break the gestation sac and not to stimulate uterine contraction or spontaneous expulsion to protect the other pregnancy. We couldn't use systemic methotrexate because there were two pregnancies. After this stage， the remaining gestational tissues could be removed hysteroscopically with later vascular coagulation of the implantation site. In our case the remaining gestational tissues couldn’t be removed without damaging the pregnancy on the bottom， so we decided to leave it in place and to have it reabsorbed over time. As time passed the gestational material gradually reabsorbed while the bottom pregnancy continued to grow steadily. With this combined minimally invasive approach we have therefore saved the woman's life and preserved her fertility.\n\n【11】Conclusion\n\n【12】A definitive consensus of CSP treatment hasn't established yet and the type of treatment method depends on many factors. It is necessary to adapt the treatment to each individual patient taking into account size of pregnancy， bHCG level， presence or absence of uterine continuity， patient’s hemodynamic state， other contemporary pregnancies and fertility preservation .", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 11:07:18", "endTime": "2024/09/24 11:07:38", "cost": 19.302}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:32", "update_time": "2024-09-23 19:07:36", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 19:07:16"}

Tuberculosis is the responsible ofa respiratory chronic disease that spreads through the respiratory tract and has the lungs as primary target. The increase of new cases， mainly due to migratory flows， has led to the reappearance of aspects of the disease that are now forgotten. The aim of this paper8.3is focusing on a typical radiological sign indicative of progressive post-primary disease， actually no more considered in recent scientific literature， but well known to radiologists at the beginning of the 20\" century： The infiltrate of Assmann-Redeker. The recognition of this sign makes it possible the recognition of cases of early post-primary disease and the immediate implementation of the correct therapeutic procedure. Our paper consists of a series of four cases admitted to the Policlinico Umberto I in Rome， in which these findings were not initially recognized. Retrospectively this radiological sign was found on the chest X-ray. All Patients underwent chest CT to compare this finding. Diagnostic confirmation was finally obtained through laboratory investigations and one case histology proven， after surgery.\n\n【2】Abbreviations\n\n【3】CT： Computer Tomography； WHO： World Health Organization； TB： Tuberculosis； SARS-CoV-2： Severe Acquired Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2；PA： Posterior Anterior； LL： Latero-Lateral\n\n【4】Introduction\n\n【5】Tuberculosis (TB) is a chronic infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis， a Bacillus that spreads through the respiratory tract and most commonly has the lungs as target organs (80%).\n\n【6】According to data released in the World Report on Tuberculosis of 2018 by the World Health Organization (WHO)，this is one of the top ten deadly diseases worldwide and is the leading cause of death from a single pathogen. In 2014， the WHO proposed a global strategy to end tuberculosis epidemics around the world， estimating a 75% reduction in the death rate from tuberculosis in 2025and 95% in.\n\n【7】However， one of the main obstacles to achieving this objective is represented by the migratory phenomenon， with great difficulty in visualizing an epidemic outbreak， making its management more complex and demanding. The epidemic is influenced by several factors， such as high mobility， low socioeconomic status， poor hygiene， and poor accessibility to the health service， which involves a prolonged time for the diagnosis and treatment oftuberculosis， favoring the spread of the disease.\n\n【8】The migrant population is， therefore， subject to a higher risk of tuberculosis， constituting high challenges for the prevention and control of the disease.\n\n【9】Although TB is not a rare disease， the reduced knowledge of some indications， that was once well known and then forgotten， can lead to a delayed diagnosis. While the Gohn's complex， the characteristic tuberculous caverns， or the Miliary dissemination belong to common knowledge， there are less known but still characteristic findings of tuberculous disease that must return to a distant part of the cultural background of the radiologist specialist.\n\n【10】We intend to highlight in particular， a radiological sign of progressive post-primary disease， the infiltrate of Assmann-Redeker， now almost totally disappeared from modern literature despite the frequency， in the course of tuberculous disease， have not decreased at all.\n\n【11】Materials and Methods\n\n【12】We considered four cases which underwent diagnostic evaluation in our Institute in a period ranging from 2017 to 2020. All the radiological investigations suggesting tuberculous diseases were re-evaluated and integrated with the anamnestic and clinical data-laboratories.\n\n【13】The specific X-ray findings were：\n\n【14】Hazy infiltrative areas with mainly apical localization (SO-called Assman-Redeker infiltrate)\n\n【15】Focal areas oftranslucency referable to cavitation\n\n【16】Pleural effusion\n\n【17】The specific CT findings were\n\n【18】Consolidation and cavitation\n\n【19】Lymphadenopathy\n\n【20】Involvement of the airways\n\n【21】Pleural effusion \n\n【22】Finally， diagnostic confirmation with culture was obtained.\n\n【23】Case Series\n\n【24】Case 1\n\n【25】Man with recurrent syncopal episodes and marked weight loss： A 59 years old man was admitted in the emergency room complaining about some recurrent syncopal episodes preceded by dizziness. Smoking habit and marked weight loss of about 30 kg in the last six months have also reported.\n\n【26】The preliminary chest X-ray examination showed an area of consolidation at the left mid-upper field， adhering to the lateralpleura and extending to the perihilar area .\n\n【27】Based onto the medical history， the case was suspected for lung cancer. Following investigations were performed：\n\n【28】- Brain CT： No significant findings.\n\n【29】-Chest CT： Extensive area of consolidation at the left upper lobe compatible with cancer .\n\n【30】The patient underwent biopsy； the pathologist report was \"Diffuse lymphomonocytic infiltrate with extensive perivascular fibrous transformation\".\n\n【31】A chest X-ray a month later showed： An increase of the consolidation area was evident， extensively involving all the upper left lobe ：\n\n【32】The following CT shows a complete parenchymal subversion of the left upper lobe with lingular sparing .\n\n【33】During hospitalization， the serological investigations performed revealed an HIV infection. The previous diagnosis has been then reconsidered as a tubercular disease and the therapy changed to a specific antibiotic therapy with isoniazid， ethambutol， rifampicin and Pvrazinamide for six months.\n\n【34】A CT examination，7 months later， clearly showed the resolution of the pulmonary consolidation therefore to be attributed to reactivation of the bacillus in a patient with immunosuppression.\n\n【35】Case 2\n\n【36】Young man with suspected SARS-CoV-2pneumonia： A22-years-old man from Asia come to the Emergency Room for suspected Severe Acquired Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2infection (SARS-CoV-2)，with hyperpyrexia (T：39°℃) and respiratory symptoms (cough， cold， and sneezing). The medical history： was negative for major disease.\n\n【37】On CT scan， a consolidation with almost complete hepatization of the entire right upper lobe in the residual aerated parenchyma is observed and the presence of \"bronchiectasis cystic areas\" with a maximum size of 7 mm is described. Further consolidations are found in the middle lobe， right lower lobe， lingular segment， and left upper lobe. The first suspect is for COVID-19 infection so empirical anti-inflammatory and antibiotic therapy is undertaken .\n\n【38】In absence of clinical improvement， three weeks later ， chest CT scan was performed. The radiological findings showed a severe worsening， with the aerated part at the level of the right upper lobe replaced by some small cavitations. The overall picture described is indicative of Assmann-Redeker infiltrate. The diagnosis has been confirmed by sputum test. The patient has undergone specific therapy with the combination of four antibiotics： Isoniazid， ethambutol， rifampicin and pyrazinamide for the first six months.\n\n【39】Case 3\n\n【40】Woman with productive cough and hemoptysis： A 46-year-old woman was admitted to emergency room for productive cough and hemoptysis. The patient reported Kaposi's sarcoma from 2007， diabetes， and a previous right upper lobar infection not well defined.\n\n【41】The chest X-ray showed a big opacity in the right apical area and shift of the ipsilateral hemidiaphragm CT confirmed the complete atelectasis of the right upper lobe with cavitation in the context . Diagnosis of tuberculosis has been confirmed by sputum test.\n\n【42】The patient worsened with an increase of cavitation and necrosis phenomena； then an infection due to Aspergillus spp. arises .\n\n【43】X-ray shows an area of subversion of the lung parenchyma in the right apical area.\n\n【44】Axial thin-section collimated unenhanced CT image shows a complete atelectasis of right upper lobe and the presence of cavitation areas in the context.\n\n【45】In this case the only way to limit the expansive infective process was deemed to be to a superior lobectomy according to the advice of the thoracic surgeon. The histology confirmed Tuberculosis and Aspergillus co-infection.\n\n【46】Case 4\n\n【47】Young man with cough and dyspnea with unknown medical history： The last case is a 19-years-old man of Somali origin， admitted in our hospital after a humanitarian flight. He presented cough and dyspnea but most of his medical history remained unknown due to the language barrier. presented with fever and cough.\n\n【48】Axial thin-section collimated unenhanced CTimage shows apical consolidation with small cavitation phenomena with a \"breadcrumb\" appearance.\n\n【49】The area of opacity at the level of the left upper lobe， corresponding to an Assmann-Redeker infiltrate， was initially considered a heteroplastic process.\n\n【50】Worsening is evident. On the X-ray， the appearance of a coarse opacity with paarly defined margins is abserved， due to the presence of cavitative phenomena which are confirmed by CT examination.\n\n【51】Due to the poor documentation available the patient had been initially treated with a nonspecific antibiotic therapy.\n\n【52】The chest X-ray described an irregular opacity in the left apical area， with diffused hypodiaphania of the remaining parenchyma， probably due to pleural effusion .\n\n【53】The CT scan， performed four days later， confirmed apical consolidation with small cavitations (the so called \"breadcrumb appearance). This typical finding， in this case， is immediately identified as post-primary TB with apicodorsal reactivation of the left upper lobe (Assmann-Redeker infiltrate) .\n\n【54】Results and Discussion\n\n【55】Chest X-ray is commonly the first radiological examination in patients with a suspected tuberculous disease. It is the first level of investigation with the highest degree of appropriateness. In all cases of consolidation involving the upper lobes or the upper segments of the lower lobes， associated with mediastinal lymphadenopathy or cavitation， the diagnosis of TB must be considered .\n\n【56】Primary tuberculosis is mainly common in the pediatric population， although in low prevalence areas the adult population may represent more than a quarter of cases. This is because in many cases， primary tuberculosis has few or no symptoms； more often， only HIV patients can show clear signs of disease at this stage .\n\n【57】The radiographic features described in the literature are：\n\n【58】Lymphadenopathy which is the most common sign of primary TB， present in about one-third of cases.\n\n【59】Pulmonary consolidation， often not so different from other bacterial forms.\n\n【60】Pleural effusion， typically unilateral， present in about 25%of adult cases .\n\n【61】The Literature shows that chest X-ray has a high sensitivity but low specificity .\n\n【62】Post-primary tuberculosis， on the other hand， represents the evolution of the disease after a variable long latent period. This is mainly due to a partially competent immune system which leads to the reactivation of the Bacillus， with consequent dissemination.\n\n【63】At this stage， a typical sign well known to radiologists， especially in the pre-antibiotic era but less considered in recent literature， is the so-called early Assmann-Redeker infiltrate. This sign (also called\"precocious subclavicular thysiogenic infiltrate\") was described during the 1930s by Assmann and was considered one of the earliest signs of post-primary disease in adults until the 1950s， even before manifesting symptoms . The importance of early diagnosis of this aspect of post-primary TB lies in the finding， widely documented since the time of the first description， of an evolution of the infiltrate towards the much more extensive and severe caseous phlebitis， in case of delay in the introduction of therapy .\n\n【64】The infiltrate is described as a rounded opacity， mainly located at the infraclavicular level in correspondence with the upper lobes. The size may be variable and are not related to symptoms， while the density is similar to the hilar shadows but it never reaches the density of the mediastinum . The description given by Assmann concerned plan chest radiography. The evolution in caseous pneumonia was expressed with an extension of opacity to the whole lobe and the appearance of numerous small areas of cavitation， which provide the typical aspect defined as \"breadcrumb\".\n\n【65】In the CT era， as evident from literature， this infiltrate has never been distinguished by the severe post-primary TB， although this particular aspect may differentiate the advanced disease in which more extensive cavitations， present in about 50% of cases， represent the most characteristic sign The Assmann-Redeker infiltrate can be observed in CT as an area of parenchymal consolidation with blurred edges， mainly localized at the level of the posterior segments of the upper lobes and with a multiloculated appearance like a \"crumb of bread\".\n\n【66】Our first case is emblematic of the incorrect clinical/therapeutic management. In fact， the patient was initiallyconsidered oncological， thus conditioning the evolution of his disease. If a differential diagnosis with TB were immediately considered， prompt action would have been taken； avoiding the patient's worsening .\n\n【67】In the second case， the small cavitations due to caseous necrosis have been erroneously referred as cystic bronchiectasis. To rejoin the studies conducted by Assman at the beginning of the 204 century， in this case， the evolution of the disease was， precisely， what he described with the use of traditional radiology alone： Cavitation phenomena， typical of uncontrolled post-primary TB  .\n\n【68】Learning Points\n\n【69】The Assmann-Redeker infiltrate at chest X-ray presents as a rounded opacity， mainly located at the infra-clavicular level in the upper lobes with variable size and a density similar to the hilum， observed in patients in an early stage of post-primary tuberculosis CT scan， the second level exam， often reveals a typicallobar pneumonia with many areas of cavitation. This specific aspect is generally described as breadcrumb appearance.\n\n【70】When all these findings are presents， related to typical TB symptoms，radiologists should consider this infectious disease at first.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 10:48:16", "endTime": "2024/09/24 11:02:21", "cost": 845.147}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:32", "update_time": "2024-09-23 19:02:21", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 18:48:16"}

It can be isolated or associated with other malformations. The diagnosis can be made antenatally by morphological ultrasound in the second trimester or postnatally. The associated malformations and the degree of hydrocephalus are the two essential criteria that condition the subsequent prognosis.\n\n【2】We report a case of Dandy-Walker malformation that was diagnosed during a first routine prenatal ultrasound at 17 weeks of gestation. We will detail the contribution of ultrasound in the diagnostic process by comparing it with the data in the literature.\n\n【3】Keywords： Dandy walker malformation； Antenatal；Postnatal； Imaging\n\n【4】Introduction\n\n【5】Dandy-Walker syndrome is a group of heterogeneous cerebellar abnormalities starting from agenesis to hypoplasia or even early cerebellar atrophy.\n\n【6】It includes the Dandy-Walker malformation， the \"Dandy Walker variant\"： Cystic dilatations of the V4 resulting from other types of vermian and/or cerebellar anomalies， which is a malformation that does not validate the 3 criteria of the real Dandy-Walker and the Magna Mega Cistern .\n\n【7】Before 18 weeks of pregnancy， the prenatal ultrasound diagnosis of the classic Dandy-Walker malformation is easier than the definitive diagnosis of“Dandy-Walker variant\"and Mega-cisterna magna. A normal ultrasound appearance of the cerebellum in the second trimester does not rule out certain pathologies of the posterior fossa since its structures are not yet established. The sonographer must be careful before making a definitive diagnosis of “Dandy-Walker variant”or“mega-tank magna”.\n\n【8】We are reporting a case of Dandy-Walker malformation which was diagnosed during a first routine prenatal ultrasound at 17 weeks of pregnancy.\n\n【9】Case Presentation\n\n【10】This is a 29-year-old patient， gravida 3， para 2， married for 7 years， non-consanguineous marriage. In her obstetrical history， there is a vaginal delivery of a full-term newborn in good health and a C-section for fetal macrosomia with a good neonatal outcome.\n\n【11】She did a follow-up at 18 weeks of amenorrhea. Antenatal ultrasound performed at this term showed dolichocephaly with cystic malformation of the posterior fossa measuring 28 mm×23mm x17 mm associated with agenesis ofthe cerebellum as well as significant hydrocephalus and agenesis of the corpus callosum found in sagittal section . All of these conditions are consistent with Dandy-Walker malformation. In addition， there is an intrathoracic stomach hernia . An amniocentesis was performed showing a normal karyotype 46 XX. The case was presented in a multidisciplinary consultation meeting and a therapeutic interruption of the pregnancy was decided in agreement with the parents. Histopathological examination confirmed the ultrasound findings.\n\n【12】Discussion\n\n【13】Dandy-Walker malformation is a term that includes several anomalies of brain development. This anomaly is a congenital brain malformation usually involving the fourth ventricle and the cerebellum which was first described in 1914 by Dandy and Blackfan and was referred to as Dandy-Walker syndrome in 1954 by Benda， who also reported a familial origin . The prevalence of Dandy-Walker malformation is approximately 1：30，000 live births with a slight female preponderance as is the case for our patient and is responsible for 4% to 12% of infantile hydrocephalus .\n\n【14】A bibliographic search on the \"PubMed\" and \"ScienceDirect\"platforms concerning the antenatal diagnosis of Dandy-Walker syndrome was carried out； three articles were found during the period of. The studies involved 8 cases in total.\n\n【15】The Dandy-Walker malformation is frequently associated with other intracranial abnormalities such as agenesis of the corpus callosum found in our case. Also， to belooked for： Holoprosencephaly， occipital encephalocele and ocular anomalies . Extra-cranial anomalies are also to be sought and are in order of frequency：\n\n【16】Cardiac anomalies (38%)， facial dysmorphisms and cleft palate (26%)， dysgraphia， poly- and syndactyly (28%)， genital malformations-urinary (28%) and digestive (7%).\n\n【17】Other less common abnormalities include limb abnormalities， abdominal wall abnormalities and diaphragmatic hernia which are extremely rare and found in our clinical case. Sexual ambiguities have also been described .\n\n【18】Postnatal studies indicate that the incidence of associated malformations is between 50% and 70% . The most common etiology is genetic.\n\n【19】Environmental factors， infections， including viral (rubella，CMV)， alcohol and diabetes also seem to play a role in the pathogenesis of Dandy-Walker malformation but the scientific evidence remains uncertain. In our patient， there does not seem to be any infectious， environmental or genetic factors， especially since the karyotype is normal. In the absence of an obvious cause， the risk of recurrence in subsequent pregnancies is 1% to 5%.\n\n【20】Prenatal ultrasound diagnosis of Dandy-Walker malformation is quite simple. However， it is important to differentiate with other posterior fossa anomalies such as mega cistern magna and retrocerebellar arachnoid cyst. For this， a set of ultrasound signs must be sought：\n\n【21】At the level of the Posterior Cerebral Fossa (PCF)\n\n【22】In the cavo-thalamo-cerebellar section： A cystic dilation of the V4 leading to widening of the FCP， anechoic， triangular with an external base. the cerebellar hemispheres， hypoechogenic， are pushed back laterally and anteriorly， more or less hypotrophic， symmetrically or not. The vermis， echogenic， is hypotrophic or even absent (25%).\n\n【23】In the sagittal section： The tentorium of the cerebellum is elevated； the vermis presents a more or less significant amputation of its lower part going as far as the complete absence of individualization. The lower part of the vermis can be extended towards the torcular by a linear image \"in the tail of a comet corresponding embryologically to the upper wall of the Blake pouch. The brainstem is normal.\n\n【24】On the supratentorial level\n\n【25】Anomalies are found in 70% of cases： Hydrocephalus (60%)， agenesis ofthe corpus callosum (15%)， migration anomalies， lipomas and interhemispheric cysts， encephalocele， holoprosencephaly .\n\n【26】As for the MRI， it finds its place especially in case of diagnostic doubt with the other cystic malformations of the posterior fossa or if there is strong presumption of a form close to the Dandy-Walker malformation with vermian hypoplasia formerly called \"Dandy-Walker variant\".\n\n【27】It not only helps to refine the diagnosis initially screened by ultrasound， but it can also represent a useful imaging technique for confirming and characterizing the various cerebellar malformations thanks to the median sagittal sections of the posterior fossa. At an early stage (19 to 24 weeks of gestation)， it makes it possible to make the differential diagnosis between vermian malrotation and Dandy-Walker malformation by studying the biometry and morphology of all the structures involved .\n\n【28】Even in the second and third trimester， an inappropriate scan angle， can give the impression of excessive size of the cistern magna (great cistern) and even a vermian abnormality . The retrocerebellar arachnoid cyst is a less frequent and more benign anomaly than the Dandy-Walker malformation， because in this case， the overlying brain is normal. The cerebellar hemispheres are not separated by a cystic mass. Rather，they are moved en bloc .\n\n【29】As the congenital anomalies of the posterior fossa are numerous with an important anatomical nuance， a new ultrasound prenatal screening method was mentioned by an Italian-Polish team： It is the measurement of the angle of the Brainstem-Vermis (B-V) from17 weeks of amenorrhea on the median sagittal slice. In this series， normal fetuses have an angle always less than 18°. For the Blake pouch cyst， this angle is less than 30°， unlike fetuses with a Dandy-Walker malformation which present an angle (B-V) always greater than 45°. An intermediate value is noted for vermian hypoplasia .\n\n【30】Early detection at 14 WA has been reported by measuring the angle (B-V) making it possible to perform a trophoblastic biopsy in search of chromosomal abnormalities .\n\n【31】Based on the available evidence， it is believed that prenatal ultrasound allows definitive diagnosis only of severe anatomical varieties of Dandy-Walker syndrome. These are characterized byboth a large cystic mass in the posterior fossa and agenesis of the cerebellar vermis， which is called the classic Dandy-Walker malformation .\n\n【32】It is difficult to dispel doubt before birth about the presence of a mega-cistern magna or a small lower vermis anomaly. This can only be resolved by postnatal imaging studies (magnetic resonance imaging) or findings by fetal pathology study.\n\n【33】Conclusion\n\n【34】Dandy-Walker malformation is a rareand]heterogeneous malformation involving the cerebellar vermis. The first ultrasound clue to the diagnosis is an enlargement ofthe cistern magna. Fetal MRI allows a better characterization of this malformation. This pathology is associated with CNS malformations and other genetic diseases， which is why a study of the karyotype and molecular analyzes are suggested. Prenatal diagnosis of DWM cannot predict the prognosis of the disease， on the basis of which the medical team and the parents must make a decision， especially since there is no consensus in the literature.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 10:16:26", "endTime": "2024/09/24 10:16:32", "cost": 5.916}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:32", "update_time": "2024-09-23 18:16:30", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 18:16:24"}

With almost half of North American population having allergies to one or more common environmental antigens， it is imperative for us to look at the most upstream level involved in this reaction pathway. Though allergic reactions are rarely life-threatening it is a common issue in today's society that had led to much distress and loss of time.\n\n【2】To truly understand the mechanisms of an allergic reaction， we will try to analyze the earliest beginning of a reaction by looking at the impact of genetics and the cytokines involved in allergic reaction. While the most classical and common pathway involving IL-4 has been studied， we will be looking at a newer， less explored pathway involving IL-33 which has been very significant in allergic reactions and can be used as a future target for therapy.\n\n【3】IL-33 and ST-2\n\n【4】There are a group of damage-associated molecules released by tissue epithelial cells in response to external stimuli. These molecules are known as “alarmins.” One of the main alarmins being studied has been Interleukin-33 (IL-33). Originating from the IL-1 family of cytokines， IL-33 has been recently observed to be expressed in many allergy responsive cells such as epidermal， smooth muscle and epithelial cells. As we analyze allergies and the human response， it is important to appreciate this on an upstream level to comprehend all the signaling pathways and use this to evolve our knowledge base to create better treatments in the future .\n\n【5】IL-33 plays a vital part in allergic response through various pathways and one of the initial stages involve binding to a membrane-bound receptor called Suppression of Tumorigenecity 2 (ST-2 receptor) and an (IL 1-R co-receptor) IL-1Receptor accessory protein via a heterodimeric receptor complex. This leads to activation of the primary signal MyD88 cascade pathway via homotypic protein-protein reactions. Other pathways involved include an increase in IL-5 cytokines that are IL-4 independent producing T-cells. Th2 cells， in general， respond via two pathways： the classic pathway involves IL-4， STAT (signal transducers and activators of transcription proteins) and GATA3 (DNA sequence“GATA\"binding transcription factors) cascades while the non-classical pathway induces IL-5 production. This is polarized by IL-33 via the ST2 receptor and leads to a stronger allergic response.\n\n【6】The IL-5 cytokine also increases production of NF-kB (nuclear factor KB)， MAPKs (Mitogen Activated Protein Kinases) and OVA (Egg protein ovalbumin) that increase inflammation and activation of tissue-resident cells with ST-2. The IL-33/ST2 complex also increases TH2-inducing cytokines like Th17 that leads to cell-mediated airway inflammation via Mast Cells (MC).\n\n【7】The MyD88 pathway\n\n【8】The MyD88 signal cascade involves the MyD88 adaptor protein to increase production of several other proteins and cytokines including IRA K4 (Interleukin-1 receptor associated kinase 4)， TRAF6 (transcription factor 6)， IL-13 and IL-6. Increased IL-5 and induce goblet cell hyperplasia in respiratory epithelial cells . This in turn leads to heavier mucus production in respiratory epithelial cells and a stronger allergic response. These responses were highlighted by when they found administration of IL-33 failed to induce IL-5 and IL-13 secretion by MyD88 -/-T cells . They also found that IL-33 induces NF-kB p65 and the MAPK p38， JNK %(c-Jun N-terminal kinases) and ERK Y (extracellular signal-regulated kinases). Though IL-33 was reported to be integral to mast cells and allergic responses， the role of ST2 has been controversial for Ag-specific asthma. They concluded in that the IL-33/ST2 signaling is more involved in acute allergic response than chronic allergies.\n\n【9】The processing and release of IL-33\n\n【10】As part of the IL-1 family， IL-33 does not possess signal peptide to release the proteins via endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi pathway. Hence， via external stimuli like allergens or injury， IL-33 is released by epithelial， endothelial， smooth cells and fibroblasts. The involvement of IL-33 in the development of allergic rhinitis induced by ragweed pollen challenge as IL-33 knock-out mice failed to induce ragweed pollen induced allergic reaction . They found that Type2 Innate Lymphoid Cells (ILC2) localized in mucosal tissues like lung and intestine， adipose tissue and lymphoid organs like spleen and lymphoid tissue were major targets of IL-33 due to their high expression of ST-2 receptors. Thesecells also produced high quantities of type 2 cytokines IL-5 and IL-13 which was previously discussed as part of the signal cascade involving IL-33/ST2/MyD88. The various functions played by IL-33 have resulted in theorizing IL-33 to be both a cytokine and an intracellular nuclear factor with transcriptional regulatory functions .\n\n【11】The Novel Alarmin\n\n【12】IL-33 is considered a “novel alarmin\"due to its secretion upon necrosis or damage and released upon responseto antigen. It is notably increased in expression in asthmatic patients vs. normal patients. It has been reported to induce airway bronchoconstriction through mast cell activation in murine models and found IL-33 protein in the lungs of mice with OVA/alum-induced airway inflammation . This is due to the increased expression of tryptophan hydroxylase I by IL-33 that leads to serotonin synthesis and storage causing airway obstruction in asthma. It is also noted to be higher in patients with atopic dermatitis founded in epidermal keratinocytes. The high number of ILC2s in epidermal skin cells and lymph nodes release IL-5 leading to eosinophilic dermatitis. These are some of the many ways IL-33 is involved in various allergic reactions.\n\n【13】Future uses and novel therapy targeting IL-33\n\n【14】To create an effective future treatment， we have to appreciate the basic genetic component of IL-33 and understand the target region. IL-33 consists of an N-terminal helix-turned helix motif responsible for nuclear translocation and chromatin binding. It also has an IL-1like C-terminal domain， which is cleaved by a caspase to form a mature 18kDa peptide from the original 30 kDa peptide. The deletion of the N-terminal domain containing the chromatin-binding motif has led to early lethality in mice by constitutive secretion of IL-33 in serum leading to multi-organ failure .\n\n【15】One of the endogenous mechanisms that was studied was the recently reported IL-22 cytokine that originated from the IL-10， expressing REG3y from lung epithelial cells in mice that suppress IL-33 expression and accumulation of ILC2s in the lung. Another idea is to sequester ILL-33 in the nucleus of IL-33 producing cells. The parasite Heligmosomoides polygyrus releases a product named H. Polygyrus Alarmin Release Inhibitor (HpARI) that binds to IL-33via the N-terminus and tethers active IL-33 within necrotic cells . Other approaches involve controlling the bioactivity of IL-33 as it can be rapidly inactivated by oxidation of four critical cysteine residues that result in extensive reconfiguration of the ST2 receptors.\n\n【16】All these novel therapy approaches require further testing and clinical trials but the fact remains that IL-33 is a key factor in allergic responses. Targeting the IL-33/ST2 pathway will be a critical component in the future treatment of allergic reactions and the more extensive our knowledge grows on the vital IL-33 genetic and secondary pathways， the better future therapy will be to treat and prevent patients with allergic reactions.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 11:16:59", "endTime": "2024/09/24 11:17:58", "cost": 58.027}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:32", "update_time": "2024-09-23 19:17:58", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 19:16:59"}

India is a country of diverse culture and dynamic life-style which shows variations from one geographical location to another. Evidence suggests that 70% to 90% of cancers in India are related to lifestyle and can be easily prevented by adapting healthier life styles. Thus， this review aimed to examine risk factors of lifestyle cancers in different geographical locations in India. Three electronic databases， namely Psych INFO，JSTOR and Medline were systematically screened from December， 2017 to February，2018 for literatures on cancer and lifestyle risk factors. The search was limited to India， adults and papers written in English. 2，301 articles were identified and 10 were reviewed. Smoking and tobacco consumption were strongly related with lung， gastric and oral cancers in South and West India. Additionally， in West India， tea consumption was identified as a contributory factor for esophageal cancer while consumption of cabbage and sprout were found to lower the risk of colorectal cancer. In North India， attributions to esophageal cancer were snuff， smoking， salty tea， hookah， sundried foods and red chilli. A number of risk factors were unique to the different geographical locations in India. Awareness of these risk factors would help in strengthening preventive interventions which would facilitate a decline in cancer incidence in India and other countries where similar risk factors are prevalent. This review proposes to organize tailor-made awareness programs reflecting resonance to socio-cultural practice of people to reduce cancer incidence. Also， facilitation of tobacco and smoking cessation programs and strengthening of policies are strongly recommended to strengthen preventive interventions and reduce cancer incidence.\n\n【2】Keywords： Lifestyle； Cancer； Risk factor； Dietary patterns； India； Tobacco； Smoking\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Cancer is a lifestyle disease which is grouped according to the location of the cancerous stem cells. The World Health Organization defined cancer as “a generic term used for a large group of diseases that are characterized by the growth of abnormal cells beyond their usual boundaries and can invade to adjoining parts of the body) . Cancer is reported to be the second leading cause of death globally which accounted for 8.8 million deaths in 2015 . The burden of diseases is doubled in the developing countries in that both non-communicable diseases and communicable diseases contribute largely to morbidity and mortality， and India seems to fall in this category where the burden of non-communicable diseases and communicable diseases are 63% and 37%， respectively . The WHO Cancer Country profile revealed that 19.1% of premature deaths from NCDs  in 2016 resulted from cancer . In addition， WHO cancer country profile， also revealed an increase in cancer mortalities from 683，800 deaths in 2014 to 784，821 deaths in 2018which implies the increasing trend in cancer mortalities in India . Anand et al.  opined that only 5% to 10% of all cancer cases can be attributed to genetic defects， while the remaining 90%to 95% have their roots in the environment and lifestyle which includes cigarette smoking， diet， tobacco consumption， alcohol consumption， sun exposure， environmental pollutants， infections， stress， obesity， and physical inactivity.\n\n【5】In India alone， about 800，000 new cases of cancer are estimated to occur every year with stark variation across region where the age-adjusted incidence rates in men vary from 44 per 100，000 in rural Maharashtra to 121 per 100，000 in Delhi . The major cancers in men are mostly tobacco-related namely lung， oral cavity， larynx， esophagus， and pharynx. In women， the leading cancers sites include are cervix， breast， and ovary cancer and those related to tobacco namely oral cavity， esophagus， and lung . India has the largest number of oral cancers in the world， due to the widespread habit of chewing tobacco . Also， India is a nation with wide diversity in food habits and cultural practices， some of which are also found in other countries of the world. The prevalence of lifestyle cancers in India therefore gives a reason to critically examine the risk factors associated with these cancers for the management of lifestyle cancer incidence in India and the world at large.\n\n【6】Methodology\n\n【7】Literature selection criteria\n\n【8】A computerized search for literature was conducted using electronic databases namely Medline through Pubmed， Psych Info and JSTOR. The broad search term used for this review was cancer’which was combined with keywords prevalence’， fepidemiology， burden， qualityoflife， health care services，using AND'as Boolean operator. Each combination was carried out individually to get maximum results. In addition， MeSH term for cancer i.e. ‘neoplasm’was also used for each combination to cover maximum results. All search results were limited to studies with humans and published in English language. To retrieve more recent literature， a timeline of 10years was traced for database search but in case of JSTOR， timeline of only last five years was retrieved owing to huge nature of JSTOR.\n\n【9】Since lifestyle behavior is mainly formed in adult life， thus present review focuses on cancers among adults leaving children out of the scope of selection procedure. Thus， inclusion criteria for identifying the studies for this review included： 1. Research papers only， review papers or conceptual articles were excluded 2. Cancer as main disease， cancer as co-morbidity was excluded 3. Cancer among adults， studies with children were excluded 4. India as nationality and residency，studies with non-Indians and migrant Indians were excluded.\n\n【10】Data extraction process\n\n【11】Identification of studies for this review involved four stages. At the first stage， a total of 2，301 studies were retrieved from three databases using above keywords， out of which 1，402 were irrelevant to present review since these were pharmacological studies， molecular studies， genetic studies or studies conducted outside India. In addition， 167duplicates were manually removed by the titles resulting in 732studies to be screened by abstract.\n\n【12】At the second stage， 732 papers were screened with abstract reading， out of these 617 studied either children or elderly subjects， focused cancer as comorbidity， conducted with non-Indians or migrated Indians. This resulted in 115 studies after abstract screening to be reviewed for full text availability.\n\n【13】At the third stage， all the selected 115 studies were searched for full text availability but only 82 studies were available in full text to download excluding 33 studies from the scope of this review. Further， another 67 studies were removed because they combined children and adult population， focused on lesions， or were review papers which were not clear from abstract reading. Another 5 duplicate studies that were previously omitted were manually removed at full text reading resulting in 10 studies eligible for this review. The selection procedure of eligible studies is presented in Figure 1. Step 1\n\n【14】& 2 was first conducted by DK which was then reviewed by TB&AK Step 3& 4 were conducted by DK and TB together.\n\n【15】Data from selected 10 studies were extracted using a self developed data extraction form  which presented information like year of study， location， age group， duration of study， study setting， objectives， study design， sample size， sampling strategy， analysis procedure and results to facilitate transparency in data analysis. DK extracted data from selected studies. TB and AK then assessed a 30% sample of randomly selected studies to check accuracy and ensure rigor in data extraction process. We differed at few instances in methodology and findings sections of the reviewed studies but consensus was arrived after discussion.\n\n【16】Results\n\n【17】On the basis of geographical location ofthe research， the selected studies were grouped into three categories： 1. South India (three studies) 2. West India (four studies) 3. North India (three studies)\n\n【18】We could not find any study from eastern part of India using our search strategy.\n\n【19】Studies from South India\n\n【20】One study from South India reported the clinical profile and epidemiological trends of lung cancer with an emphasis on smoking practices . The data was collected from a sample of 258 lung cancer patients (200 males， 58 females) from January 2003 to December2007. The age range of the participants in this study was 26 to 77years. The study reported 60.5% participants were ever-smokers while only 39.5% were never smokers. Among the smokers， 71.8%smoked cigarette while 28.2% smoked bidi. A significant correlation(P=0.0028) was found between advanced age at presentation (>60years) and those with a history of smoking.\n\n【21】Jayalekshmi et al.  reported a cohort study conducted in Kerala on the risk of gastric cancer in relation to tobacco and alcohol consumption. A baseline survey was conducted on every resident of Karunagappally taluk covering 65，553 participants (30 to 84 years) for socio-demographic and other lifestyle-related factors from January 1990 to December， 1997. The face-to-face interview survey was conducted with the help of trained field investigators for each resident using a 6-page， standardized questionnaire which was constructed with specific questions to elicit factors such as household socioeconomic status， religion， education， income， and occupation along with lifestyle factors such as smoking and drinking habits， and dietary practices . The study reported that Bidi smoking was associated with Gastric Cancer (GC) risk (P=0.042). The Relative Risks (RR) comparing current versus never smokers was 1.6 (95% CI：1.5). Gastric cancer risk was associated with the number of bidis smoked daily (P=0.012) and duration of bidi smoking (P=0.036). Those who started smoking bidi at younger ages were at an elevated GC risk. The RRs for those that started bidi smoking under the age of 18 and ages 18 to 22 were 2.0 (95% CI： 1.9) and 1.8(95% CI：1.9)， respectively， when their risks were compared with lifetime non-smokers of bidis.\n\n【22】Mahapatra et al.  also examined the association between oral cancer risks and consumption of tobacco， cigarette and other oral dip products from March 2013 to July 2013 with 402 participants (134 cases， 268 controls) in Karnataka. The study reported that the risk of oral cancer is associated with smoking， smokeless， oral dip products， gutkha and other tobacco products. They also reported a preponderance of males (82.8%) over females (17.2%). Majority of the cases consumed gutkha (35.8%)， 14.9% consumed supari， 20.1%chewed tobacco， 17.4% consumed betel quid， 9.7% used snuff， and70% consumed alcohol daily. They further reported the odds of oral cancer in cases that consumed gutka， supari， tobacco， betel quid， bidi and alcohol to be 4.3， 3.2， 6.9， 2.1 times higher than those that do not consume these products respectively. Conversely， there was no association between mishiri， betel quid， smoking cigarettes and the risk of oral cancer.\n\n| Table 1： Summary of reviewed studies.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| First AuthorandYear  | Objective(S)  | Design  | Sample and Samplingstrategy  | Analysis procedures  | Main finding s  | ReviewerRemarks  |\n| Krishnamurthy et al.，2012， South India(Chennai  | To analyze the clinical profileand the epidemiologicaltrends in lung cancer patients with an emphasis onthe smoking practices from asingle tertiary care center  | 5-Year Retrospective-prospective study on 258lung cancer patients (200males， 58 females) aged26-77 years in a tertiaryhealth setting in Chennai.  | Retrospective analysis ofprospectively collected dataof consecutive hospitalin-patients with a provendiagnosis of lung cancer at atertiary care oncology centre.  | SPSS software (Versionwas used.  | 60.5% were smokers while 39.5% were non-smokers.Smokers were cigarette(71.8%) and bidi (28.2%)smokers.  | Single facilitystudy which maynot represent thegeneral populationSample sizedetermination wasnot reported.  |\n| Krishnamurthy et al.，2012， South India(Chennai  |  |  |  |  | Acenocarcinoma was most prevalent among non-smokers(52.7%)and squamous cellcarcinoma among smokers(80.4%).  | Study includedsurvival rate of thesample.  |\n| Krishnamurthy et al.，2012， South India(Chennai  |  |  |  |  | Signiticant correlation ofsmokers presented atadvanced age (>60 years] withsquamous histology comparedto adenocarcinoma histology (P=0.00281.  | Structured abstract  |\n| Ganesh，et al.

They studied the risk of demographic， dietary habits and lifestyle factors through interview in an out-patient department. These examined tobacco， alcohol， unhealthy diet and tea drinking as risk factors of esophageal cancer and colorectal cancer in Mumbai. They reported a moderate 1.3 times excess risk for chewers of pan(betel-leaf) with tobacco， 1.8-fold excess risk each for bidi smokers and alcohol drinkers， 2-fold for cigarette smokers， and tea drinking showed a 4-fold excess risk for esophageal cancer. Both studies also reported a dose-response relationship among pan with tobacco chewers and an increased risk with time duration. Similarly， bidi and cigarette smoking showed a positive dose-response relationship where the risks increased to 2.4 and 2.5 folds respectively. Some significant findings emerged regarding the dietary habits and colorectal cancer. Cabbage-eaters had a 50% reduction in risk among both the genders， compared to those who did not eat cabbage. Sprout eaters also had a 30% to 50% reduction in risk. There was an enhanced1.4-fold risk among ‘dry-fish'eaters compared to non-eaters. Among women， meat-eaters had a 2.4-fold excess risk than non-meat-eaters. Dark-green-leafy-vegetables did not show any protective effect for colorectal cancer .\n\n【29】Madani et al.，between February， 2005 and September， 2006examined the risks of oral cancers with consumption of tobacco， cigarette and other oral dip products in Pune. A matched case-control sample (N=700； 350 controls， 350 cases) was studied using a self-reported questionnaire tracking information on consumption of tobacco， poly-ingredient oral dip products， alcohol， dietary habits and demographic status. A great risk of oral cancer in tobacco chewers and oral dipping consumers was reported. Three Smoking categories (filtered， non- filtered cigarette and bidi) were prevalent in cases and all the oral dip products {chewing tobacco， mishiri， gutkha， and supari} except betel quid， (P=0.112)， and panparag(P=0.621)， showed significant difference in cases. The study reported an increased risk amongst bidi smokers but no significant effect of betel quid and filtered cigarette on oral cancer risk .\n\n【30】Balasubramanian et al.  reported the risk factors for Non-Hodgkin lymphoma in Mumbai (1997 to 1999) with male subjects only (N=1，773； 390 cases， 1，383 controls) through a pre-designed questionnaire . The study examined the significance of alcohol， tobacco， dietary items and occupational exposure to non-Hodgkin lymphoma risk. The findings suggested that， among the dietary items， only consumption of mutton showed 7.0-fold significant excess risk for non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Consumption of milk showed a 6-fold excess risk (OR=1.5)； while coffee showed a 50% reduction risk for non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Among occupational factors， exposure to pesticides showed 3-fold excess risk for non-Hodgkin lymphoma.\n\n【31】Studies from North India\n\n【32】In North India， Sehgal et al.  reported the risk factors of Esophageal Cancer (OC) in Jammu (N=400； 200 cases， 200 controls). Samples were selected from patients who attended the Endoscopy Unit of Government Medical College from October 2007 to July2011. Patients below the age of 80 years and being diagnosed with squamous cell carcinomas of the esophagus were the cases while patients diagnosed with other diseases were the controls. Data on age， gender， educational level， and socio-economic status， family history of OC (first-degree relatives)， clinic pathological symptoms and dietary habits were collected using a short-structured questionnaire. The study examined risk factors and survival rate of OC and revealed that among dietary characteristics， snuff was highest (OR=3.86，95%) followed by salt tea (OR=2.53， 95%)， smoking (OR=1.97，95%)， sundried food (OR=1.77， 95%) and red chilly (OR=1.76，95%). The probability of survival also lowered significantly among those consuming tobacco in the form of snuff and smoking as compared to those who did not take these .\n\n【33】Also， Khan et al.  conducted a study at a tertiary care institution in Kashmir from January to December， 2008 with a sample of 100 diagnosed patients of esophageal cancer (cases) and100 healthy individuals (controls). A predesigned questionnaire covering personal， occupational， dietary and family history was administered. A preponderance of male cases over females was reported and majority of the cases were farmers (37%) and house-wives (29%) belonging to the low-socioeconomic status. It was further reported that， 91.7% of the cases were hookah smokers(major mode of smoking in Kashmir)， 78.8% smoked more than 20 g of tobacco per day， and 24% consumed five cups of salty tea per day. Sun-dried vegetable called Haakh was consumed by both cases and controls. With respect to fruit consumption， 45% cases consumed monthly， 40% consumed weekly while none consumed fruits daily. Consumption of meat on a monthly， weekly and daily basis was69%/15%/14% and 44%/42%/14% in controls and cases respectively. None of the groups chewed tobacco or consumed alcohol.\n\n【34】The third study is a matched hospital-based case control study(February 2008 to October 2009) conducted on the role of lifestyle and dietary factors in Gallbladder Cancer (GBC) in the Northern part of India . The study was conducted at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences， New Delhi with a sample size of 244 individuals from Delhi， Uttar Pradesh， Bihar， Uttarkhand， Rajasthan， Punjab， Orissa and Jharkhand. Cases  were newly registered confirmed primary GBC patients while controls  were healthy relatives of patients. Data were collected using a semi-structured interview schedule. The study revealed that illiteracy， low socioeconomic status， high parity (more than three)； early pregnancy and use of non-liquefied petroleum gas are associated with the risk of gall bladder cancer. They further reported that there was no significant relationship between alcohol consumption， tobacco consumption， education and age at menarche. Vitamin C intake was also reported to have a protective effect . Geographical distribution of risk factors has been presented on India map in supplementary file .\n\n【35】Discussion\n\n【36】This systematic review appraised the risk factors for cancer in India. The studies were location-specific with none covering India as a whole. In addition to the commonly known risk factors like smoking， alcohol and tobacco consumption， dietary patterns and life style factors were also identified to pose risk to certain cancers. However， a variation was seen depending upon geographicallocation and different cancer sites.\n\n【37】Smoking\n\n【38】Smoking has been identified as the predominant cause of lung cancer， esophageal， oral and gastric cancer across the world having increased risk with longer duration andhigh quantity of consumption. Earlier studies have reported a higher risk with bidi smoking in comparison with cigarette . High prevalence of lung cancer in Chennai was attributed to smoking (bidi and cigarette) especially among males， and the significant correlation found between advanced age at presentation (>60 years) and those with a history of smoking suggests high risk of cancer among advanced age smokers in comparison to young age . Hookah smoking was quite popular in Kashmir region particularly among farmers. Smoking was also an established risk factor for esophageal cancer . In Pune， bidi smoking was identified as a significant risk to oral cancer while betel quid and filtered cigarette were not. Bidi smoking was observed to be more prevalent than cigarette； this could be attributed to the cheap cost thereby implicating its affordability by the low socioeconomic status .\n\n【39】In Kerala， higher frequency and increased duration of bidi smoking heightened the risk of cancer and significant differences were observed for gastric cancer incidence among the low socioeconomic class. These differences could be associated to their dietary patterns， although it was not reported in the reviewed study Cigarette smoking and bidi smoking were reported to be associated with Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL) in Mumbai while alcohol consumption was not， although riskwas enhanced in drinkers by 50% compared to non-drinkers .\n\n【40】Passive smokers\n\n【41】Previous studies have established the association between smoking and lung cancer； nevertheless， there has been a rising trend in the occurrence of lung cancer in non-smokers as well especially among females. This could be attributed to second-hand smoking， whereby they were exposed to passive smoking from their spouses while they worked closely on the farm and other indoor air pollutants. This has also been reported as a contributory factor predisposing women to the risk of esophageal cancer in addition to the use of cow dung， wood and coal for cooking in Kashmir .\n\n【42】Tobacco consumption\n\n【43】Consumption of tobacco has been reported in various forms， such as， cigarette， hukka， bidi and snuff in the Jammu region . In addition to previously established association of cigarette， hukka and bidi with esophageal cancer， snuff intake has also been correlated with esophageal cancer because of the presence of tobacco carcinogens in moist snuff .\n\n【44】Over half of all tobacco consumed in India is smoked as bidi(Indian specific non-filtered cigarette) and about one-fourth of tobacco consumption is in smokeless form， such as chewing tobacco and mishiri . A great risk for oral cancer was found in the habit of tobacco chewing， with or without lime， which is kept in the mouth for different durations depending on personal habits. In an investigation that compared smokers with smokeless tobacco and oral dipping products users， both were at increased risk of oral cancer . This could be due to the direct contact of these products with the oral epithelium of the users.\n\n【45】India has the largest number oforal cancer diagnosis in the world， due to the widespread habit of chewing tobacco . Oral cancer is strongly attributed to consumption of gutkha， tobacco chewing， consumption of supari and consumption of mishiri. Areca nut， the seed of the fruit of the oriental palm Areca catechu， is commonly used in India to prepare paan or betel quid， pan masala and gutkha. Chewing of pure areca nut has been associated with the risk of oral cancer because of its ability to promote carcinogenesis . Gutkha contains areca nut， slaked lime， catechu， condiments， and powered tobacco. Gutkha can be highly addictive when compared to chewing ordinary tobacco as it has been previously shown to be a gateway to smoking .\n\n【46】When compared with non- consumers， Gutkha consumers were5.1 times more at risk of oral cancer， supari consumers were 11.4times more at risk，tobacco chewers were 6.0 times more at risk， betel quid consumers were 6.4times more at risk and bidi smokers were 2.3times more at risk of oral cancer while Betel quid had no significant effect in causing oral cancer .\n\n【47】This could infer a protective effect of betel leaf (the main ingredient of betel quid) to the oral mucosa against the harmful alkaloids in areca nut. Betel leaf is known to be rich in beta-carotene which has the capacity to quench free radical .\n\n【48】In contrast， another study opined that chewing tobacco with paan (betel leaf) is more harmful in causing esophageal cancer than chewing tobacco only. It was speculated that while chewing tobacco with betel leaf， the juice comes in contact with the esophagus mucosa as opposed to tobacco juice alone which may be spat out without a direct contact with the esophagus mucosa .\n\n【49】Alcohol consumption\n\n【50】Although oral cancer risk was not reported to be associated with cigarette smoking and mishiri consumption but alcohol was reported to be associated with a high risk of oral cancer . In Kerala， Alcohol consumed was limited to arrack because it was the commonly consumed among the study population. Majority of the cases were educated only until primary level and this could have an influence on their heightened alcohol consumption. Future researches are therefore recommended to establish the association of gastric cancer with other alcoholic drinks alcohol drinking was not reported in Kashmir； this could be due to the prevalence of Muslims in the region.\n\n【51】Dietary pattern\n\n【52】Tea is a common beverage in India. Salted tea has been reported as a dietary factor which is strongly associated with esophageal cancer. The tea is prepared by brewing green tea leaves with sodium chloride to obtain a reddish brown extract after which water， salt and milk are added to it. Consumption of bicarbonate-containing hot salted tea， commonly consumed by Kashmiri people， has been identified as dietary high-risk factor associated with the development of esophageal carcinogenesis. This type of tea is commonly consumed at a high temperature due to the harsh weather that is prevalent in the region. The hyperthermic effect of this tea could be injurious to the esophageal mucosa . This correlates with an earlier study that reported a relationship between tea drinking and stomach cancer in Kashmir.\n\n【53】Also， the risk of esophageal cancer due to tea drinking was reported in Mumbai as a result of the high temperature of the tea consumed， which could be injurious to the esophageal lining， although the actual temperature that causes injury is not known. In contrast， another investigation reported tea drinking to show less risk and coffee drinking showed a 50% reduction in risk when compared to non-drinkers . Coffee has been reported to protect from cancer through the activity of its anti-carcinogenic constituents.\n\n【54】In Kashmir region， the diet commonly consumed are cooked rice， green-leafy vegetable called haakh and salted tea. These have limited source of protective factor from esophageal cancer， as compared to the consumption of different varieties of fruits and vegetables， which are rich in the presence of vitamins and carotene that induces anti-oxidant effects . Increased intake of vitamin C was reported to be a protective factor against Gall Bladder Cancer， this is supported by an earlier hypothesis posing vitamin C to be an antioxidant which prevents the formation of carcinogen from precursor compounds， although there is no strong evidence for this . Also， dietary factors revealed red meat consumption to be a high risk factor for the incidence of NHL； this has also been confirmed by earlier studies. However， high consumption of vegetables reduced the risk of NHL but they did not emerge as a protective factor . Fresh fish on the other hand was reported to be a protective factor， this finding is similar to a study reported on risks of esophageal cancers in Mumbai. Animal studies have shown that fat from fish contains 20% to25% saturated fatty acids， and fish and fish oil are a rich source of n-3fatty acids and the fat-soluble vitamins A and D， and these n-3 fatty acids have anti-inflammatory effects .\n\n【55】Meat consumption was found to be a risk factor among the women in the population which could be as a result of their small sample size when compared to the males (females =59， males =144). Further research should be conducted on a larger population in order to establish the association between meat consumption and colorectal cancer in females. Among the vegetarian diets， only cabbage and sprout consumption were reported to be protective factors while dark green leafy vegetables， root vegetables and other vegetables were not shown to reduce the risk of colorectal cancer. The anti-carcinogenic actions of cruciferous vegetables are commonly attributed to them because theycontain glucosinolates . Sprouts contain antioxidants which may be the reason for its protective factor.\n\n【56】Food preservation\n\n【57】Owing to unavailability of vegetables， nomadic lifestyle and harsh weather， sun-drying is a common strategy used to preserve food in Jammu and Kashmir. This method facilitates the growth of mould， fungi and the presence of trace levels of several volatile and non-volatile N-nitroso compounds which have been strongly implicated with esophageal cancer .\n\n【58】Furthermore， the risk of colorectal cancer in Mumbai was associated with consumption of dry fish. This is speculated to be due to the fact that the dry fish is salted， dried and preserved for later use thereby exposing it to harmful microorganisms .\n\n【59】Occupational exposure and socioeconomic factors\n\n【60】Occupational exposure was reported as a contributory factor to the risk of esophageal cancer in Kashmir where farmers are likely exposed to hazardous chemicals and biological farming that are suspected carcinogens . Although， the relationship between farming and risk of esophageal cancer was reported， other occupations were not included， therefore studies that include other occupations are strongly recommended. Also， poor socio-economic status posed to be a major risk factor predisposing the population to esophageal cancer in Kashmir. The absence of dietary nutrients， specifically vitamins A， E，Candtrace elements like zinc and selenium in meals， as observed in poor people increases the chances of cancer.\n\n【61】In North India， the risk factors associated with Gall Bladder Cancer (GBC) were low education， three or more parity (childbirth)， early pregnancy and exposure to non-liquefied petroleum gas . Early pregnancy and multiple pregnancies will elevate the levels of progesterone and estrogen which may change the lithogenicity of bile and increase the risk of GBC . Non-liquefied petroleum gas does not burn completely therefore producing carbon monoxide， poly-organic and poly-aromatic hydrocarbons and other gases that could be carcinogenic thereby causing harm to women who use them to cook . The role of traditional non-liquefied petroleum gas fuel in the incidence of GBC has not been well established， therefore future research is recommended in this area.\n\n【62】India being a country with a wide variation in food habits and cultural practices infers the possibility of similar lifestyle risk factors in other nations of the world. Consumption of hot tea and smoking are common habits in cold regions where people want to stay warm in the cold seasons. Also， there is a high rate of alcohol and tobacco consumption in many developed and developing countries inferring a high risk ofcancer incidence. In addition， meat is a highly consumed non-vegetarian diet in various countries in the world while vegetables are still less consumed in many countries causing poor nutrient intake in the population. These lifestyle risk factors， though are revealed from studies in India have the potential to draw inferences to other countries which have similar life-style.\n\n【63】Major gaps and recommendations\n\n【64】Hospital based surveys might not present the actual prevalence of cancer in the regions， therefore large population-based research is required to reveal the lifestyle risk factors of various cancers in the country for policy based interventions Also， occupational exposure history especially exposure to chemicals， poisonous gases， and other occupational hazards needs to be studied with large samples in order to examine the suggesting relationship with cancer. In addition， physical activity which is also a risk factor for lifestyle cancers was not included in any of the reviewed studies.\n\n【65】We therefore recommend future research focusing on physical activity and its association with risk of cancers. In addition， we recommend that future research should examine the evidence of these contributory factors in the risk of cancers in India. Also， we recommend the need for quality research in other parts of India， in order to provide a wider perspective to the lifestyle factors that is contributing to the rising burden of lifestyle cancers in India.\n\n【66】Conclusion\n\n【67】In conclusion， this systematic review reveals that lifestyle cancers have a high incidence in India and this could be associated with the prevalence of risk factors like tobacco consumption， alcohol consumption， and dietary patterns of which tobacco consumption， a common habit in India is foremost. Lung cancer， gastric cancer， oral cancer， colorectal cancer， esophageal cancer， Gall bladder cancer and non-Hodgkin'slymphoma were identified as main cancers attributing to life style factors. Though life style factors like smoking， tobacco consumption， and other oral dip products were common factors in north， south and west India， few risk factors like consumption of salty tea， hookah，sundried foods and red chilly were unique to North India. Cabbage sprouts and Vitamin C rich foods were identified to have protective properties. Consumption of high temperature tea poses a risk of esophageal cancer while coffee has protective tendencies. Also， the consumption of various fruits and vegetables that are rich in vitamins and carotene have anti-oxidant effects which reduce the risk of lifestyle cancers. Among non-vegetarian diets， fresh fish is a protective factor while the risk associated with meat consumption is not yet established. However， the exposure of dry fish to harmful micro-organisms during preservation makes it a threat to the body. Amongst females， cooking methods such as the use of non-liquefied petroleum gas， cow dung， coal and wood and also exposure to passive smoking， high parity， and early pregnancy also emerged as risk factors for life style cancers. Contributory factors like occupational exposure， low education， and low socio-economic status have also been identified with these cancers. There is variation in the incidence of risk factors in different regions due to the diversity of lifestyle patterns in India， a reflection of what exists in the globe. This review therefore implies the need for better and more effective awareness programs which focuses not only on widely known risk factors but also those that are yet to be established. Also，establishment of tobacco and smoking cessation programs at various levels and enactment of policies to strengthen preventive measures are strongly recommended to achieve a decline in the burden of lifestyle cancers.\n\n【68】Limitations of the Study\n\n【69】Due to time constraint， the reviewer could not explore other databases like CINAHL which could have added to the available studies in the reviewed area. In addition， only published data that was available online was used by the reviewer leaving grey literature out of scope of this review.\n\n【70】What is known about the Topic of Tobacco and Alcohol are highly associated with lifestyle cancers.\n\n【71】In India， 70% to 90% of cancers can be associated to lifestyle and can be easily prevented by adapting healthier lifestyles.\n\n【72】India has the highest number of oral cancer cases in the world due to the common habit of chewing tobacco in the country.\n\n【73】What the Paper Adds\n\n【74】In addition to the consumption of Tobacco and Alcohol which is generally associated to lifestyle cancer， dietary pattern consumption ofhookah， salty tea， poor food preservation，occupation hazards andpoor socio-economic status were also associated with the incidence oflifestyle cancers in India and were specific to North India.\n\n【75】Diversity of lifestyle patterns were noted in the different geographical locations in the country and therefore informed variation in the incidence of risk factors of lifestyle cancers in India Esophageal，gastric，colorectal，oral， Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma，lung and Gall bladder cancers have been associated with lifestyle risk factors in India.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 11:04:50", "endTime": "2024/09/24 11:07:17", "cost": 147.3}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:32", "update_time": "2024-09-23 19:07:16", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 19:04:47"}

The most prevalent tumors occurring in pregnant females are malignant melanoma(2.8/1000)， followed by carcinoma of the cervix (1/2200) and breast (1/3000). A review of the literature didn't find any convincing evidence that pregnancy has a deleterious impact on the incidence of clinical profile of malignancy as compared to non-pregnant women of reproductive age， except in the case of malignant melanoma.\n\n【2】Urological malignancy in pregnancy is rare and poses a diagnostic and treatment challenge. Here， we report a case of non-muscle invasive bladder carcinoma in the pregnant female， successfully managed by TURBT (Transurethral Resection of Bladder Tumor)，resulting in good maternal and fetal outcomes.\n\n【3】Keywords： TURBT； Non-muscle invasive bladder cancer； Pregnancy\n\n【4】Introduction\n\n【5】Urological malignancies are very uncommon in pregnancy， with an overall incidence ofaround1/1000 pregnancies . Though rare， they can impose particular problems in diagnosis and management during pregnancy as fetal wellbeing has to be kept in mind too.\n\n【6】Case Presentation\n\n【7】A 25-year-old pregnant woman in the 36th week of gestation was presented to the hospital owing to painless gross intermittent hematuria with clots for the last four months. She denied any history suggestive ofurinary tract infections， renal calculus， or other genitourinary complaints. Herprenatal course had been otherwise uneventful， and she had no history of such urological complaints. She was a nonsmoker， nonalcoholic， and had no history of occupational or chemical exposure. On examination， the patient was pallor， normotensive， afebrile， and had stable vitals and voiding of wine-colored urine with blood clots. The fetus was active and the fetal heart sounds were strong. There was no evidence of vaginal bleeding. Her complete blood count was within normal limits except for normocytic normochromic anemia (Hemoglobin 9.2 gm/dl). Blood urea nitrogen，serum creatinine， viral markers， and coagulation survey were non-contributory. Her urine analysis showed numerous red blood cells with no casts or crystals and her urine culture was negative. Ultrasound examination revealed mild pregnancy-related hydronephrosis without any calculus and single space-occupying， papillarylesion of size approximately 2 cm x2 cm with high vascularity was noted at the right anterior wall of the bladder， suggestive of bladder tumor. The kidneys were normal in appearance. A single live fetus without any uterine abnormalities was noted.\n\n【8】She was being followed conservatively but in meantime， she started to have severe gross hematuria with clots retention leading to a fall in hemoglobin (6.2 gm/dl). She was managed by cystoscopy and clots evacuation followed by two units of blood transfusion. On cystoscopy， a growth of 2 cm x2 cm in size was noted at the anterior bladder wall that was bleeding profusely.\n\n【9】A decision was taken to fulgurate and bipolar Transurethral Resection of Bladder Tumor(TURBT) in the same sitting under spinal anesthesia. The procedure was uneventful. On 2nd postoperative day， severe fetal distress was noted， the cause of which was unknown. A decision of Lower Section Cesarean Section (LSCS) was taken by a treating obstetrician and was performed.\n\n【10】The postoperative periods were uneventful， with mother and baby both being healthy and recovering. The patient and the baby were discharged on postoperative day 8.\n\n【11】The TURBT tissue specimen sent for histopathological evaluation revealed transitional cell carcinoma of the urinary bladder of TaG 1 grade. Follow-up cystoscopy on 3r-month follow-up was unremarkable.己\n\n【12】Discussion\n\n【13】In men， bladder carcinoma is one of the most common malignancies，but its occurrence in women is quiet less， with a male to female ratio of 3-4：1. It usually presents in the 6h and 74 decades of life. In young pregnant women， chances of the bladder carcinoma are very low. Pregnancy and malignancy are among the biological conditions in which antigen tissue is tolerated by a competent immune system .\n\n【14】The majority of these cases usually present in the second or third trimester with painless hematuria. Hematuria presenting during pregnancy always warrants prompt evaluation， keeping bladder cancer as a differential diagnosis in mind. Diagnosis of bladder carcinoma during pregnancy can pose a dilemma， as symptoms are often misleading， i.e. frequency and nocturia are usually mistaken as they can arise throughout pregnancy in healthy females too， thus delaying the diagnosis . It is further complicated as for the patient， identification of the source of bleeding is often difficult and is frequently mistaken for obstetric hemorrhage or more common benign lesions such as cystitis. Although cystitis is the commonest cause of hematuria during pregnancy ， complete work-up is needed if a response to treatment is not satisfactory but firstly， painless vaginal bleeding due to placenta previa must be excluded since this needs prompt obstetrical intervention. Although bladder carcinoma is quite rare in pregnant women， gross hematuria should be managed with a high index of suspicion to rule out the possibility and timely management of bladder malignancy. Flexible cystoscopy is considered safe and the most useful test in the evaluation ofhematuria pregnancy. Transurethral IResection of the Bladder Tumor(TURBT) under regional or general anesthesia is considered safe to perform irrespective of the gestational period . If the malignant potential of the tumor is high， then termination of pregnancy is considered during the early gestational period for maternal survival， followed by management of malignancy. There are only 27 cases reported of bladder mass with pregnancy out of which eight cases were managed with TURBT during the intrapartum period followed by an uneventful continuation of pregnancy till term or near term， thus ensuing fetal well-being simultaneously.\n\n【15】In this case， as the patient was having profuse bleeding from bladder growth， so we decided to go for fulguration and TURBT.\n\n【16】Unfortunately， the fetal distress of unknown cause resulted in emergencyLSCS. The current casehighlights the successfulprocedural outcome of TURBT for the mother but the risk remains for the fetus although TURBT is considered safe generally. In our case， though we couldn't ascertain the exact cause of fetal distress， still the procedure can be considered as one of the culprits. The authors want to shed light on the TURBT in pregnancy as a not-so-safe procedure but it remains a choice to perform in a patient with persistent hematuria where conservative treatment fails to continue pregnancy till term. Close and proper monitoring of both the maternaland fetal conditions remains crucial during the postoperative follow-up period.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 11:41:18", "endTime": "2024/09/24 11:41:28", "cost": 9.523}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:32", "update_time": "2024-09-23 19:41:27", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 19:41:18"}

From her medical history， we highlight a syndrome of generalized congenital lipodystrophy (Berardinelli-Seip syndrome). This consists of an absence of adipose tissue alongside an alteration in the metabolism of fats and carbohydrates . The patient presented a long time， velvety pigmentation on the neck and armpits that had been classified as acanthosis nigricans related to her genetic disease . However， on her annual clinical assessment， she complained about the appearance of new asymptomatic， hyperpigmented， confluent skin lesions with reticulated edges. It develops progressively in a couple of months， starting with the pectoral region and upper back . No response to any topical depigmentation was observed.\n\n【2】Wood's light examination and direct Potassium Hydroxide (KOH) examination were negative. A biopsy of the cervical region was performed， which revealed epidermal papillomatosis with orthokeratosishyperkeratosiswithout acantholysis， associated withbasal melaninhyperpigmentation. After a treatment with topical retinoids and oral Josamycin 500 mg/24 h for 3 months， the lesions showed an evident improvement.\n\n【3】Diagnosis\n\n【4】Confluent and Reticulated Papillomatosis (CRP)\n\n【5】CRP is a not very well-known dermatosis that usually begins in adolescence. It is more frequent in women and in dark-skinned patients， as in our case. Some theories have been proposed to explain its etiopathogenesis： Genetic or acquired keratinization abnormalities， photosensitivity or underlying endocrine disorders such as obesity， diabetes or thyroid dysfunction. These ones would cause an abnormal-epithelialization related to the excess of certain hormones . In our patient， due to the genetic lipodystrophy syndrome， we are led to consider the possible relationship with endocrine disorders.\n\n【6】In order to make a diagnosis， Lee et al.  defined three main criteria needed， which include：Hyperpigmented plaques in the centre of the chest or back with a reticulated pattern on the edge. Negativity for fungi in the KOH stain or the absence of hypha in the biopsy. Histology showing papillomatosis， hyperkeratosis and acanthosis with hypogranulosis.\n\n【7】As a topical treatment， good results have been observed with selenium sulphide， vitamin D derivatives and topical retinoids . Oral isotretinoin at doses of 1 mg/kg/day to 2 mg/kg/day has also been used with favorable responses . Oral doxycycline presents a sccess rate of over70% at doses of 100 mg/day and lead， as in our patient， to rapid resolution of the lesions in 1 or 2months . It is believed that its antiproliferative and anti-inflammatory action could play an important role.\n\n【8】Acanthosis Nigrans (AN)： It is one of the main differential diagnoses， with a similar histology， but different clinical features. In AN， the lesions are thicker with a velvety hyperpigmentation and are mainly located on the flexures  . The onset- aged is earlier and it is more frequently related to endocrine disorders. On rare occasions， as in our case， both entities can coexist.\n\n【9】Pitriasis Versicolor： It is a superficial fungal infection caused by Malassezia yeasts.

There are limited studies that explore health professionals'views on screening or perceived barriers to the screening process.\n\n【9】Methods\n\n【10】The studies conducted for this thesis were approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee(HREC) of the University of Sydney approval number， 15315. Interviews were completed in a focus group format or face-to-face. Interview questions were analyzed using thematic analysis and were verified by a second person. Thematic analysis was undertaken by identifying concepts or experiences and then combining and cataloguing the related patterns into sub-themes . This process was performed by three researchers who then discussed common themes and a consensus in themes and subthemes was reached. Thematic analysis was used . The style of Qualitative Analysis employed resembled that described by Burnard  and more recently termed editing analyses by Polit and Beck . As the researchers conducted the interviews， they kept field notes that were used to contextualize the data and contributed to the commencement of data analysis.\n\n【11】Results\n\n【12】Group 1： Booking-in midwives\n\n【13】The midwife includes the psychosocial assessment as part of her usual antenatal clinical interview. Her role is to assess all women at booking-in for psychosocial risk factors and offer referral as needed. The booking-in visit is conducted in a private room with the woman， her partner and midwife present. The partner could be asked by the midwife to leave the room to ensure privacy.\n\n【14】Only those midwives who had attended the Perinatal Mental Health Assessment (Introductory Training) could participate in the study， enroll women to the study， gain their consent and conduct the screening using the Clinical Care Guideline package. During the booking-in visit， women who had consented to be part of the study were asked a series of psychological questions and also given an Edinburgh Perinatal Depression Scale to complete .\n\n【15】It is generally accepted that， in an English-speaking population， an EPDS score of 10-12 suggests the respondent may meet criteria for minor depression； a score 13-18 suggests she would probably meet criteria for depressive illness： 19-30 indicates a higher degree of distress and complexity， possibly including depressive illness， but also including other factors， such as a positive score on question 10(self-harm). Women are offered follow-up according to established referral pathways.\n\n【16】Group 2： Obstetricians and other health professionals\n\n【17】Health professionals (obstetricians， midwives， general practitioners， social workers， psychologists， early childhood nurses) involved in delivering care to study participants as above were asked to contribute their views on the effectiveness/suitability of the clinical care guideline package following implementation， using semi-structured interviews.\n\n【18】Midwives and obstetricians were then interviewed in focus groups or individually to ascertain the appropriateness of the psychosocial screening questions， as well as any concerns， suggestions and other issiles.\n\n【19】Group 3： Private hospital midwives\n\n【20】Interviews were commenced with midwives working at other private hospitals (in addition to the primary study site) to ascertain their views on the effectiveness/suitability of antenatal psychosocial questioning. Early detection and appropriate referral are the main aims of data collection， with a view to establishing Commercial-in-Confidenceevidence for implementing routine， universalscreening in this setting. Midwives at each facility (as well as those at the study site) were invited to share their experiences of the antenatal psychosocial and depression screening of women through voluntary participation in semi-structured qualitative interviews .\n\n【21】Them es\n\n【22】Benefits of psychosocial screening\n\n【23】We need to know： A dominant theme among all midwives consenting to interview was related to the benefits of screening women for psychosocial issues. The midwives indicated that this type of information was not only helpful but necessary for them to give the best possible care to women.\n\n【24】Midwives spoke of the “need to know” to be able to provide a comprehensive service and holistic care to women. They felt the experience of questioning women offered the opportunity to ask questions， to debrief and provide tailored care.\n\n【25】For example， midwives spoke of answers to the psychosocial questions giving them a “heads up”(M1) or\"flags going up\"(M2) or“opening things up”for further discussion.\n\n【26】Midwives comments； “We get the heads up that there are issues”“It is invaluable”. We can put supports in place for women， it opens things up\". It allows us to look for issues and explore them with the women\"(midwife 1).\n\n【27】Yes， apart from looking after the body， we are looking after the spirit and mind as well. These women are not stupid： mostly career women (midwife 2). Yes，\"If you don’t ask， you won’t know\"(midwife3).\n\n【28】Consistency： Another major sub-theme within the benefits of screening concerned the consistency of approach in asking the questions. For example， “We can display empathy for the women if we are aware of their issues\". The benefit of a consistent approach rather than self-selecting who to interview was evident， “Women are consistently asked the questions， all on the same page. It gives them the opportunity to disclose\"(midwife 5).\n\n【29】“It is less threatening if it is standardized\n\n【30】“It helps us tailor the care to meet their needs”\n\n【31】Risks of not screening： Midwives were asked directly about the benefits and risks of not screening. Midwives indicated that the benefits outweighed the risks. For example： Yes， “There are no risks， only benefits， if we don’t ask and they have a history of self harmits our duty\". (Midwife 1) and， “No benefits in NOT asking them. If we don’t we miss someone at risk\" (midwife 3). Although there was an expressed sensitivity around asking the screening questions，“However， they may be uncomfortable being asked these questions\".“If we don’t ask， we won’t know， for example-DV. We can plead ignorance if we don’t ask， as we are not aware\" (midwife 4) “I’m in two minds， as some women want to disclose and others dont. I think that they should given a choice/elect to answer the questions\".“The risk of not asking them is that they will get no help， may have prolonged PND or suicide\"(midwife 5).\n\n【32】Barriers to screening\n\n【33】No training/experience in how to screen： Midwives identified a lack of training and experience in how to screen women. Only one of the three sites had received any training in psychosocial screening. For example， “Staff feeling uncomfortable and being inexperienced. There is no antenatal clinic. No staff with mental health training. An antenatal clinic would allow rapport building. Also， the husbands are present”(Midwife 3). Some midwives noted that they needed to screen regardless of their lack of training and therefore relied on experience or a “gut feeling. “We have to rely on our experience to detect issues”.“But some of the midwives don't have the experience to do this”.\n\n【34】“I think that the postnatal midwives needtraining， they administer an EPDS but often don't know how to score it or what is considered high risk and when to refer\".\n\n【35】The husband： Some midwives highlighted the issue of the husband being present. Some husbands stayed in the room to interpret for the woman or were not asked to leave by the midwife.“The problem is that often the husbands come and we don't ask them to leave， that’s the way we have always done it； the booking in. “We have a lot of women from India who come with their husbands， often the husbands fill out the EPDS for their wives or with them， and we rely on them to interpret for the women\". There was a concern expressed by midwives that they often could not speak to the women on their own as the husbands refused to leave when the woman was being interviewed.\n\n| Table 1： Themes.  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Theme  | Subtheme  | Quotes  |\n| Benefits of psychosocial screening  | We need to know  | \"We would know where they are at， so that we can help them\".

For example， “The obstetricians， they are often defensive\"， “the obstetricians， they have a sense of ownership of the women\". There was also a concern that when the midwife did in fact high light a woman’s psychosocial issues to the obstetrician that it was not taken seriously.“Sometimes they fob vou off when you identify an issue and alert them- the obstetricians\"，“We are often left in the dark about a woman’s problems\"， “We rely on the obstetricians to document but they often write nothing.\n\n【38】Other themes\n\n【39】They lie/fear： There was a reported concern by midwives that women were not honest with the results of questioning. For example， However， some women lie， they will talk if they want help，“The women can lie and not admit that they have problems”(midwife1). Woman may also fear any potential consequences of disclosing issues，“Some women don’t want to know about community services as there is a fear attached，i.e.，DOCS (FACS)”，“They hide their issues， some come here to hide from DOCS， they come under a false name and don’t want to go to the public system because of DOCS”. This is referring to FACS-Family and community services who have to capacity to remove the baby from the mother).\n\n【40】They don’t want to disclose- the women， they are high powered38 to 40 year old women that often run big businesses/are high flyers and are used to being in control\".\n\n【41】Midwife barriers： Some midwives expressed concern about the psychosocial questions. “Some questions are a bit odd： that is awkward'(Midwife 2). There was also concern about discomfort in asking the questions or receiving uncomfortable answers， difficult responses include： mother passed away； patient estranged from family； half a dozen said abused as a child； someone with trauma in first delivery so has come to private hospital this time； infertility； lack of support. Interestingly some midwives indicated that they could either determine which women warranted asking the psychosocial questions， or that women should indicate that they wanted to be screened. “I don’t think that we should screen all women， the odd one may say that they wanted to be asked the questions”.\n\n【42】A social worker expressed concerns with the booking-in process at a hospital.“Certain midwives are more receptive to assisting women than others. Most women here dont seem to disclose at booking in. I get the majority of referrals postnatally when they stay for 3-4 days and a more attuned midwife picks up that there might be a problem. Things need to change here”(SW). The answer-“Change the booking in midwife and educate the midwives.\n\n【43】Lack of awareness： Another sub-theme indicated a concern that women were neither attuned to the psychosocial questions nor understood their relevance， “They are often unaware of the connection between their past history and their present status/effect\".\n\n【44】Language can be a barrier， e.g.， some Asian women： a few women are very business-like (midwife 2).\n\n【45】Lack of time： Time was seen as an additional pressure in psychosocial screening. “It takes a long time to screen the women”(midwife 1). “They book in online” “The pressure on staff， time”(midwife 5).\n\n【46】Enough supports\n\n【47】A subtheme emerged around a lack of resources and supports for women once positively screened. “We don’t have a social worker； we don’t have enough supports for the women\". When asked whether there was enough support for women one midwife replied，“Sometimes you need to call the obstetrician several times before something is done to help the women， but you just need to keep onto them， the obstetricians.\n\n【48】General comments\n\n【49】“The psychiatrist may retire soon and I don’t know if she will be replaced”(midwife 4).\n\n【50】We only have 1 useless psychiatrist and 1 social worker； they help a bit at least(midwife 3).\n\n【51】\"We need better follow-up”\n\n【52】“We can’t refer； we just let the obstetrician know”\n\n【53】“We do follow-up with the child and family health nurse and flag women if we are concerned”\n\n【54】Further suggestions about the psychosocial screening process/procedure?\n\n【55】As mentioned by the NUM， it would be good to talk to the women more postnatally， including debriefing (midwife 2).\n\n【56】“Ongoing support/training so that staff can repeat the EPDS\". We need an update(midwife 3).\n\n【57】“More access to public health services would be helpful”(midwife4).\n\n【58】“Sometimes the fathers look depressed； I suppose we could also give them an EPDS?”\n\n【59】“I think that we could re-administer the EPDS during antenatal classes at 32/40 approx， as often concerns come up in the classes. These concerns may not have been there at 12-20 weeks when we book them in”.\n\n【60】“Our midwives are older here and attuned to women's needs due to their life experience， they have been there， done that， had their families”However， the postnatal midwives would not know how to score； use or flag an EPDS score so need training”.\n\n【61】“If we are concerned postnatally we often ask the husband what the woman is normally like”\n\n【62】“We need a social worker， just for this unit\n\n【63】“We need a community link for the women”\n\n【64】“We need to be clear of the referral pathways to help a woman， instead of feeling lost\".\n\n【65】“The antenatal classes may be an opportunity to educate the women about psychosocial issues， however， we have such a poor attendance at these classes， as women view them as only for a woman wanting/booking in for a natural birth， not a C/S. Midwives in the obstetricians’ rooms could screen/support the women also. The women need to book in earlier and if they are identified as at risk we could see them again\"(Midwife 3).\n\n【66】Discussion\n\n【67】At the time of the study， only one other private hospital in Sydney was screening women and their midwives were trained in psychosocial assessment. There were mixed views on psychosocial screening and barriers to screening were identified. Benefits were also identified：early identification of problems， standardization and patient-focused care. However， midwives also expressed concerns： suicide ideation， intrusiveness of questions， “some women lie\"， not wanting to screen all women， lack of support systems， cultural barriers， and inaccurate answers， power barriers with obstetricians， husband interference， fear and powerlessness. Relevant suggestions were made： appropriate and adequate education， training and support of midwives； flagging high risk women； more in-house resources and external resources community links， and employing a central midwife with interest and expertise in psychosocial assessment and screening. Midwives had various views on the program. Some felt that it was within their work role， others did not. Some were fearful of what could be revealed by the woman and how to deal with it. There was an identified concern that obstetricians did not take seriously any concerns highlighted by the midwife about a woman's psychosocial difficulties. There was a sense of a lack of ownership’of the women， therefore a feeling of helplessness in addressing their needs. Some midwives indicated an interest in a woman's perinatal mental health/psychosocial risk factors；however others expressed a concern that this was not part of their role. This highlights the need to educate and support midwives working in the private sector on their important role in enhancing the perinatal mental health of women in their care. Their role includes potential for prevention， early intervention and health promotion to benefit not only the woman but her child， partner and family.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 10:17:48", "endTime": "2024/09/24 10:18:17", "cost": 28.96}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:32", "update_time": "2024-09-23 18:18:16", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 18:17:47"}

It is commonly used to lower the risk of stroke and systemic embolism in non-valvular atrial fibrillation and for the treatment of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism . In addition， it has recently been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) after the COMPASS trial， which showed a 24% risk reduction of maior cardiovascular events in patients with chronic coronary artery disease and peripheral artery disease . The most common adverse effect of Rivaroxaban is related to the increased risk of bleeding. We are reporting the sixth case of spontaneous splenic rupture caused by Rivaroxaban. Written permission to publish this case was obtained from the patient.\n\n【2】Case Presentation\n\n【3】A 66-year-old gentleman with a background of hypertension and chronic atrial fibrillation， treated with Enalapril 20 mg (two times daily)， Bisoprolol 5 mg (once a day) and Rivaroxaban 20mg (once a day)， was admitted to the Emergency Department with abdominal pain， nausea， and vomiting. He was a smoker but denied any alcohol intake.\n\n【4】On examination， he was tachycardic (115 bpm)， hypotensive (BP 70/50 mmHg)，had abdominal distention with tenderness in the epigastrium and left hypochondrium. Fluid resuscitation was commenced with crystalloids，and a Noradrenaline infusion was started via a PICCline (Peripherally Inserted Central Venous Catheter). Initial blood tests revealed Hemoglobin (Hb) of 11 g/dL with a normal platelet count (150.000/pL)， and a coagulopathy [Prothrombin Time (PT) 43%， INR 1.93， activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT) 50 sec and fibrinogen 1.43 g/dL)]. Arterial blood gas sampling confirmed metabolic acidosis (pH 7.22， PO， 93 mmHg and PCO， 35 mmHg) and a Computed Tomography (CT) of the abdomen/pelvis with intravenous contrast was undertaken， revealing a splenic rupture with a moderate hemoperitoneum . The patient re-affirmed there was no trauma prior to the onset of abdominal pain. A repeat full blood count was performed and confirmed a significant decrease in Hb(5.7 g/dL) and hematocrit (17.6%). Two units of Red Blood Cells (RBC) were transfused immediately， and the patient transferred to the operating room for emergency laparotomy and splenectomy.\n\n【5】An arterialline inserted prior to induction revealed severe hypotension (50/20mmHg) requiring administration of small boluses of intravenous Adrenaline (5 ug +5 ug). General anesthesia was initiated with a rapid sequence induction (Etomidate 18 mg， Fentanyl 150 ug， Rocuronium 80 mg). Intubation was uneventful， and anesthesia was maintained with Sevoflurane and Remifentanil. A percutaneous sheath introducer with a 8.5 French was inserted under US guidance into the right internal jugular vein to facilitate rapid administration of blood products. Four units of RBC and three units of Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP) in addition to 500 mL of colloids and 500 mL of crystalloids were required during surgery aiming to stabilize the patient and reverse the coagulopathy. A total splenectomy was performed， and after safe extubation in the operating room， was transferred to the intensive care unit. His postoperative course was uneventful and successfully discharged home seven days later.\n\n【6】Discussion\n\n【7】Rivaroxaban has a rapid onset of action with a relatively predictable pharmacokinetic profile and a relatively short plasma half-life making initiation， maintenance， and discontinuation of anticoagulant therapy considerably more comfortable than with traditional oral anticoagulants. It is highly protein-bound (92% to 95%) with renal excretion at 36%， and in contrast to other new anticoagulants as Dabigatran， dialysis is not effective for its removal.\n\n【8】Table 1： Management of bleeding secondary to Rivaroxaban.\n\n【9】Rivaroxaban Moderate bleeding： action Severe bleeding： action\n\n|  | Fluid replacement. Give blood cells if Hb<8 mg/dL Give platelets (if <70.000/pL or if patient is taking an antiplatelet drug) Tranexamic acid iv (15-30 mg/kg) +/- continuaus infusion (1 mg/kg/h) Consider Prothrombin complex 50 lUikg， repeat if necessary  | Add recombinant factor Vlla (Novoseven@-100 pg/kgby lV bolus)； repeat if necessary2 Give Andexanet alfa if available3 ·Bolus 800 mg at 30 mg/minute. ·Within 2 minutes following the bolus dose， administer the continuous iv infusion 8 mg/min for up to 120minutes.  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n\n【11】Half dose could be an option if there is no a life-threatening bleeding scenario\n\n【12】In 2019 the update of the AHA/ACC/HRS in the guidelines for the management of patients with atrial fibrillation， Rivaroxaban is now recommended over warfarin for stroke prevention . There is， at present， no consensus on the best methodology for assessing Rivaroxaban activity in vivo and hence no guiding dosage. Unlike traditional oral anticoagulants， traditional coagulation tests cannot be used to assess or adjust dosing. At therapeutic concentrations， Rivaroxaban has a relatively weak influence on the PT；however， it is more profound at higher concentrations， with a good correlation between prolongation of the PT and plasma concentration.\n\n【13】Although hemorrhage iiss the significant adverse effect of Rivaroxaban， unfortunately， there is no immediate reversal agent currently available. Although Andexanet alfa has been approved by the FDA， for reversal of anticoagulation in life-threatening or uncontrolled bleeding in patients treated with Rivaroxaban， it is not available in many countries. Therefore， other measures should be taken to treat significant hemorrhage .\n\n【14】Conclusion\n\n【15】Rivaroxaban's datasheet details no reference to spontaneous splenic rupture due to its use； however， this is the sixth case report of spontaneous splenic rupture in a patient， with no history of trauma， treated with Rivaroxaban.\n\n【16】A pharmacologic interaction could be the potential cause of an increase in activity ofRivaroxaban resulting in major hemorrhage. An interaction between amlodipine and telmisartan/hydrochlorothiazide was reported as a cause of hemorrhage in a previous case report . An interaction between amiodarone， a P-glycoprotein inhibitor and Rivaroxaban has also been reported as a cause of spontaneous splenic rupture.\n\n【17】It’s well known that the higher risk of bleeding exists when Rivaroxaban is used in combination with antiplatelet agents， particularly in the elderly or in the presence of renal dysfunction. Specifically， of the case reports described previously one had aspirin as a potential cause and another reported renal dysfunction as the potential cause . Similar to the case we are reporting， another could not ascertain a potential cause . We believe there are significant numbers for the pharmaceutical manufacturer to mention splenic rupture in the datasheet and doctors need to be made more aware of this severe complication of patients prescribed Rivaroxaban .", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 10:18:55", "endTime": "2024/09/24 10:19:03", "cost": 8.26}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:32", "update_time": "2024-09-23 18:19:03", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 18:18:55"}

India’s first peak was in September2020 and then the number decreased. However， India started vaccine diplomacy but did not arrange sufficient vaccine doses for their people. Lack of social distancing， no use of mask， attending social program fuelled the COVID-19 infection. India got one year to improve the health sector but in reality， all are in a dream now. Lack of oxygen support， vaccines， and capacity in hospital beds are now the bottlenecks to tackle the second wave of COVID-19 India.\n\n【2】Keywords： COVID-19；India； Second wave； Vaccine； First Wave； Economy\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】The biggest threat in humankind is now COVID-19， which is of Zoonotic origin and spreads through aerosol transmission of respiratory droplets. It started from the seafood market in Wuhan， Hubei， China back in December 2019，and within 2 months， it spread worldwide and WHO declared it as pandemic . Most common symptoms include dry cough， fever， difficulty of breathing， and tiredness or fatigue . It is estimated that transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is occurring mainly by airborne . To tackle the issues， several countries went into a lockdown scheme. During this national lockdown， restrictions were imposed on most of the movement， home confinement was mandatory， and exceptions were given only for essential food shopping . Physical distance， use of mask， hand sanitization， respiratory hygiene， prompt self-isolating， and prompt testing are the so-far worldwide COVID-19 prevention techniques. A recent survey of WHO reveals that globally90% of countries are still struggling to come back to their pre-COVID-19 condition in terms of health services.\n\n【5】Now， the world is experiencing a second wave of COVID-19 infection . Often the second wave from infectious diseases occurs after a relative decrease in the number of patients with the disease. The second wave may increase among specific age groups or populations， or in particular areas of each country and become as widespread as the first wave. The first wave of a pandemic is followed some months later by a second or third wave of infection. This can be severe as experienced previously in the influenza pandemics of 1918 (H1H1)， 1957 (H2H2)， 1968 (H3N2)， and 2009(H1N1) . It may be a question that why there is always a second wave. Probably the answer is， most often， infected people in one region do not develop herd immunity and they are re-exposed again to the infection from people who got infected from the first wave . After the COVID-19last year， WHO including all research articles， scientists， and researchers， expected that there could be a second wave from COVID-19. The threat arriving from the COVID-19 second wave was already assumed and reported by researchers .\n\n【6】Some countries， like South Korea and Singapore， got success to flatten the virus spreading by employing comprehensive testing and tracing regimes. Furthermore， UK， France， Italy， Spain managed to flatten the wave by imposing lockdowns. On June 22nd， 2020，South Korea announced the second wave although the number was low . In this country so far death count was 301 (as of July31，2020).South Korea has conducted 1，295，962 tests since January 3m， 2020， to detect the illness. On January 23，COVID-19 officially hit Vietnam and by the 8th of September 2020，Vietnam had a second wave . The first wave commenced in Spain， from mid-March 2020 and continued for 3 months and again the second wave started in mid-September 2020 which stayed until 2020Christmas . Sweden's COVID-19 cases peaked during the first wave with 102 reported deaths(7-day rolling average) on April.On December 20h， 2020， COVID-19 deaths in Sweden had reached more than 8，000 . The second wave from COVID-19 was theoretically studied for Iran， where model validation and the prediction were performed using data from January 22nd to June 25h， 2020. It was predicted that the second wave would be more severe than the first wave. The most effective way to the improvement of weakly immune people is to employ appropriate medical facilities . Modeling studies in the UK suggested that the test-trace-isolate program could reduce the chances of the second wave in the UK， as there is a chance to reopen the school from September. The absence of sufficiently broad test-trace-isolate coverage and reopening of schools can result in reproductive number over 1 and would peak up cases in December 2020， which will be 2 times to 3times the size of the original COVID-19wave . This has happened in reality and the UK again started lockdown and strict restrictions.\n\n【7】Last year one study revealed that India could face a deadly second wave and in present-day India is facing this enormous life-taking wave. Currently， India is facing another wave， or better to say the second wave， and much more in world discussion. In this work， how Indian is dealing with the second wave of COVID-19 and vaccination and other associated issues are discussed.\n\n【8】First Wave in India\n\n【9】India is the 2nd most populated country in the world after China， and a center of attraction because of its diverse variation. India has 28 states and 8 Union Territories. Its population is more than 1.35 billion， of which 2.75 million are below the poverty line. A significant variation is present in India where the smallest state Sikkim has a population closer to Bhutan and the largest one Uttar Pradesh has a population similar to Brazil. Goa which has the highest GDP per capita can be comparable to Jordan while the poorest state Bihar is similar to that of Haiti . Thus， state-wide variation is not surprising. The health care system in India is also a mixture of public and private health care systems， available in rural and urban locations. The government unfortunately spends only 1.17% of its GDP on health care . The overall capacity of private health care is4 times that of the public sector.\n\n【10】January 30h， 2020， was the day when the first case of COVID-19was detected in the southern state of India. Within few weeks， COVID-19 spread throughout the country and reached the count of100 by March and close of 1，600 by end of March. Consequently， the first death from this disease also happened in March. To tackle the spread Indian PM announced a nationwide lockdown without any heads up to the citizen. Initially， the lockdown was until April 14h，2020， which later was extended to May 03， 2020，and then June 012020 . To understand how the lockdown worked in India， the stringency index was performed which showed that at the starting of lockdown the stringency index was 100 whereas， in other countries which also faced serious lockdown， the in dex was not satisfactory and appeared low. On April 12h， 2020， Italy scored a stringency index of93.5， while Belgium and Peru counted 81.48 on March 22n， 2020，and96.30 on May. However， India's score fell to near 82 in May2020， which evidently indicates that lockdown which was followed according to the governmental rules at the beginning， did not at the end.\n\n【11】As shown in Figure 1， it is apparent that this lockdown did not help India to stop the spread and India experienced its peak in September 2020. Back in September 2020， India faced 90，000 cases every day including 1，200 deaths. Lockdown had limited success and it drastically impacted the Indian GDP， which fell 23.9% than that of the same quarter in 2019. Sharp unemployment was prominent because of the lack of jobs. Industrial Production (IIP) fell by 36%during the 3 months between April and June of 2020 compared to the previous year . Indian government behavior towards migrant workers was negligent which the world experienced last year. Unnecessary death， due to the impact of COVID-19 lockdown which was not directly related to the COVID-19 occurred， was nearly600 by late May 2020 . The death of 23 individuals from March12h to April 11h， 2020， was recorded due to suicide. Fear of isolation or domestic violence was the reason behind these tragic incidents. This noticeably indicates that not only economic issues， social health， and mental issues were also key aspects due to the prolonged lockdown period.\n\n【12】The air quality of India is always in bad shape which got an immensely positive impact due to last year’s COVID-19 lockdown. In India， mainly major urban places and cities have poor air quality. Because of the lockdown transport， industries were closed which limited the emission ofharmful gases. Compared with the immediate Pre-Lockdown period (PL3)， the average PM2.5 and PM10 reduced by up to 51% and 47% respectively during the lockdown periods .\n\n【13】Second Wave in India\n\n【14】In mid-September， India had a peak of 93，000 cases per day， which started declining， and the Indian government， policymakers， media； politicians thought In dia is free from COVID-19. Restrictions were less and elections campaigns for five states were announced for186 million people to cast their vote. In January 2021 Indian started its vaccine diplomacy by shipping vaccines to foreign countries. Interestingly last year， a research study from MIT suggested that without proper treatment or vaccination， India can surge up to0.287 million cases by early 2021. India reported more than 100，000new cases on April 04h， 2021，and a new record for the country was observed， a level not seen in its first wave. On April 15h， 2021， new COVID-19 infected cases were 0.2 million in India. On May 4h， COVID-19 cases were more than 20.2 million. The western state of Maharashtra， which has been India’s COVID ground zero from the start of the pandemic， is back at the top after briefly reporting a drop in cases. This state， among India， the richest and home to its financial hub， Mumbai， confirmed more than 66，000 cases last night. It is widely agreed among experts that both cases and deaths are being under-reported in India right now. The Lancet COVID-19commission warned that India could experience recording more than2，300 deaths every day by the first week of June.\n\n【15】To understand the COVID-19 cases two factors can be considered： (a) Test Positivity Rate (TPR=total infection/total cases)；(b) Case Fatality Rate (CFR= total deaths/total infections). The Test positivity rate shows whether testing is enough to limit the virus spread by employing quarantine and isolation. According to WHO， TPR below 5% is good which indicates the health care program is working sufficiently. India had over 5% TPR during the first wave and started declining from August 2020. On April 14， 2021，TPR was of May 10h total vaccination in India is listed in Table 7.\n\n【16】Table 1： State-wise TPR and CFR in India on April 15m， 2021.\n\n| State  | CFR  | TPR  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Maharashtra  | 1.6  | 15.7  |\n| Nagaland  | 0.7  | 8.9  |\n| Kerala  | 0.4  | 8.5  |\n| Chhattisgarh  | 1.1  | 7.6  |\n| West Bengal  | 1.7  | 6.5  |\n| Andhra Pradesh  | 0.8  | 6  |\n| Madhya Pradesh  | 1.2  | 5.3  |\n| Tripura  | 1.2  | 5.1  |\n| Rajasthan  | 0.8  | 5.1  |\n\n【18】5.4%. State-wise TPR also varied. Maharashtra had a very high TPR of15.7% indicating very high transmission. State-wise transmission on April 15h， 2021 is listed in Table 1. As of 11th May India has tested more than 305 M samples. Tests include both， RT-PCR and Rapid Antigen. India’s current test positivity rate (7DMA) is 22%. Table 2shows the current TPR test no in India.\n\n【19】Vaccination and variant\n\n【20】Mass vaccination program to tackle COVID-19 was started in Table 2： TPR and total test no in India accarding WHO fram March to September 2021.\n\n| Date  | Tested  | TPR  | Test  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 21 September  | 540  | 2.10%  | RTPCR and Rapid Antigen  |\n| 15\" September  | 530  | 2.07%  | RTPCR and Rapid Antigen  |\n| 81h September  | 519  | 2.55%  | RTPCR and Rapid Antigen  |\n| 31m1 August  | 501  | 2.50%  | RTPCR and Rapid Antigen  |\n| 24mAugust  | 496  | 1.90%  | RTPCR and Rapid Antigen  |\n| 171hAugust  | 484  | 2%  | RTPCR and Rapid Antigen  |\n| 10mAugust  | 471  | 2.40%  | RTPCR and Rapid Antigen  |\n| 3d August  | 460  | 2.40%  | RTPCR and Rapid Antigen  |\n| 27hJuly  | 448  | 2.40%  | RTPCR and Rapid Antigen  |\n| 20hJuly  | 436  | 2%  | RTPCR and Rapid Antigen  |\n| 13mhJuly  | 423  | 2.30%  | RTPCR and Rapid Antigen  |\n| 61July  | 411  | 2.40%  | RTPCR and Rapid Antigen  |\n| 291h June  | 398  | 2.75%  | RTPCR and Rapid Antigen  |\n| 22d June  | 386  | 3.25%  | RTPCR and Rapid Antigen  |\n| 151h June  | 373  | 4.38%  | RTPCR and Rapid Antigen  |\n| 8hJune  | 360  | 5.93%  | RTPCR and Rapid Antigen  |\n| 151 June  | 346  | 8.60%  | RTPCR and Rapid Antigen  |\n| 25mMay  | 332  | 12%  | RTPCR and Rapid Antigen  |\n| 18 May  | 318  | 17.60%  | RTPCR and Rapid Antigen  |\n| 11\"May  | 305  | 22%  | RTPCR and Rapid Antigen  |\n| 4th May  | 293  | 21.60%  | RTPCR and Rapid Antigen  |\n| 27hApril  | 280  | 20%.  | RTPCR and Rapid Antigen  |\n| 20mApril  | 269  | 16%  | RTPCR and Rapid Antigen  |\n| 121h April  | 257  | 10.70%  | RTPCR and Rapid Antigen  |\n| 5th April  | 249  | 7%  | RTPCR and Rapid Antigen  |\n| 29h March  | 241 million  | 5.33%  | RTPCR and Rapid Antigen  |\n| 21s1 March  | 233 million  | 3.80%  | RTPCR and Rapid Antigen  |\n| 15th March  | 703，772  | 2.87%  | RTPCR and Rapid Antigen  |\n\n【22】Table 3： List of vaccines with their efficacy .\n\n| Vaccines Name  | Country of origin  | Efficacy  | How they work  | Reference  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Pfizer /BioNTech (BNT162b2m-RNA)  | United States and Germany  | 95%  | Genetic code teaches immune system how to make part of virusthat triggers immune response  |   |\n| Moderna-US National Institutes of Health(mRNA-1273)  | United States  | 95%  | Genetic code teaches immune system how to make part of virusthat triggers immune response  | |\n| Sputnik V (Gamaleya Gam Covid Vac)  | Russia  | 91%  |  | |\n| AstraZeneca-Oxford (ChAdOx1 nCov-19)  | UK and Sweden  | 70%  | Modified virus tells body how to make part of the virus that triggers immune response  |   |\n| Johnson and Johnson (Ad26.COV2.S)  |  | 72%  | Madified virus tells body how to make part of the virus that triggersimmune response  |  |\n\n【24】Table 4： Details of two vaccines .\n\n| Vaccine name  | Covishield@  | Covaxin@  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Manufacturer  | AstraZeneca's vaccine manufactured by Serum Institute of India  | manufactured by Bharat Biotech Limited  |\n| Composition  | inactivated adenovirus with segments of Coronavirus， Aluminium Hydroxide Gel， L-Histidine，L-Histidine Hydrochlaride Monahydrate， Magnesium Chloride Hexahydrate， Polysorbate 80，Ethanol， Sucrose， Sadium Chlaride， and Disodium Edetate Dihydrate (EDTA)  | Inactivated Coronavirus， Aluminum Hydroxide Gel， TLR 7/8 Agonist， 2-Phenoxyethanol， and  |\n| Composition  | inactivated adenovirus with segments of Coronavirus， Aluminium Hydroxide Gel， L-Histidine，L-Histidine Hydrochlaride Monahydrate， Magnesium Chloride Hexahydrate， Polysorbate 80，Ethanol， Sucrose， Sadium Chlaride， and Disodium Edetate Dihydrate (EDTA)  | Phosphate Buffered Saline NKA1.  |\n| Temperature fortransport and storing  | +20℃ to +8℃  | +20C to+8℃  |\n| Time between twovaccine dose  | Four to six weeks or four to eight weeks  | Four to six weeks  |\n\n【26】December 2020 after one year of its first case reported. Emergency Use Listing (EULs) for COVID-19 vaccine was issued by WHO. On December 31， 2020 Pfizer， on February 15h， 2021， two versions of the AstraZeneca/Oxford， (manufactured by the Serum Institute of India and SKBio)， and on March 12h， 2021， Ad26.COV2.S， (Johnson& Johnson) were EUL listed by WHO. According to WHO， the vaccine should be taken if possible and even if you experienced COVID-19.However， it is too early to predict how these vaccines will work and protect and research is continued. It is still advised to take a vaccine because it will develop immunity inside the human body and will probably reduce the risk of illness development. In general vaccine development goes several stages which include pre-clinical(vaccine development in the lab)， Phase 1 Clinical trial (8 participants to 10 participants； for vaccine testing safety)； Phase 2 clinical trial (50participants to 100 participants； for testing vaccine immunogenicity i.e. production of antibodies against virus)； Phase 3 clinical trial (30k participants to 50k participants； for testing actual protection offered by the vaccine) . However， this COVID-19's dreadful impact forced to development of a vaccine within a vear compared to other previous diseases . For example， the development of the polio vaccine took 40 years， 5 years for Ebola， and an average of 15 years for most of the vaccine development . To understand how vaccines are working properly， efficacy is useful term. Efficacy is a degree of relative lessening in threat. To understand it in bete way； if someone has cloned of him/herself which having one version fully vaccinated and other version is not then the vaccinated one will have 95% less risk to get risk. In reality cloning of human being is not possible hence in the lab randomization is employed . According to WHO， vaccine will only is allowed in the market if it has at least 50% efficacy and higher is better . Table 3 lists the vaccines and their efficacy.\n\n【27】India targeted to vaccinate 300 million people by August 2021， and by February 8h， 2021， India was able to vaccinate 6 million beneficiaries countrywide . In India， two different vaccines are available which include Covishield and Covaxin. Covishield vaccine is the same patent technology developed by the AstraZeneca vaccine and manufactured by the Serum Institute of India. According to the Indian Government website， the choice of vaccine is not an option of public， though it will be made available in various parts of India. The first group includes healthcare and frontline workers. The second group to receive the COVID-19 vaccine will be persons over 60 years of age and persons between 45 and 59 years of age with comorbid conditions. Vaccines are mostly liquid products. As of May 5h， 2021total vaccination has been done for 16，04，94，188 people.\n\n【28】At the beginning of the vaccination program， vaccines were free from government medical healthcare while private hospitals charged250 rupees ($3) which were changed later. Serum institute decided to sell shots at 150 rupees to central， 300 rupees ($4) to state， and the private hospital for 600 rupees ($8). Bharat Biotech decided to charge 150 rupees to central， 400 rupees ($5.50) and private hospital for 1200 rupees ($16) . European Union paid $2.15 per dose for the AstraZeneca vaccine. According to them， the price reduction is because of the EU's contribution to vaccine development. This high price for Covaxin is shocking as it is made by an Indian company.On the other hand， Covaxin didn't publish yet its phase 3 clinical trial data in a peer-reviewed scientific journal， and has only announced its interim efficacy data-claimed to be around 80% through a press release. Now Sputnik V vaccines got a green signal to be used and at the first phase， 125 million doses will be distributed. Details of the present two vaccines are listed in Table 4 and Table 5， which show the other vaccines that are under process.\n\n【29】However， there is still doubt that the vaccination plan will not work properly as the COVID-19 virus is mutating and new variants as listed in Table 6. WHO has been tracking mutations and variants since the start of the COVID-19 outbreak. Currently， there is no agreed international naming system for variants. In India， the active variants are B.1.617 and B.1.1.7.3.2.\n\n【30】Current issues in India\n\n【31】COVID-19patients with severe conditions suffer from respiratory distress . Data from China showed that COVID-19 patient needs oxygen treatment and those who are critical should be taken care with mechanical ventilation . WHO， Welcome Trust， and Unit aid had set COVID-19 oxygen Emergency Taskforce that will deal with $90million to fund the “immediate emergency response\". Initially， they will target 20 low and middle-income countries (e.g. Afghanistan， Malawi， and Nigeria) over the coming year . Oxygen employed for medical purposes should contain 82% pure and contamination-free oxygen and should be generated by an oil-free compressor . Oxygen concentrators， plants that generate oxygen and liquid oxygen in the storage tank are the common sources of oxygen that could be\n\n【32】Table 5： Other vaccines which are under pre-clinical or Phase l orll stages .\n\n| Product Name  | Indian Manufacturer + Collaborator  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ZyCaV-D (DNA vaccine)  | Cadila Healthcare Ltd， Ahmadabad (Zydus Cadila) + Dept of Biatechnalagy， India  |\n| Sputnik V (Human Adenovirus vaccine)  | Trialed and manufactured in India by Dr. Reddy Lab. +Gamaleya National Center， Russia  |\n| NVX-CoV2373 (Pratein Subunit)  | Serum Institute of India， Pune + Novavax  |\n| Recombinant Protein Antigen based vaccine  | Bialagical E Ltd， Hyderabad +MIT， USA  |\n| HGCO 19 (mRNA based vaccine)  | Genova， Pune+ HDT， USA  |\n| Inactivated rabies vector platform  | Bharat Biotech International Ltd， Hyderabad + Thomas Jefferson University， USA  |\n| Vesiculo Vax Platform  | Aurobindo Pharma Ltd， Hyderabad + Aurovaccine， USA  |\n\n【34】Table 6： Variants of concern or under investigation .\n\n| Variant  | The names by which this variant may be known  | Lineage  | Country in which first detected  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| VOC-20DEC-01  | VOC-202012/01  | B.1.1.7  | England， UK  |\n| VOC-20DEC-02  | VOC-202012/02  | 501Y.V2 B.1.351  | South Africa  |\n| VUI-21JAN-01  | VUI-202101/01  | P.2  | Brazil  |\n| VOC-21JAN-02  | VOC-202101/02  | P.1  | Japan ex Manaus， Brazil  |\n| VUI-21FEB-01  | VUI-202102/01  | A.23.1 with E484K  | England， UK  |\n| VOC-21FEB-02  | VOC-202102/02  | B.1.1.7 with E484K  | England， UK  |\n| VUI-21FEB-03  | VUI-202102/03  | B.1.525 (previously designated UK1188)  | England， UK  |\n| VUI-21FEB-04  | VUI-202102/04  | B1.1.318  | TBC  |\n| VUI-21MAR-01  | VUI-202103/01  | B1.324.1 with E484K  | TBC  |\n| VUI-21MAR-02  |  | P.3  | TBC  |\n| VUI-21APR-01  |  | B.1.617  | India  |\n| VUI-21APR-02  |  | B.1.617.2  | India  |\n| VUI-21APR-03  |  | B.1.617.3  | India  |\n\n【36】In India， during this current second wave， hospitals are facing a shortage of medical oxygen. However， the director of Inox Air Products， which supplies 50% of the oxygen demands in the country， claims that India has sufficient oxygen to deal with the present condition. India produces more than 7，000 metric tons of liquid oxygen per day. Uneven supply and logistical issues have led to an oxygen crisis in some states. Some other major oxygen manufacturers in India include Indian Linde India， Goyal MG Gases Pvt. Ltd.， National Oxygen Limited . In India， the health care sector consumes 15% of total produced oxygen while the rest are consumed by industry. During this pandemic， 90% of oxygen is now supplied to the medical sector and still， the situation is critical. The allocated amount for health care service in India is the lowest in the world and India has insufficient doctors， nurses， and beds to tackle an unprecedented COVID-19 situation .\n\n【37】To tackle the situation， 64，000 beds were deployed using 4，000railway coaches at various railwaystations. The Indira Gandhi Athletic Stadium， in Guwahati， Delhi's Radha Soami Satsang Beas Campus， Bangalore's Koramangala In door Stadium have been converted to the COVID-19 treatment center.\n\n【38】To support India， globally 40 countries agreed to send oxygen support. UK sent equipment， which can generate 500 liters of oxygen per minute . Singapore sent 7，511 oxygen concentrators， 516BiPAP ventilators. Ireland agreed to send 700 Oxygen concentrators. France decided to send relief in two phases. The first phase will include oxygen generating plant， liquid oxygen， and respiratory materials while the liquid oxygen content will be in the second phase.\n\n【39】Germany promised to send oxygen production plants and protection gear. Australia’s commitment includes ventilators ， surgical masks (1 million)， P2 and N95 masks ， goggles ，100，000 pairs of gloves， and 20，000 face shields. Russia， Kuwait has also promised to provide help. Saudi Arabia will send 80 MT of liquid oxygen. 800 Oxygen concentrators from Hong Kong and four cryogenic oxygen containers from Thailand respectively. UAE will send six cryogenic oxygen containers . Indian government revised the Foreign Trade Policy and allowed to import of oxygen for personal use until July 2021.Indian rail (oxygen express) transporting liquid medical oxygen across the country in the name of Oxygen Expresses to fight COVID-19.\n\n【40】To destroy the COVID-19 transmission， different states and UT have imposed either night curfew， mini lockdown， restriction until 8 pm， or just keep open the essential kinds of stuff and close the non-essential shops. For example， Delhi (1 till 19th April 2021and later till May 1，2021)， Maharashtra (till May 15h， 2021)， Uttar Pradesh (till May 44，2021)， Jammu Kashmir (April 30th to May 3r，2021)， Karnataka (from April 27h， 2021， 14 days)， Telangana (May84，2021)， Jharkhand (May 64，2021)， Goa (May 3m， 2021)， Haryana(May 31， 2021)， Gujarat (29 cities till May 54， 2021)； Kerala ( from April 20h，2021)，Bihar (May 15h， 2021)， West Bengal (start from May6，2021) already have imposed such restriction.\n\n【41】From May 1India had a plan to start vaccinating the entire adult which could be around 660 million people.However， vaccine shortage is now prominent and only 12 state out of36 states including UT have enough stock to vaccinating over 18s . Right now in India， three key bottlenecks for the vaccination process are the unavailability of the vaccine， efficacy of the vaccine， and penetration (registration). As\n\n【42】Table 7： Total COVID-19 vaccination as of 10'h May (source from MoHFW).\n\n| Type  | 1et Dose  | 2nd Dose  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Health care workers  | 95，63，406  | 65，05，072  |\n| Front line workers  | 1，40，49，681  | 78，51，075  |\n| People aged 18-44 years  | 25，52，843  |  |\n| People aged ≥ 45 years  | 5，54，97，658  | 71，73，939  |\n| People aged 60 years  | 5，38，00，706  | 1，56，39，381  |\n| Total  | 13，54，64，924  | 3，71，69，467  |\n\n【44】From last year lockdown， Indian education sector suffered a lot. When there was a plan to school student’s returning to school， this second wave created and made the plan delayed again. Indian government made announcements regarding promotion of student to the next classes without any examination，based on their assessments， class tests and projects. Additionally， various states cancelled their state board examinations during serious pandemic situation， directly and severely affecting the education system and standards . It's unclear when situation will be clear again. Because of the closure of education sector， approximately 320 million students have been affected. It can be argued why India didn’t move towards digital education. For 2017-18 years， National Sample Survey office reported that only 23.8% Indians have internet access with 42% in urban and14.9% in rural. According to economic times， during lockdown one in four students in India can’t use the online study because they don’t have laptop or desktop. Thus， in quality and inconsistency of education in digital medium is evident. Even developed country like USA faced challenges to offer equal online education because of the presence of black，Hispanic and low income family student. On other hand， it is also evident that the way students learn in school (offline education)， it is not possible to achieve through online because online education can't replace the interpersonal interactions， essential social skills for holistic growth and development.\n\n【45】Discussion\n\n【46】Totackle this COVID-19 situation， no medication is available now and no one knows fully how to deal with this. Isolation probably one of the best ways to limit at least the spreading of this virus. Lockdown probably the best way to limit transmission . According to WHO， to lift the lockdown， proper health system capacities for testing， trace every contact and isolate and treat every case； maintain social distancing at schools and other essential places， workplaces； minimizing importation of new cases from countries or areas that have not yet contained the outbreak； community willingness to continue social distancing wherever possible and community engagement in all measures are required. It is evident that the lockdown for the first wave in India did not stop the spread of COVID-19 and the economy suffered a lot. However， now the COVID-19 Task Force (set up by the government) and the Supreme Court asked the Indian government to impose again nationwide lockdown to break the transmission. Probably from last year’s experience， the Government is trying to use all efforts and keep the lockdown for the last option. However， according to the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy， this localized lockdown already created a job loss which is around 70 lakhs in various states across the country. Though it is not announced，but， from May 2021， 98% of Indians are under some kind of restriction to break the COVID-19 second wave transmission.\n\n【47】India is dealing with a huge vaccination program for COVID-19and many people even in rural areas were able to have those doses free of cost. However， it has to be remembered that temperature control is essential for the safety and efficacy of the vaccine. Even unwillingly or due to lack of infrastructure， if vaccines are kept at different temperatures， they will be deadly . The first wave of COVID-19 affected hugely in urban areas and also for the second wave it is evident that hotspots (and the emerging hotspots) are everywhere in urban areas . To have the better result from vaccination it could be the strategy to vaccinate urban areas first and then rural areas or areas where population density is less. However， now there is no scope as COVID-19 second wave also covered the smalltowns and rural areas in India.\n\n【48】It is heartbreaking to see that when India facing this tragic pandemic and suffering from the second wave； pharmaceutical companies are charging a price for vaccines. Indian government failed to stockpile vaccine at an early stage while other countries such as the USA， UK， and Israel started this measure in back September2020. India first purchased 15 million doses and later administered over 140 million doses. However， it is not officially revealed how it will be fulfilled. On February 15， India's finance minister announced Rs 35，000 crores ($4.69 billion) for COVID-19 vaccines. Without a free vaccine， India may move towards another economic downtown if lockdown possess again. Increase COVID-19 cases can create a situation again which requires the forced shutdown， closure of industry which will derail the economy again. Economist believes that Indian government could support the free vaccination scheme， which could only take 0.3% of GDP. By simple calculation， it can be shown that 966 million people should be vaccinated twice which indicates the requirement of 1.93 billion doses. If dose cost Rs 150total cost will be Rs 28，980 crores ( close to 0.14%GDP) and if the cost is Rs 400； total cost will be Rs 77，280 crores (close to 0.38%GDP).\n\n【49】It is evident that India's claim ofbeating the epidemic and younger population are free from this disease， immunity has been developed， and overall victory on the COVID-19 is fully hogwash. Currently， administrative arrogance， lack of doses， hyper-nationalism， and population created a grave burning issue . Probably it can be said that the people of Indian are also equally liable for the occurrence of the second wave. Early letting down the protection (use of mask； sanitization； maintaining social distancing)； started attending weddings and socializing，religious gathering， and no strict restriction norms from government； all added the fuel in this situation. It seems like Indians were in a parallel universe while the rest of the world was experiencing a second wave. As the infection rate waslow， people were not in the mood to take the vaccine. India could slow down the rate by imposing strict vaccination rules， maintaining social distancing， and follow strict COVID-19 restriction measures set by WHO. The government had one-year time to increase the health sector capacity and a complete failure is visible now. People are paying thousands and lakhs of money in the health sector if they are lucky enough to be admitted to hospital. According to the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation， by August 1， India can experience a staggering1 million deaths from COVID-19 . To avail herd immunity， India should implement safe， effective， and robust vaccination . Currently population of India is 135 crore. 94.5 crore people must be vaccinated to obtain herd immunity which is only possible if 189crore vaccine doses are available. With India's current vaccination rate，herd immunity is feasible only in 3.5 years.\n\n【50】Conclusion\n\n【51】The second wave of COVID-19 infection was under the radar from last year still it could not be stopped. India is facing the second wave of COVID-19 infection. In this work， how India dealt with COVID-19 first wave and now suffering from the second wave is documented. National lockdown is still not imposed. Last year lockdown could not limit the COVID-19 transmission but due to the closure of industry India faced serious economic down. Pure medical Oxygen is essential for COVID-19 patients but lack of oxygen created the scenario more complex. Vaccination programs started but the price of vaccination is a serious issue. It will take several weeks to vaccinate a large population. Free vaccination could help the Indian economy as a new national lockdown can create another economic dip. Education sector is now another large sector which suffered significantly. It is still unsure how India will manage to tackle this second wave.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 11:15:45", "endTime": "2024/09/24 11:16:17", "cost": 31.851}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:32", "update_time": "2024-09-23 19:16:17", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 19:15:44"}

A late diagnosis， unplanned pregnancy course and delivery are related to a 40% to 50% maternal and fetal mortality risk. Conversely， early detection and treatment significantly reduces both to 5% to 15%. Based on a literature review and our implications for the present case report， we suggest a multidisciplinary diagnosis and management algorithm PHEO in pregnancy.\n\n【2】Case Report： A35-year-old primigravida at 27+1 weeks of Gestation [GA] presented with headache and previously diagnosed chronic Hypertension [HTN] aggravation. Complete evaluation ruled out pregnancy related HTN. A high suspicion level for an alternative cause for HTN was raised. Appropriate imaging studies revealed a heterogenous mass adjacent to the left adrenal 8 cm x 7cm in diameter， highly suspicious for adrenal tumor. Elevated urine catecholamines confirmed the diagnosis ofPHEO. A multidisciplinaryteam was formed and a joint decision for disease control and delayed surgery until after delivery was taken. Blood pressure control was achieved by a combined alpha and beta-adrenergic blocker approach at levels of 135-140/.\n\n【3】Antenatal steroids for fetal lung maturation were administered with concurrent 24 h BP Holter. Her condition remained stable and at 32+0 GA a planned cesarean section delivery using a minimal intraperitoneal handling technique under neuraxial anesthesia. A male newborn of 1，960 g was delivered， 1'/5'Apgar score 6/9. The medical therapy was continued with lower BP goals and a planned laparoscopic adrenalectomy performed after 2 weeks of postpartum recovery. The mother and child were discharged in good condition.\n\n【4】Conclusion： The maternal and fetal lethal consequences of PHEO during pregnancy may be prevented by a high index of suspicion for the diagnosis and following a multidisciplinary algorithm of management， adapted to the individual patient， mainly based on achievement of BP control and the gestational age.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】35-year-oldprimigravida at 27+1 weeks of Gestation [GA]，work immigrant from the Philippines， was referred to our center with a diagnosis of severe aggravation of chronic Hypertension [HTN].\n\n【7】Her medical history was positive for a HTN disease diagnosed four years prior to referral and diagnosed as essential； treated with TRITACE (5 mg/25 mg ramipril and hydrochlorothiazide 5mg) tid. Her family history was positive for chronic HTN (mother and maternal grandmother). Additionally， she was diagnosed with Diabetes Mellitus type 2 [DM and treated with Metformin850 mg/daily with no regular control of glucose levels.\n\n【8】Her pregnancy was spontaneously conceived while a HbA1C % level of 6.5%. Genetic screening consisted of nuchal translucency， biochemical 1 and 2n trimester screening as well as fetal anatomy Ultrasound [US] evaluation； all reported within normallimits. During the 1trimester she reported intractable headache and Blood Pressure [BP] values registered as high as 240/125. At the time the patient denied flushing， palpitations， and sweating. Labetalol 200 MG tid was then added.\n\n【9】She was referred to the emergency department at 27+1 GA because of headache. The initial examination the BP measured 198/119， with no skin or vasomotor changes. The laboratory workup was within normal limits； hemoglobin percentage 13.6 g %， platelet count 413K， normal liver function and Protein Creatinine Ration [PCR] of 0.14. The uterine fundal height corresponded to the GA and the fetal biophysical profile was 10/10. A diagnosis of aggravated chronic HTN prompted treatment with intravenous hydralazine and magnesium sulfate and admission to the maternal fetal medicine ward.\n\n【10】Due to the sustained high BP the differential diagnosis was extended from superimposed Preeclampsia [PET] spectrum other chronic HTN causes (endocrinopathies， renal artery stenosis etc.). Further examination included ophthalmologic examination， echocardiography， renal artery Doppler studies； all within normal range. Abdominal Sonography revealed a heterogenousmass adjacent to her left adrenal measured 8 cm × 7 cm . A subsequent Magnetic Resonance Imaging [MRI] showed a T2hyperintensity space occupying lesion， without hyper vascularization and neither lymphadenopathy . A differential diagnosis of Pheochromocytoma [PHEO] versus Adreno-Cortico-Carcinoma[ACC] was raised. A 24 h urine with a metanephrine level of 94.9mcg/24 h [range 39 to nor-metanephrine 14777.7 mcg/24 h[range confirmed a diagnosis of PHEO.\n\n【11】A multidisciplinaryteam Of maternal-fetal medicine， neonatology， endocrinology， anesthesiologists， and general surgery was formed. The midpoint of the discussion was the balance upon the immediate surgical tumor removal in the presence of pregnancy induced cardiovascular changesand a 28 weeks uterus and subsequent delivery or deferral of the adrenal surgery until fetal maturity. After consideration of the data and previous surgical experience and a joint consult with the mother a decision was made for continuous hospitalization aimed towards the utmost conservative approach regarding the pregnancy. The aim was set for a Cesarean Delivery[CD] at 32 weeks to be followed by the adrenal surgery. A combined antihypertensive therapy was started consisting of Labetalol 400 mg tid， Amlodipine 10 mg tid and Doxazosin 7 mg bid； with a therapeutic goal of BP of 130/80； a dose of corticosteroids for fetal lung maturation under Holter monitoring of BP. Within a week of the medical therapy the BP goal was achieved. In parallel insulin therapy was started and glucose control reached. The fetal growth was appropriate and daily fetal wellbeing assessment (US BPP and NST) were reassuring.\n\n【12】At 32+0 weeks of gestation the mother was prepared for a minimal intraperitoneal handling technique of cesarean delivery with neuraxial anesthesia.\n\n【13】Upon entering the surgical suite， the patient was connected to a non-invasive BP monitor， administrated Midazolam (1 mg) and Esmolol (10 mg)； to meet the anxiety and related hypertension during the preparations. A radial arterial line was then placed (local anesthesia) towards a Combined Spinal Epidural anesthesia (CSE)， the patient received a spinal shot of hyperbaric Bupivacaine (5 mg)， Fentanyl (20 mcg) and Morphine (0.15 mg)， followed by Lidocaine2%(4 ml) injected into the epidural catheter， sensory T6 level block was diagnosed by pinprick. with the umbilical cord 3 times around neck and a true knot. The placenta was sent for pathological assessment and later reported to be normal and adequate to the GA. Intravenous oxytocin was during surgery continued with administered， a low dose of Oxytocin drip (1unit/h) 24 h postoperative. The postoperative course was normal. The medical therapy was continued after the CD surgery for an additional two weeks in hospital. Thereafter， a planned for laparoscopic adrenalectomy under general anesthesia was preformed following a rigorous pharmaceutical preparation； a large highly vascular adrenal mass measured 8 cm in diameter was removed， no signs of macroscopic metastatic disease . The antihypertensive medication was limited to Labetalol 200 mg twice bid. The pathologic assessment ofthe adrenal mass confirmed the diagnosis of PHEO with intact capsule and no evidence of mitotic activity (Ki-67 proliferation index： 1%) or invasion.\n\n【14】Discussion\n\n【15】Pheochromocytoma [PHEO] a benign type catecholamine-secreting tumor， originating from chromaffin cells of medullary region of the adrenal gland or sympathetic ganglia， is an extremely rare cause of HTN disease；0.2% to 0.4%， ofall causes of hypertension. During pregnancy a scarce prevalence of 1 in 54，000 pregnancies has been reported .\n\n【16】The diagnosis of PHEO is based on a high level of suspicion facing related severe HTN crisis. The immediate medical interventions as aimed to limit the hazards related to extreme HTN while the definite therapy is surgical resection with the laparoscopic approach being\n\n【17】GA： Gestational Age； BP： Blood Pressure； CD： Cesarean Delivery；TOP： Termination of Pregnancy； IUFD： Intrauterine Fetal Demise； NST： Non-Stress Test； BPP：Biophysical Profile， EFW： Estimated Fetal Weight preferred . The effect of a concomitant pregnancy presents an additional consideration of the PHEO related hazards in view of the maternal-fetal safety concerns. Previous reports show that the two thirds of PHEO cases during pregnancy were diagnosed antepartum and the rest postpartum .\n\n【18】The present case of PHEO during pregnancy is representative of all these challenges. We will focus on the PHEO-pregnancy related considerations and present a management algorithm  aimed to early antepartum diagnosis and therapy； both reported to decrease maternal mortality rates from 50% to less than 5% to 15%\n\n【19】In PHEO， as in other surgical intervention during pregnancy， the second trimester of pregnancy is considered the optimal timing； due to the fetal organogenesis stage and in cases of intra-abdominal approaches， the gravid uterus does not impair the surgical view . Earlier reports of the PHEO included cases diagnosed after adverse outcome of a delivery or uncontrolled BP， thus with a significant bias towards a recommendation of immediate medical therapy and PHEO removal， irrespective of gestational age or fetal maturity. We hereby raise the concerns of catecholamine excessive secretion when manipulating the tumor， prolonged exposure to general anesthesia agents， prolonged right decubitus position with subsequent profound maternal hypotension and fetal deterioration. We suggest that reviewing the later cases， adrenal surgery may be deferred until after delivery in the late prematurity period.\n\n【20】The present suggested multidisciplinary conservative approach is aimed towards all these concerns. Mainly， it consists of an initial alpha-blocker together with an optional beta-blocker therapy to obtain BP control at any GA . Predelivery medical therapy is based a-blockers at least until up to 14 days before surgery， followed by B-blockers to prevent reflex tachycardia . Among a adrenergic receptor blockers doxazosin rather phenoxybenzamine； although both category C drugs during pregnancy， the later was reported to be associated with neonatal cardiorespiratory complication . We suggest that the BP therapeutic goals in pregnancy should be higher than in the non-pregnant state， especially if longer period until delivery is expected； hypoperfusion of the uteroplacental unit， intrauterine growth restriction and placental abruption may occur with excessive low BP .\n\n【21】Although the non-pregnant BP goal is considered less than130/80 mmHg while seated and greater than 90 mmHg systolic while standing ， we suggest， a BP goal of 140/90； all the more in cases of PHEO diagnosis in the late 2n and 3r trimester ofpregnancy.\n\n【22】Gestational age， fetal status， patient’s response to medical treatment，malignantcharacteristics ofthetumorandthe respectability of thetumor are the main factor to take into consideration in order to plan the surgical excision .\n\n【23】Before 24 weeks of pregnancy， the recommendation is that the delivery should be postponed after the surgical therapy， for full maternal benefit； and the mode determined by obstetric considerations. The 24 weeks limit has been derived from the fetal viability limits； however， we may suggest that since these limits are re-defined， 22 weeks of gestation seems a more reasonable bound. After fetal viability， additional considerations such as HTN crisis， placental abruption prior to or during adrenal surgery together with the difficult surgical field approach are to be taken in consideration. Nevertheless， antihypertensive therapy and hemodynamic instability during adrenal surgery may be seriously detrimental to the fetus leading to severe brain hypoperfusion. We consider that the consult in the fetal pre-viability period should include the option of termination of pregnancy. In case surgical intervention is performed and the pregnancy is continued， careful targeted fetal brain imaging into the second part of the pregnancy is warranted.\n\n【24】In cases the PHEO is diagnosed after fetal viability， that the mainstay of the management should be aimed the achievement and maintenance of maternal BP response to medical therapy， under hospitalization in a center with multidisciplinary facilities. This first goal successful achievement is the indicator that allows postponing delivery and refraining from extreme prematurity，i.e.，at least until 32weeks gestation . Although fetal movements have been postulated an ability to induce adrenal hypertensive crisis； we found no robust proof in the literature； including the present case. Antenatal steroids for fetal lung maturation are to be administered with concurrent 24h BP Holter.\n\n【25】The delivery， either emergency or planned should be attended by a multidisciplinary team. Previous case reports suggested a higher maternal mortality rate after Vaginal Delivery [VD] in contrast with elective Cesarean Section [CS] ； CS is reported to lower the maternal and fetal mortality rate from 33% to 19% . This might be the base that approximately 80% of the cases were delivered by CS； either planned or emergent .\n\n【26】The excess of maternalfetal hazards in the case ofavaginal delivery， has been explained by the maternal BP stress induced rapid changes， elevation of the intra-abdominal pressure during labor and the labor and the related pain which can result in excessive catecholamine's secretion. We consider that independent of the BP control， in view of a planned premature delivery with an expected low cervical Bishop score， a planned CS is the preferred mode of delivery. Importantly， the pain management is critical in either delivery situation .\n\n【27】The anesthetic management goal for the CS is preoperative anxiety limitation and BP stability and monitoring； in addition to ASA standard monitoring， a radial arterial line is warranted.\n\n【28】Neuraxial anesthesia should be considered for PHEO Caesarean sections . This type of anesthesia may prevent the swift rise in BP often observed during intubation and reduce pain-related hypertension via use of intrathecal morphine. However， neuraxial anesthesia (namely spinal anesthesia) often results in sympathectomy， causing an associated decline in BP. In the present case a Combined Spinal Epidural anesthesia (CSE) approach was elected， as it allows the use of reduced doses of intrathecal Bupivacaine and reduced subsequent hemodynamic effects， with additional epidural doses， if needed.\n\n【29】Conclusion\n\n【30】In cases of concomitant PHEO and pregnancy， timed diagnosis， a multidisciplinary approach  with planned delivery will benefit the mother and the fetus with a favorable outcome.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 10:20:01", "endTime": "2024/09/24 10:20:17", "cost": 15.818}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:32", "update_time": "2024-09-23 18:20:15", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 18:19:59"}

However， the use of centrallines is not without complications. The two most common complications associated with the use of central venous catheters are infection and thrombosis . Improvements in the design and maintenance of CVCs have reduced their occurrence. Current improvements include the use of antibiotics and tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) catheter locking solutions . Even when the rates of infection and thrombosis have decreased and patency has improved， AV fistulas and grafts are still the preferred method of venous access for long-term hemodialysis. Not every patient is suitable for an AV fistula； including the elderly and diabetic populations are not good candidates. An AV graft is often more suitable for this particular type of patients， and is considered a better option over a CVC . We present a case of sepsis and thrombosis， co-occurring in a patient with End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD)， associated with the use of central venous catheters.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 54-year-old patient with ESRD on hemodialysis with a past medical history of seizure disorder，hypertension， heart failure， and a cerebral vascular accident with residual right hemiparesis， was transferred to the emergency department from a nursing home due to syncope， falls and altered mental status. Last fall prior to admission was unwitnessed.\n\n【7】On initial assessment， the patient was unable to recall what had occurred prior to the fall. The patient denied palpitations， headache， blurry vision， excessive sweating or weakness. The only complaint was pain in the left arm and hip. Vital signs were within normal limits， except for a temperature of 39.6C. No signs of fracture were noted on X-rays of the cervical spine， left arm， shoulder or hip. No acute injury noted on cephalic non-contrast CT nor any abnormalities on the electrocardiogram or encephalogram. A portable chest X-ray demonstrated a moderate effusion of the right lung field， as well as cavitary lesions at the left lateral base. Lab findings demonstrated a leukocytosis of 30.62×10/3 with an ANC of 27.18×10/3. The Blood chemistry panel revealed a BUN of 84 mg/dl and a creatinine level of 9.81 mg/dl.Lactate level was 1.1 meq/L. The patient was started on antibiotic therapy with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam.\n\n【8】On subsequent investigation， a CT scan of the chest showed bilateral pleural effusions and cavitary lesions scattered throughout the left lung field with a possible consideration for septic emboli. A right internal jugular central venous line extending into the superior vena cava was also visualized. An abdominal CT showed a questionable wedge-shaped hypodensity along the inferior and lateral aspect of the spleen， suspicious for a possible splenic infarct. A pelvic CT demonstrated a small amount of fluid and gas at the entry of a left femoral venous line. A transthoracic echocardiogram demonstrated the presence of a fluffy echogenic mass which appeared attached to the catheter， likely thrombotic in origin. The mass traveled across the tricuspid valve to the level of the tricuspid leaflet. The possibility of the mass being colonized with bacteria was possible. Anticoagulation with heparin and warfarin was initiated. A ventilation perfusion scan and Doppler studies of upper and lower extremities showed no abnormalities.\n\n【9】Blood cultures， grew Enterococcus feacalis and Staphylococcus hominis. The tip of the internal jugular dialysis catheter grew Staphylococcus aureus. Sputum cultures grew Candida albicans and normal flora. Antibiotic therapy was switched to gentamicin and ampicillin.\n\n【10】Removal of the femoral venous catheter followed. The right internal jugular venous catheter was removed and replaced by a new catheter in the left internal jugular vein. The patient resumed dialysis during the hospital course and continued dialysis upon discharge.\n\n【11】Prior to discharge a transesophageal echocardiogram still demonstrated a small thrombus at the junction of the superior vena cava and right atrium； no vegetations were visualized. The patient continued anticoagulation therapy upon discharge with Warfarin5 mg PO daily and heparin 8000 units subcutaneously every 12hr. A new chest CT scan demonstrated stable to slightly decreased lung nodules， interval resolution of the right pleural effusion and a grossly stable 4 cm splenic lesion. Further investigation of the splenic lesion via biopsy or laparoscopy was not recommended due to a high surgical risk. Due to the high suspicion of a splenic abscess， the patient was discharged on 500mg of vancomycin and 70 mg of gentamicin. A follow-up with infectious disease as an outpatient was arranged. The patient's leukocytosis was resolved and blood cultures were negative prior to discharge.\n\n【12】Infection andthrombosis arethetwo most common complications of CVC use . Reduction in the incidence of complications are observed with the use of tPA and antibiotic catheter locking solutions， as well as with the use of mupirocin or polysporin as topical agents at the catheter exit site . The presence of catheter-related thrombosis predisposes to bacterial colonization and catheter related sepsis . Localized injury of the vein at the access site can occur during insertion of the catheter； as a result deposition of fibrin occurs at the site of the injury， followed by the formation of a thrombus . The biofilm layer found around the lumen of the catheter offers a perfect nidus for bacterial growth .Obtaining the right long-term vascular access is a critical factor affecting the morbidity and mortality of patients on hemodialysis . In this particular case， the patient's initial catheters were removed，anda new catheter in the left internal jugular vein was placed. A preferred option in these particular types of cases， in which patients require long-term hemodialysis， is that of an autogenous fistula. AV fistulas provide a better outcome in terms of mortality， infections， hospitalization rates， and avoids repeated access interventions .

Yet， it is not the standard of care to screen for either of these sexually transmitted diseases upon diagnosis of primary penile cancer. We present a 50 year old male who had a confirmed diagnosis of penile cancer for 2 years prior to his presentation to our clinic in Dakar， Senegal. Outside institutions repeatedly failed to screen the patient for sexually transmitted diseases， namely HPV and HIV. We share this case to emphasize the importance of sexually transmitted disease screening upon diagnosis of penile cancer with hopes to increase awareness in both developed and developing nations. We call for consensus in sexually transmitted disease screening guidelines upon penile cancer diagnoses.\n\n【2】Keywords： Penile cancer； HPV；HIV； STD screening\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Primary penile cancer is a rare malignant overgrowth of cells， typically located on the glans or the internal prepuce of the penis. It has a worldwide incidence of 1/100，000 and most commonly affects males between the ages of 50 years to 70 years. Delayed diagnosis often yields significant morbidity and mortality . While penile cancer is uncommon in Europe and North America， the developing world has much higher rates of incidence up to 8 cases per 100，000 in some countries. Variations in incidence worldwide are hypothesized to be affected by socioeconomic status， healthcare accessibility，cultural tradition，and psychological factors of the patient populations .\n\n【5】Over 95% of penile carcinomas are Squamous Cell in Carcinoma (SCC) . Additionally， there are a wide variety of other histological variants， such as basaloid， verrucous， and sarcomatoid . The majority of lesions are found on the glans (48%)， with the remainder located on the prepuce(21%)， both glans and prepuce (15%)， coronal sulcus (6%)， and shaft (<2%). Diagnosis is often clinical， though clinical presentation is variable and commonly asymptomatic initially. Lesions can present as indurated nodules， ulcers， or fun gating masses. With progression， symptoms such as itching， bleeding， discharge， or pain may occur. Advanced disease can present with palpable lymphadenopathy， weight loss and fatigue .\n\n【6】Certain biological pathologieshavebeentiedto increased incidence. Poorhygiene， uncircumcised males， urethral stricture， tobacco use，and even psoralen ultraviolet A photochemotherapy have all been associated with increased penile cancer incidence in prior studies . Chronic inflammation may also be a critical component of tumor development， as many penile cancers arise from sites of infection， chronic irritation or injury . Further， penile cancer is best known to have a strong association with carcinogenic strains of Human Papillomavirus (HPV). For example， HPV infection is found in 45% to 80% of penile SCC cases. This association is even higher in other histological types such as verrucous， basaloid and sarcomatoid . The most commonlyaccepted explanation for the association is HPV's ability to produce the oncogenic proteins E6 and E7， which interfere with the p53 and Retinoblastoma tumor suppressor genes， respectively . This carcinogenic mechanism is especially important in populations with high HPV infection rates， such as Sub-Saharan Africa. HPV incidence was found to be around 61% of the male population in Sub-Saharan Africa in 2012. Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) may also play a role in SCC pathogenesis. Though a causal link between immunosuppression and penile oncogenesis has not yet been made， men who are HIV+ carry up to an 8X greater risk of penile SCC .\n\n【7】Despite HPV and HIV's well known association with penile cancer， there is a serious lack of attention to the preventive health component of this condition. For example， the European Urological Association's (EUA) guidelines for penile cancer address diagnostic standards， staging， and possible treatment avenues that individual cases may necessitate. However， there is little acknowledgement of the public health risks that penile cancer may pose with an underlying HPV and HIV infection. Additionally， there seems to be no recommendation for penile cancer management specifically in developing nations， including Sub-Saharan Africa， which may have unique socioeconomic roadblocks. Consequently， this case report aims to emphasize the critical importance of screening for HIV/HPV upon a diagnosis of penile cancer， such that it should be included in official penile cancer guidelines. Prompt evaluation of a patient's STD status can not only decrease morbidity and mortality for the patient， but also provide preventative measures against future HPV-related cancers， as well as HIV complications in the community.\n\n【8】Case Presentation\n\n【9】We present a 50 year-old Senegalese male with a history of recurrent urethritis， who presented to our clinic for an evolving ulcerative swelling on his penis for the past 2 years. The patient's medical history is limited secondary to lack of documentation and resources from outside institutions. The patient had presented to several local clinics before the diagnosis of penile cancer was made； those records were unable to be obtained. The patient received 12chemotherapysessions before being referred to our clinic. Ofnote，the patient was polygamous with 2 wives， though became divorced since the beginning of the disease. He did not report having unprotected intercourse with other women.\n\n【10】CT scans demonstrated local invasion of the cancer into the subcutaneous fat overlying the pubic symphysis. Lymph node metastases with left inguinal necrotic lymphadenopathy of 5 cm were also present. Furthermore， there were bilateral， multiple lung nodules of different sizes， mostly predominant on the left side.\n\n【11】The patient never received an STD screening since his diagnosis. We performed an HIV and HPV test that came back positive for HIV2，previously unknown to the patient. The results also came back HPV (+) for serotype 16. As of May 2020， the patient is currently alive and being treated accordingly.\n\n【12】Discussion\n\n【13】There are no written recommendations for STD screening in patients diagnosed with penile cancer despite overwelming evidence that there is some association between HIV， HPV and penile cancer.Evidenced by our patient remaining undiagnosed with HIV2after initial presentation 2 years ago， delay in STD diagnosis can have dire consequences. An earlier diagnosis for our patient may have prevented the eventual progression of his penile cancer and further metastatic disease.\n\n【14】We hypothesize that early diagnosis of HPV and HIV infections in patients can have a marked benefit for public health as well. With earlier identification and Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Therapy(HAART)，HIV transmission will likely decrease. A case report written by Konan et al. acknowledges a link between HIV and penile cancer and suggests that a diagnosis of HIV may worsen the prognosis of the disease. Additionally， Konan recommends screening HIV+ patients for penile cancer so that tumors can be discovered in earlier stages. Patients would therefore be more likely to be treated conservatively. As for HPV， there is evidence to suggest that good clinical suspicion to screen for the virus in sexually active patients may reduce the risk of subsequent oropharyngeal cancers in the public . Hence， it may be extrapolated that early diagnosis of these viruses may prevent their transmission and subsequent complications in the community.\n\n【15】Despite the plethora of information on the internet， there is still not enough consistent information to educate developing nations on the infectious disease management ofpenile cancer. For example， the EUA never recommends screening for HPV/HIV in penile cancer patients and the American Urologic Association has no specific guidelines for penile cancer whatsoever. Consequently， Teh et al. was right to describe finding consistent information on penile cancer as a “needle in the haystack\". Additionally， they state that there seems to be a discrepancy in the quality of websites in differing languages， with significantly lesser quality available in the developing world. With all of the inconsistencies in literature， the severity of our patient's case could have been prevented by access to clear， concise STD recommendations.\n\n【16】Necessarily，wecallforspecific，evidenced-basedrecommendations for STD testing for penile cancer diagnosis. A clear consensus would address the discrepancies and current confusion across resources.For our future patients and the entire medical community， we seek more thorough guidelines in regards to testing for HIV and HPV upon a diagnosis of penile cancer.\n\n【17】Conclusion\n\n【18】The association between penile cancer， HPV， and HIV has been well established. However， in the developing world， it is not always common practice to properly screen for STDs upon a diagnosis of penile cancer. Prompt screening of these patients can lead to earlier treatment， better outcomes， increased public health awareness， and potential for more cost effective care. Thus， screening for sexually transmitted diseases should be the standard of care in anyone diagnosed with penile cancer.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 11:39:31", "endTime": "2024/09/24 11:39:37", "cost": 5.932}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:32", "update_time": "2024-09-23 19:39:38", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 19:39:31"}

The type of papers was case series and case report in respectively 8 and 9 studies. Skin manifestations were reported in two studies including two HCW， in addition to our series of six HCW. Skin manifestations were：Chilblain like lesions (44.5%)， a generalized macular or maculopapular exanthem (32.1%)， a papulovesicular rash and chicken pox-like vesicles (11.5%)， painful acral red-purple papules (4.6%)， urticaria (2.8%)， purpuric or petechial lesions (2.3%) and livedo reticularis lesions (0.45%).

Thus， heightened awareness and timely recognition of cutaneous manifestations in COVID-19 are important for occupational physicians treating HCW with COVID-19.\n\n【7】Keywords： Cutaneous manifestations； Healthcare workers； COVID-19\n\n【8】Introduction\n\n【9】COVID-19 infection initially reported in Wuhan， China  has been spread all over the world. As of July 7uh， 2021， COVID-19 has been diagnosed in more than 184 million people worldwide. Its rapid spread across geographical borders leading to a pandemic can be explained by several factors such as the high rate of infectivity and transmission from asymptomatic persons . The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the COVID-19 outbreak as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. COVID-19 pandemic still represents a great challenge for Healthcare Workers (HCW) around the world .\n\n【10】Healthcare workers are first-line fighters against COVID-19. They may experience symptoms ranging from influenza-like illness to life-threatening respiratory distress . Apart from pulmonary involvement， it is interesting to note that multiple extra pulmonary manifestations have been reported in patients with COVID-19 including skin manifestations. Common clinical features of COVID-19 are increasingly known but cutaneous manifestations associated with this infection are rarely described. A review of cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19 especially among Health Care Workers (HCW) is thus required.\n\n【11】The aim of our current study was to provide a comprehensive review of cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19 among HCW through six case reports and a literature review.\n\n【12】Methods\n\n【13】We conducted a literature search for cases reports， original and review articles published from the beginning of the COVID-19pandemic until January 2021 using PubMed and the Google search engines. In our study， we used these key search words \"cutaneous\"“skin\"， and1 \"dermatology\" in combination with \"coronavirus\"，\"COVID-19\"and\"SARS-CoV-2\". A manual search of reference lists of some relevant articles was performed. We excluded the studies that did not mention skin lesions.\n\n【14】We extracted the socio-demographic and clinical data from the included studies. Socio-demographic data were mainly the number of cases， age， gender and status for COVID-19. The clinical data were mainly the description of the cutaneous lesions， its location， onset and healing time and associated signs. The occupation was extracted from these studies when mentioned. In addition to the review， 6 cases were collected among the HCW working at the Charles Nicolle Hospital of Tunis from September 2020 to January 2021.\n\n【15】Results\n\n【16】Case presentation\n\n【17】Case 1： A 45-year-old nurse with a history of spontaneous pneumothorax， with no previous medication， or previous adverse drug reactions， presented to the occupational medicine department with a fever， a productive cough， asthenia， and body ache with no suspicious contact of COVID-19. The COVID-19 infection was confirmed by a positive RT-PCR on November 05h， 2020. Anosmia， headaches， and dizziness occurred between day 2 and day 13 of the infection. The patient was treated with antibiotics based on azithromycin and a third-generation cephalosporin， combined with vitamins and preventive heparin therapy. The clinical course was marked by the appearance at day 10 of an erythematous and pruritic cutaneous rash on the trunk and limbs with buccal ulcers without fever or signs of hemorrhages of the mucous membranes . Clinical improvement ofthe rash was noted after taking corticosteroid injections for 5 days. The nurse returned to work after 25 days of the infection with a dry sequela cough.\n\n【18】Case 2： A 44-year-old physiotherapist with a history of high blood pressure， paracetamol-drugged hepatitis， and an operated thyroid nodule， tested positive to COVID-19 on October 7ih， 2020with symptoms of ageusia， anosmia， and fever. She was treated with vitamin therapy and antibiotics based on azithromycin. Diarrhea and dizziness appeared respectively at day 2 and day 6 of the clinical evolution. She returned to work on October 20\"h with only hyposmia. One month later， on November 25h， the patient reconsulted for an erythematous and pruritic herpetiform rash on the limbs and the abdomen without fever or other associated signs nor medication use . A progressive and spontaneous improvement of the cutaneous lesions appeared after one week.\n\n【19】Case 3： A 57-year-old midwife with a history of hypertension was tested COVID-19 positive on September 25h， 2020， a sample indicated for body aches， asthenia and headaches with a suspicious contact. She was treated with vitamin therapy for 10 days， combined with azithromycin for 06 days. She received preventive heparin therapy for 4 days. On day 13 of the infection， the patient reported cutaneous lesions.\n\n【20】These lesions were objectified at the return-to-work medical examination. There was none necrotic purpura (1 cm to 2 cm) on the legs and lower back， with no mucous lesions or fever. There were recurrent attacks that spontaneously resolved after 5 to 7 days. The patient was referred for further explorations. Skin biopsy showed a \"necrotizing neutrophilic leukocytoclastic vasculitis\" . Blood tests were normal and immunological tests were requested. The patient was not put under corticoid or immunosuppressive treatment. The clinical evolution was marked by remission of cutaneous manifestations observed about two months after the onset of the disease around December 5h， 2020.\n\n【21】Case 4： A 32-year-old neonatology technician with no notable history presented on October the 64， 2020 with fever， cough， shortness of breath and body aches. The nasopharyngeal swab confirmed COVID-19 infection on October 7h. The patient was put under azithromycin for 9 days combined with a third-generation cephalosporin and vitamin therapy. On October the 16h， 10 days after， the patient reported the appearance of cutaneous lesions， which were confirmed at the return-to-work medical examination on October 204. There was a pruritic rash on the lower limbs and the elbows， which improved after five days of antihistaminic treatment.\n\n【22】Case 5： A 33-year-old doctor， with no notable antecedents， was tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 on December the 9h， 2020， by a nasopharyngeal swab indicated for suggestive symptomatology of fever with anosmia and contact with a positive case. The clinical evolution was favorable under medical treatment. On December23m， 15 days after the infection， the patient reported a spontaneous cutaneous lesion on the left forearm with no fever， which was objectified at the medical check-up on December 25h. It was a well-limited superficial ecchymotic plaque of 07 cm long on the anterior face of the lower third of the left forearm which has spontaneously regressed after one week .\n\n【23】Case 6： A 50-year-old medical secretary， with no notable antecedents， was tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 on January the 18h， 2021 by a nasopharyngeal swab indicated for suggestive symptomatology of fever， cough， and odynophagia with no suspicious contact with a positive case. The clinical evolution was favorable under medical treatment. On January 23m， 8 days after the onset， the patient presented with spontaneous pruritic maculopustular eruption on the chin， neck and upper chest with lower back pain without fever. Cutaneous lesions have spontaneously regressed after one week.\n\n【24】Review of literature： Seventeen articles were selected for this review. There are 8 case series ， and 9 case reports . The mean age was 49.8 years . The gender was not reported in 17.9% of cases. In the other cases that mentioned the gender， sex ratio was 1.15.\n\n【25】COVID-19 infection was confirmed in 90.8% of cases. Skin manifestations among HCW were reported in two studies including two physicians ， in addition to our series of six HCW.\n\n【26】Table 1 summarizes the characteristics and cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19 cases published in scientific literature in addition to our case series.\n\n【27】Skin manifestations were： Chilblain like lesions (44.5%)， a generalized macular or maculopapular exanthem (32.1%)， a papulovesicular rash and chicken pox-like vesicles (11.5%)， painful acral red-purple papules (4.6%)， urticaria (2.8%)， purpuric or petechial lesions (2.3%) and livedo reticularis lesions (0.45%). Of the 218 cases， 203 cases have reported the location. The very great majority of lesions were found on the trunk， hands and feet. Fifty-one patient (23.4%) experienced lesions on the trunk. The time of onset of cutaneous lesions in relation to the onset of symptoms was variable. At the diagnosis or the onset of COVID-19 symptoms， 8.3%(18/218) of patients presented with cutaneous lesions. After the onset of respiratory symptoms or COVID-19 diagnosis， 36.7% (80/218) of patients presented with cutaneous lesions. The timeline of the appearance of the skin lesions was not mentioned in 55% of cases. Healing times were up to 24 days in 197 cases.\n\n【28】The severity of cutaneous lesions was not correlated with COVID-19 severity in 99% of cases. Only two studies by Mahe  and Estebanez  reported on the possible association between skin lesion severity and COVID-19 in 2 patients. Overall， histological findings were not reported. In our series， we have histological findings that may be related to the COVID infection in one patient.\n\n| Author.PublicationYear  | Region1  | Patientswith SkinSigns (n)  | Age，Genrer.

as compared to the common clinical features such as shortness ofbreath， cough and grippal syndrome . In our study， we summarized the characteristics of cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19 cases published in scientific literature in addition to our case series . We wished to characterize these manifestations， particularly among HCW for further diagnostic and prognostic value because cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19 have been increasingly reported worldwide. Skin manifestations were reported in 8 case reports and 9 case series.\n\n【33】In this review， 44.5% (97/218) of patients presented with chilblain-like lesions. In a previous review by Tan et al. ， the most common COVID-19 skin manifestations in the USA and Europe were the chilblain-like lesions. There was only 1 case reported in Asia. Rash containing macules and papules was the second cutaneous manifestation of COVID-19. However， rashes containing macules and papules were not specific to COVID-19， and there were reports of misdiagnosed cases of COVID-19 in patients with rash containing macules and papules .\n\n【34】In the study by Recalcati et al. ， 20.4%(18/88) of COVID-19patients had developed skin manifestations. These manifestations were： erythematous rash (77.8%)， urticaria (16.7%) and vesicle formation (5.6%). These findings are nearly similar to our results.\n\n【35】Skin manifestations may aid in timely diagnosis of the COVID-19infection even in the asymptomatic cases with no respiratory or common symptoms. We found that at the onset of the infection， 8.3%(18/218) of patients presented with cutaneous lesions.\n\n【36】In order to prevent the misdiagnosis of the COVID-19 signs， doctors'awareness of the skin lesions related to COVID-19 infection must be raised . Furthermore， skin lesions may have several outcomes on the professional quality of life of HCW. Having new manifestations of the COVID-19 infection can lead to frequent consultations seeking care and treatment so that frequent absenteeism. Also， HCW may wonder if they could be assisted with compensation of their skin lesions as sequella of the COVID-19occupational disease.\n\n【37】Visible skin lesions present on exposed body parts may induce fear， disgust， aversion， or even intolerance . Furthermore， some people with limited awareness of skin lesions after COVID-19infection believe that the disease still contagious， which mayeventually contribute to the social isolation of persons with skin lesions. HCW with skin lesions may be subject to segregation and stigmatization， especially if the lesions are visible on the face and exposed bodyareas.\n\n【38】Polymorphous cutaneous manifestations could reflect diverse interactions with the skin such as direct viral action in infected cells， hypercoagulability and immune system hyperactivity . The mechanisms of COVID-19 cutaneous lesions are not yet well known. Some studies have linked the cutaneous symptoms to a primary infection of the skin itself. In other theories， skin disturbances are seen as a secondary consequence after the respiratory infection. Suchonwanit et al. reported that the late-onset of lesions may be related mainly to thrombotic vasculopathy and vasculitis . Moreover， Litaiem et al. reported a case in Tunisia of a 39 year-old female patient diagnosed with COVID-19 infection， and 18 days after hydroxychloroquine (600 mg daily) initiation she developed a cephalocaudal spread of erythematous and pustular plaques. The Acute Generalized Exanthematous Pustulosis (AGEP) was diagnosed. Skin lesions were significantly improving after hydroxychloroquine withdrawal. They hypothesize that pustular eruptions occurring in COVID-19 patients are more likely to support drug-related origin . Gianotti et al. described the histopathology of skin COVID-19lesions with a spectrum of findings that ranged from mild spongiosis of the epithelial layer to the important situation of vasculitis and extravasation of red blood cells . The scientific understanding of cutaneous manifestations in patients with COVID-19 is still evolving.\n\n【39】We believe that this work is the first study describing cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19 among HCW. However， several limitations must be considered. Due to evolving literature and language-related exclusion criteria， this paper only examines 218cases. The inclusion of our cases was limited because of the low declaration by the patients and the quarantine restrictions. Moreover， publication bias was encountered. Drug side effects not mentioned in most of the studies must be taken into account. Also， occupation was not mentioned in several cases.\n\n【40】Further studies are still required to understand the mechanism and the link between skin lesions and COVID-19.So that prospective studies based on clinical and histological confrontations are needed.\n\n【41】Conclusion\n\n【42】In summary， COVID-19 has been associated with different cutaneous manifestations， likely of varying pathophysiology and severity， some preceding COVID-19 symptomatology and others occurring during active disease or later in the course. Given the evolving state of evidence， occupationalphysicians should be aware of the variety of skin manifestations related to COVID-19among Health care workers. Thus， heightened awareness and timely recognition of dermatologic findings in COVID-19 are important for occupational physicians treating HCW with COVID-19. Further studies are still required to understand the mechanism and the link between skin lesions and COVID-19. So that prospective studies based on clinical and histological confrontations are needed.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 11:35:13", "endTime": "2024/09/24 11:35:54", "cost": 40.803}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:32", "update_time": "2024-09-23 19:35:54", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 19:35:13"}

We also provide a review of the literature to identify the importance of CAPS for clinicians to be aware of this syndrome when the patient is not known to have antiphospholipid syndrome.\n\n【2】Keywords： Catastrophicantiphospholipidsyndrome； Antiphospholipid syndrome； Hypercoagulable state； Ulcerative colitis\n\n【3】Abbreviations\n\n【4】Ab2GLP1： Anti-b2 Glycoprotein1； Ab： Antibody； AKI： Acute Kidney Injury； ANA： Antinuclear Antibody； ANCA： Antineutrophil Cytoplasmic Antibody； aPL： Antiphospholipid Antibodies； APS： Antiphospholipid Syndrome； BP： Blood Pressure； CAPS： Catastrophic Antiphospholipid Syndrome； CFA： Common Femoral Artery； CVA： Cerebrovascular Accident； DIC： Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation； DM： diabetes Mellites； GCS： Glasgow Coma Scale； HDL： High Density Lipoprotein； HIT： Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia； HR： Heart Rate； HTN： Hypertension； IBD： Inflammatory Bowel Disease； ICU： Intensive Care Unit； Ig： Immunoglobulin； IMA： Inferior Mesenteric Artery； LDL： Low Density Lipoprotein； LMWH： Low Molecular Weight Heparin； PCEA：Patient Controlled Epidural Analgesia；POD： Postoperative day； PTT： Partial Thromboplastin Time； SFA： Superficial Femoral Artery； SLE： Systemic Lupus Erythematosus； SMA： Superior Mesenteric Artery； TG： Triglyceride； tPA： tissue Plasminogen Activator； TTE： Transthoracic Echocardiography\n\n【5】Introduction\n\n【6】Failure of multiple organs within a week's period in patients who have antiphospholipid antibodies presents a disastrous situation to surgeons . This phenomenon was named“catastrophic”antiphospholipid syndrome “CAPS” by Asheron， thus the other name “Asheron Syndrome”. The CAPS Registry is an international registry for patients who develop catastrophic APS； it was generated by the European Forum on aPL in the year 2000. Analysis of the registry showed that the predisposing factor was primary APS in 46% of patients， SLE in 40%，lupus-like disease in 5%， and different autoimmune diseases in 9% . It is noteworthy to state that 46% of CAPS patients may present de novo without any event of previous thrombosis. However， 53% had precipitating factors . Thankfully， as little as 1% of the patients with anti-phospholipid antibodies present with CAPS . There are manyidentified precipitating factors for the development of CAPS， these include： infections in 20%， operative procedures in 14%， malignancies in 9%， withdrawal of anticoagulation in 7%， complications of obstetrics in 5%， lupus flares in 4% and the use of oral contraceptive pills in 3% .\n\n【7】Case Presentation\n\n【8】A 52-year-old female patient presented to our hospital for an elective aortobifemoral bypass for Leriche syndrome. Her past medical history is significant for ulcerative colitis on mesalamine， HTN， DM， and CVA. On postoperative day 2 she developed“Catastrophic Antiphospholipid Syndrome”(CAPS) and passed away 10 days after the surgery.\n\n【9】Three months prior to presentation， she had presented to the hospital with a thrombotic stroke in her left middle cerebral artery. Thrombolysis with tPA was attempted and failed. Thrombectomy was performed 10 h after the beginning of her symptoms. During thrombectomy through the femoral approach， the wire failed to pass through her common femoral artery bilaterally but was successfully passed through her right brachial artery. Post-thrombectomy she was started on Enoxaparin 40 mg and Aspirin 100 mg daily.\n\n【10】It is worth stating that 11 days prior to her stroke， the patient presented with a 3-week history of diarrhea and was diagnosed with a flare up ofher ulcerative colitis and was thus started on Enoxaparin40 mg daily. Thus， our patient had her stroke despite being on prophylactic anticoagulation.\n\n【11】As the wire failed to pass through her femoral artery (bilaterally) during thrombectomy， CT angiography was performed2and demonstrated a complete occlusion of her infrarenal aorta， extending to the common iliac arteries consistent with Leriche syndrome. The inferior mesenteric artery was completely occluded. She had multiple splenic and bilateral renal infarcts. The colon had a tubular lead-pipe appearance . She had an irregular atheromatous plaque within the aortic arch .\n\n【12】Concerningthe hypercoagulability workup， the patient had a negative lipid profile， with HDL cholesterol of 32 mg/dl， LDL cholesterol of 24， and TG of 138. Negative ANA， C3， C4， Homocysteine， Protein C， Protein S， Procalcitonin， Antithrombic activity， Factor VIII， p-ANCA and c-ANCA. She also had negative Cardiolipin Ab IgG and IgM， Phospholipid Ab IgG and IgM. Her Lupus anticoagulant was positive， but she was on Enoxaparin， thus it was interpreted as a false positive result， especially with the negative cardiolipin Ab.\n\n【13】She had a Fecal calprotectin of >2100 (high quantity >200micrograms/g). Ten days after her stroke， she was discharged with right sided hemiplegia and aphasia on Aspirin and Rivaroxaban.\n\n【14】Three months following her CVA， the patient was admitted for an aortobifemoral bypass. Preoperatively， she was switched from Rivaroxabanto enoxaparin. She had Patient Controlled Epidural Anesthesia (PCEA) inserted directly preoperatively for postoperative pain control. Intraoperatively， the right external iliac artery was atherosclerotic. 5000 Units of unfractionated heparin were injected intravenously before clamping of the aorta. An anastomosis was performed between Dacron graft and the aorta， then between the graft and both femoral arteries. At the end of the procedure a positive right and left Common Femoral Artery (CFA) pulse was felt.\n\n【15】Postoperatively， ultrasound showed flow in the SFA and profound a bilaterally. In the ICU， the patient developed altered mental status with worsening ofher aphasia. Brain MRI did not show new changes. Enoxaparin was started 40 mg SC BID 5 h post-operatively. Her post-operative course was complicated by acute occlusion of her aortobifemoral bypass on post-operative day 1. Subsequently， a bilateral embolectomy was performed using Fogarty catheter . The patient was then started on unfractionated Heparin IVSP25000 IU /24h monitored by PTT level.\n\n【16】Post-embolectomy， the patient developed d rhabdomyolysis complicated by AKI， she also had hypotension unresponsive to IV fluids and became tachypneic but was not able to compensate for her metabolic acidosis. She was intubated， started on norepinephrine and antibiotics and on day 3 post-operatively she was started on hemodialysis. Methylprednisolone 100 cc once was given due to a possible component of adrenal insufficiency and was continued at a rate of 50 cc q 6 h. The skin on her right thigh also showed livedo reticularis， but these were not confirmed by biopsy due to financial reasons. She developed thrombocytopenia with a platelet count reaching 49 000/mm. Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT) and Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC) were ruled out as she had a D-dimer of 3.06 and a fibrinogen level of 354. Her mental status was disturbed as she was intubated， off sedation， with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of3. Brain CT did not show any changes.\n\n【17】CT angiography showed acute mesenteric ischemia involving the small bowel secondary to a proximal SMA thrombus ， multiple scattered hepatic infarcts， occlusion of both renal arteries distally  with increase of the bilateral renal infarcts. Bilateral lower lobar arterial pulmonary emboli . Her Beta 2 Glycoprotein Abs IgM and IgG were positive， Lupus anticoagulant and Anticardiolipin IgG and IgM were negative. She was continued on methylprednisolone 50 mgq6 h and therapeutic range unfractionated heparin monitored by Anti-factor X a assay. Due to her poor prognosis， her family changed the authorization to comfort care only. She deteriorated and passed away 10 days post-operatively.\n\n【18】Discussion\n\n【19】Asheron et al. proposed criteria for diagnosing CAPS. Certain features were common between these patients： Multiple organs (>2) involved， many small vessels obstruction found histologically and the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies on serology  .\n\n【20】These were later validated in the year 2005 by Cervara et al. who found that they are 90.3% sensitive and 99.4% specific .\n\n【21】It is of utmost importance to have the diagnosis early； but， due to multiple reasons， it is challenging. Aside from the fact that CAPS is a rare disease， it might not be thought of in patients without a known APS. Even if considered， not all diagnostic criteria may be met； especially in the acute setting .\n\n【22】Regarding management of patients with CAPS，early initiation of treatment， within 8 hours of diagnosis， was considered of extreme importance. The first and most important treatment for such patients is therapeutic level anticoagulation . Steroids， anticoagulants and plasma exchange combined provided the highest recovery rate .\n\n【23】We present a case of a 52-year-old female， with no previous pregnancy attempts， not known to have APS who was operated on and died after developing probable CAPS. Yet， she is known to have ulcerative colitis. The aim of this case report is to emphasize the importance of identifying CAPS as a differential diagnosis for patients who develop thrombocytopenia with no DIC nor HIT； but， with multiple organ damage and are not known to have APS nor SLE. This is of utmost importance as rapid treatment may save the life of the patient.\n\n【24】We also aim to emphasize the probability of CAPS in the large population of patients with IBD and increase the level of suspicion for CAPS in surgical patients. There is evolving evidence that the pathogenesis of formation of both arterial and venous thrombosis involves antiphospholipid antibodies . In fact， in a studyconducted by Kraiem et al. ， titled antiphospholipid antibodies and procoagulant profile in Tunisians with IBD， the authors concluded that the antiphospholipid auto antibodies， mostly IgA ab2GPI antibodies， were very often found in Tunisian patients with IBD. They suggested more prospective studies be conducted to learn about this marker's exact function and clinical relevance .\n\n【25】A case report published by Stammler et al. ， further supported recommendations that anti- vitamin K medication is the anticoagulant of choice in patients who have all three positive antiphospholipid antibodies . Our patient， who had only 2 of the three antibodies positive， was on Enoxaparin 40 mg daily before she had her stroke. She had her stoke， despite being on enoxaparin which was prescribed to her due to an ulcerative colitis disease flare up. Postoperatively our patient developed CAPS triggered by the surgery.\n\n【26】Importantly， in preparation for her postoperative pain， a PCEA was placed preoperatively. On POD 4， while the patient was on therapeutic anticoagulation， removal of the PCEA was problematic， as it would requires interruption of the anticoagulation due to fear of an epidural hematoma. This is an area of controversy， and further studies are required for identifying patients who are not fit for epidural pain control due to their hypercoagulable state that might require uninterrupted therapeutic anticoagulation post operatively. Patients with hypercoagulable state could be identified as being a relative contraindication for placement of apreoperative PCEA.\n\n【27】In conclusion， we encountered a case of probable CAPS in a patient not known to have antiphospholipid syndrome but known to have ulcerative colitis. It was a dramatic experience to have a patient develops such a chaotic sequence of events. Despite its rarity， CAPS should be kept in mind as one of the differentials in a patient with known ulcerative colitis who develops thrombocytopenia with multi-organ dysfunction following surgery. The early diagnosis of the disease with early management with uninterrupted therapeutic anticoagulation and steroids could save the life of the patient. Further studies are required for finding the incidence of developing CAPS in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.\n\n【28】Placement of a PCEA is an area of controversy that requires further studying. Surgeons must always keep in mind that surgery acts as a trigger for developing a hypercoagulable state leading to CAPs.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 10:26:27", "endTime": "2024/09/24 10:26:52", "cost": 24.987}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:32", "update_time": "2024-09-23 18:26:50", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 18:26:25"}

Ackerman described it for the first time in the Otorhinolaryngology field in 1948 . Verrucous carcinoma occurs most frequently in the nasal cavity， esophagus， vulva， vagina， anorectal region， penis， and skin. It is very rare in the urinary tract . Very few cases of verrucous carcinoma have been reported in the bladder， mainly related to schistosomiasis infection. Renal verrucous carcinoma was first reported in a horseshoe kidney by Sheaff in 1996 . To our knowledge， only six cases of verrucous carcinoma of the renal pelvis have been published previously； all of them were treated by radical nephrectomy or even nephroureterectomy. In contrast， this case presents the first verrucous carcinoma in a renal calyceal diverticulum. Moreover， it was successfully treated by nephron-sparing surgery for the first time.\n\n【2】Case Presentation\n\n【3】A 60-year-old man with a clinical history of renal lithiasis was referred to our consultation of lithiasis due to small calculus located in the left kidney . He was operated on for small calculilocated in the lower calyceal diverticulum of the left kidney via Retrograde Intrarenal Surgery(RIRS) and micro-percutaneous (PNL). During the surgery， the calyceal diverticulum was accessed and multiple small calculi (2 mm to 3 mm) were removed. Methylene blue showed the existence of communication between the renal pelvis and the diverticulum， but direct endoscopic visualization was not possible. During the follow-up， a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan was performed. A well-defined cystic lesion measuring 4.2 cm x 6 cm x 4.6 cm was observed in the posterior valve. The cystic lesion was mainly intrarenal with small eccentric growth. The MRI report described that the lesion could be a complicated calyceal diverticulum， without ruling out the coexistence of urothelioma or squamous tumor. After all， surgical resection of the lesion was decided. Through a subcostal incision， the left kidney was freed from the upper pole to the lower pole. The cystic tumor was identified at the posterior valve of the interpolar region. The lesion was removed without ischemia time. During the surgery， an opening of the diverticulum to the urinary tract was identified. The opening appeared to be a tubular structure communicating with the lesion with abundant cesium material coming out. The urinary tract was successfully closed. The patient had a favorable evolution at the hospital， presenting febrile peaks with negative cultures during the immediate postoperative period. He was discharged on the fifth postoperative day after a full course of antibiotics was completed.\n\n【4】Thepathological study confirmed the existence ofan exo-endophytic，acantholytic，papillomatous neoplasm composed of keratinizing squamous epithelium with mild atypia and expansive growth. The tumor focally invaded the medullary renal parenchyma in the form of small nests with increased cellular atypia and keratinization. The pelvic-calyceal epithelium was completely replaced. The renal parenchyma adjacent to the tumor shows signs of atrophy. The pathological diagnosis was a verrucous carcinoma with a focus on well-differentiated infiltrating squamous cell carcinoma. The margins were free of tumor.\n\n【5】Since the date of surgery， the patient has been followed up with imaging tests. A new Computed Tomography (CT) scan was performed every 3 months for the first 12 months. Then， a CT scan was done every 6 months and finally， an annual CT scan is being performed free of tumor recurrence in the last 5 years . Adjuvant treatment has not been required.\n\n【6】Discussion\n\n【7】Verrucous carcinoma is a very rare subtype of squamous cell carcinoma. It is used to designate a specific histological appearance of well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma . It also shows extensive keratinization with exophytic or papillomatous extension into the stroma and the absence of significant cellular atypia . Verrucous carcinoma occurs most frequently in the nasal cavity， esophagus， vulva， vagina， anorectal region， penis， and skin. It is very unusual in the urinary tract . Some risk factors include urinary tract infections， especially bilharziasis， or chronic inflammation， due to urinary lithiasis in 40% to 80% of cases； other factors include tobacco， coffee， phenacetin， and organic solvents . All this leads to chronic irritation that causes squamous metaplasia which may eventually progress to carcinoma . The average age of onset of verrucous carcinoma in urinary tract is about fifty-six years old； there is no predominance of men， unlike transitional cell carcinomas. The clinical symptomatology is non-specific， patients mainly present with hematuria and occasionally lumbar pain . Verrucous carcinoma has a good prognosis because of its characterization of local infiltration with a slight tendency to metastasize to regional lymph nodes or distant sites， unlike epidermoid carcinoma . A few cases of verrucous carcinoma have been reported in the bladder related to schistosomiasis infection， but only six cases are described in the kidney . Due to verrucous carcinoma may present extensive adjacent squamous metaplasia and coexistence with the squamous variant of carcinoma， a radical treatment was performed in previously reported cases .\n\n【8】To our knowledge， only six cases of verrucous carcinoma of the renalpelvis have been previously reported in the literature. In all these six cases， lithiasis may have been the cause of chronic inflammation. The average age at diagnosis has been fifty-five years old. Reviewing the cases reported in the literature about verrucous carcinoma in the renal pelvis previously， a higher prevalence in men than women can be found. None of the patients with verrucous carcinoma presented urinary tract anomalies， apart from the first patient who had horseshoe kidney . In addition， in all cases published so far in the literature， the tumor was located in the renal pelvis  and only one case in pelvis and ureter . The present case is the first one where a verrucous carcinoma was detected in a renal diverticulum. Moreover， the present case is the first one to be successfully treated with nephron-sparing surgery. All previously reported cases of verrucous carcinoma were treated by radical nephrectomy or even nephroureterectomy .\n\n【9】Table 1： Patients with verrucous carcinoma of the renal.\n\n|  | Age  | Sex  | Anomaly in tract urinary  | Location of lesion  | Treatment received  | Outcome  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Sheaff et al.   | 41  | M  | + (horseshoe kidney)  | Renal pelvis  | Heminephrectomy  | 6 months， NED  |\n| Sellami-Boudawara et al.  | 61  | M  |  | Renal pelvis  | Radical nephrectomy  | 5 years， NED  |\n| Sellami-Boudawara et al.   | 56  | M  |  | Renal pelvis  | Nephroureterectomy  | Died  |\n| Kansal et al.   | 64  | F  |  | Renal pelvis  | Radical nephrectomy  | 2 years， NED  |\n| Basekioglu et al.   | 56  | M  |  | Renal pelvis  | Radical nephrectomy+RT+CT  | 3 years， Died  |\n| Hung WH et al.  | 53  | M  |  | Renal pelvis and ureter  | Nephroureterectomy +RT  | 3 months， NED  |\n| Present case  | 60  | M  |  | Calyceal diverticulum  | Partial nephrectomy  | 5 years， NED  |\n\n【11】Partial nephrectomy surgery was revealed to be as effective as radical nephrectomy in patients with verrucous carcinoma without poor prognostic data (such as usual epidermoid carcinoma， poorly differentiated tumor， and affected surgical margins). In the cases of the previous studies where the patient died， positive surgical margins or poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma were present. These two features were related to the aggressiveness of the tumor. In spite of a radical nephrectomy being performed， both patients died of metastatic disease in the next few days after surgery . None of the remaining cases presented any evidence of poor tumor prognosis， and a simple nephrectomy was performed successfully . The present study is included in this second group， where characteristics of poor tumor prognosis were notpresent. It shows that a partial nephrectomy can be performed rather than a radical nephrectomy if there is no evidence of verrucous carcinoma aggressiveness characteristics.\n\n【12】In summary， the present case is the first report of verrucous carcinoma located in a calyceal diverticulum. It is also the first report of nephron-sparing surgery performed on a patient with verrucous carcinoma with no poor prognostic factors. The patient has been free of disease for 5 years. However，there is not enough evidence to affirm that a nephron-sparing surgery treatment can be done in patients with verrucous carcinoma and the absence of poor prognosis factors instead of radical nephrectomy. More experience is needed to affirm that.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 11:24:54", "endTime": "2024/09/24 11:25:32", "cost": 38.486}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:32", "update_time": "2024-09-23 19:25:32", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 19:24:53"}

Incorrect kinase signaling causes cancer， developmental， and metabolic problems. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors are effective in cancer treatment and growth. Drug development is hampered by TKI-induced drug resistance. Understanding how TKs cause sickness and drugs to stop working will boost TKI research. Protein kinases regulate complicated bioprocesses. This involves cell growth， cell death， and cell division. 2% of human genes encode 518 kinases. 90 tyrosine kinases . Since the discovery of v-Src as a protein kinase in 1978， it has been recognized that dysregulated kinase signaling is at the root of many human disorders， including cancers， developmental， and metabolic issues. Since v-identification， Src's been a protein kinase. Protein kinase inhibitors are sought for medical use. Imatinib， a tyrosine kinase ABL inhibitor， was developed to treat CML in 2001. When the BCL-ABL mutation causing CML was found， Imatinib was produced (CML). This therapeutic technique targets mutations that induce oncogene production to stop tumor growth. Clinical trials found many more tyrosine kinase inhibitors beneficial. Sorafenib ， Sunitinib ， Pazopanib ， and Axitinib  all go after mutant EGFRs in NSCLC (NSCLC).\n\n【1】This targeted treatment responds well. Drug resistance reduces response duration. Clinical cancer genome sequencing reveals medication resistance genes. Intrinsic drug resistance alters the drug's target； extrinsic resistance avoids its effects (compensatory signaling through other pathways and pharmacokinetic factors that primarily reduce drug concentration in targeted cells). Amplification， overexpression， epigenetic activation， and missense mutations may render kinase inhibitors ineffective. Mismatch mutations induce intrinsic resistance . Medication therapy induces clonal growth of treatment-resistant cancer cells . Proteins involved in drug interactions or kinase activation often have drug-resistant point mutations. These alterations reduce the drug's binding affinity but don't affect the ATP substrate's interaction with the targeted kinase. Different drug-resistant kinases have similar hotspots.\" drug-resistant Commonly， gatekeepers mutate.ABLT315I is associated with CML， PDGFRT674I/M with hypereosinophilic syndrome， EGFRT790M with NSCLC， KITT670I with gastrointestinal stromal tumors， and ALKL1196M with NSCLC. ATP binding affinity， catalytic power， and conformational change are increased by most gatekeeper mutations. Mutant Gatekeeper resistance needs dormant kinases. This compensates for the increased energy required to switch from the disease-driven active to inactive conformation if the inhibitor targets the inactive conformation. increasing molecular weight， lipophilicity， and drug-like characteristics. New chemical entities should target mutant kinase activity.\n\n【2】Dasatinib ， nilotinib ， bosutinib ， and ponatinib  are strong ABL kinase inhibitors. Wild-type and mutant ABL kinases are inhibited. Imatinib， nilotinib， and ponatinib support ABL kinase. Trifluoromethyl improves nilotinib's effectiveness against native and mutant ABLs， except ABLT315I. Ponatinib is the only ABL inhibitor that works against ABLT315I. It substitutes the pyrimidinylamino linker with an acetylene group， which enhances interaction with I315. Dasatinib and nilotinib occupy space near the gatekeeper region， so they may alter the ABLT315I mutant's active conformation， lowering its blocking ability. Active conformation ABL inhibitors may help CML patients who relapse after TKI treatment.\n\n【3】Imatinib and second- and third-generation ABL inhibitors pave the path for targeted kinase inhibitors and TKI resistance treatment. In 2011， crizotinib (PF-02341066) was authorized for late-stage NSCLC patients with the EML4-ALK fusion gene. Crizotinib-treated patients develop treatment resistance， similar to imatinib-treated individuals. ALK gene amplification， secondary mutations like EML4-ALKL1196M， and c-KIT/EGFR activation are resistance mechanisms . ALK inhibitors are beneficial for crizotinib-naive and -refractory ALK+ NSCLC patients (NSCLC).\n\n【4】LDK378 and alectinib inhibit natural and mutant ALKproteins better than crizotinib，approved in 2011. ALK inhibitors include crizotinib， LDK378 and alectinib. These ALK inhibitors interact variably with the ALK gatekeeper region， causing varying L1196M sensitivity. LDK378is 3 to 6 times more potent than crizotinib. Crizotinib-relapsed ALK-positive patients showed a 60% response rate and an 8.5-month median PFS. Imatinib and crizotinib are low-cellular-activity kinase inhibitors. In refractory patients， second-generation inhibitors are virtually as effective as the first. Sequential therapy involves following a less effective kinase inhibitor with a second-generation， broad-spectrum inhibitor.\n\n【5】Next-generation EGFR inhibitors for NSCLC patients resistant to gefitinib or erlotinib capture disease-driven kinase conformation. Even though afatinib suppresses EGFR by covalently attaching to the ATP binding site， the drug-resistant T790M mutant favors the active conformation. Like ATP， Afatinib inhibits EGFR. Afatinib cannot connect to T790M mutant EGFR because it is in the incorrect conformation. AZD-9291 and CO-1686 use a pyrimidine scaffold to reduce gatekeeper-related structural features while increasing G-loop interactions. In phase I studies for EGFR TKI-resistant patients， both AZD-9291 and CO-1686 were effective.\n\n【6】Reversible EGFR inhibitors that target EGFRT790M will help EGFR TKI-refractorypatients. Protein kinases are cancer treatments. Protein kinase inhibitors comprise 50% of cancer drug research . One or a few TKs seem crucial to the development of many cancers. Mutant TK-targeting TKIs should target cancer cells selectively and improve patient safety. Both the development oftargeted medications and the clinical treatment of advanced malignancies will face obstacles due to intratumor heterogeneity and tumor adaptability. TKIs and TKI combinations should have anti-tumor effects. As resistances molecular rrooiutes are recognized， new strategies are evolving. Inhibitors must target distinct kinase active site topographies to circumvent drug resistance. This effective protease design method may lead to chronic cancer therapy.\n\n【7】Cancer and other disorders include protein kinases. Lahiry et al.  showed that 50 kinases form 67 single-gene clinical entities， and half are TKs . Kinase gene mutations cause illness. Mutations induce neurologic，skeletal，craniosynostosis，hematological，vascular， immunological，endocrine， and metabolic disorders. Tofacitinib is the first TKI authorized for inflammatory disorders. Despite 30 kinase inhibitors reaching commercialization and hundreds in clinical research， structural variation and target coverage are restricted. If we knew how protein kinases work and how they malfunction in diseases， we may have discovered unmet medical needs. Current kinase inhibitors may be improved in structural diversity， selectivity， and toxicity. Non-oncology and combination cancer therapies need high-quality TKIs. Effective， selective， and safe TKIs need further structural biology and medicinal chemistry research.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 11:00:54", "endTime": "2024/09/24 11:01:36", "cost": 41.035}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:32", "update_time": "2024-09-23 19:01:35", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 19:00:54"}

Today it is known that strength training (TF) has benefits such as decreased fasting glycemia， glycated hemoglobin， stimulates translocation of GLUT4 in skeletal muscle， increases insulin sensitivity， restoring metabolic control. The objective of this research was to observe the glycemic responses of a type 1 diabetic who underwent strength training at different intensities.\n\n【2】Methods： A 26-year-old woman with type 1 Diabetes Mellitus participated in this research， with a trained diagnosis time of 22 (twenty-two)years. The volunteer participated in three non-consecutive days of intervention at the first visit. The evaluation was performed with a test of Maximum Repetition (1RM) in the following exercises： Bench press； Knee extension on the device； Peck Deck； Front high pulley with cable； Leg 45；Low row with triangle. On the second visit to the laboratory， the TF session was performed at 40% of 1RM. On the third visit， the session was performed at 80%of 1RM， capillary blood glucose was collected before， during and immediately after each strength training session.\n\n【3】Results： The results observed showed that the exercise of less intensity， at 40% of 1 RM， showed a greater drop in capillary glycemia during and immediately after the TF session.\n\n【4】Conclusion： Different intensities will result in different physiological responses. It is important to highlight the need for blood glucose monitoring before， during and after training.\n\n【5】Keywords： Type 1 Diabetes； Blood Glucose； Strength Training\n\n【6】Introduction\n\n【7】Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (DM1) is concentrated between 5% and 10% of the total number of people with diabetes. In most cases， DM1 arises as a result ofautoimmune destruction of pancreatic B cells causing complete deficiency in insulin production，being diagnosed more frequently in children， adolescents and young adults， equally affecting men and women， although its pathophysiology is not fully known. It is known that it is a polygenic disease， thus genetic and environmental factors trigger the autoimmune response .\n\n【8】The treatment of DM1 has historically followed the insulin/food/physical exercise triad. Currently， the triad should switch to insulin/diabetes monitoring/education， including education in nutrition， exercise and guidance for patients and their families .\n\n【9】Among the treatments， physical exercise offers different methods for controlling DM1， such as aerobic training， which is the most used， since strength training before 2005 was not suitable for DM1 . Today it is already known that strength training has benefits such as decreased fasting blood glucose， glycated hemoglobin， visceral fat， and body weight； stimulates GLUT4 translocation in skeletal muscle， increases insulin sensitivity and， consequently， restores metabolic control . Insulin injected by the DM1 carrier acts on the IRS-1 and IRS-2 receptors， promoting a cascade of intracellular signaling that results in the translocation of GLUT4 and the entry of glucose into the cell， physical exercise enhances the phosphorylation of IRS-2， which results in a greater PI3K activity causing an increase in Akt protein phosphorylation， which promotes an increase in the translocation of GLUT4 to the cell membrane， consequently greater glucose entry into the cell， decreasing circulating glycemic levels strength training also minimizes cardiac risks， increases muscle strength and is a good strategy to improve health， physical fitness and performance ， justifying its inclusion in the treatment ofDM1.\n\n【10】However， studies relating strength training in isolation and type1 diabetes are still scarce in the literature， in the same way studies that show the efficiency of different intensities under individuals with DM1 are a great gap in which little has been investigated. Comparing different intensities could clarify the benefits of strength training and provide support for practical applications and recommendations regarding the adequate and safe prescription of strength training for glycemic control in DM1， in addition， the little information on strength training related to DM1 demonstrates the need for further studies that address the topic， in order to elucidate the acute and chronic responses of DM1 through this training method . In this sense， the objective of this research was to observe the glycemic responses of a type 1 diabetic who underwent strength training at different intensities.\n\n【11】Materials and Methods\n\n【12】Participants\n\n【13】This research was characterized as a case study and is linked to the Project Doce Vida - Supervised Physical Exercise Program for Diabetics， held at the Higher School of Physical Education at the University of Pernambuco. Participated in this research a woman aged 26 (twenty-six) years with type 1 Diabetes Mellitus， with a diagnosis time of 22 (twenty-two) years. The participant is trained.\n\n【14】Instrumentation and data collection\n\n【15】The training was carried out at the Biodynamics Laboratory of the Higher School of Physical Education at the University ofPernambuco in the morning.\n\n【16】Capillary glycemia\n\n【17】Capillary blood glucose was collected before， during and immediately after each strength training. Capillary blood glucose was measured before and after each workout， always on the little or ring fingers， discarding the first drop of blood， the second drop being used . The glucometer， reagent strips，lancets and lancets used were from the Freestyle Optium Neo model from Abbott. The infectious material (gloves， lancets， tapes and paper towels) used for collection， was deposited in a specific box of hospital material.\n\n【18】Blood pressure\n\n【19】Blood pressure was measured before and after each strength training session， using the OMRON HEM 7113 digital automatic blood pressure monitor.\n\n【20】Initial evaluation and test of a maximum repeat (1RM)\n\n【21】The volunteer participated in three non-consecutive days of intervention. On the first visit to the Biodynamics Laboratory， the volunteer was familiarized with the training protocol. Soon afterwards， a test of Maximum Repetition (1RM) was performed in the following exercises： Bench press； Knee extension on the device； Peck Deck； Front high pulley with cable； Leg 45°； Low row with triangle . The equipment was made by New Fit.\n\n【22】Before starting the 1RM test， the volunteer warmed up， in each exercise， from 10 to 15 repetitions， with an equivalent load of 40%to 60% of the maximum perceived strength . Then， the load was increased to approximately， 60% to 80% of the maximum perceived force. After this warm-up， there was an interval of 2 min， while the load was increased to perform the 1RM test.\n\n【23】Experimental sessions\n\n【24】On the second visit to the laboratory， the strength training session was performed at 40% of 1RM. On the third day， the session was performed at 80% of 1RM. Each day of intervention aimed to assess the impact of a strength training session on glycemic control. Glycemic responses were analyzed before， during and immediately after each session.\n\n【25】Pre-intervention\n\n【26】Before each intervention， the volunteer remained seated in the laboratory for a period of 10 min， in a quiet room without noise interference and with a temperature between 23·C to 24C.\n\n【27】Intervention\n\n【28】Strength training intensities were established based on the ACSM and ADA classification for individuals with DM1 ， with low intensity exercise with 40% 1RM and high intensity with 80% 1RM. The strength training sessions consisted of seven exercises in the same sequence as the 1RM test (Bench Press in the machine； Knee extension on the device； Peck Deck； Front high pulley with cable； Leg 45°；Low row with triangle). For the strength training session at 40% of 1RM，02 sets were performed with 16 repetitions in each exercise， with a recovery interval of 60s between sets and 120s between exercises. For the strength training session at 80% of 1RM， 02 sets were performed with 08 repetitions in each exercise with an interval of 90s between sets and 120s between exercises. The duration of the repetition in each series of the strength training was 3s， being 1s in the concentric phase and 2s in the eccentric phase of the movement.\n\n【29】Statistical analysis\n\n【30】A descriptive analysis of the variables was performed through the variation of the delta at baseline during and immediately after the intervention.\n\n【31】Results\n\n【32】According to the observed results， the exercise of less intensity， at 40% of 1RM， showed a drop between the measurement of the pre-training moment and the measurement of the moment during the training， and continued to fall until the moment immediately after the training， showing a greater blood glucose drop compared to training at 80% of1RM.\n\n【33】The strength training session at 80% of 1RM， showed an increase in capillary glycemia in the measurement during the training session， but， immediately after the training session， there was a decrease in capillary glycemia below the pre-training values. RT data at 40% and80% are shown in Table 1 and 2.\n\n【34】Table 1： Variation of the capillary glucase Delta (A) with 40% of 1RM at baseline， during and after intervention of a RT session.\n\n| Glycemia  | Moment  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Pre Workout  | 143 mg/dL  |\n| During  | 137 mg/dL  |\n|  | 06 mg/dL  |\n| During  | 137 mg/dL  |\n| After  | 100 mg/dL  |\n| A  | 37 mg/dL  |\n| Pre Workout  | 143 mg/dL  |\n| After  | 100 mg/dL  |\n| A  | 43 mg/dL  |\n\n【36】Table 2： Variation in the capillary glucose Delta (A) with 80% of 1RM at baseline， during and after the intervention of a RT session.\n\n| Glycemia  | Moment  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Pre Workout  | 267 mg/dL  |\n| During  | 281 mg/dL  |\n| A  | 14mg/dL  |\n| During  | 281 mg/dL  |\n| After  | 240 mg/dL  |\n| A  | 41 mg/dL  |\n| Pre Workout  | 267 mg/dL  |\n| After  | 240 mg/dL  |\n| A  | 27 mg/dL  |\n\n【38】Discussion\n\n【39】The objective of this research was to evaluate the glycemic responses of a type 1 diabetic who underwent strength training with different intensities. Our findings showed a better acute response in low intensity exercise， at 40% of 1RM.\n\n【40】A study conducted by Silveira et al.  investigated the acute effects of different strength training intensities on glycemic fluctuations in individuals with DM1， using the intensities of 40%， 60% and 80%of 1RM， with capillary blood glucose measurements being taken at rest， immediately after exercise ， 10 min after exercise， 20 min and30 min after exercise， resulting in a lower concentration of glucose in all intensities up to 30 min after training， however， without showing a significant difference between the three training intensities during each training period time.\n\n【41】However， the study showed a significant difference between rest and 10 min after， 20 min and 30 min after training at the three intensities investigated， and during these periods of time， the glycemic drop at 40% of 1RM was moderate， unlike the fall between the highest intensities， 60% and 80% of 1RM， which revealed a fall in great magnitudes 30 min after the last exercise .\n\n【42】Campos， Paixao et al.  conducted a case study with a type 1diabetic in order to evaluate the hypoglycemic effect of resistance training with an emphasis on movement along the eccentric phase in an individual with an insulin infusion pump， the study lasted four weeks where the applicability of the training was three times a week.\n\n【43】Capillary blood glucose data were collected 15 min， 30 min and45 min， during and after training. The study found a significant drop in glycemia during the training sessions， the authors associate the glycemic drop with a greater activity of the GLUT4 protein， physical exercise promotes an increase in energy expenditure and associated with this there is an increase in the AMP： ATP ratio， this mechanism promotes the activation of AMPK， which is associated with translocation of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane .\n\n【44】The activation of the AMPK enzyme may explain the reduction in glucose during the training intensities performed in this study， as it is one of the precursors of activation of GLUT4， in addition， exercise promotes the suspension of the mTORC1/S6K1 protein that is capable of phosphorylating IRS1 into serine and interrupting the insulin signaling cascade . Thus， a greater phosphorylation of AMPK and Akt protein occurs， a mechanism that activates GLUT4through an insulin-independent signaling cascade .\n\n【45】A study carried out with type 2 diabetes conducted by Moreira， compared the acute effect of strength training exercise of different intensities of lower cardiovascular-metabolic stress on glucose control， intensities of 23% 1RM and 40%1RM were used， while end of the study it was concluded that both intensities were effective in reducing glycemia in individuals with type 2 diabetes， demonstrating that even at low intensities， the muscle contraction performed by exercise can promote GLUT4 translocation and in the reduction of capillary glycemia .\n\n【46】The increase in capillary glycemia during training to 80% of1RM and a smaller drop immediately after training compared to a session at 40% of 1RM may be related to hormonal and metabolic responses antagonistic to the decline in blood glucose stimulated to high-intensity exercise . Guelfi et al.  state that， metabolic and hormonal responses， elevated catecholamine and growth hormone levels， may contribute to avoiding a decline in blood glucose levels at the beginning of recovery， since these hormones stimulate increased hepatic glucose production and inhibits insulin-mediated glucose. One study that compared responses to glucose levels in high-intensity interval aerobic training vs. moderate-intensity aerobic training demonstrated a drop in blood glucose in both protocols， but glucose levels in interval training high intensity remained stable during recovery due to the hormonal versus regulatory response， which it did not occur in moderate training， where glucose levels continued to fall .\n\n【47】Despite the benefits of physical exercise， one of the biggest concerns when relating physical exercise and DM1 patients is the risk of hypoglycemia . However， unlike continuous mild to moderate exercise， in high-intensity exercise the occurrence of hypoglycemia does not is frequent . Exercises with anaerobic component (weight lifting/resistance exercises， sprints and high intensity interval training) reduce the risk of hypoglycemia during and after physical exercise in DM1.\n\n【48】Processes regulated by independent insulin mechanisms are generally preserved when people with diabetes engage in high-intensity work. These processes include normal increases in glucose production and disposition during and immediately after exercise， as well as a normal rate of decline in glucose production after exercise. Since glucose production is mainly controlled by catecholamine’s， current data suggest that physically fit patients with insulin-dependent diabetes can exercise vigorously and exercise require high-intensity workloads  Catecholamines (epinephrine， nor epinephrine， dopamine) exhibit effects excitatory and inhibitory effects of the peripheral nervous system and actions in the Central Nervous System(CNS)， in addition to modulation of endocrine function， such as insulin secretion and glycogenolysis rate .\n\n【49】The findings of the present study revealed that in strength training at 40% 1RM， glycemic levels showed a continuous drop in the moments during training and immediately after training which occurred due to muscle contraction that is one of the factors responsible for the greatest GLUT4 activity. However， in the 80%1RM strength training session there was an increase in capillary glycemia above pre-workout levels， which can be justified by the regulatory action of the hormones responsible for the production of liver glucose， even so， the higher intensity strength training was able to promote glycemic drop at the end of the training session to lower levels than with the pre-workout moment. Strength training can also be prescribed because it has a lower risk of hypoglycemia in addition to promoting increased muscle strength and cross section that only the high intensity of strength training can promote .\n\n【50】Conclusion\n\n【51】It is concluded that in this case study， for this participant， both training protocols showed a drop in capillary glycemia values at the end of the training session， however the protocols showed different behaviors during the session， where the strength training at 40% of1RM. The fall happened continuously， while in strength training at80% of 1RM there was an increase in blood glucose during the session and then a fall in capillary blood glucose levels， which demonstrate that different intensities will result in different physiological responses. It is important to emphasize the need for blood glucose monitoring before， during and after training， in order to obtain greater safety for the diabetic and reduce the risks ofhypoglycemic events.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 11:18:10", "endTime": "2024/09/24 11:23:16", "cost": 305.765}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:32", "update_time": "2024-09-23 19:23:16", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 19:18:10"}

In TACAR there was evidence of bronchiectasis of bilateral central location. The patient was treated with corticosteroids and antifungal agents， showing clinical improvement in his outpatient controls Serological detection tests for Aspergillus fumigatus， together with TACAR， are important in asthmatic patients，particularly in uncontrolled patients， since a timely diagnosis and treatment will improve the prognosis and quality of life of these patients.\n\n【3】Keywords： Asthma； Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis； Aspergillosis\n\n【4】Introduction\n\n【5】Allergic Bronchopulmonary Aspergillosis (ABPA) is an inflammatory lung disease caused by infection with Aspergillus furnigatus， giving a type 1 hypersensitivity response . Its worldwide prevalence is unknown， however， there are epidemiological reports that consider that Aspergillus fumigatus colonizes the respiratory tree of 25% of asthmatics； however， only 2% of patients go on to develop ABPA. Currently， worldwide， the global burden of ABPA exceeds 4.8 million， being an underdiagnosed entity that affects the quality of life of patients .\n\n【6】Although the disease is acquired by inhaling the microscopic spores of Aspergillus， most people do not contract it， and there is a higher risk of infection in patients with any immunosuppressive condition or presence of pulmonary disease .\n\n【7】For its diagnosis， predisposing factors such as a history of asthma or fibrosis should be taken into account， in addition to laboratory tests， such as a positive Aspergillus test， high IgE levels and eosinophil counts. It should be clarified that in most patients with uncontrolled asthma， despite receiving adequate standard treatment， it is recommended that ABPA be suspected.\n\n【8】We present the case of a 45-year-old female patient with a history of uncontrolled bronchial asthma， who was admitted to hospital with the initial diagnosis of infected bronchiectasis，laboratory revealed increased IgE， eosinophilia and positive galactomannan antigen， confirming the diagnosis to ABPA.\n\n【9】Case Presentation\n\n【10】Female patient， 45 years old， from Lima-Peru， with family history of bronchial asthma. Allergic to penicillins. With medical history ofbronchial asthma 5 years ago， whose usual treatment consists of fluticasone-salmeterol 250/50 ug (2 inhalations every 12 h) and salbutamol on demand， adherent to treatment； with history of asthmatic crises of mild to moderate intensity several times a year in the last 3 years despite regular treatment. No history of previous hospitalizations. She was admitted to the emergency department of Hospital Dos de Mayo on January 21 ， 2020 due to 5 days of illness characterized by increased respiratory frequency and consistency of expectoration， with mucopurulent features， associated with progressive dyspnea. On the day of admission， she presented a fever of 38°C associated with dyspnea on moderate exertion， which was the reason why she went to the emergency department.\n\n【11】At the time of evaluation， the patient presented tachycardia140 bpm， tachypnea 24 rpm， oxygen saturation 92% (FiO， 21%)， body temperature 38.5℃ and blood pressure 110/80 mmHg. On preferential. physical examination there were diffuse wheezing in both lung fields and fine crackles in lung bases. The rest of the evaluation was unaltered. Subsequently the patient was referred to the hospitalization area of the Pneumology service.\n\n【12】Among the laboratory findings on the first day of admission to that service， the hemogram showed mild anemia (Hb： 10.5 g/dL)， leukocytosis (leukocytes： 19670 mm’ and abastonates： 393.4 mm) with mild eosinophilia (750 mm) and a value of C-reactive protein of 185 mg/dL. The electrolytes， urine and sputum GenXpert tests showed no other alterations.\n\n【13】Pulmonary CT (HRCT) showed pulmonary parenchyma with multiple bronchiectasis of cylindrical and varicose appearance of bilateral central location .\n\n【14】The patient received antibiotic therapy with ceftazidime 2gr/24 h for 14 days， prior sputum culture which was positive for Pseudomonas aeruginosa， in addition to inhaler therapy (salbutamol2 PUFF/6 h and Ipatropium bromide 2 PUFF/6 h). On the fifth day of treatment there is evidence of persistent bronchospasm，the results of the control laboratory tests show a slightleukocytosis (10，140 mm’- abastonates： 0 mm’) with a slight eosinophilia (750 mm) and a decrease in c-reactive protein (58.7 mg/dl).\n\n【15】Due to the persistence of bronchospasm， eosinophilia and the distribution of bronchiectasis in the pulmonary HRCT， it was decided to expand the laboratories， obtaining a value of immunoglobulin E greater than 2500 IU/ml and a positive result of galactomannan antigen (Aspergillus).\n\n【16】With these results a diagnosis of Allergic Bronchopulmonary Aspergillosis (ABPA) was made and she was discharged with Itraconazole 200 mg c/12 hand prednisone 20 mg c/24h.\n\n【17】The patient continues to attend her check-ups at the hospital， with clinical improvement and absence ofbronchospasm episodes.\n\n【18】Discussion\n\n【19】ABPA is an inflammatory lung disease produced by an infection of the Aspergillus fungus， as a response to the antigens of this infection， with immune responses mediated by antibodies (IgE and IgG) and by cells，release of cytokines and interleukins， among others. These responses， combined with the toxic effects of the fungus， cause airway damage such as epithelial rupture and activation of immune responses， which can lead to bronchiectasis and fibrosis .\n\n【20】The International Society for Human and Animal Mycology(ISHAM) has proposed diagnostic criteria， grouping them into3 blocks： Predisposing conditions， mandatory criteria and other criteria. For diagnosis， one of the predisposing conditions must be present： Asthma or cystic fibrosis； both mandatory criteria： Positive Aspergillus skin test with elevated serum IgE levels >1000 IU/mL； and at least 2 of 3 of the other criteria： Total eosinophil count >500cells/uL， presence of IgG antibodies to Aspergillus furigatus or chest radiograph consistent with ABPA . In the present case， the patient reported a history of asthma and at the laboratorylevel presented IgE concentrations greater than 2500 IU/mL，eosinophilia and a positive galactomannan test， which corroborated the diagnosis of ABPA.\n\n【21】With the development of ABPA， there is a poor control of asthma， so they may worsen and manifest with cough or increased expectoration， considering that some patients may have brownish black expectoration， secondary to the accumulation of degenerated eosinophils， desquamated epithelial cells and mucin . They may also present hemoptysis， fever or febrile fever， weight loss， general malaise， wheezing and bronchial hyperresponsiveness .\n\n【22】At the imaging level， chest radiography usually shows the presence of fugitive opacities as indicative of ABPA， and is useful in follow-up， avoiding the need for repeated CT scans. For patients with ABPA， High-Resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT) of the chest is the most sensitive test， as it allows better evaluation of the distribution of bronchiectasis and other findings that are not apparent on radiography. Bronchiectasis and mucoid impaction are the classic ABPA findings on CT . In this patient， bronchiectasis was evidenced in the middle lobe and lingula， which， in the context of a patient with a history of asthma， increases the clinical suspicion ofABPA\n\n【23】Regarding treatment， itraconazole and voriconazole are used in the treatment of ABPA and only for patients who cannot taper oral corticosteroid or have an exacerbation of ABPA. The use of other drugs such as Omalizumab， itraconazole and voriconazole are still being investigated10. In this case the patient was prescribed Itraconazole and Prednisone.\n\n【24】In conclusion， we report a case of ABPA witha clinicalpresentation of uncontrolled asthma. It is recommended that serological screening tests for Aspergillus fumigatus be routinely performed， together with high-resolution chest CT， in asthmatic patients， particularly in those with uncontrolled and/or difficult to treat asthma， since a timely diagnosis and treatment will improve the prognosis and quality of life of these patients.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 11:09:35", "endTime": "2024/09/24 11:12:33", "cost": 178.011}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:32", "update_time": "2024-09-23 19:12:31", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 19:09:32"}

There are less than 10 reported cases of orbital myxofibrosarcoma. The authors report a case of a patient with a previous resected low-grade myxofibrosarcoma in the right orbit， who 16-years later presented with the same tumor. This first recurrence was resected， leaving a residual mass. Two years later， the patient presented with an extensive mass in the right orbit， sinuses， and nasal cavities. The histopathological examination showedhigh-grade myxofibrosarcoma. The patient underwent palliative radiotherapy and palliative care. The risk of metastasis ofthis type of tumor depends on the degree ofhistological differentiation. But local recurrence rate is similar for all with an increase of metastasis risk with every recurrence. Due to the few cases reported there are no standardized management guidelines. However， it is recommended wide surgical margins be associated with postoperative radiotherapy in the presence of residual lesions or high-grade tumors.\n\n【2】Keywords： Myxofibrosarcoma； Orbital； Proptosis\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Myxofibrosarcoma (MFS) is the most common type of fibroblastic sarcoma in elderly patients. It is a slow-growing mesenchymal tumor that usually occurs in the extremities . Its orbital location is extremely rare as there are few cases described in the literature at the moment of this review. Therefore， there are notreatments guidelines available for this disease， thus the authors present this case of a recurrent orbital myxofibrosarcoma in order to collaborate towards future studies and this orbital tumor management.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 73-year-old woman presented with a 5-month painful right proptosis and a same-side Ipro exodeviation. Her past medical history was significant for a right orbital mass resection reported by an external hospital as a low-grade myxofibrosarcoma 16 years earlier. Her other medical background included arterial hypertension， dyslipidemia， fibromyalgia， essential tremor， suspended tobacco use， and she had been treated for a depressive episode. The patient was taking atorvastatin and sertraline， at the moment of presentation.\n\n【7】On the first physical examination， she presented with an obvious right exophthalmos and exotropia . Uncorrected visual acuity was 20/150 in the Right Eye (RE) and 20/20 in the Left Eye (LE). Intraocular pressure was normal in both eyes. Slit-lamp examination was unremarkable. Fundus examination revealed a congested right optic disc.\n\n【8】Computerized Tomography scans (CTs) revealed a thrombosed right orbital vascular malformation and Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA) revealed an orbital mass with a vascularized component in the internal portion of the right orbit .\n\n【9】Considering the patient's background， a relapse of the original tumor was suspected. Thus， a transcaruncular orbitotomy with excisional biopsy of the lesion was performed. The mass was lobular and solid in appearance， of medial location， and deep extension， almost reaching the orbital apex. Due to the lesion size， it was necessary to widen the surgical field with a vertical division of the upper eyelid at 5 mm from the superior punctum. The resected mass was 50 mmx30mmx19mm .\n\n【10】Histologic examination revealed fused cells， ofelongated， oval， round nuclei， some pleomorphic and hyperchromatic， eosinophilic cytoplasm， mitotic count of 1 to 3 in 10 fields of higher magnification.Stroma with mild to moderate inflammatoryelements of lymphocyte type， congestive vascularization， hyalinized fibrosis， myxoid areas. No necrosis was found.Immunohistochemical analysis of the tumor cells was positive for vimentin， desmin， ki-67 positive in 10% of the nucleuses and CD34 in 80% of the cells negative for S100 and actine. These features were suggestive of low-grade myxofibrosarcoma.\n\n【11】Due to the presence of tumor in the surgical margin of the biopsy a post-surgical CT was done， which confirmed the presence of a residual mass. This case was presented to the oncology committee to evaluate the need for exenteration of coadjuvant therapy. Consensus was not reached. Therefore， no further procedures were done.\n\n【12】The patient stayed asymptomatic during medical follow-up for two years， after that period， the patient presented with two-week paresthesia of the right orbital region， progressive exophthalmos， and a recurrent nosebleed from the same side. On examination， the patient showed greater proptosis in the right eye. The evaluation by otolaryngology revealed a nasal cavity mass. Resonance revealed an extensive mass centered in the perinasal cavities of about 60 mmx50 mm x 62 mm. The tumor occupied the ethmoid cells， maxillary sinus， and part of the right orbit， with intraconal involvement， and which posteriorly extended to the sphenoid sinus， compressing the cavernous sinus .\n\n【13】Through the nasal passage， a new biopsy was performed. It was diagnosed as high-grade myxofibrosarcoma. The case was presented again to the oncology committee， along the lesion was out of surgical reach. It was decided that palliative care management and palliative radiotherapy was the best option for this patient.\n\n【14】Discussion\n\n【15】Myxofibrosarcoma (MFS)， previously called malignant myxoid fibrous histiocytoma， is one of the most common fibroblastic sarcomas in elderlypatients (20%). It is a slow-growing mesenchymal tumor that usually occurs in the extremities， and its orbital location is extremely rare . In the literature there are less than 10 reported cases of orbital myxofibrosarcoma， however， it is likely that there is an underreporting due to the change in its nomenclature in recent years . In 2002， the World Health Organization modified the classification of MFS， so that part of the previously reported orbital Malignant Fibrous Histiocytomas (MFH) could correspond to the same entity， unlike other subtypes of FMH (pleomorphic， giant cell and inflammatory) that did not represent a defined entity. Characteristics of the previous studies are summarized in Supplementary Table 1； however it was not possible to find the full article of the work by Imai et al.\n\n【16】The clinical behavior of myxofibrosarcomas is related to the degree of histological differentiation. Low-grade tumors have a low probability of metastasizing (20%)， however the local recurrence rate is similar for all tumor grades， with rates ranging between 17% and60%， and with each new recurrence the risk of metastasis recurrence increases . The high rates of local recurrence could be explained by the frequent vascular extension of the tumor . Recent studies have shown that the only significant predictor of local recurrence risk is the surgical margin . Risk factors associated with disease-specific mortality are size greater than 5 cm， tumor necrosis， and <75% myxoid component on histology . Compared to other soft tissue sarcomas， MFS have better survival， since a 5-year survival rate is estimated at 64% to 77% in high-grade MFS .\n\n【17】Managing these patients is a real challenge. The described infiltrative character makes it very difficult to define the tumor margins， increasing the probability of residual lesions and therefore of local recurrence.In addition，each recurrence increases the probability of having higher-grade lesions， and therefore of metastasizing. The few cases reported to date do not allow for standardized management guidelines， but in general， resection with wide surgical margins is recommended， associated with postoperative radiotherapy in the presence of residuallesions or high-grade tumors.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 10:49:51", "endTime": "2024/09/24 10:50:52", "cost": 60.169}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:32", "update_time": "2024-09-23 18:50:50", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 18:49:49"}

The relative content of T-lymphocytes and their main subpopulations was determined on a flow cytofluorimeter FACS Calibur (Canada) by phenotyping lymphocytes with monoclonal antibodies (BECKMAN COULTER， USA) to surface membrane differentiation antigens (CD)： CD3+19- (pan T-cells)， CD4+-8+-(T-helpers/inducers)，CD4-8+(cytotoxic T lymphocytes)， CD3-16+(natural killers). To identify the imbalance of immunoregulatory subpopulations ofT cells， the immunoregulatory index was calculated - the ratio of the number of CD4+8-Lf and CD4-8+ Lf. To calculate the absolute content in the peripheral blood of individual populations of Lf， leukogram indicators determined on the hematological analyzer ABH-miscros60， France were used.

In severe asthma， an increase in the content of pan-T cells occurred 1.2 times more often than in moderate asthma， but this was not observed in people with concomitant pathology. In this group， the frequency of increasing the content of T-helpers and decreasing the content of cytotoxic T-cells in patients with severe asthma without concomitant diseases was 1.3 times more frequent than in patients with comorbid pathology. No pathological changes in the T-system were detected in patients with controlled asthma. In partially controlled asthma， these changes were registered 1.5 times more often than in controlled asthma， and in its uncontrolled course， the prevalence of pathological changes in the T-system of immunity was much higher than in the two previous groups. In patients with concomitant diseases， these changes， as a rule， had a higher frequency than in patients without comorbid pathology.\n\n【4】Keywords：Comorbid pathology； Immunity； Exacerbation of asthma\n\n【5】Introduction\n\n【6】In the last two decades， researchers have paid considerable attention to the problem of comorbidity in bronchial asthma BA . Comorbidity is a combination of several chronic diseases in one patient， which mutually affect each other. It has been proven that the interaction of diseases， their pathomorphosis and age significantly changes the course of the main disease， the nature and severity of complications， worsens the patient's quality of life， limits or complicates the treatment and diagnostic process. It is known that patients with comorbid pathology， including the gastrointestinal tract， which is very common among this category of patients，have an increased risk of developing asthma exacerbations and a greater severity of their course. Comorbidity negatively affects the prognosis of the disease and significantly increases the probability of a fatal outcome. The presence of comorbid diseases leads to an increase in the length of hospitalization， causes disability， and prevents the implementation of rehabilitation measures . Discrepancies in the data of different authors regarding the prevalence of comorbid pathology in patients with asthma， in particular the digestive organs， and its influence on the course of asthma and the features of immunological changes determined the purpose of the work - to investigate immunological changes in patients with exacerbation of bronchial asthma with different severity and controllability depending on the presence comorbid pathology.\n\n【7】Materials and Methods\n\n【8】The work is based on the analysis of the anamnesis data and comprehensive clinical examination of 337 patients with exacerbation of BA and 255 patients who underwent immunological research in the laboratory of clinical immunology. The distribution of patients with exacerbation of BA with different severity and controllability by gender and age is presented in the . The analysis of these data showed that in all groups the majority of patients were women， which corresponds to the gender characteristics of this disease. Most of the examined patients with moderate and severe asthma were ofworking age (86.3% and 87.2%， respectively)， while with mild BA - only 46.7%(p<0.05).\n\n【9】There was no statistical difference between the fates of patients of different age categories with controlled and partially controlled asthma； however， in the group of patients with an uncontrolled course of the disease， there was a 2.4-fold decrease in the percentage of young and middle-aged patients and a 1.3-fold increase in the number of people elderly (p<0.05)， which corresponds to the well-known features of BA. Concomitant diseases were recorded in 252of 337 (74.8%) people， 144 (42.7%) of them had pathology of the digestive organs， and the absence of comorbidity was observed in85 (25.2%) patients. Among this group， there were 15.4% more men than among the group of patients with concomitant diseases (40.0%and 24.6%， respectively； p<0.05). There was no difference in the age composition between the groups .\n\n【10】To assess the severity and controllability of asthma， we used criteria based on international recommendations (GINA， 2014) and given in the unified clinical protocol of primary， secondary(specialized) medical care \"Bronchial asthma and adapted clinical guidelines for bronchial asthma .Average severity of asthma exacerbation was determined in 125 (65.8%) patients， severe - in 65(34.2%).18(9.5%) patients had a controlled course of the disease， 131 (68.9%) partially controlled， uncontrolled 41 (21.6%) patients. Comorbid pathology of digestive organs was recorded in 83 (43.7%) patients with exacerbation of BA. The most common diagnosis was cholecysto-cholangitis， which was present in 63 (75.9 %) patients， gastritis， duodenitis and reflux esophagitis were noted in 31 (37.3%)， pancreatitis in 12 (14.5%)， hepatitis in 6 (7.2%)， gastric or duodenal ulcer - in 4 cases (4.8%)， intestinal candidacies was established in 2cases. It should be noted that almost a third of these.\n\n【11】Patients had a combined pathology of the digestive organs. The remaining 107 (56.3%) persons with exacerbation of asthma had no comorbid diseases. They were included in the comparison group.The relative content of T-lymphocytes and their main subpopulations was determined on a flow cytofluorimeter FACSCalibur(Canada) by phenotyping lymphocytes with monoclonal antibodies (BECKMAN COULTER， USA) to surface membrane differentiation antigens(CD)： CD3+19-(pan T-cells)， CD4+8-(T-helpers/inducers)， CD4-8+ (cytotoxic T lymphocytes)， CD3-16+ (natural killers). To identify the imbalance of immunoregulatory subpopulations of T cells， the Immunoregulatory Index (IRI) was calculated - the ratio of the number of CD4+8- Lf and CD4-8+ Lf. To calculate the absolute content in the Peripheral blood (PC) of individual populations of Lf， leukogram indicators determined on the hematological analyzer ABH-micros 60， France were used. The proliferative activity of lymphocytes was evaluated in cultures of whole blood in the Reaction of Blast Transformation (RBTL) of these cells with morphological accounting of the results .\n\n【12】Statistical processing of the obtained data was carried out using licensed software products that were included in the Microsoft Office Professional 2007 package， license OPEN No Level No.43437596. To confirm the reliability of the difference in the obtained frequency indicators， the method of alternative variation was used with the determination of the student's two-tailed t-test. The level of probability was taken as the value of the Probability indicator (p) between groups， which was equal to or less than 0.05.\n\n【13】Results and Discussion\n\n【14】WithBA of moderate severity， an increase in the content ofpan-T cells was found in 37.7% of patients， and its frequency did not depend on the presence of concomitant diseases. An increase in the content of T-helpers occurred in 22.9% of patients without comorbid pathology， and in its presence， an insignificant increase in the frequency of high\n\n| Course of asthma  |

Consolidation is achieved in the vast majority of cases. The possible removal of the material can be considered at a distance from the installation. The 18-month period is commonly used as the minimum date at which this extraction can be considered .\n\n【9】Traumatic deformity is very rare. This deformation can cause a rupture of the material and making its extraction complicated. The extraction of a broken nail has been described by many authors and there are many methods， some of which are original .\n\n【10】The extraction ofa deformed nail is an exceptional case and requires a reflection on the surgical strategy . Sometimes， the importance of the deformity is at the origin of vascular complications， imposing an urgent surgery.\n\n【11】Case Presentation\n\n【12】A 25-year-old patient was cared for following an accident involving high kinetic motorcycles at the Army Instruction Hospital (HIA) of the Sainte-Anne in Toulon. The initial assessment showed a hemodynamically stable patient.\n\n【13】Gaubert L， Breda R. Removal of a Bent Tibial intramedullary Nail：A Case Report and a Review of the Literature. Clin Case Rep Iint. 2019； 3： 1097.\n\n【14】The primary evaluation showed a irreducible deformity of the right leg at 45°lateral flexion and about 10 degrees in frontal flexion at the junction 1/3 mid-1/3 inferior of the tibia . A cutaneous opening of a few centimeters was at the level of flexion. The clinical examination found a vascular suffering with a weak distal pulse， compared to the healthy side.\n\n【15】The surgical strategy had to meet several objectives. It had to allow ablation nail to allow aligning the limb. It had to preserve the bone capital to allow a secondary osteosynthesis. We decided to perform an anteromedial approach with a distal tibial corticotomy flap respecting the tibio-talar joint and an economical corticotomy at its proximal part. This is to extract the nail retrograde way.\n\n【16】With regard to osteosynthesis， we have been able to perform a conventional osteosynthesis by medial distal tibial plate LCP 3.5.\n\n【17】Discussion\n\n【18】The deformation of osteosynthesis material is frequent in cases of nonunion due to a progressive and irreversible embrittlement of the metal. In the vast majority of cases， the diagnosis is made at the time of the rupture of the latter and the extraction of this material is carried out in semi emergency. There are many methods of extraction. The authors focus mainly on tactics with proximal anterograde extraction and distal percutaneous or retrograde extraction. In all clinical cases reported， there is no simple deformation but a complete rupture ofthe metallic material .\n\n【19】The deformation of material in traumatic cases is much less frequent . The extraction of the material is made very complicated by this deformation. Yip et al. reported extraction of two tibial nails by standard route . By carefully studying the deformations， one realizes that these were not important and finally allowed a classic extraction of the nail. One case reported by these authors had 13° of anterior flexion and 20° of valgus. Our clinical case had a much larger deformity.\n\n【20】The idea of deforming the tibia by an external force to obtain a realignment allowing the conventional extraction of the nail has not been seriously considered. Some authors have tried with total failure7.\n\n【21】Some authors propose a minimal approach on the deformation focus . The goal is to cut the nail with a plier or saw. Thus， one can realign the limb and proceed to the extraction as in the case of a rupture on a nonunion. Some authors believe that the use of a saw is not advisable because of metal chips and the risk of bone burns .\n\n【22】We decided preoperatively to perform a distal corticotomy. We were then able to seize the nail to carry out a retrograde extraction. All the proximal diaphysis was intact. The bonyhood was then rested and fixed by a provisional strapping and a very long bone plate was placed .\n\n【23】In conclusion， the presence of osteosynthesis equipment may expose to complications in case of trauma as illustrated by our clinical case. However， it seems that a complication at this degree of severity is exceptional in the literature. According to our service habits， the removal of osteosynthesis equipment must be included in the therapeutic project from initial management， particularly in a population at high risk oftrauma.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 11:46:39", "endTime": "2024/09/24 11:46:47", "cost": 7.956}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:32", "update_time": "2024-09-23 19:46:47", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 19:46:39"}

Women were asked to fill the Italian version of the Coping Orientation to the Problems Experienced (COPE-NVI). The questionnaire included 5different dimensions： 1) Social support； 2) Avoidance strategies； 3) Positive attitude； 4) Problem solving； 5) Turning to religion. We planned to evaluate COPE-NVI score according to the different maternal or fetal complication. Hundred women met the inclusion criteria， agreed to participate to the study and filled out the questionnaire. Thirty-seven were admitted for preeclampsia， 15for diabetes， 5 for intrahepatic cholestasis， 14 for hyperemesis gravidarum， while 29 had severe intrauterine growth restriction requiring monitoring. The mean COPE-NVI score for social support was 31.5 ± 8.6， for avoidance strategies was 25.1± 6.7， for positive attitude was 31.7 ± 7.3， for problem solving was 30.5±7.5，and for turning to religion was 24.9 ±5.3. No statistically significant differences were found the COPE-NVI score within the different maternal or fetal complications， rather than for turning for religion， where the score was higher for women with preeclampsia and lower for women with intrahepatic cholestasis (P=0.01).

Pregnantwomen may also worry about the health of their future babies， impending childbirth， and motherhood responsibilities. Women with high-risk pregnancies usually report a significantly higher level of stress and negative emotions . Studies also showed that hospitalized pregnant patients admitted for inpatient monitoring had higher levels of anxiety compared to non-hospitalized women . However， why some women have a better psychologic outcome compared to other pregnant women with similar pregnancy features， is still a subject of debate .\n\n【5】Coping is defined as a changing cognitive and behavioral efforts aimed to dealing with specific situations that may be stressful . Reviews showed that avoidant coping behaviors or styles and poor coping skills in general could be associated with adverse outcomes， including postpartum depression， preterm birth， and infant development .\n\n【6】The COPE inventory was created by Carver et al. in the 1989 . It is a multi-dimensional inventory developed to assess the different coping strategies people use in response to stress. COPE stands for Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced. The inventory is a list of statements that participants review and score. Each statement in the inventory is then connected to a specific coping strategy that sits under either the problem-focused， emotion-focused， or coping response measures.\n\n【7】Objective\n\n【8】The aim of this study was to evaluate coping behavior and style in a cohort of pregnant women with high risk pregnancy admitted for inpatient antenatal monitoring.\n\n【9】Materials and Methods\n\n【10】Study design and participants\n\n【11】This was a single-center， observational， prospective， cohort study of pregnant women with high-risk pregnancy admitted for inpatient antenatal monitoring at University of Naples Federico II from Appendix 1： Statements of the COPE-NVI.\n\n【12】1.

All participants in the trial provided written informed consent.\n\n【26】Inclusion criteria were pregnant women with high-risk pregnancy admitted for inpatient antenatal monitoring. High risk pregnancies included diabetes， preeclampsia， intrahepatic cholestasis， severe intrauterine growth restriction， and hyperemesis gravidarum.\n\n【27】Outcomes\n\n【28】Women were asked to fill the Italian version of the Coping\n\n【29】Orientation to the Problems Experienced (COPE-NVI) . The tool consists of five large essentially independent dimensions： Social support， Avoidance strategies， and Positive attitude， Problem solving and Turning to religion. The tool includes 60 statements (Appendix 1) with a score from 1 to 4 as following： 1. I usually do not do this at all 2. I usually do this a little bit 3. I usually do this a medium amount 4. I usually do this a lot Each statement in the inventory is connected to a specific coping dimension. The questionnaire included 5 different dimensions： 1. Social support 2. Avoidance strategies 3. Positive attitude 4. Problem solving 5. Turning to religion For each dimension a specific score is validated. Above that cut-off the coping strategy is considered to be present： 27.7 for social support； 23.5 for avoidance strategies； 30.9 for positive attitude； 32.0for problem solving： 22.7 for turning to religion.\n\n【30】We planned to evaluate COPE-NVI score according to the different maternal or fetal complication.\n\n【31】Statistical analysis\n\n【32】Statistical analysis was performed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) v. 19.0 (IBM Inc.， Armonk， NY，USA). Continuous variables were reported as means ± Standard Deviation (SD)，while categoricalasInumbers (percentage).Univariate comparisons of dichotomous data were performed with the use of the chi-square test with continuity correction. Comparisons between groups were performed with the use of the T-test to test group means by assuming equal within-group variances for parametric data， and with the use of Wilcoxon and Mann-Whitney tests for nonparametric data. P value <0.05 was considered statistically significant.\n\n【33】Results Characteristics of the included women\n\n【34】During the study period 100 women， admitted for antenatal inpatient monitoring， met the inclusion criteria， agreed to participate to the study and filled out the questionnaire.\n\n【35】Maternal age ranged from 25 to 40 years.

The study included 100 pregnant women， and showedthat for all five dimensions using the COPE-NVItoolpregnant women have high score and therefore good coping strategies The study was limited by the small sample size， and by the observational study design. All participants were enrolled during the COVID-19 pandemic. If there were any effect on the outcomes is it possible that the COVID-19 pandemic could have modified the findings. This would further reduce the power of a maybe already underpowered study.\n\n【46】Implication\n\n【47】Pregnancy is a unique health experience. Unlike other health and illness contexts studied by health psychologists， such as cancer or heart disease， pregnancy is not an illness and is commonlyassociated with positive psychological experiences . However， different maternal or fetal conditions， and high risk pregnancies， may have a significant impact on maternal satisfaction .\n\n【48】Many women may be coping with an unintended pregnancy， bothersome physical symptoms， medical risk conditions or other chronic life strains. Pregnancy， which typically spans 40 weeks， is also time-limited in nature. The finite nature may influence how women appraise and cope with at least some pregnancy-specific stressors. By its very nature， pregnancy is also embedded within a broader interpersonal context and therefore， it is particularly important to understand the influence of an expecting mother’s close personal relationships on her coping effectiveness. A recent study by Stapleton et al. examined the maternal relationship with a baby’s father in detail and found that paternal support during pregnancy predicted maternal prepartum and postpartum distress， as did the quality of their relationship . Models of dyadic coping developed in other populations suggest that a partner’s ways of coping with stress affects the other partner’s coping methods， as well as the effectiveness of his or her coping .\n\n【49】Coping helps pregnant women to manage the negative effects of stress . Firm evidence of mediational mechanisms and for relevant moderating factors should be established before implementing interventions that are based on teaching women how to better cope\n\n【50】Table 3： COPE score according to type of high-risk pregnancy.\n\n|  | Preeclampsia  | Diabetes  | IUGR  | Intrahepatic cholestasis  | Hyperemesis gravidarum  | p-value  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Social support  | 32.8±9.1  | 29.8±8.4  | 31.9±9.3  | 28.2±6.7  | 30.4±6.5  | 0.64  |\n| Avoidance strategies  | 24.9±7.4  | 24.8±5.6  | 25.9±7.6  | 22.4±3.0  | 25.1+5.2  | 0.87  |\n| Positive attitude  | 32.2±8.5  | 34.0±5.9  | 30.3±7.6  | 31.8±4.9  | 30.5±5.5  | 0.55  |\n| Problem solving  | 30.5±8.8  | 32.4±6.7  | 30.1±7.5  | 30.8±5.1  | 29.5±5.2  | 0.86  |\n| Turning to religion  | 26.2±4.7  | 22.7±5.4  | 26.2±4.6  | 19.2±9.1  | 24.9±5.3  | 0.01  |\n\n【52】IUGR： Intrauterine Growth Restriction， Baldface data， statistically significant during pregnancy. Looking ahead， researchers should develop a greater understanding of the particular challenges that women face and must cope with during pregnancy and across the lifespan， use strong and consistent instrumentation， and conduct longitudinal studies in large samples. A more rigorous approach to the study of coping during pregnancy could provide evidence needed to develop empirically-based interventions targeting modifiable risk factors for adverse pregnancy outcomes .\n\n【53】The solution that expresses COPE-NVI internal structure is the one that combines the basic scales in five factors： Social support； avoidance strategies； positive attitude； problem solving； and turning to religion. Our cohort was associated with high score at coping strategies. By looking at the different type of high-risk pregnancies， only turning to religion was statistically significant with the highest score in IUGR patients， and lowest score in women with intrahepatic cholestasis. We also reported a non-significant higher score for social support in women with preeclampsia and IUGR. This may reflect a tendency for these classes of patients to research\"social support\" more than others， since they are often long-term patients and therefore more exposed to social distancing imposed by prolonged hospitalization and social exclusion induced from the CODIV-19 pandemic.\n\n【54】Conclusion\n\n【55】In summary， women with high risk pregnancies admitted for antenatal inpatient monitoring have a high score at coping strategies.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 11:41:58", "endTime": "2024/09/24 11:42:30", "cost": 32.063}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:32", "update_time": "2024-09-23 19:42:30", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 19:41:58"}

Advances in organ preservation， surgical techniques， and immunosuppressive agents in the past few decades have extended the life expectancy of these patients. However， the shortage of cadaveric donors remains a major concern. A Living Donor Liver Transplant (LDLT) is an option； however， the supply of donated livers is very low relative to the demand. According to the Taiwan Organ Registry and Sharing Center database， although 6，211 liver transplants were performed in Taiwan from 2005 to 2018， the organ shortage led to a long wait， with a cumulative dropout probability within 3 years of up to 24% . In 2021， more than 1，169 patients were awaiting a liver transplant in Taiwan. However， only 107 cadaveric and 436 LDLTs were performed in 2020， with many patients dying on the waiting list . Therefore， the extension of the organ pool may benefit more people Prior to the approval of Direct-Acting Antivirals (DAAs)， Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) -positive liver grafts were discarded three times more than HCV-negative grafts . A liver transplant from an HCV-positive donor into an HCV-negative recipient has become possible because of the remarkable success rate of DAA therapy， with ASTRAL studies reporting an overall Sustained Virologic Response (SVR) of 99% in 624 patients . However， most of such case series focused on cadaveric liver transplants，leading to the lack of information on LDLTs.\n\n【6】We present a novel procedure to treat an HCV-seropositive donor with 8 weeks of DAA therapy before liver donation to her seriously ill relative； moreover， we evaluated the long-term outcomes of the treatment in both donor and recipient.\n\n【7】Materials and Methods\n\n【8】Recipient\n\n【9】A 39-year-old man with blood type B and alcoholicliver cirrhosis was transferred to our division for liver transplant evaluation.

His initial Model for End-Stage Liver Disease(MELD) score was 25， and the total bilirubin level was 7.45 mg/dL(normal range： 0.2 mg/dL to 1.2 mg/dL). Serological tests revealed a negative hepatitis B and C status . Imaging tests， including Panendoscopy， colonoscopy， abdominal Computed Tomography(CT)， and liver magnetic resonance imaging， were performed to rule out malignancies and major vascular anomalies. Subsequently， the patient was referred to the waiting list for a liver transplant. However， his liver function deteriorated rapidly after several episodes of bleeding from esophageal varices， with the MELD score escalating to34. On the basis of the MELD score，the estimated 3-month mortality rate was 52.6% . Because of the recent high mortality without liver transplants in time attributing to the cadaveric liver shortage， we discussed the possibility of an LDLT with his family. His younger sister expressed willingness to be a donor； therefore， an LDLT was initiated.\n\n【12】The living donor was a 39-year-old woman with blood type B. She had a weight of 61 kg and a height of 163 cm； moreover， her BMI was 23.0， BSA was 1.66， and history was noncontributory. Her pretransplant serological test results were normal； however， HCV-RNA was more than 4 log 10， with a sub-genotype of 1b .\n\n【13】Abdominal CT and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography revealed neither vascular variation nor bile duct anomalies. Although the risk of postoperative hepatic insufficiency is influenced by multiple factors， the preoperative Future Liver Remnant (FLR) volume is a key determinant for ensuring adequate functional remnant liver . CT liver volumetry revealed a total liver volume of 1266.1 mL， with 753.4 mL in the right liver lobe without the middle hepatic vein and 512.7 mL in the left liver lobe with the middle hepatic vein. The results suggested an acceptable volume for the recipient and indicated that harvesting the right liver lobe without the middle hepatic vein was safe for the donor. Regardless of HCV infection， the donor’s clinical condition was suitable for right lobe liver donation， with a graft-to-recipient weight ratio of 0.978 and the donor's liver remnant of 39.76%. The estimated FLR， calculated using the Urata formula (SLV=2.4+706.2×BSA)， was 55.48% and 43.57%for the recipient and donor， respectively. The donor was informed of the risks associated with the procedure， and coercion was excluded during an independent， confidential evaluation. Surgical agreement was approved by the medical ethics committee followed by the discussions with hepatologists， hepatobiliary surgeons， and intensive care staff. Informed consent was obtained from the patients.\n\n【14】Results\n\n【15】We developed a novel protocol for LDLTs from HCV-positive1OVE donors into HCV-negative recipients. According to the Treatment of Hepatitis C 2018 recommendations of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and European Association for the Study of the Liver， treatment-naive patients with HCV genotype 1b infection and without cirrhosis can be treated with the fixed-dose combination of sofosbuvir and ledipasvir for 8 weeks (grading B1； moderate evidence quality and strong recommendation) . We initiated DAA therapy for the donor with a daily fixed-dose combination of ledipasvir (90 mg) and sofosbuvir (400 mg； Harvoni) for 8 weeks. The presence of HCV-RNA was evaluated at 4， 8， and 12 weeks posttherapy ， and the Rapid Virologic Response (RVR)， SVR12， posttherapy SVR， and posttransplant SVR suggested that the disease was cured. The donor HCV-RNA diminished from4 log 10 to less than 15 IU/mL， which is below the lower limit of quantification. Although the HCV-RNA was not detected post transplantation， anti-HCV seropositivity was detected before and after the transplant. The LDLT was performed after the end of DAA therapy. To ensure donor safety， physicians requested a preoperative liver biopsy that was suggested using the options of laparoscopic or conventional percutaneous procedure because of the latter process-related bleeding risks， as informed by the radiologist. Subsequently， an intraoperative laparoscopic liver wedge biopsy was performed before the liver harvest surgery. The frozen section of the bilateral liver lobes revealed a minimal fatty change of less than 5% and no fibrosis. The laparoscopic liver biopsy was converted to an open donor right hepatectomy， with an uneventful perioperative period. The donor developed transient postoperative hyperbilirubinemia， however， the level decreased to normal range 1 weeklater. The donor was discharged in stable condition on postoperative day 7. Currently， the donor is undergoing regular follow-ups by the hepatologist and surgeons in the outpatient department. The donor resumed her job3 months post-donation. No other complications have been noted during the 3-year follow-up period.\n\n【16】The recipient without hepatitis C history was not treated with DAAs all the time during the perioperative period. Transient anti-HCV antibodies were detected at the first serological follow-up 2 weeks post transplantation， with the antibodies disappearing2 months later. No HCV-RNA was detected during follow-ups. Postoperative bile leak complicated with intraabdominal biloma formation was noted. The sono-guided Intra-abdominal pigtail drainage and the endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography-guided biliary stent placement was performed. The recipient was discharged in a stable condition 1.5 months post-operation. The2-year posttransplant liver biopsy revealed Ishak fibrosis stage 0with a modified histology activity index score (neuroinflammatory score) of 2 (of 18) and no rejection. The recipient had a herpes zoster infection of the trigeminal nerve 1 year after the transplant， with the long-term neurological deficits of dizziness and vertigo that disabled him from the job. Currently， the patient is being followed up at our OPD， with no HCV flare-ups over 3 years.\n\n【17】Discussion\n\n【18】Here， we present an HCV-positive donor treated with DAAs before donating the right liver lobe to her elder brother. Few articles have discussed this topic. Prior to the approval of DAAs， HCV recurrence after liver transplant was the most common cause of graft failure and reduced recipient survival in HCV-positive patients compared with HCV-negative patients . Chhatwal et al. demonstrated that HCV-seronegative patients have an increased life expectancy after accepting any liver graft regardless of HCV status if the MELD score is more than or equal to 20 .\n\n【19】The survival rates in HCV-positive donors and HCV-negative recipients are similar to those of HCV-negative donors and recipients because of the use of DAAs， with cure rates of nearly 100%. The use of HCV-positive organs in a selected group of recipients with and without HCV infection was reported by Dhaliwal et al.\n\n【20】Because of the recipient’s high 3-month mortality rate and the involved cost， the DAA therapy duration for the donor was shortened to 8 weeks. Under existing guidelines， most patients are prescribed12-week DAA therapy， a treatment duration resulting in high rates of SVR across various viral and host characteristics . Moreover， the guidelines do not encourage a treatment duration of less than12 weeks . However， increasing evidence suggests that many patients can achieve an SVR with only 8 weeks of therapy. In clinical practice，an SVR rate of93% to 98% has been observed after treatment withledipasvir and sofosbuvir for 8 weeks . In Taiwan， the cost of DAA therapy is similar to that in the United States； however， it is not covered by National Health Insurance， making it unaffordable to ordinary people. The wholesale acquisition cost of ledipasvir and sofosbuvir is $1125 per pill，and the cost of a ledipasvir and sofosbuvir course reduces from $94，500 to $63，000 when the treatment duration is shortened from 12 to 8 weeks . In Taiwan and neighboring countries， such as Japan and South Korea， routine pretransplant liver biopsies are not performed for living donors if CT and MRI images reveal no fibrosis， fatty change (less than 5%)， or hemosiderosis. However， we performed a pretransplant laparoscopic liver biopsy for donor safety in the setting oftreated HCV infection.\n\n【21】Although LDLTs have been performed in patients with fulminant liver failure or advanced liver disease categorized as the United Network of Organ Sharing (UNOS) status 2 A， posttransplant survival rates are low . In a series， 1-year patient survival was57%， with an average stay of 23 days in the intensive care unit . By comparison， 1-year patient survival was 82% in cadaveric organ transplant recipients， with UNOS status 2 A at the time of the transplant . With the advent of MELD， decisions on LDLTs are made on a case-by-case basis， and LDLTs are uncommon in patients with MELD scores above 25. In these patients， short-term mortality without liver transplants approaches 100% . In regions such as East and South Asia with low cadaveric organ availability， the decreased posttransplant survival rates with LDLT may be superior to the high waiting list mortality， especially when the outcomes of LDLT are improving.\n\n【22】What mortality rate is acceptable when the donor understands the risks， and when coercion has been excluded? Even if the donor is willing to accept a potential mortality risk for the life of a loved one， would the medical community proceed with an LDLT? A balance should be achieved between the risk incurred by the donor and what is acceptable to society， the medical community， and the recipient.\n\n【23】Conclusion\n\n【24】In the DAA era， a transplant from deceased HCV-positive donors to HCV-negative recipients has become feasible and safe. Our study also revealed the feasibility and safety as well of HCV-seropositive LDLTs to seronegative recipients.

The patient's case was studied 13 months after DC through high-resolution CT， assessing brain， skull and scalp data， that were used for virtual Three-Dimensional (3D) analysis and planning， in order to produce hypoprojected PEEK implants that prevented both an excessive tension on the severelyscarred scalp and an excessive intracranial dead space. The patient was treated with a one-stage cranioplasty that reconstructed 208 cm’ of the cranial vault while obtaining tensionless scalp closure； a total of 46cm² of skull surface in the lower temporal areas were left unreconstructed as they could work as a warning sign for the rise of ICP in case of swelling. The 12-months follow-up showed satisfactory aesthetic and structural results.\n\n【3】Discussion： Whether it’s for treatment of the syndrome of the trephined or for aesthetic purposes， the need to reconstruct calvarial defects remains a challenge， especially for very large defects (>150cm’) which are rarely described in literature. To overcome the potential intra- and extracranial complications to the procedure， available surface-guided CAD-CAM programming represents an optimal solution.\n\n【4】Conclusion： In this report， use ofundercorrection in planning and finalizing subtotal custom-made cranioplasty， appears able to restore skull integrity and aesthetics while avoiding excessive skin tension and reducing intracranial dead space.\n\n【5】Keywords： Cranioplasty； Subtotal cranioplasty； Custom-made cranioplasty； Decompressive craniectomy； Traumatic brain injury\n\n【6】Introduction\n\n【7】In cases of large skull defects， reconstruction currently represents a necessity， with the aim to provide structural protection for the underlying brain， a barrier against infection， and the solution to correct aesthetic deformities . These skull defects are frequently the result of Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) -related Decompressive Craniectomy (DC)； in other cases， craniectomy is performed due to intracranial aneurysm， Arteriovenous Malformations (AVM)， cerebral abscess， ischemic stroke-related cerebral edema， and tumors .\n\n【8】Since ancient history， great efforts have been made to solve the problem of skull defects， but it was only after World War I that cranioplasties were performed in greater number . Between the reasons that support reconstruction， the main one is undoubtedly the treatment of the Syndrome of the Trephined  which consists in the rapid neurological deterioration while changing the posture of the patient is specific positions (from orthostatic to horizontal or Trendelenburg position)， together with modifications of Cerebral Blood Flow (CBF) and Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF). In these patients， cranioplasty has a therapeutic effect in preventing these sudden neurological symptoms by avoiding the flaccid scalp portion covering the cranial defect from being sensitive to atmospheric pressure， causing direct force over the cortex . Thanks to the vast knowledge of materials and design refinements while programming a Computer-Aided Design and Computer-\n\n【9】Aided Manufacturing (CAD-CAM) cranioplasty， it is now possible to perform subtotal cranioplasties， although uneventful results still represent a challenge. This work has been reported in line with the Scare Criteria .\n\n【10】Case Presentation\n\n【11】Informed written consent was obtained from the patient’s legal guardian for the writing and publication of this case report. A22-year-old patient was sent to the Emergency Room of our IIIlevel University Hospital 1 h after a 7-meter fall from a roof while working. Neurological examination assessed a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 6， and the patient underwent a brain CT scan  that showed bilateral cerebral swelling with multiple cerebral contusions and a suspected intracranial right carotid artery rupture.\n\n【12】He was transferred to the emergency operating room and under general anesthesia， he underwent right temporoparietal DC. After 24 h， the patient’s Intracranial Pressure (ICP) was still high(23 mmHg) and a left temporoparietal DC was performed . The patient’s Glasgow Coma Scale score was 6 on postoperative day 11 and continued until discharge. Due to the trauma， the patient suffered irreversible traumatic brain damage， and despite the DC， a long-term outcome of Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS-E)=2 was assessed.\n\n【13】The patient suffered 3 episodes of skin flap dehiscence along different parts of the surgical incisions， that healed by secondary intention with the aid of medicated dressings.\n\n【14】A High-Resolution CT of the craniomaxillofacial complex was acquired (Siemens SOMATOM Definition AS+， Siemens， Erlangen， Germany)， assessing both the brain and the skull data ， which were processed using Materialise's Interactive Medical Image Control System 10.0 (Materialise， Leuven， Belgium).\n\n【15】All data regarding the surface of preoperative and postoperative cranial defect were acquired， together with the scalp surface and the intracranial dead space between the brain and the scalp. Using this data， 16 months after decompressive craniotomy， the patient underwent bilateral Polyether Ether Ketone (PEEK) custom-made cranioplasty (implants were fabricated by 3dific， Perugia， Italy) for the skull defect along the original incision approach . After discharge， the patient was checked at the 1-week， 2-weeks 1-month， 6and 12 months clinical and radiological follow-up.\n\n【16】The data details regarding the area of skull surface reconstructed are summarized in Table 1. The data acquired from the CT scan prior to the cranioplasty and processed with virtual Three-Dimensional(3D) analysis showed a total cranium surface of 397 cm， compared to 605 cm\"after surgery， with the implants representing a total of 208cm’ of skull surface. Bilaterally， in the temporal region， a total of 46cm’were non-reconstructed for reasons that will be discussed below. The patient did not show any complications related to cranioplasty and was discharged 7 days after surgery. Atthe 12-months clinical and radiological control ，noimplantloosening or dislocation were noted， and the aesthetic aspect and the structural strength of the cranium were restored.\n\n| Skull surface before DC  | 651 cm²  | Skull surface after DC  | 397 cm²  | Skull surface after cranioplasty  | 605 cm²  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Scalp surface before DC  | 686 cm2  | Scalp surface after DC - multiple flap dehiscenceevents  | 663cm2  | Scalp surtace after cranioplasty  | 664 cm2  |\n|  | /  | /  | /  | Total area reconstructed  | 208 cm²  |\n|  |  | 7  | /  | Area left unreconstructed  | 46 cm2  |\n\n【18】Discussion\n\n【19】Under the circumstances of brain insults， such as trauma or intracranial hemorrhage， inflammatory cascade， impaired osmolyte transport and oxidative stress， combined to the eventual direct injury， lead to serious brain swelling and subsequent damage . It is not a coincidence， in fact， that the first neurosurgical operation performed was indeed a trephination， performed by the Incas over 3000 years ago，probably with the purpose to treat the consequences of a trauma. However， we will have to wait the sixteenth century to see the first description of a cranioplasty， done by a Flemish physician named Fallopius .\n\n【20】In modern times， treatment of such harmful events as TBI includes， in the first instance， DC together with a specific medical treatment and， in the case of really extended TBI， bifrontal or bilateral craniectomy is advised. Even though current guidelines do not specify nor the extension of the craniectomy neither the optimal time to perform subsequent cranioplasty ， some authors suggest that at least 60 cm² of cranial vault should be removed for DC and Hawryluk et al. conclude that a large fronto-parieto-temporal (15 cm in diameter) DC should be preferred over a smaller DC in order to reduce mortality and improve neurological outcomes .\n\n【21】However， whether it’s for treatment of the syndrome of the trephined or for aesthetic purposes， the need to reconstruct calvarial defects remains a challenge， especially for very large defects (>150cm) which are rarely described in literature.\n\n【22】Historically， replacement of the patient's stored autologous bone flap has represented the first-line treatment for reparation of post-decompressive skull defects， usually taking place between 6 and 12months after surgery. However， complications like bone resorption， infection or chronic scalp wounds can result in a composite skull defect that should be approached by alternate means .\n\n【23】Nowadays， multiple options for restoring skull integrity following DC or previous autologous bone repositioning failure have been described， and in these cases， reconstruction planning should consider previous scalp incisions， to avoid scalp vessel damage that could bring to necrosis. Moreover， a thorough study of the scalp surface available should be performed， to obtain a tensionless closure. In an article of Nout et al. a CAD-CAM implant for parietal reconstruction was slightly decreased in projection， in order to facilitate wound closure. In these cases， CAD-CAM surface measurement can help predict the total skull surface before and after surgery， allowing to prevent potential complications such as skin dehiscence， or in cases when it is most suitable， to suggest the need for free soft tissue transfer or scalp expansion ， as advised by Baumeister et al.\n\n【24】Another important factor to consider for a successful cranioplasty is the choice of the material， which should be carefully made： A recent systematic review reported a 20.64% risk of complications with alloplastic materials， but each of them has advantages and disadvantages that must be considered. Titanium offers low rates of infection (10.7%) and can be easily screwed directly to the adjacent bone； however， it has a higher extrusion rate compared to the other materials， and being radiopaque， it gives problems for tumor surveillance follow-up . Polyether Ether Ketone (PEEK) offers the advantage that it is radiolucent and hypodense and does not cause radiographic artifacts on CT scans or MRIs . It has a 7.3%infection rate and a lower overall complication rate (17.3% vs. 31.8%for titanium). Polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) implants benefit from this material's strength， radiolucency and relatively low cost compared to the others. Prostheses made of PMMA can be modified intraoperatively using a bur， but， during handling and fixation， cases of prosthesis fracture are described， and account for an overall complication rate of 19% .\n\n【25】In our patient， a large bilateral DC was performed， bringing the total calvarial defect to 254 cm. Due to this impressive bilateral defect， which represented approximately 40% of the total neurocranium， the patient had to rest only in supine position， causing a high risk of pressure sores and making it difficult to move the patient during bed changes or daily hygiene. For these reasons， the patient could not be left to the care of his family and had to stay at along-term care facility.\n\n【26】In the months following DC， several episodes of skin flap dehiscence along different parts of the surgical incisions occurred， treated by the neurosurgery and plastic surgery units. After complete healing of the scalp dehiscence， the maxillofacial surgery team was asked to reconstruct the calvarial defect， and with the aid of an engineering team， started programming the reconstruction， and two possible complications were highlighted. The first one is related to the skin quality and its surface； after several episodes of flap dehiscence， the skin resulted heavily scarred， thickened and contracted. The second potential complication is given by the dead space that would follow a cranioplasty which brings the calvaria to its original shape， while the brain would maintain its post-traumatic volume. Free tissue transfer was at first considered as a possible solution； it offers several benefits， including providing durable coverage for skull reconstruction， obliteration of dead space， and is of great benefit in revision cranioplasty patients with chronic overlying wounds lacking adequate soft tissue coverage . However， free tissue transfer often limits the retention of native hair-bearing scalp skin at the defect site and would have necessitated a two-step surgery for both bringing soft tissue and calvarial custom reconstruction. Moreover，the relatives of the patient denied their consent to the free flap option to preserve a potential donor site from further surgery on such a delicate patient， and they preferred for us to find a solution for the problem without harvesting a free flap.\n\n【27】In order to overcomethe potential complications to the procedure， the program of developing adequate implants for cranioplasty firstly focused on the scalp surface， that was measured in the 3D rendering of the TC， giving an estimate of the scalp available (663 cm²). With this data， the biparietal implants for cranioplasty were designed to utilize all the skin surface available for cranioplasty without stretching the already scarred parietal skin， obtaining an undercorrected skull surface . Another concept that was taken into consideration was the volume of the dead space between the implant and the brain； by undercorrecting the custom-made implants， the amount of dead space was dramatically lowered. Despite the large area reconstructed with cranioplasty， thelower portion of the temporal area on both sides was not covered by the implant ， since due to the presence of the zygomatic arch， it was the safest area to leave unreconstructed and could work as a warning sign for the rise of ICP in case of swelling.\n\n【28】Conclusion\n\n【29】Cranioplasty oflarge calvarial defects with poor soft tissue quality represents a challenge in which the surgeon could need to think\"outside the box\" to solve the problem he is put in front of. We have achieved durable aesthetic and functional results in this setting using undercorrected CAD-CAM PEEK implants for reconstruction，both reducing the risk of skin dehiscence and drastically reducing the intracranial dead space. For these patients， an accurate planning， that takes into consideration both soft and hard tissues is paramount. Further investigations are needed to better examine the long-term results of undercorrected CAD-CAM in cranioplasty patients.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 10:44:11", "endTime": "2024/09/24 10:44:27", "cost": 15.515}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:31", "update_time": "2024-09-23 18:44:26", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 18:44:11"}

The cause of the disease is still unknown but thought to be an immunological disorder following a viral infection. Brain imaging is one of the best tolls for the diagnosis.\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Rasmussen's Encephalitis (RE) was first described by Theodore Rasmussen in 1958 about its clinical and pathological characteristics . RE is one of the rare chronic progressive focal inflammatory lesions in the brain of unknown etiology clinically manifested as refractory epilepsy， progressive motor and cognitive deterioration. Epileptic activity of RE is thought to be responsible for the neurocognitive decline of the patients . Exact incidence of this disease is yet not clearly calculated however it is estimated 2.4 per 10' people≤ 18 year . Brain imaging plays an important role for the diagnosis of RE， MRI of brain will also help to assess the prognosis. Proper antiepileptic drugs， immunotherapy and surgery now the current treatment strategy for the patients of RE. Clinical diagnosis of RE depends on European consensus criteria proposed on 2005 described in two parts， all three conditions in part A or two conditions in part B need to be satisfied for a diagnosis of RE .\n\n【4】Part A：\n\n【5】1. Clinical： Focal epilepsy (with or without EPC) and unilateral cortical deficit 2. EEG： Unilateral hemispheric slowing with or without epileptic activity and unilateral seiziire onset A 3 year 6 month old boy only son of non consanguineous parents was reasonably well up to 18months of age， then he had a attack of fever， convulsion and unconsciousness and was diagnosed as a case of meningoencephalitis and treated accordingly in a tertiary care hospital ， His neuroimage was normal during this illness  after recovery he developed recurrent episode of focal seizure in the form of myoclonic jerks and occasional staring， for this illness he was treated with antiepileptic drugs phenobarbital without any improvement of symptoms. At the age of 25 months of age he hospitalized again with symptoms ofencephalitis and was treated for 15 days， during that period his neuroimage of brain have shown hyper intensity on right hemisphere in T2WI， FLAIR and DWI with normal ventricles . MRA of brain， cardiac evaluation， metabolic screening， coagulation profile， EEG findings all were normal. At the age of 40 months he came to us with history of recurrent fall， weakness of left side of body and recurrent seizure in the form of myoclonic jerks. His antenatal and perinatal history was uneventful. His developmental age was age appropriate up to 18 months of age before the attack of meningoencephalitis then there is stagnation of motor， cognitive and speech development. He is anthropometrically well thrived and vaccinated as per EPI schedule. On examination there is no facial dysmorphism， OFC 48 cm which lies above 10\"centile on centile chart. On neurological examination he is conscious， cooperative， no sign of meningeal irritation， no cranial nerve palsies， motor examination reveals hypertonicity present in left upper and lower limb with brisk deep tendon reflexes， plantar extensor on left. His motor developmental age around 18 months， speech and cognitive age corresponds the age of 18. Interictal EEG showed right fronto-temporo parietal discharge with generalized slowing of background activity . Brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging(MRI) showed hyper intensity on T2WI and FLAIR images on the whole right cerebral hemispheres with leptomeningeal enhancement Right lateral ventricles are effaced . Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) of brain shows decrease NAApeak and normal choline peak. His routine blood and CSF investigations all are within normal limits. On the basis of clinical criteria based on European consensus criteria proposed on 2005 we diagnosed the case as Rasmussen's encephalitis and started Inj. Methylprednisolone at a dose of 30 mg/kg for 5 days followed by oral prednisolone 2mg/kg for one month and tapering for next one month along with antiepileptics levetiracetam and clobazam. With this treatment his clinical improvement obtained and complained no seizure activity for last 3 months. Now he can ran and able to talk two word sentence. Parents were advised to come for follow up visit regularly； they were also counseled about the nature and treatment plan of the disease and also instructed to continue his physiotherapy， speech therapy and cognitive behavior therapy.\n\n【6】Discussion\n\n【7】Here we report a case of a three year six month old boy presented with recurrent focal seizure， weakness of one side of body after 18months of normal development. Diagnosis of RE is based on clinical and neuro-radiological criteria based on European consensus criteria proposed on 2005 . Progressive neuroimaging deterioration indicates the chronic inflammatory nature of the disease.\n\n【8】This disorder is rare and usually affects children with median age of onset 6 years， but our patient presents at early age. Delayed presentation may also reported by Klaa et al. There is no gender preference. RE almost in every patients involved one hemisphere of brain which progressively atrophied in the course of time， typical disease course usually follow the pattern of variable prodromal period which is usually contains minor sign and symptoms of viral fever then the patients enters in to the acute stage which is characterized by progressive deterioration of functions of the affected hemispheres like hemiparesis， hemianopia， cognitive deterioration， aphasia and predominantly intractable unilateral focal motor seizure with or without secondary generalization . Epilepsia Partialis Continua (EPC) in the form of focal myoclonic twitching of facial muscles or muscles of distal extremities persisted for more than one hour with seizure free interval less than ten seconds is one of the characteristics features of RE that may present among half of the patients. Some patients may present without any evidence of seizures. Acute stage of the disease usually persists around 8 to 10months thereafter a phase of residual stage came which have a stable neurological deficit but seizure activity remains high but low compared to acute stage . Several studies has been carried out to search the etiology of RE，Rasmussen and their colleagues in their index paper suggested slow viral infection as a causative factors but still it is neither established nor excluded as a causal association . Antibody mediated pathogenetic hypothesis originated in 1994， antibodies to subunit 3 of the AMPA receptor (Glu R3 antibodies) had been suggested to dominate pathogenesis. Other anti-neuronal antibodies such as Munc-18， and the alpha7-acetylcholine receptor were identified in some patients with RE . Function of cytotoxic T cells is now considered in the pathogenesis of RE， where affected hemispheres found to be infiltrated with cytotoxic CD8+T cell， astrocytic degeneration caused by cytotoxic T lymphocyte attack give rise to neuronal cell death and seizure induction . Abnormal Electroencephalography (EEG) as slow background with slow focal and epileptic abnormalities in the lesion hemisphere present in the acute stage later on interictal abnormal discharge may appear on unaffected hemispheres . Brain MRI is one of the best tools for diagnostic evaluation and to assess the prognosis of the disease， at the early stage unilateral hyper intensity in T2， FLAIR image noticed in the cortical， subcortical region， then unihemispheric atrophy sets on， our case typically follow those changes. Most of the tissue loss happens from the 12 months onset of symptoms. Usually post contrast enhancement less commonly present in RE. Functional imaging like Flurodeoxyglucose-Positron Emission Tomography(FDG-PET) shows diffuse hypometabolism of affected segment. Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) studies showed decreased N-Acetyl-Aspartate (NAA) levels and increased or normal choline peaks resulting in a decreased NAA/Cho-ratio suggestive of neuronal loss or dysfunction .\n\n【9】As the etiology is still clearly not known so the treatment is aimed to symptoms and inflammation， to control seizure and to prevent further deterioration of neurological deficit effective AEDs， immunotherapy and surgery are the main modalities of treatment. Immunosuppressive， immunomodulatory and antiviral treatment approaches have been tried in different studies， among them corticosteroid found to be effective on seizure control and neurological improvement. Forlong term steroid therapy started with bolus methylprednisolone 20 mg/kg to 30 mg/kg， followed by oral prednisolone 1 mg/kg to 2 mg/kg for months then slow tapering. Here in our patients we followed the regimen with significant improvement in seizure remission and also there is improvement observed in motor， speech and cognitive domain. IVIG and IVIG plus steroid other modalities of immunotherapy also found effective by some reports . Tacrolimus also found as superior outcome regarding neurological function but not found as effective as seizure control . Other immunotherapies targeting to T-cells like cyclophosphamide， natalizumab and alemtuzumab helps to reduce the inflammatory reaction of RE patients . Epilepsy surgery may consider in case of refractory epilepsy for seizure control but neurological deficit could not be avoided. Functional hemispherectomy and hemispherotomy are associated with lower complications compared to anatomical hemispherectomies .\n\n【10】As the etiology of the disease is still controversial so specific managementapproach detected at F pathogenic factors， most work is now directed to the activation of infiltration CD8+ T cells and microglia to ensure the alternative of surgical management. Early suspicion at early stage with proper management to halt the inflammatory process will help to prevent neurological deficits.\n\n【11】Conclusion\n\n【12】Rasmussenencephalitis is a rarechroni1cCprogressive unihemispheric inflammatory disease manifested with recurrent focal seizure， hemiparesis and neurocognitive deterioration. Neuroimage， EEG findings， early suspicion with exclusion of possible differential diagnosis may help to diagnose the patients earlier and will add better prognosis.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 11:05:05", "endTime": "2024/09/24 11:05:12", "cost": 7.233}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:31", "update_time": "2024-09-23 19:05:12", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 19:05:04"}

World Health Organization (WHO) recommends every newborn baby to feed breast milk within 1-h of birth and feed colostrum. However， in Ethiopia， colostrum feeding is poorly practiced and culture makes a difference in the acceptability of colostrum. Thus， the study aimed to assess the knowledge， attitude， and practice of colostrum feeding among lactating women in Northeast Ethiopia， 2021.\n\n【2】Methods： An institution-based cross-sectional study was done in Debre Berhan town from May to June 2021. A systematic random sampling technique was used to recruit 308 participants. The data was cleaned， coded， and entered into Epi-Info software version 7.2.1 and exported to SPSS version 24.0 statistical software for analysis. Univariable analysis was computed and the finding was summarized using frequency tables. For continuous variables， means and standard deviations were computed.\n\n【3】Result： The overall prevalence of good knowledge， favorable attitude， and good practice ofcolostrum feeding among participants was 74%， 69.4%， and 56.2%， respectively. Believe that colostrum feeding cause's abdominal pain and diarrhea (51.2%)， and culture (30%) were the main reasons for avoidance of colostrum. About 26.9% of mothers initiate prelacteal feeding. Butter and non-human milk were the commonest prelacteal feedings.\n\n【4】Conclusion： The knowledge， attitude， and practice of colostrum feeding were very low. Health education dissemination should be given to all reproductive age groups， pregnant and postnatal mothers， and community members regarding the importance of colostrum and avoidance of prelacteal feeding. Besides， emphasis should be placed on harmful cultural practices to increase the level of practice.\n\n【5】Keywords： Knowledge； Attitude； Practice； Colostrum； Ethiopi\n\n【6】Abbreviations\n\n【7】ANC： Antenatal Care； CSA： Central Statistical Agency； EDHS： Ethiopia Demographic and Health Survey； EPI： Expanded program of immunization； KAP： Knowledge， Attitude and Practice； UNICEF： United Nation Childrens Fund； WHO： World Health Organization\n\n【8】Introduction\n\n【9】Colostrum is the first milk produced by the mammary glands of mammals immediately following the birth of the newborn and continuing through the early days of breastfeeding . This is the most suitable food for the newborn and ensures the neonate's adaptation and successful transition to independent postnatal life. This special milk is thick， sticky， and yellow to orange in color . It is very rich in proteins， carbohydrates， immunoglobulins， vitamin A and sodium chloride， but contains lower amounts of lipids，fat， and potassium than normal milk. Thus， it helps to fight against various viral， bacterial， fungal， and protozoal infections. Besides， it protects against childhood and adolescent illnesses， i.e.，pneumonia， diarrhea， overweight， obesity， various cancers， asthma， allergies， and autoimmune diseases that are difficult to treat .\n\n【10】Early initiation of breastfeeding (provision of breast milks to infants immediately/within 1-h of birth) is important for both the mother and the child and confirms that the infant receives the protective milk， the colostrum . Early initiation of breastfeeding protects the newborn from diseases， encourages bonding between the mother and her newborn， facilitates the production of regular breast milk， and helps the uterus contract， reducing the postpartum hemorrhage . In addition， colostrum has a laxative effect that encourages passage of the baby’s first stool(meconium) which intern helps to clear excess bilirubin produced in large quantities at birth and helps prevent jaundice . For most children breastfeeding makes the difference between life and death and is the infants “passport to life\". Colostrum is also considered the first vaccine for newborns. Even if it is secreted in small amounts (30ml to 100 ml per day)， the mothers need to be explained that this small amount of colostrum is adequate for the infant and must not be discouraged .\n\n【11】A secondary analysis of the WHO Global Survey on Maternal and Perinatal Health indicated that the prevalence of Early Initiation of Breastfeeding (EIBF) ranges from 17.7% to 98.4% (average 57.6%). According to data from 35 Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS)， the timely initiation of breastfeeding in SSA is 58%， ranging from 24% in Chad to 86% in Burundi . In Ethiopia， 73% of children begin breastfeeding within 1 h after birth，92% of infants breastfed within 1 day of birth， and 8% of children receive prelacteal feeding. Amhara region is the third-lowest region in the level of early initiation of breastfeeding (66%).\n\n【12】Malnutrition has been a cause directly or indirectly for millions of deaths annually among under-five children. Globally in 2020， over 149 million children under 5 were estimated to be stunted，45million were wasted， and 38.9 million were overweight or obese. Under nutrition accounts for about 45% of deaths among under 5years of age. They are the most vulnerable groups to ill health. These mostly occur in low-and middle-income countries particularly in Southern Asia， Asia， and Africa. However， the number of children with stunting has declined in all regions except Africa . One of the main reasons for under nutrition is delayed breastfeeding along with colostrum avoidance .Additionally，newborns who initiated breastfeeding 2 h to 23 h after birth had a 33% greater risk of neonatal mortality， and those who initiated after 24 h of birth had an 85%greater risk of neonatal mortality than those initiated within 1-h of birth . Universal optimal breastfeeding could save more than800，000 child death per year ， and an estimated 20，000 annual deaths from breast cancer .\n\n【13】In a study of Wolaita Zone， 66% of mothers were knowledgeable and 70% had a positive attitude towards colostrum feeding . Though 90% of mothers in the Tigray region knew about colostrum feeding； only 48% of them started colostrum feeding within 1-h of birth . According to a study done in Bench Maji Zone， 66.6%，69.4%， and 72.4% of mothers had good knowledge， positive attitude， and practice colostrum feeding， respectively . In Debre Tabor， 74%of mothers gave colostrum to their index children .\n\n【14】In Harar town， 8% of mothers discourage colostrum feeding because of increased abdominal cramping (45%)， difficulty to digest(18%)， and belief it is polished (36%) . Similarly in Debre Tabor，12% of mothers thought that colostrum doesn’t contain sufficient milk secretions . Further， in North-Eastern Ethiopia， 13.5% of mothers discard colostrum. The reasons for colostrum avoidance were a belief that colostrum is not good (26%)， traditional (23.5%)， and thought colostrum milk is dirty (22.4%) . The 2016 Ethiopian Demographic Health Survey (EDHS) results showed that theneonatal， infant and under 5 mortality rates were 29，48， and 67 deaths per 1，000live births， respectively . Besides， in Ethiopia， colostrum feeding is still unsatisfactory. These major child deaths can be reduced by immediate initiation of breastfeeding and colostrum after birth . Thus， this study aimed to assess the knowledge， attitude， and practice of colostrum feeding among lactating women in North Shewa Zone， Ethiopia，2021.\n\n【15】Methods\n\n【16】Study setting， design， and population\n\n【17】An institution-based cross-sectional study was done in Debre Berhan town from May to June 2021. Debre Birhan is the capital city of the North Shewa Zone of Amhara Region and is located 130km Northeast of Addis Ababa on the Ethiopian highway. It is the highest town in Africa with an elevation of 2，840 m. Debre Berhan has fourteen kebeles with a total population of 1，10，500； of whom 14，966are children under five years. The town has 2 hospitals， 3 Health centers， 14 clinics， and around 20 pharmacies.\n\n【18】All lactating women presented for an Expanded Program of Immunization (EPI) in the North Shewa Zone health facilities were the source population. All lactating women who fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were available at the time of the data collection were the study population. Randomly selected mothers with infants less than6 months of age presented for EPI were included. Lactating mothers with known chronic illnesses (Hepatitis B/C and HIV/AIDS)， had active herpes simplex virus infection with lesions present on the breast， who delivered premature baby， and birth defects (cleft lip/palate) were excluded from the study.\n\n【19】Sample size， sampling technique， and procedure\n\n【20】The sample size was determined using Open Epi Version 3.03. The following assumptions were considered： 95% confidence level，5% margin of error， and proportion， 74.4% of practice of colostrum feeding . Adding a 5% non-response rate， the final sample size equals 308.\n\n【21】The number of mothers with infants less than 6 months of age visiting the health facilities was obtained from the respective health institutions EPI registration book. Then systematic random sampling was applied to proportionally select mothers from all health institutions included in the study.\n\n【22】Data collection tool， quality control， andstatistical analysis\n\n【23】A striictuired and pre-tested interviewer-administered questionnaire was used to collect data. The questionnaire was adapted from different works ofliterature and modified according to the local context. The questionnaire was first prepared in English and then translated to the local language， Amharic， and then back to English to maintain consistency. The questionnaire was pre-tested on 5% of the samples in Deneba health center which was not selected in the study. The questionnaire was modified based on the result obtained from the pre-test. In addition， one-day training was given to the data collectors and supervisors about the obiective and methods of data collection. The supervisor and principal investigators daily checked and reviewed the data for completeness， clarity， and consistency.\n\n【24】The data was cleaned， coded， and entered into Epi-Info software version 7.2.1 and exported to SPSS version 24.0 statistical software for analysis. Univariable analysis was computed and the finding was summarized using frequency tables. The means and standard deviations were estimated for continuous variables.\n\n【25】Measurement\n\n【26】Knowledge： Participants who answered greater than or equals to 60% of the knowledge questions were considered to have“Good knowledge\"， whereas those who scored below 60% were considered as having \"Poor knowledge”.\n\n【27】Attitude： Participants who responded greater than or equals to60% of the attitude questions were considered to have a “Favorable attitude\"， whereas those who scored less than 60% were considered as having“Unfavorable attitude .\n\n【28】Practice： Is the overt habit of feeding colostrum/first thick and yellowish milk to the newborn within the first three days of birth without prelacteal feeding.\n\n【29】Optimal breastfeeding practice： Is the early initiation of breastfeeding within 1 h of birth， exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months of life， and continued breastfeeding for up to 2 years or beyond with appropriate complementary feeding beginning at 6months .\n\n【30】Prelacteal feeding： If the newborn is given any solid or liquid foods other than breast milk during the first 3 days of birth.\n\n【31】Ethical clearance\n\n【32】Ethical clearance was obtained from Debre Berhan University， Institute of Medicine and Health Sciences. A cooperation letter was written to the selected health institutions. After explaining the objective and benefits of the study， written informed consent was obtained from voluntary participants. Confidentiality was ensured.\n\n【33】Result\n\n【34】Socio-demographic characteristics\n\n【35】A total of 290 mothers were interviewed in this study making a94.2% response rate. The mean age of participants was 29+5.45 years. Half of the respondents (52%) belonged to the age group of 20 to 34years. About 77.2% of mothers are housewives， and 91.7% of them are married. Regarding monthly income， 41.4% of mothers earn less than2000 Birr per month .\n\n【36】Utilization of maternal health service\n\n【37】About 45.9% of mothers had only one child. More than half(53.8%) of women had Antenatal Care (ANC) follow-up， however， only 7% of them had postnatal care visits. Around 61% of women were counseled about early breastfeeding during antenatal care follow-ups .\n\n【38】Knowledge of colostrum feeding\n\n【39】More than half (54.5%) of mothers have heard about colostrum feeding. Health provider (51%) was the main source of information about colostrum feeding. Around 53.8% of mothers know that colostrum is the best nutrition for the newborn . The overall prevalence of good knowledge of colostrum feeding among participants was 74%， 95% CI (68.4).\n\n【40】Attitude towards colostrum feeding\n\n【41】About 38.3% of mothers believe that colostrum causes diarrhea， and 41.7% think that colostrum breast milk is dirty and looks like pus. Besides， more than half of mothers (57.2%) agree that colostrum is important for growth and mental development .

Believe that colostrum feeding causes abdominal pain and diarrhea (51.2%)，and culture (30%) were the main reasons for avoiding colostrum feeding. Butter and non-human milk were the commonest prelacteal feedings .\n\n【48】Discussion\n\n【49】In this study， 74%， 69.4%， and 56.2% of mothers had good knowledge， favorable attitude， andgood practice of colostrum feeding， respectively. The main reasons for colostrum avoidance were a belief that colostrum feeding causes abdominal pain and diarrhea and culture. About 26.9% of mothers initiate prelacteal feeding. Butter and non-human milk were the commonest prelacteal feedings.\n\n【50】In the current study，74%， CI (68.4) of mothers had good knowledge about colostrum. Similarly in Pakistan， 70% of mothers had good knowledge about the health benefits of colostrum .\n\n【51】Table 2： Utilization of maternal health care services in North Shewa Zone， Ethiopia， 2021.\n\n| Variable  | Category  | Frequehcy  | Percent(100%)  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Parity  | Primigravida  | 133  | 45.9  |\n| Parity  | Multipara  | 157  | 54.1  |\n| Antenatal care visit  | Yes  | 156  | 53.8  |\n| Antenatal care visit  | No  | 134  | 46.2  |\n| Number of ANC visits(N=156)  | One time  | 43  | 27.6  |\n| Number of ANC visits(N=156)  | Two times  | 80  | 51.3  |\n| Number of ANC visits(N=156)  | Tree times  | 22  | 14.1  |\n| Number of ANC visits(N=156)  | Four times  | 11  | 7  |\n| Counseling about colostrumfeeding during ANC visit(N=156)  | Yes  | 95  | 60.9  |\n| Counseling about colostrumfeeding during ANC visit(N=156)  | No  | 61  | 39.1  |\n| Place of delivery  | Health institution  | 173  | 59.7  |\n| Place of delivery  | Home  | 117  | 40.3  |\n| Mode of delivery  | Cesarean section  | 11  | 3.8  |\n| Mode of delivery  | Vaginal delivery  | 279  | 96.2  |\n| Postnatal care visit  | Yes  | 19  | 6.6  |\n| Postnatal care visit  | No  | 271  | 93.4  |\n\n【53】Table 3： Knowledge of colostrum feeding among mothers in North Shewa Zone， Ethiopia， 2021.\n\n| Variable  | Category  | Frequency  | Percent  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Have you ever heard aboutColostrum feeding?  | Yes  | 158  | 54.5  |\n| Have you ever heard aboutColostrum feeding?  | No  | 132  | 45.5  |\n| Source ot intormation  | Health care provider  | 148  | 51  |\n| Source ot intormation  | Health extensionworkers  | 109  | 37.6  |\n| Source ot intormation  | Mass Media (TV/Radio)  | 33  | 11.4  |\n| Colostrum gives naturalimmunity  | Yes  | 120  | 41，4  |\n| Colostrum gives naturalimmunity  | No  | 111  | 38.3  |\n| Colostrum gives naturalimmunity  | Idon't know  | 59  | 20.3  |\n| Colostrum is the bestnutrition for the newborn.  | Yes  | 156  | 53.8  |\n| Colostrum is the bestnutrition for the newborn.  | No  | 107  | 36.9  |\n| Colostrum is the bestnutrition for the newborn.  | Idon't know  | 27  | 9.3  |\n| Colostrum is thick， sticky，and yellowish.  | Yes  | 254  | 87.6  |\n| Colostrum is thick， sticky，and yellowish.  | No  | 34  | 11.7  |\n| Colostrum is thick， sticky，and yellowish.  | I don't know  | 2  | 7  |\n| Time of initiation of the firstbreast milk  | Within one hour of birth  | 192  | 66.2  |\n| Time of initiation of the firstbreast milk  | Within six hours of birth  | 56  | 19.3  |\n| Time of initiation of the firstbreast milk  | After 24 hours of birth  | 29  | 10  |\n| Time of initiation of the firstbreast milk  | I don't know  | 13  | 4.5  |\n| Day's colostrum will stay  | For 1 day  | 24  | 8.3  |\n| Day's colostrum will stay  | For 2 days  | 47  | 16.2  |\n| Day's colostrum will stay  | For 3 days  | 131  | 45.2  |\n| Day's colostrum will stay  | More than 3 days  | 88  | 30.3  |\n\n【55】In addition， in Nepal， 74% of women had heard about colostrum and 69% of them knew its nutritional advantage . About 73.8%of mothers in the Bench Maji Zone also had good knowledge of colostrum feeding . However， this was higher than the findings from Wolaita Zone  which found that 66.1% of participants were knowledgeable on colostrum feeding. This might be due to the differences in socioeconomic， culture， and study period. In the current study， 55% of mothers are urban residents compared to 48%in Wolaita Zone. This might increase access to information from various sources (mass media and campaigns). Further， the higher knowledge may be the result of health information dissemination and awareness creation done by the health extension workers in the study area.\n\n【56】On the otherhand， the result was lower than the study conducted in Mekelle city which showed that 89.7% of mothers had good knowledge about colostrum feeding . The variation maybe because of the differences in socio-cultural， geographical， and utilization of maternal health care services. In the current study， 53.8% of mothers had Antenatal Care (ANC) follow-up compared to 83% in Mekelle，60.9% have been counseled about colostrum during ANC follow-up compared to 86.7%， and 59.7% of mothers delivered in health institutions compared to 81.5% in Mekelle. The utilization of health services increases access to health education and promotion.\n\n【57】This study found that 69.4%， CI (.5) of mothers had a favorable attitude towards colostrum feeding. This is similar to the studies done in Bench Maji Zone ， Mekelle ， and Wolaita Zone which reported that 69.7%， 67.2%， and 69.9% of mothers had a positive attitude about colostrum feeding， respectively. However，this result was lower than 89% in Harar town . This discrepancy might be due to differences in the study setting， socio-cultural deference， and a better understanding of colostrum feeding among the study participants living in Harar city.\n\n【58】This study also assessed the practice of colostrum feeding by mothers and the finding showed that colostrum feeding is practiced by 56.2%， CI (51.3). WHO recommends every newborn baby to feed breast milk within 1 h of birth and feed colostrum. This was comparableto the study done in Mizan Tepi Teaching Hospital(60.8%). A study from Debre Tabor  showed that colostrum feeding is practiced by 74.4% of mothers which is higher than the current study. Similarly， it is lower than 72% in Pakistan  and 80.5% in Mekelle. The variation may account for sociodemographic differences and cultural beliefs. Debre Berhan communities are more bigoted for culture and religion. In addition， it may be due to variation in information access and utilization of maternal health care services including place of delivery.\n\n【59】According to this study， 43.8% of mothers avoid colostrum. About51.2% of mothers believe that colostrum causes abdominal pain and diarrhea and 29.9% of them believe that it is culturally forbidden. A study in Pakistan reflected a similar finding where 28% of mothers feel that colostrum is not milk， having harmful effects on child health and may cause diarrhea. Mothers prefer to feed water， honey， or herbal preparation in place of the colostrum . Similarly， in Mizan Tepi， 60.5% of mothers believe that colostrum harms both the mother and her newborns . A cross-sectional study in Bure identified the reasons for colostrum avoidance and found colostrum causes neonatal illness (2.3%)， is culturally forbidden (4%) and is very thick(2.7%). Further， in the Raya Kobo district， untrained traditional birth attendants believed colostrum causes abdominal cramps and raw butter cleans an infant's stomach. They recommend discarding colostrum and fed raw butter before initiation of breastfeeding . This could be due to low educational attainment and poor access to information and health care.\n\n【60】Table 4： Attitude of mothers towards colostrum feeding in North Shewa Zone， Ethiopia， 2021.\n\n| Variables  | Agree，n(%)  | Disagree， n(%)  | Neutral，n(%)  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Baby's do not like colostrum breast milk.  | 52(17.7)  | 214(73.8)  | 24(8.3)  |\n| Colostrum causes diarrhea for an infant.  | 111(38.3)  | 159(54.8)  | 20(6.9)  |\n| Colostrum makes the baby sick.  | 111(38.3)  | 159(54.8)  | 20(6.9)  |\n| Colostrum is a dirty part of milk.  | 121(41.7)  | 158(54.5)  | 11(3.9)  |\n| Colostrum milk is difficult to digest.  | 112(38.6)  | 160(55.2)  | 18(6.2)  |\n| Necessary to discard colostrum.  | 116(40.0)  | 161(55.5)  | 13(4.5)  |\n| Colostrum is forbidden in culture.  | 112(38.6)  | 151(52.1)  | 27(9.3)  |\n| Colostrum impairs growth and development.  | 93 (32.1)  | 166(57.2)  | 31(10.7)  |\n\n【62】Table 5： Practice of colostrum feeding in North Shewa Zone， Ethiopia， 2021.\n\n| Variable  | Category  | Frequency  | Percent  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Have you fed calastrum far your baby within the first three days of birth?  | Yes  | 163  | 56.2  |\n| Have you fed calastrum far your baby within the first three days of birth?  | No  | 127  | 43.8  |\n| Initiation of first breast milk  | Within one hour  | 98  | 60.1  |\n| Initiation of first breast milk  | Within six hours  | 42  | 25.8  |\n| Initiation of first breast milk  | After 24 hours  | 23  | 14.1  |\n| Reasons for not feeding colostrum  | Medical reason  | 5  | 3.9  |\n| Reasons for not feeding colostrum  | The baby can't suck  | 5  | 3.9  |\n| Reasons for not feeding colostrum  | Breast can't secrete  | 14  | 11.1  |\n| Reasons for not feeding colostrum  | Cause abdominal pain and diarrhea  | 65  | 51.2  |\n| Reasons for not feeding colostrum  | Culture  | 38  | 29.9  |\n| Prelacteal teeding  | Yes  | 78  | 26.9  |\n| Prelacteal teeding  | No  | 212  | 73.1  |\n| If yes， what did you give the baby?  | Non-human milk  | 26  | 33.3  |\n| If yes， what did you give the baby?  | Butter  | 41  | 52.6  |\n| If yes， what did you give the baby?  | Plain water  | 8  | 10.3  |\n| If yes， what did you give the baby?  | Water with sugar  | 78  | 3.8  |\n\n【64】Limitation of the Study\n\n【65】Participants may answer questions in a manner that would be viewed favorablyby others (Social desirability bias).

Post contrast there was significant diffuse meningeal enhancement. These findings suggested rupture of the cyst causing aseptic chemical meningitis . Patient was treated with steroids and following treatment she showed significant relief of symptoms.\n\n【10】Follow-up MRI brain done after one week revealed almost complete resolution of the Neuroenteric cyst with thin floating membranes in CSF space . Patient was clinically asymptomatic and discharged. Follow-up MRI could not be done since patient informed us on telephone that she was absolutely fine and not willing for repeat imaging.\n\n【11】Discussion\n\n【12】Neuroenteric cysts are rare tumor like cystic lesions seen in spine and brain harboring heterotopic endodermal tissue. In 1928， Kubie  first described it as teratomatous cysts and later as intestinomas by Puuseep  in 1934. In 1954， the current name of Neuroenteric cyst was given by Matson et al.\n\n【13】These are benign cysts of foregut origin with endodermal lining from the incomplete dissolution of the neuroenteric canal. There are two theories which describe the origin of these cysts. First， at the time of notochordal development， failure of separation of notochord and foregut during the process of excalation leads to incorporation of endodermal cells with notochord which later becomes Neuroenteric cysts . Second theory is of an endodermal diverticulum behind the oropharyngeal membrane called as Seesel pouch which may be a progenitor for midline supratentorial cysts .\n\n【14】These cysts are mostly seen in the spine but can be rarely seen intra cranially. They are commonly seen in posterior fossa， anterior to brainstem， frequently in midline and sometimes in cerebellopontine angle .\n\n【15】Histologically the intracranial Neuroenteric cysts are classified as mucin poor and mucin rich based on the content of mucin within the cyst. The mucin poor cyst shows pseudostratified ciliated columnar epithelium while the mucin rich cyst shows simple columnar epithelium .\n\n【16】Few important imaging features of neuroenteric cyst have been described. Also， the imaging characteristics vary as per the content of the cyst like the mucin， a proteinaceous secretion. On Computed tomography， Mucin rich cysts appear hyperdense and mucin poor appear mildly hypodense. In MRI imaging， the protein content tends to vary the signal characteristics on T1 and T2. The lesions appears hyper intense on FLAIR sequence， predominantly hyper intense on T2W and sometimes hypo intense and on T1W it appears hyper to isointense compared to CSF. Contrast study shows no obvious contrast enhancement except at the site where the cyst is adherent with brain parenchyma .\n\n【17】Neuroenteric cyst can be circular or lobulated and significantly hypo intense on T2W images due to presence ofhigh protein content， squamous metaplasia and keratin debris. Presence of NAA like peak at 2.02 ppm on MR spectroscopy was considered specific for these cysts . This NAA like peak is supposed to be secreted by celllining of the cyst wall and contains perchloric acid or sialic acid bound to macromolecules resonating at 2.02 ppm .\n\n【18】The main differential diagnosis of neuroenteric cyst are arachnoid cyst， epidermoid cyst， dermoid cyst rarely Rathke and colloid cyst. However imaging features can differentiate between these cysts. Arachnoid cyst is of CSF intensity on all the MRI sequences， epidermoid cyst shows restricted diffusion， Rathke and colloid cyst have different site of location. The presence of N-Acetyl Aspartate(NAA) like peak at 2.02 ppm is also considered as specific finding in neuroenteric cyst which is absent in other cysts .\n\n【19】Similar imaging features were noted in our case. In addition we found heavily T2W sequence like CISS 3D very useful in differentiating these cysts. IN CISS sequence we can clearly define the wall of the cyst and it appears hypo intense compared to surrounding CSF with smooth wall. The wall of epidermoid cyst however can appear irregular or frond like on CISS sequence . As a rare complication， these cysts can spontaneously leak slowly or rupture following trauma leading to aseptic chemical meningitis .\n\n【20】The recurrentaseptic meningitis is calledasSMollaret meningitis associated with CSF pleocytosis predominantly with polymorphonuclear cells and caused by virus however Mollaret meningitis due to slow leakage of epidermoid cyst are reported . Similarly Mollaret meningitis is also reported due to slow leakage from neuroenteric cyst 21.\n\n【21】In a ruptured dermoid cyst， fat globules can be seen in the subarachnoid space as hyper intensities on T1 weighted images， subtle sulcal FLAIR hyper intensities and leptomeningeal enhancement on contrast study due to chemical meningitis . Similar imaging picture can be seen in ruptured neuroenteric cyst. The chemical meningitis in neuroenteric cyst could be due to its enteric mucin contents.\n\n【22】In our case， patient initially presented with headache and vomiting probably suggesting leakage of neuroenteric cyst and aseptic meningitis however there was no obvious contrast enhancement on imaging. Subsequently，the neuroenteric cyst ruptured spontaneously during the hospital course causing chemical aseptic meningitis with sulcal and cisternal FLAIRhyperintensity and intense leptomeningeal enhancement. Following treatment with steroids， patient recovered completely within two days. Follow-up imaging showed near total resolution of the neuroenteric cyst. In our knowledge this is first case， showing near total resolution of the neuroenteric cyst following spontaneous rupture without any obvious trauma. We could not get the imaging follow up of the patient but telephonic follow-up suggested that patient was asymptomatic.\n\n【23】Conclusion\n\n【24】Clinical signs of headache and vomiting in a known case of neuroenteric cyst could be the warning sign of impending rupture and spontaneous rupture can occur leading to partial or complete resolution. Also CISS 3D sequence (heavily T2W) can be used additionally to further characterize the cystic lesions.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [{"text": "21.", "content": "【0】Abstract\n\n【1】Neuroenteric cysts are congenital cysts commonly seen in the spine.

Post contrast there was significant diffuse meningeal enhancement. These findings suggested rupture of the cyst causing aseptic chemical meningitis . Patient was treated with steroids and following treatment she showed significant relief of symptoms.\n\n【10】Follow-up MRI brain done after one week revealed almost complete resolution of the Neuroenteric cyst with thin floating membranes in CSF space . Patient was clinically asymptomatic and discharged. Follow-up MRI could not be done since patient informed us on telephone that she was absolutely fine and not willing for repeat imaging.\n\n【11】Discussion\n\n【12】Neuroenteric cysts are rare tumor like cystic lesions seen in spine and brain harboring heterotopic endodermal tissue. In 1928， Kubie  first described it as teratomatous cysts and later as intestinomas by Puuseep  in 1934. In 1954， the current name of Neuroenteric cyst was given by Matson et al.\n\n【13】These are benign cysts of foregut origin with endodermal lining from the incomplete dissolution of the neuroenteric canal. There are two theories which describe the origin of these cysts. First， at the time of notochordal development， failure of separation of notochord and foregut during the process of excalation leads to incorporation of endodermal cells with notochord which later becomes Neuroenteric cysts . Second theory is of an endodermal diverticulum behind the oropharyngeal membrane called as Seesel pouch which may be a progenitor for midline supratentorial cysts .\n\n【14】These cysts are mostly seen in the spine but can be rarely seen intra cranially. They are commonly seen in posterior fossa， anterior to brainstem， frequently in midline and sometimes in cerebellopontine angle .\n\n【15】Histologically the intracranial Neuroenteric cysts are classified as mucin poor and mucin rich based on the content of mucin within the cyst. The mucin poor cyst shows pseudostratified ciliated columnar epithelium while the mucin rich cyst shows simple columnar epithelium .\n\n【16】Few important imaging features of neuroenteric cyst have been described. Also， the imaging characteristics vary as per the content of the cyst like the mucin， a proteinaceous secretion. On Computed tomography， Mucin rich cysts appear hyperdense and mucin poor appear mildly hypodense. In MRI imaging， the protein content tends to vary the signal characteristics on T1 and T2. The lesions appears hyper intense on FLAIR sequence， predominantly hyper intense on T2W and sometimes hypo intense and on T1W it appears hyper to isointense compared to CSF. Contrast study shows no obvious contrast enhancement except at the site where the cyst is adherent with brain parenchyma .\n\n【17】Neuroenteric cyst can be circular or lobulated and significantly hypo intense on T2W images due to presence ofhigh protein content， squamous metaplasia and keratin debris. Presence of NAA like peak at 2.02 ppm on MR spectroscopy was considered specific for these cysts . This NAA like peak is supposed to be secreted by celllining of the cyst wall and contains perchloric acid or sialic acid bound to macromolecules resonating at 2.02 ppm .\n\n【18】The main differential diagnosis of neuroenteric cyst are arachnoid cyst， epidermoid cyst， dermoid cyst rarely Rathke and colloid cyst. However imaging features can differentiate between these cysts. Arachnoid cyst is of CSF intensity on all the MRI sequences， epidermoid cyst shows restricted diffusion， Rathke and colloid cyst have different site of location. The presence of N-Acetyl Aspartate(NAA) like peak at 2.02 ppm is also considered as specific finding in neuroenteric cyst which is absent in other cysts .\n\n【19】Similar imaging features were noted in our case. In addition we found heavily T2W sequence like CISS 3D very useful in differentiating these cysts. IN CISS sequence we can clearly define the wall of the cyst and it appears hypo intense compared to surrounding CSF with smooth wall. The wall of epidermoid cyst however can appear irregular or frond like on CISS sequence . As a rare complication， these cysts can spontaneously leak slowly or rupture following trauma leading to aseptic chemical meningitis .\n\n【20】The recurrentaseptic meningitis is calledasSMollaret meningitis associated with CSF pleocytosis predominantly with polymorphonuclear cells and caused by virus however Mollaret meningitis due to slow leakage of epidermoid cyst are reported . Similarly Mollaret meningitis is also reported due to slow leakage from neuroenteric cyst 21.\n\n【21】In a ruptured dermoid cyst， fat globules can be seen in the subarachnoid space as hyper intensities on T1 weighted images， subtle sulcal FLAIR hyper intensities and leptomeningeal enhancement on contrast study due to chemical meningitis . Similar imaging picture can be seen in ruptured neuroenteric cyst. The chemical meningitis in neuroenteric cyst could be due to its enteric mucin contents.\n\n【22】In our case， patient initially presented with headache and vomiting probably suggesting leakage of neuroenteric cyst and aseptic meningitis however there was no obvious contrast enhancement on imaging. Subsequently，the neuroenteric cyst ruptured spontaneously during the hospital course causing chemical aseptic meningitis with sulcal and cisternal FLAIRhyperintensity and intense leptomeningeal enhancement. Following treatment with steroids， patient recovered completely within two days. Follow-up imaging showed near total resolution of the neuroenteric cyst. In our knowledge this is first case， showing near total resolution of the neuroenteric cyst following spontaneous rupture without any obvious trauma. We could not get the imaging follow up of the patient but telephonic follow-up suggested that patient was asymptomatic.\n\n【23】Conclusion\n\n【24】Clinical signs of headache and vomiting in a known case of neuroenteric cyst could be the warning sign of impending rupture and spontaneous rupture can occur leading to partial or complete resolution. Also CISS 3D sequence (heavily T2W) can be used additionally to further characterize the cystic lesions.", "index": 6792, "show": true, "start": 6792, "end": 6795, "province": ["文本干净度", "页码/数字"], "isEdit": false, "comment": "【20】"}], "startTime": "2024/09/24 11:31:41", "endTime": "2024/09/24 11:32:16", "cost": 35.113}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:31", "update_time": "2024-09-23 19:32:16", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 19:31:40"}

When this phenomenon occurs at night， it is known as Nocturnal Enuresis (NE)， also known as bedwetting. It often leads to emotional and behavioral problems in the client and family， hence psychosocial intervention becomes effective.\n\n【2】Aim and Objective： To assess the psychosocial problems related to NE and provide intervention at individual and family levels.\n\n【3】Methodology： A single-subject case study design was used. The client and family members have explained the purpose of the study and proper written consent was taken from them. Pre and post-assessment were done， using assessment scales.\n\n【4】Result： Significant level of improvement was seen in post-assessment.\n\n【5】Conclusion： Psychosocial assessment and intervention is the need of the hour， in cases of NE.\n\n【6】Keywords： Nocturnal enuresis； Psychosocial intervention； Enuresis alarm； Care burden\n\n【7】Introduction\n\n【8】Nocturnal Enuresis (NE) is the inability to hold urine during the night. It is a physiological neuro-motor condition . The prevalence of nocturnal enuresis in male adults was found to be 2%to 3%， whereas， in female adults， it was found to be 23% to 39% . A study conducted by Guragac et al.  suggested that the condition of nocturnal enuresis may lead to emotional and behavioral problems such as stress， anxiety， depression， social shyness， lower self-esteem. The common risk factor associated with nocturnal enuresis may include genetic predisposition， obesity， and hypertension . Therefore， the present study was designed to see the effectiveness of psychosocial intervention in person with NE and his caregiver.\n\n【9】Methodology\n\n【10】The present study was a single-subject case study， where a quasi-experimental research design was used and pre-& post-tests were performed to identify the changes in scores. The case was identified at the outpatient department of LGBRIMH， Tezpur. Proper information about the study and confidentiality terms was provided to the person with NE and the caregiver after that written consent was signed.\n\n【11】Assessment scales used in the study\n\n【12】1. Family Assessment Device (FAD)： It is a 60-itemself-reported questionnaire designed to measure the family functioning of an individual. Cronbach alpha was found to range from 0.79 to0.815.\n\n【13】2. Family Attitude Scale (FAS)： It is a 30-itemself-reported questionnaire designed to measure the attitude of the family. Cronbach alpha was found to be 0.67 .\n\n【14】3. Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS 21)： It is a 42 items self-reported questionnaire， designed to measure emotional state. Cronbach alpha was found to be 0.69 .\n\n【15】4. Work Behavior Inventory (WBI)： It is a 7-item self-reported tool used to quantify an individual's behavior in terms of work styles and interaction at work. The Cronbach alpha was reported to be 0.85.\n\n【16】Case Introduction\n\n【17】Mr. X， 21 years， male， unmarried，Hindu， B.Tech (II) year student， hailing from the suburban area of Tezpur. The client came to the LGBRIMH， Tezpur outpatient department with the chief complaint of bedwetting (since childhood)， along with social shyness， poor appetite， and a pessimistic view of the future for 2 years. The mode of onset was insidious，continuous course of illness and deteriorating progress of the illness. The client’s mother as a primary caregiver mentioned that the client always preferred to stay at home in dark rooms， and had deteriorated a lot in studies and other physical activities. He was diagnosed with F41.2 (mixed anxiety and depressive disorder) with R32 (unspecified urinary incontinence)， according to the International Classification of Diseases  .\n\n【18】Family history\n\n【19】According to the informant (mother)， till 16 years of age， she had a history suggestive of nocturnal enuresis. The client's younger brother has a schizophrenia-like illness， with ongoing treatmer from LGBRIMH， Tezpur. The client's two paternal aunts have some non-affective mental illness. The client’s maternal grandmother has a history suggestive of cardiac ailment， diabetes mellitus， and hypertension.\n\n【20】Family dynamics\n\n【21】Based on the assessment scales and cross-sectional psychosocial interview， it was found that both internal and external family boundaries were semi-open. Father was the nominal head of the family， whereas， the mother was the functional head of the family. Decision-making was democratic style， but the father used to take the major decision of the family and tries to brief other members. A dysfunctional pattern of non-verbal communication was presented from children toward their father. The family failed to distribute their roles and responsibilities appropriately among all members. Coping and problem-solving were inadequate in the family.\n\n【22】Psychiatric social work intervention\n\n【23】Psychosocial assessment and intervention were provided to the client and the family (the mother was the primary caregiver) in the psychosocial unit of LGBRIMH， Tezpur. Altogether 14 sessions(seven individual sessions， three family primary caregiver sessions， and three follow-ups) were provided.\n\n【24】At individual level\n\n【25】1. Establishing rapport and therapeutic alliance (session1)： In the introductory session， a trustworthy objective relationship was developed between the client and the therapist. The client has explained the nature of the treatment. He has explained the nature of the treatment， the process of the intervention， and the expected outcome. Confidentiality assurance was given to him.\n\n【26】2. Dry bed training (session 2)： In this training， the client facilitated mandatory waking up at a sort interval at night for urination. Changing clothes， if urine spots are present for better hygiene. This intermittent wake-up at night helps the bladder to remain lightly weighted .\n\n【27】3. Behaviormodification1(session 3， 4)： Behavior modification is seen as the planned systematic application of the experimentally established principle of learning to the modification of maladaptive behavior especially to decrease undesired behavior and increase desired behavior. Here， techniques like reinforcement， punishment， shaping， Channing， fading， and prompting were used.\n\n【28】4. Alarm therapy/Enuresis alarm (session 5， 6)： It is one of the advanced treatment techniques， which is found to be an effective treatment of nocturnal enuresis. In this technique， an alarm with a sensor is kept nearby the client's bed. At midnight， whenever， a small amount of urine is passed in the bed， the alarm is activated， and the client can urinate properly in the bathroom. On repeated conditioning of this technique， the client develops a habit of waking up at night for urination .\n\n【29】5. Cognitive behavior therapy (session 7-8)： This therapy was planned to target automatic negative thoughts that can contribute to and worsen emotional difficulties， depression， and anxiety. The objective was to identify the negative thoughts， generate a list of possible solutions， and evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of each possible solution， to choose a solution and implementation. The ultimate goal of this therapy was to shift the client from an emotional focus coping to problem focus coping .\n\n【30】Table 1： Pre and post-test score of Family Assessment Device (FAD).\n\n|  | Pre-test Scores  |  | Post-test Scores  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Domains  | Obtained score/cut-otts  | Impression  | Obtained score/cut-offs  | Impression  |\n| Problem Solving  | 2.4/2.2  | Dysfunctional  | 1.9/2.2  | Normal  |\n| Communication  | 2.3/2.2  | Dysfunctional  | 2.1/2.2  | Normal  |\n| Roles  | 2.4/2.3  | Dysfunctional  | 1.9/2.3  | Normal  |\n| Affective Responsiveness  | 2.1/2.2  | Normal  | 2.1/2.2  | No change  |\n| Affective Involvement  | 2.2/2.1  | Dysfunctional  | 2.2/2.1  | No change  |\n| Behavioral Control  | 2.4/1.9  | Dysfunctional  | 1.7/1.9  | Normal  |\n| General Functioning  | 2.3/2.0  | Dysfunctional  | 1.9/2.0  | Normal  |\n\n【32】Table 2： Pre and post-test score of Family Attitude Scale (FAS).\n\n|  |  | Pre-test Scores  |  | Post-test Scores  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Domains  | Maximum Score  | Score Obtained  | Impression  | Score Obtained  | Impression  |\n| Critical Comment  | 10  | 2  | Mild  | 0  | Nil  |\n| Hostility  | 12  | 3  | Mild  |  | Nil  |\n| Warmth  | 12  | 6  | Moderate  | No change  |  |\n| Dissatisfaction  | 12  | 4  | Mild  | No change  |  |\n| Emotional over-involvement  | 14  | 10  | Severe  | 6  | Mild  |\n\n【34】At family level\n\n【35】1. Family psychoeducation (session-1)： The objective of this therapy was to psychoeducation the mother (primary family caregiver) and father about the nature of illness like onset， course， causal factors， and treatment rationale of illness.\n\n【36】2. Supportive counseling (session-2)： This session was planned to promote the client's family's best possible psychological and social adaptation by restoring and reinforcing their abilities to cope with the challenges of life.\n\n【37】3.FRelaxation therapy (session-3)： Jacobson’s progressive muscle relaxation was provided to the family’s primary caregiver(mother)， to feel relaxed. Techniques applied were - deep breathing exercises and meditation.\n\n【38】4.FFollow-ups session： After the discharge of the client， two follow-ups session was conducted， at an interval of one and three months. The objective of these follow-ups was to monitor the Results According to Table 1， in the post-test scores， a significant level of positive changes occurred in the domain of problem-solving， communication， and roles (1.9/2.3).\n\n【39】According to Table 2， significant positive changes were seen in post-test scores in critical comment， hostility， and emotional over-involvement domains. This table showed significant positive changes in all the domains of the DASS 21 .\n\n【40】Discussion\n\n【41】In the present study， there was a positive change seen in the client’s post-finding scores of stress， depression， and anxiety after cognitive behavioral therapy. A study conducted by Akhouri et al. also showed a shift from moderate to mild depression after the successful application of cognitive behavior therapy. Alarm therapy was found to be a very effective non-pharmacological treatment in adults. During the follow-up sessions， the client reported 3 to 4 days of dry nights per week. Studies conducted in past have also mentioned alarm therapy as the first-line non-pharmacological treatment . The post-test score of the work behavior inventory showed that there were significant changes in social skills， cooperation， and work habits， quality of work， personal presentation，and global assessment of work behavior. Family psychoeducation is important in NE cases， as it develops an insight in the family members about the illness so that they are no more clueless about the illness its etiology.\n\n【42】Table 3： Pre and post-test score of Depression， Anxiety and Stress Scale-21(DASS 21).\n\n| Domains  | Pre-test  | Post-test  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Stress  | Moderate  | Mild  |\n| Anxiety  | Severe  | Mild  |\n| Depression  | Moderate  | Mild  |\n\n【44】Conclusion\n\n【45】NE in adults has a direct impact on the emotional and behavioral aspects of client personality. It may lead to poor self-esteem， social isolation， depression， anxiety， stress， poor coping. It also leads to care burden on the family primary caregivers of the client. So， a proper psychosocial assessment and management both at the individual and family level is the need of the hour.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 10:42:43", "endTime": "2024/09/24 10:43:45", "cost": 61.653}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:31", "update_time": "2024-09-23 18:43:44", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 18:42:43"}

It presents in two distinct forms， Ulcerative Colitis (UC)and Crohn's Disease (CD). This case study focuses on a 28-year-old female patient who experienced symptoms such as diarrhea， abdominal pain， and rectal bleeding during her pregnancy. Subsequently， she was diagnosed with UC along with Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia (AIHA). It is crucial to closely monitor patients with UC for potential complications like AIHA. Further research is necessary to enhance our understanding of this rare complication and develop more effective treatments for affected patients.\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)， is a chronic， incurable， relapsing disease of unknown etiology. IBD has two distinct forms； Ulcerative Colitis (UC) and Crohn’s Disease (CD). In 2017it was estimated that around 1.5 million people in the United States and 2.5 in Europe suffer from IBD. This chronic disease causes substantial costs for health care and substantial impact on different aspects of patient's life， including career aspirations， installing social stigma and impairing quality oflife. Reports showed a lot of variation in incidence and prevalence of the disease between different geographic areas and different ethnic groups .\n\n【4】Some call for a systemic approach when dealing with this disease ， as manifestation of this disease may be found in any organ system out of the GI tract， with a huge burden on the patient's quality of life. The disease manifestation commonly affects the joints， the skin， the hepatobiliary tract， less commonly the vascular system.\n\n【5】These manifestations are thought to be due to the same immunological process but outside the gastrointestinal system . Although some of them may run parallel to the intestinal disease activity and some may not .\n\n【6】Anemia is common among patients with both types of IBD， with reports showing prevalence ranging from 6% to 74%.\n\n【7】There several causes of anemia in patient with IBS， with iron deficiency anemia as the most frequent， other causes include folate and vitamin B12 deficiency which appears significantly more prevalent in patient with IBD . Another less frequent cause of anemia is the autoimmune hemolytic anemia.\n\n【8】Several reports investigated the prevalence of autoimmune hemolytic anemia in patient with ulcerative colitis， with some report's prevalence of 0.6% to 1.7% which is higher than what is reported in Crohn's disease .\n\n【9】IBD may cause several complications， such as VTE， with a recent meta-analysis shows it carries2-fold the risk of Venous Thromboembolism (VTE) than general population ， with several possible contributing factors such as the effect of local and systemic inflammation with the resulting IL-6 medicatedprocoagulant state， dehydration and corticosteroid use . Another contributing factor to the increased risk of VTE in patients with IBD is AIHA， which was investigated in a recent study and showed a 3-fold increase in the risk of VTE . cited. In this case report we report a female patient with acute severe ulcerative colitis， Coombs positive hemolytic anemia and splenic infarction.\n\n【10】Case Presentation\n\n【11】A 23-year-old female patient presented to the emergency room on February 15h， 2023 with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea. She had a normal vaginal delivery three weeks prior and had been complaining of abdominal pain，perianal pain， fever， and non-bloody diarrhea two weeks prior which progressed to become bloody. She was admitted into a regional hospital and treated with metronidazole； however， her condition did not improve and her hemoglobin dropped，leading to referral as a suspected case of ulcerative colitis.\n\n【12】Upon presentation her vital signs were as follows： BP 100/62mmHg， temperature 36.9°C， heart rate 85 bpm， respiratory rate 18breaths per min， and oxygen saturation 95% on room air.\n\n【13】Laboratory tests revealed Leukocytosis (18.9×10/L) which were mainly neutrophils (neutrophils 78%)， low Hemoglobin level (5 mg/dL)， with a mean cell volume at the upper limit of normal (MCV95 fL)， thrombocytosis (769×10/L)， low albumin level (1.8 g/dL)， increased Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH 512 U/L)， low haptoglobin(10 mg/dL)， high reticulocyte count (12%)， ferritin was increased(11173 ng/mL)， with increased inflammatory markers (CRP 25mg/L， ESR 88 mm/h). Stool analysis revealed the presence of many red blood cells and white blood cells as well as Entamoeba spp. cysts and trophozoites； with significantly elevated fecal calprotectin (>1000ug/mg). Stool was tested positive for Glutamate Dehydrogenase(GDH)， and further testing revealed positive Clostridium dificile toxin A&B. Further laboratory workup revealed positive direct and indirect antiglobulin tests (Coombs)， positive Antinucear (ANA) autoantibodies in high titers (1/160， negative anti-double stranded DNA antibodies， normal levels of C3 and C4 complements.\n\n【14】Other tests including Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP)， Gamma-Glutamyl Transferase (GGT)， Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST)， Alanine Transaminase (ALT) total serum bilirubin and direct serum bilirubin， International Normalized Ratio (INR)， Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN)， Creatinine， Serum sodium， serum potassium， correct serum calcium， were all within the normal limit.\n\n【15】A peripheral blood smear showed nucleated red blood cells， with no schistocytes. The patient was seen by the hematology team and was diagnosed with Coombs Positive Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia(AIHA) .\n\n【16】CT-scan of the abdomen was done and revealed diffuse colonic wall thickening with surrounding fat stranding.Ahepatosplenomegaly was also noted with two wedges shaped hypodensities seen in the spleen suggestive of infarction .\n\n【17】Upon admission flexible sigmoidoscopy was performed， which revealed hyperemic congested mucosa which bleeds with water irrigation， with diffuse small ulcerations. Biopsies were taken .\n\n【18】The patient was given methylprednisolone 100 mg/day for AIHA and suspected acute severe colitis. Antibiotics therapy were initiated for amebiasis (Metronidazole 500 mg three times daily) and Clostridium difficile infection (Vancomycin 125 mg orally four times daily). Low-Molecular-Weight Heparin (LMWH) was given for Venous Thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis (enoxaparin 40mg subcutaneously once daily). And Intravenous (IV) fluid (normal saline 0.9%) was given at a rate of 70 cc/h.\n\n【19】Pretransfusion compatibility testing showed incompatible blood， for which the patient was given the least incompatible two units of packed RBCs. During hospitalization the patient was doing well， with regular surgical follow up and three to five bowel motions per day， her vital signs were all normal，her CRP was going down and her hemoglobin level was stable， until the fifth day of admission， when the patient bowel motion increased up to 8 times， her CRP level increased to 50 mg/dl and her hemoglobin level dropped to 6.5 mg/dl (for which she was given two units of blood). At that time patient was still on methylprednisolone 100 mg/day， vancomycin and metronidazole. In the sixth day ofadmission the pathology report came out， showing cryptitis， crypt abscess and crypt architecture distortion， which was highly suggestive of Ulcerative Colitis (UC) .\n\n【20】Due to her deteriorating condition infliximab was given at a dose of 300 mg. in the next day the CMV stain came positive for CMV， so the patient was given ganciclovir.\n\n【21】On the 3m day the infliximab patient was improving， her fever did not recur， her CRP dropped down， her bowel motion decreased to about 3 times a day with intermittent streaks of blood. Intravenous methylprednisolone was shifted to oral prednisolone 40 mg once daily and the patient was discharged home.\n\n【22】Discussion\n\n【23】Ulcerative Colitis (UC) is a chronic Inflammatory Bowel Disease(IBD) that affects the colon and rectum. It is characterized by inflammation， ulceration， and bleeding of the intestinal lining . Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia (AIHA) is a rare complication of UC that occurs when the immune system attacks and destroys red blood cells. This case study discusses a patient who was diagnosed with UC complicated b AIHA .\n\n【24】The first case of UC with AIHA was reported in 1955 by Lorber et al. who reported four cases of female patients with ulcerative colitis and AIHA. The four cases were diagnosed during flare up of the disease . The exact mechanism behind the development of AIHA in patients with UC is not fully understood. However， it was believed that the development of AIHA in these patients may be attributed to autoimmunity and the cross-reactivity between antibodies produced against substances absorbed by the diseased colon and antigens present on the surface of red blood cells .\n\n【25】The patient in this case study was a 28-year-old female who developed symptoms of UC during her pregnancy. She experienced diarrhea， abdominal pain， and rectal bleeding， which are common symptoms ofUC. After delivering her baby，her symptoms worsened， and she was diagnosed with AIHA. In a study on 8patients with AIHA with UC done by Gumaste et al. autoimmune hemolytic anemia was diagnosed after a mean of 10 years after the diagnosis of colitis  although in our case AIHA was diagnosed at the time of the ulcerative colitis diagnosis.\n\n【26】There is no significant sex-based difference in the incidence of AIHA with UC . The prevalence of AIHA in IBD is higher than non-IBD without difference between UC and Crohn's group . There is evidence to suggest that AIHA may be related to flare-ups of IBD， as some patients experience remission of AIHA after treatment for IBD . In Lorber et al. study all patients were having relapses at the time of diagnosis therefore AIHA considered as an extraintestinal manifestation of IBD .\n\n【27】It is widely accepted that corticosteroids aretheprimarytreatment for warm antibody type AIHA， despite the lack of concrete evidence. Corticosteroids are expected to vield a response in 70% to 85% of patients， but only one-third of cases remain in long-term remission after discontinuing the drug. Half of the remaining patients require maintenance doses .\n\n【28】Infliximab is a type of monoclonal antibody that targets TNF-a， a protein involved in inflammation. It is made up of a combination of mouse and human proteins， with the mouse portion binding to TNF-a and the human portion providing stability. Infliximab can bind to both soluble and membrane-bound forms of TNF-a with high affinity， effectively blocking its activity. It has a long half-life in the bloodstream and is typically administered intravenously at doses of 5 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg.\n\n【29】In case of IBD flare， AIHA is thought to be a reactive type of Extraintestinal Manifestations (EMS). This particular group of EMS typically occurs concurrently with a flare-up ofUC and can usually be treated by effectively managing the bowel disease. Infliximab has been found to be an effective therapeutic option for steroid-refractory UC， resulting in complete remission. Therefore， successful management of the bowel disease， as evidenced by mucosal healing， was the primary factor in resolving the clinical symptoms of AIHA . Our patient was given intravenous corticosteroid for several days but showed no response， so we used infliximab as rescue therapy after which significant improvement was noted.\n\n【30】Otherlines would have been considered in thetreatment of AIHA ifthe IBD treatment did not resolve the AHIA， like Rituximab， which is considered the second line in isolated AIHA .

Since then， many types of RPE appliances have been developed  with different rates of expansion， but the principles are essentially the same . Palatal expanders separate the midpalatal suture， leading to skeletal orthopedic expansion . RPE also opens the circum-maxillary sutural systems depending on their anatomic location and degree of interdigitation .\n\n【7】Because conventional RPE appliances by design transmit the expansion forces through the teeth， alveolar bone bending and dental tipping are inevitable， particularly in older patients . To ensure expansion of the basal bone without surgical intervention while attempting to minimize dental side effects， micro-implants have been utilized in conjunction with RPE devices， known as Microimplant-Assisted Rapid Palatal Expanders (MARPE) .\n\n【8】Although MARPE appliances have been designed to enhance the orthopedic effect of maxillary expansion， dental tipping and alveolar bone bending has been reported in previous studies from RPE/MARPE appliances . Additionally， past studies have relied solely on linear measurements with no consideration to the rotational nature of the maxillary expansion .\n\n【9】There is no consensus regarding the fulcrum anatomic location of the maxillary bone during maxillary expansion. Some studies have reported this center of rotation to be localized at the frontomaxillary suture  while others point it close to the superior orbital fissure . A recent Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) study with Midfacial Skeletal Expander (MSE) has established that the zygomatic bone and maxilla move as a unit consistently， with its fulcrum slightly above the frontozygomatic suture in the coronal plane . Since the expansion with MSE is Archial in nature and the fulcrum location can be defined， perhaps an angular measurement system should be used to assess the expansion pattern ofthis appliance.\n\n【10】This methodological paper aims to present a novel angular measurement systemthat can accurately represent the MSE expansion outcomes having as a reference the precise localization of the rotational fulcrum of the zygomaticomaxillary complex in the coronal plane.\n\n【11】Materialand Methods\n\n【12】Institutional review board approval (IRB number 16-001662) was granted by the University of California， Los Angeles (UCLA). Two cases are presented， consisting of pre-treatment and post-expansion CBCT records of a 20 years old male and an 18 years old female， who were treated with MSE (Biomaterials Korea， Seoul，Korea) appliance. The patients were diagnosed with maxillary transverse deficit and posterior crossbite， without craniofacial irregularity nor previous orthodontic treatment. Treatment was performed at the Section of Orthodontics， UCLA School of Dentistry， under supervision of one clinician.\n\n【13】MSE was indicated in lieu of traditional tooth-borne expanders， based on patients’ maturity and cervical vertebral maturation stage higher than CS4 . An MSE device  consists of a jackscrew unit with four holes， housing the palatal micro-implants which engage the palatal bone bicortically. Additionally， two supporting arms extend from the jackscrew and are soldered to the molar bands. The rate of expansion was 2 turns per day (0.25 mm per turn) until a significant diastema of 2 mm to 3 mm. appeared； then the rate changed to 1 turn per day. MSE activation was stopped when the maxillary skeletal width， defined in Figure 1， matched or was greater than the mandibular width. The MSE was maintained in place with no further activation for at least 6 months during the restructuring of the suture.\n\n【14】The CBCT scans were taken before expansion and within 3weeks after completion of the expansion. The time between the scans was 3 months for both patients. In order to assess the outcomes induced purely by MSE， the post-expansion scans were obtained before patient received any other orthodontic appliances. A CBCT scanner (5G； NewTom， Verona， Italy) was used， with an 18 cmx16cm field of view， 14-bit gray scale， and a standard voxel size of 0.3mm. Configuration of the CBCT included scan time of 18 sec (3.6sec emission time)， with 110 kV. An automated exposure control system was used to detect the patient s anatomic density， to properly adjust the milliamperes. On demand 3D (Cybermed， Daejeon，Korea) software was used for superimposing the pre-expansion and post-expansion CBCT images .\n\n【15】Localization of fulcrum\n\n【16】After superimposition of CBCT images， the following steps were taken to localize the fulcrum of the zygomaticomaxillary complex. The maxillary sagittal plane was identified ， passing through the anterior nasal spine， posterior nasal spine， and nasion on the pre-expansion CBCT image . Then the coronal zygomatic section  was selected. This section passes through the uppermost point of the frontozygomatic sutures and the lowermost point of the zygomaticomaxillary sutures. The previous study by Cantarella  indicated that fulcrum is near the external surface of the frontozygomatic suture because the suture is the weakest point during the Archial movement of midfacial structure. The most external and inferior points of the zygomatic processes of the frontal bones were chosen as initial reference points. The interfrontal distance between these two reference points were measured on both pre-and post-expansion CBCT images . If these two measurements were different， the correct fulcrum points must be more superiorly located. A parallel line slightly above the initial interfrontal line was used to identify the true fulcrums by incrementally moving this line upwards until both pre- and post-expansion distances were equal. This newly established line with no width changes was named the modified interfrontal distance， and the most external points of this line were denoted as the right and left rotational fulcrum respectively(Case 1， ). If the initial interfrontal distances (pre- and post-expansion) were the same， the most external points of this line can be denoted as right and left rotational fulcrum points. To verify this， a parallel line slightly below the initial interfrontal line was used to confirm that the post-expansion distances were greater than the pre-expansion. In this situation， the modified interfrontal line is the same as initial interfrontal line (Case 2， ). To further verify the true center of rotation， two different landmarks in the zygomatic bone were chosen and the angular displacement was measured around this proposed fulcrum point. One landmark was the zygomaticomaxillary suture and the other landmark was easily definable corresponding landmarks within the zygomatic bone in both pre- and post-expansion CBCT . The angles formed between the modified interfrontal line and the line connecting the proposed fulcrum to two chosen landmarks were measured. The changes in pre- and post-expansion values were identical for the two measurements within each zygoma in all cases， confirming the accuracy of the fulcrum locations .\n\n【17】Novel angular measurement system\n\n【18】From the rotational fulcrum， three angular measurements were selected to differentiate the skeletal， alveolar and dental components of the expansion. The following angular measurements were selected： The Frontozygomatic Angle (FZA) is an angle between the interfrontal line and the line extending from fulcrum to the most external point of the zygomaticomaxillary suture， the Fronto-Alveolar Angle (FAA) is an angle between the interfrontal line and the line extending from fulcrum to the alveolar bone surface at the level of distobuccal root tip ofthe upper first molars， and the Fronto-Dental Angle (FDA) is an angle between the interfrontal line and the line extending from fulcrum to the occlusal point located at the central groove of the upper first molar . For FAA， a line parallel to the interfrontal was moved down until it contacted the tip of the root， and the alveolar surface that intersects the line was chosen. These three different angles were measured on both sides， and the pretreatment value was subtracted from the post-expansion value in order to determine the treatment change for each component. The FZA changes correspond to the zygomaticomaxillary expansion， a true skeletal expansion (FZA changes)； the FAA changes correspond to the sum of the skeletal expansion (FZA change) and the alveolar bone bending (FAA changes-FZA changes)； and the FDA changes correspond to the sum of the skeletal expansion (FZA changes)， alveolar bone bending (FAA changes-FZA changes) and the dental tipping (FDA changes-FAA changes).\n\n【19】With the same coronal zygomatic section， a set of traditional linear distance measurements were employed . The Zygomaticomaxillary Line (ZML)， the Alveolar Bone Line (ABL)， and the Dental Line (DL) are perpendicular lines connecting the three landmarks used for the above angular measurements to the intersecting points on the maxillary sagittal plane. The changes in the three sets of linear measurements， before and after the MSE treatment， were calculated for both sides in order to determine the treatment change of each component. The ZML changes describes the Zygomaticomaxillary skeletal changes (ZML changes)； the ABL changes as the sum of the skeletal change (ZML change) and the alveolar bone bending (ZML changes-ABL changes)； and the DL changes as the sum of the skeletal change (ZML change)， alveolar bone bending (ZML changes-ABL changes) and the dental tipping(DL changes-ABL changes).\n\n【20】Statistical analysis\n\n【21】All measurements were obtained three times by 2 raters， to assess method reliability. Measurements were then repeated after 2 weeks by the same operators. Additionally， to compare linear and angular measurements for the two selected cases， both linear and angular measurements of the three components were transformed to relative percentages from the total expansion， the fronto-dental changes.\n\n【22】Results\n\n【23】The amounts of activation of the MSE expansion jackscrew were11.5 for the male patient and 7.5 for the female patient. The duration of maxillary expansion was 23 and 15 days respectively.\n\n【24】For the male case selected， the treatment change with linear measurements at the zygomaticomaxillary level was 4 mm and 3.95mm (right and left sides)， at the alveolar bone level was 0.77 mm and0.49 mm. (right and left sides)， and at the dental level was 1.61 mm and 1.7 mm. (right and left sides). These values suggest 62.7% and64.33% (right and left sides) skeletal expansion， 12.06% and 7.98%(right and left sides) alveolar bone bending， and 25.24% and 27.69%(right and left sides) dental tipping. In contrast， the treatment change with angular measurements at the zygomaticomaxillary level was 4.3and 4.4 (right and left sides)， at the alveolar bone level was 0 (both right and left sides)， and at the dental level was 0° (both right and left sides). These values represent 100% skeletal expansion for the right and left sides， 0% alveolar bone bending and dental tipping for the right and left sides .\n\n【25】For the female case selected， the treatment change with linear measurements at the zygomaticomaxillary level was 1.61 mm and1.97 mm (right and left sides)， at the alveolar bone level was 0.37 mm and 0.78 mm. (right and left sides)， and at the dental level was 1.41mm and 1.06 mm. (right and left sides). These values suggest 47.79%and 51.7% (right and left sides) skeletal expansion， 10.91% and20.47% (right and left sides) alveolar bone bending， and 41.6% and27.83%(right and left sides) dental tipping. In contrast， the treatment change with angular measurements at the zygomaticomaxillary level was 2° and 2.1 (right and left sides)， at the alveolar bone level was 0o(both right and left sides)， and at the dental level was 0.3° and 0.4(both right and left sides). These values represent 89.96% and 84%of skeletal expansion for the right and left sides， 0% alveolar bone bending for right and left sides and dental tipping of 13.04% and 16%for the right and left sides respectively . For the considered parameters， the ICC value was 0.95.\n\n【26】Discussion\n\n【27】Each expansion device produces expansion force directed at different parts of craniofacial structure， depending on its design and the means of anchorage. The expansion pattern can greatly vary from one appliance to another. MacGinnis  illustrated the difference between MSE and Hyrax using FEM simulation. A study on FEM located the fulcrum around the upper border of the orbit ， while others stated that is placed near the frontomaxillary suture . Other studies on FEM mention that the maxillary center of rotation is located near the superior orbital fissure ； that in agreement with the results of Gardner and Kronman  in a study with rhesus monkeys. Even micro-implant supported expanders exhibit various pattern of expansion ， based on the anchor placement， depth of implant engagement， expansion protocol， etc. The MSE has a unique feature， promoting skeletal movement in Archial Imanner， around the fulcrum located near the frontozygomatic sutures. Cantarella  has illustrated this effect but the precise location of the fulcrum was not clearly defined， only indicating that it is near the frontozygomatic suture. In the current study， additional steps were taken to further define the true points of rotation. The interfrontal distance which connects two fulcrums should not change with the expansion. In addition， the interfrontal distances connecting the points above the fulcrum should not change but the distance alveolar bone point； D： Pre-expansion dental point； D： Past-expansion dental point， a： Linear skeletal distance， b： Linear alvealar bone distance， c： Linear dental distance\n\n| Table 1： Linear and angular measurements for male case.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  | Skeletal expansion  | Alveolar bone bending  | Dental tipping  |\n|  | Right linear measurements  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Unit  | Aa  | Ab  | AC  | Aa  | Ab-Aa  | Ac-Ab  |\n| mm.  | 4 mm.  | 4.77mm.  | 6.38 mm.  | 4  | 0.77  | 1.61  |\n| %  |  |  |  | 62.70%  | 12.06%  | 25.24%  |\n|  | Right angular measurements  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | ▲a  | Ab  | AC  | ▲a  | Ab-Aa  | Ac-Ab  |\n| mm.  | 4.3°  | 4.3°  | 4.3°  | 4.3°  | 0°  | 0°  |\n| %  |  |  |  | 100%  | 0%  | 0%  |\n|  | Left linear measurements  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | Aa  | Ab  |  | ▲a  | Ab-Aa  | Ac-Ab  |\n| mm.  | 3.95 mm.  | 4.44 mm.  | 6.14 mm.  | 3.95  | 0.49  | 1.7  |\n| %  |  |  |  | 64.33%  | 7.98%  | 27.69%  |\n|  | Left angular measurements  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | ▲a  | Ab  |  | ▲a  | Ab-Aa  | Ac-Ab  |\n| mm.  | 4.4°  | 4.4°  | 4.4°  | 4.4  | 0  | 0°  |\n| %  |  |  |  | 100%  | 0%  | 0%  |\n\n【29】Aa： Skeletal expansion， Ab： Skeletal expansion + Alveolar bone bending， Ac： Skeletal expansion + Alvealar bone bending + Dental tipping connecting the points immediately below the fulcrum should increase with expansion. By applying these concepts， the fulcrum positions were identified. Arbitrarily， the most external and inferior points of the right and left zygomatic processes of the frontal bone were used for initial interfrontal distance measurements. If the distance changed with expansion， the line was moved upward until the distance was stable (Case 1). If this initial interfrontal distance did not change， the line was moved downward and verified that the distance increased below the initial reference points (Case 2). Once these fulcrum points were established， one additional step was taken， in order to ensure that these were truly the points of rotation. According to the Reuleaux technique ， at least two corresponding landmarks\n\n| Table 2： Linear and angular measurements for female case.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  | Skeletal expansion  | Alveolar bone bending  | Dental tipping  |\n|  | Right linear measurements  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Unit  | ▲a  | Ab  | Ac  | ▲a  | Ab-Aa  | Ac-Ab  |\n| mm.  | 1.61 mm.  | 1.98mm.  | 3.39 mm.  | 1.61  | 0.37  | 1.41  |\n| %  |  |  |  | 47.49%  | 10.91%  | 41.60%  |\n|  | Right angular measurements  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | ▲a  | Ab  | Ac  | ▲a  | Ab-Aa  | Ac-Ab  |\n| mm.  | 20  | 20  | 2.3°  | 2°  | 0°  | 0.3°  |\n| %  |  |  |  | 86.96%  | 0%  | 13.04%  |\n|  | Left linear measurements  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | ▲a  | Ab  | AC  | ▲a  | Ab-Aa  | Ac-Ab  |\n| mm.  | 1.97 mm.  | 2.75 mm.  | 3.81 mm.  | 1.97  | 0.78  | 1.06  |\n| %  |  |  |  | 51.70%  | 20.47%  | 27.83%  |\n|  | Left angular measurements  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | ▲a  | Ab  | Ac  | ▲a  | Ab-▲a  | Ac-Ab  |\n| mm.  | 2.1°  | 2.1°  | 2.5°  | 2.1°  | 0°  | 0.4°  |\n| %  |  |  |  | 84%  | 0%  | 16%  |\n\n【31】Aa： Skeletal expansion， Ab： Skeletal expansion + Alvealar bone bending， Ac： Skeletal expansion + Alvealar bone bending +Dental tipping must show uniform displacement around a single point， to be able to pinpoint a center of rotation. The displacement of two separate landmarks within a zygomatic process around the proposed fulcrum were measured， and they showed uniform displacements， indicating the fulcrum position was accurate .\n\n【32】The fulcrum positions for these two individuals were identified by the findings from previous studies of MSE and by applying additional measurements； however， the fulcrum position may vary greatly with other expansion devices because of the design differences described above. Since most of the expansion devices lack fulcrum information， the pattern of expansion was customarily described by linear width changes of various points within the structures. If the skeletal movement was Archial in nature as seen in MSE cases， the differential movements measured by these linear distances introduce inherent error. The linear distance changes were greater for the landmarks further away from the fulcrum， falsely exaggerating the magnitude of alveolar bone bending and dental tipping . This effect was examined by applying both linear measurements often used traditionally and novel angular measurements stemming from the fulcrum points.\n\n【33】Two MSE cases were selected to illustrate the difference between the angular andlinear measurements. The first case was a male patient who had received MSE treatment with optimal quality expansion. When the angular measurements were employed ， the results clearly indicated that there was no alveolar bone bending or dental tipping， but the entire movement was a skeletal rotation from the fulcrum， identified from the first part of this study. On the other hand， the linear measurements  yielded different results with exaggeration of the dentoalveolar components： 12% R and 8% L bone bending， and 25% R and 28%L dental tipping . Because the movement was in Archial configuration， the structures further away from the fulcrum were displaced more . These discrepancies inlinearlength change can be misinterpreted as the alveolar bone bending and the dental tipping were significant components of the expansion. However， the angular measurements indicated that the expansion was purely skeletal， with midfacial rotation and with no additional bone bending or dental tipping. With MSE， both zygomatic bone and maxilla were rotating around the fulcrum， without significant bone bending or dental tipping . The MSE is placed at the palatal vault， close to the center of resistance， and the micro-implants were engaged bicortically promoting superior expansion. The MSE produced an orthopedic response， causing the fulcrum to be near the weaker frontozygomatic suture . The best way to differentiate the percentage of skeletal expansion， alveolar bone bending and dental tipping for MSE is to use the angular measurements from this fulcrum. This novel measurement system can eliminate the inherent error associated with the linear distant measurements discussed above.\n\n【34】The second case was a female patient who has a successful split of midpalatal suture but with difficulties， yielding some tipping of the implants during the expansion . Some bone bending and dental tipping was anticipated with this patient， and this case was chosen to prove that the novel angular measurements can illustrate these changes. The angular measurements  indicated that most of the expansion was skeletal (87%R and 84%L). There was no alveolar bone bending but some dental tipping (13% R and 16% L). As the implants tipped during the expansion， the molars experienced some buccal tipping， but the alveolar process did not move further away from the zygoma as the midfacial complex was rotating from the fulcrum . On the other hand， the linear measurements yielded very different results with exaggeration of the dentoalveolar components 11% R and 20% L bone bending， and42% R and 28% L dental tipping . These sets of numbers indicate entirely different expansion pattern， emphasizing that linear measurements are severely inaccurate in assessing Archial movement， as seen in MSE.\n\n【35】In the past， many studies  have evaluated the maxillary expansion outcomes with linear measurements. Assuming that the fulcrums of these changes were above the landmarks they have chosen for the distance measurements， the linear distance changes for the alveolar bending and dental expansion were probably exaggerated， simply by the fact that these landmarks were further away from the fulcrum. If we assume that the skeletal expansion is Archial in nature， the intermolar distance will increase more than the skeletal components， even with pure skeletal rotation. The actual dental tipping may be much less than the reported values. However， the angular measurements can also have inherent errors if they are measured from the wrong fulcrum. The fulcrum location may vary with each appliance， and the origin of the angular measurements must be identified.\n\n【36】Obtaining the accurate measurements differentiating skeletal， dentoalveolar and dental expansion is a difficult task， as illustrated above. Two conditions must be met in order to produce accurate valuation： The identification of the true fulcrum and the designing of the angular measurements from this fulcrum. Each appliance presumably has different fulcrum location， and it is important to identifythe accurate position. With MSE， the fulcrum waslocated near the frontozygomatic suture . In this study， this area was further explored， in order to define the precise fulcrum position， utilizing the superimposed CBCT images，acquired before and after the expansion. Subsequently， the three angular measurements from this fulcrum were used to differentiate skeletal， alveolar and dental components of the expansion. By using these angular measurements radiating from the fulcrum， the above-mentioned problems with linear distance measurements can be eliminated. This new mathematical approach illustrated that commonly used linear analysis may not be the best way to assess the differential components of maxillary expansion.\n\n【37】Tn thiIsSstudythe precise rotational fulcrumof the zygomaticomaxillary complex after MSE treatment was determined， and a novel angular measurement system that accurately assesses the expansion outcomes has been developed. The results obtain from the cases in this study are not representative for all the MSE cases. These cases were selected to illustrate a novel methodology that can accurately assess expansion of MSE. A further study will be conducted in order to assess the overall impact of MSE treatment，by applyingthe method developed in this study to all MSE cases. Further studies in defining the fulcrum locations for other expansion appliances would be beneficial in accurately determining the expansion outcomes.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 11:25:47", "endTime": "2024/09/24 11:26:15", "cost": 27.397}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:31", "update_time": "2024-09-23 19:26:15", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 19:25:47"}

However， a 30mm arterially enhancing lesion in the liver located between the falciform ligament and the left lobe of the liver was noted， along with multiple arterially enhancing peritoneal nodules.\n\n【8】Differential diagnosis\n\n【9】The differential for multiple， arterially enhancing lesions witting the abdomen and thorax lies within the spectrum of a malignant aetiology， with a differential lying between a haematological malignancy， such as lymphoma， and disseminated solid organ malignancy.\n\n【10】Outcome and follow up\n\n【11】On review of the images， it was noted that the nodule bore similar enhancement characteristics to the spleen which was it lobulated and small. There were subtle abnormal appearances of the inferior left ribs and right iliac crest. This raised the possibility of primary trauma with nodules described representing intraabdominal and intrahepatic splenosis rather than primary malignancy.\n\n【12】A denatured red blood cell scan was suggested  This demonstrated a small splenic residue lying posteriorly in the left upper quadrant， multiple peritoneal nodules over the diaphragm， surface of the liver and in the anterior abdominal wall， all of which showed high scintigraphic activity. These were felt likely to be splenunculi. On further questioning the patient reported ahistory of abdominal trauma as a teenager when he underwent a partial splenectomy after splenic rupture. No further follow up was required.\n\n【13】Discussion\n\n【14】Splenosis is defined as heterotopic implantation of splenic fragments following splenectomy or splenic trauma . It can occur anywhere within the abdomen. The incidence of splenosis has been quoted as between 56% to 67% in patients following a traumatic splenic injury .\n\n【15】Splenosis， as a relatively asymptomatic condition， often goes undiagnosed， with the majority of cases being diagnosed at a later date； the mean time interval from splenectomy to detection of splenosis being 25 years .\n\n【16】The pathophysiology is thought to be due to either direct seeding of splenic tissue or haematogenous spread. Radiological assessment is complicated by the fact that on CT， splenosis appears much like malignancy， with arterially enhancing soft tissue deposits. However， the use of denatured red blood cells with Tc-99m labelling utilises the functionally of the reticuloendothelial system in order to localise and characterise ectopic splenic tissue. Further characterisation can be with MRI using SPIO： this shows a loss of single intensity on T2weighted a sequence which is in contrast to tumour， which does not demonstrate signal loss. Surgical exploration with diagnostic laparoscopy or laparotomy allows further characterisation of lesion in cases of clinical uncertainty. Crucially， there needs to be clinical suspicion as to the nature of the lesion in order to allow appropriate investigation to be requested in order to avert the need for exploratory surgery.\n\n【17】Splenosis may be associated with bowel obstruction due to compression or lesion torsion. It is an otherwise benign entity and therefore no treatment is required.\n\n【18】Learning Points\n\n【19】1. A rare mimicker of a malignant lesion that demonstrate arterial enhancement and appears as a soft tissue lesion on cross-sectional imaging is ectopic splenic tissue.\n\n【20】2.

This big data is of very important for designing the new drug product but it is very difficult to extract the information manually from this huge source. Now days a new ways of data mining and processing are on focus of the scientists such as Machine Learning (ML)， Deep Learning(DL) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). Therefore， in the era of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer revolution， the conventional methods of product design seem to be irrelevant as personalized medicines are now getting more attention. Now the conventional approach of “one drug-fits all”have been replacing by the “customizable dosage forms\" based on the individual needs. So a large scale updation of pharmaceutical sector is indeed required to adopt for innovative engineering and processing methods of formulation development. Induction of computer simulation and computational approaches such as Quality by Design (QbD) concept， statistical analysis and simulation software's now shifted the paradigm from lab-based research to in-silico research where majority of the research activities related to product development are performed on the computer simulated mathematical models with high degree of accuracy covering the interaction of all the process variables. In silico approach eliminates the irrelevant sets of experiments and only provides the best suitable ones using AI based simulated model. The areas of application of AI approach in formulation development can be formulation optimization and pharmacokinetic evaluation as discussed one by one in the coming sections. The data of physicochemical properties of the different drugs， chemicals and excipients is stored in the AI enabled computer software. The AI algorhythm in the computer system find the expected results of the mutual interaction ofany given set of excipients and drug by the aid of algorhythm based mathematical calculations and predict the characteristics of the resulting formulation. Here we can optimize the formulation for the desired results as defined by the QbD tools by varying the concentrations of the excipients without performing the actual experimentation. Statistical tools such as Central Composite Design (CCD)，box-behnken design or others provide us with the different formulations with the varying concentration ranges of polymers which may have the desired and optimized formulation. Using computer algorhythm a blend of raw materials can be designed based on the physical and chemical properties ofthe drug and excipients to produce the product with desired characteristics. This saves the cost and time of research and increase the confidence on the quality of product. The customization of the dosage forms based on the individual needs is also possible through in-silico approach. The customization is done to adjust the pharmaceutical， pharmacokinetic and therapeutic characteristics of the product as per the need of the individual patients i.e.， based on the behavior of the drug in individual patients due to different genetic makeup and different body physiology. AI based evaluation of pharmacokinetics parameters is the necessary and important part of the formulation development as it reduces the attrition rate and failure of drug compounds during the clinical studies. AI based techniques predicts the ADME profile of the drug in a particular dosage form that not only help in drug optimization but also in drug repurposing. Establishing an In Vitro-In Vivo Correlation (IVIVC) predicts the pharmacokinetic behavior of the drug inside the body in earlier phase of the study before going in to the actual experimentation. In this manner a product can be designed from initial step to final optimized formulation using the computer simulated algorhythm. After validation of the final design， the product is developed in the lab and tested for its characteristics to check if these are as per the given specifications or not", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 11:20:44", "endTime": "2024/09/24 11:21:09", "cost": 24.934}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:31", "update_time": "2024-09-23 19:21:07", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 19:20:42"}

In conclusion， awareness of focal unusual histology in otherwise typical pulmonary synovial sarcoma can prevent misdiagnosis， particularly when t(x； 18) is negative.\n\n【2】Keywords： Pulmonary； Pleura； Synovial sarcoma\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Primary pulmonary synovial sarcoma is an aggressive tumor sharing common histologic features with soft tissue synovial sarcoma . Molecular testing for the pathognomonic t(x； 18) chromosomal translocation has enabled diagnostic confirmation in approximately 90% of cases. In t(x； 18) negative cases， diagnosis must rely on histologic and immunophenotypic features. The differential diagnosis of primary pulmonary synovial sarcoma is particularly challenging when histologic features unusual to synovial sarcoma， but common to other neoplasms are focally present. This challenge is compounded with negative t(x； 18) findings. We present a case ofprimary pulmonary synovial sarcoma where unusual histology was present and t(x； 18) was negative. We offer diagnostic pearls to prevent misdiagnosis in such challenging cases.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 49 year old female presented with chest pain and shortness of breath with no significant medical or family history. Laboratory and cardiac work-up was normal and chest x-ray showed a left pulmonary mass. Computed tomography redemonstrated the pulmonary mass with likely metastatic left pleural nodule . Biopsy and surgical excision of tumour showed classic monophasic pulmonary synovial sarcoma histology with dense spindled cellularity， interlacing fascicles， and hyalinized stroma as diagnosed by a pulmonary pathologist， however with focal Verocay body formation， rhabdoid morphology and vague rosette formation . Immunohistochemistry showed pancytokeratin and CK7 immunoreactivity with focal S-100expression， but were negative for muscle markers， other melanoma markers， and CD34. The SYT/SSX RNA fusion transcripts resulting from t{x； 18)  translocation were not detected using real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. The patient showed no sign of widespread metastatic disease and was treated with complete resection of tumour and received adjuvant radiation treatment. The patient presented with recurrence and pericardial seeding eight months later and died of disease 10 months following diagnosis.\n\n【7】Discussion\n\n【8】Synovial sarcoma， although rare， is a primary pulmonary neoplasm with distinctive histology. The presence of focal unusual histologic findings characteristic of more common epithelial and mesenchymal tumors may lead to misdiagnosis. This is particularly problematic in small biopsies or in primary pulmonary synovial sarcomas that are negative for the pathognomonic t(x； 18) translocation. We present a case of primary pulmonary synovial sarcoma with unusual histologic features， negative for t(x；18). The focal unusual histology in primary pulmonary synovial sarcoma can erroneously suggest more common primary and metastatic pulmonary neoplasms. Verocay body-like areas in this case were similar to those seen in malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor . The stromal background of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor， however， typically lacks hyalinization and appears more basophilic. While focal immunoreactivity for S-100 can be present in both tumors，  primary pulmonary synovial sarcoma is often immunoreactive for cytokeratin 7， a finding not generally seen in malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor . Clinically， malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors arise from nerve or neurofibroma and are associated with neurofibromatosis type I in approximately two-thirds of cases . Primary pulmonary synovial sarcoma with focal vague rosette formation can leadto misdiagnosis as primitive neuroectodermal tumor . Primary pulmonary synovial sarcoma may also be reminiscent of primitive neuroectodermal tumor when the former is poorly differentiated and displays round cell morphology. Unlike primary pulmonary synovial sarcoma， primitive neuroectodermal tumor typically has distinct cell borders， clear cytoplasm， scant stroma， and lacks hemangiopericytoma-like vasculature typically seen with primary pulmonary synovial sarcoma. Both tumors can express CD99，CD56， and cytokeratins，  although expression of cytokeratin 7 makes a diagnosis of primitive neuroectodermal tumor less likely . Chromosomal translocation t (11； 22) is present in 85% of primitive neuroectodermal tumors. We present a case of primary pulmonary synovial sarcoma with focal unusual histologic features that may erroneously suggest more common primary and metastatic pulmonary neoplasms. This unusual histology may be particularly chalenging in small biopsies or when t(x； 18) is negative. Awareness of typical histology of pulmonary synovial sarcoma， their potential misleading unusual morphologic features， and prudent use of Immunohistochemistry will prevent misdiagnosis， even in t(x； 18)-negative cases.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 10:53:02", "endTime": "2024/09/24 10:53:36", "cost": 33.609}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:31", "update_time": "2024-09-23 18:53:35", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 18:53:01"}

Our study aimed to clarify the effects of a theater program intervention on the cognitive， physical， and social functions of older adults living in the community.\n\n【2】Methods： Of the 43 participants， they were assigned to the control group and theatre intervention group， each group received intervention for three months. We compared participants pre-test and post-test physical， cognitive， and social functioning results of the program. Moreover，the amount of change in physical and cognitive items in the control and theater groups was compared.\n\n【3】Results： A comparison of pre-test and post-test results showed significant improvements in the UWS and physical and social frailty for the control and theatre group. Furthermore， amount of the change in UWS in the theatre group was significantly higher than in the control group.\n\n【4】Conclusion： In conclusion， we have shown that a theatrical intervention can be as effective as the multicomponent exercise recommended， the theatrical approach was suggested to be effective in improving social frailty.\n\n【5】Keywords： Theater program intervention； Older adults； Frailty\n\n【6】Introduction\n\n【7】Worldwide countries moving from a state of high fertility， high mortality， and a predominance of a young population to a condition characterized by low fertility， low mortality， and the preponderance of an old population， the aging process of the world population is happening faster than in the past . Japan is likewise aging more rapidly than any other country， the percentage of the population aged 65 and over reached 23% in 2009， the highest in the world. Furthermore， by2030， one in three people will be 65 or older，and one in five will be 75 or older . Deterioration in physical and cognitive health with aging increases the risk of developing disability in older adults. Older adults remain at great risk for cognitive decline and， as a result， for increasingly poor quality of life. As for those reasons， previous studies have shown that (a) a decline in information-processing speed， (b) failure to engage in elaborative processing， (c) deficits in various types of problem-solving ability，(d) decrease in working memory capacity， and (e) lack of controllability . Suzuki et al. developed an intervention program in the form of a dual task in which physical exercise and cognitive tasks are performed simultaneously . Dual tasks require executive functions that are particularly important for Activities of Daily Living (ADL). Doi et al. reported that increased prefrontal activation during dual-tasks correlated with executive function in elderly patients with MCI . Other previous studies have also shown that interventions using dual-task training may be a promising approach for MCI patients . In our previous study also showed that our multi-component program could improve the cognitive and physical functions of older adults in community dwellers .\n\n【8】On the other hand，participation in cultural activities has recently been associated with cognitive function and other health outcomes. Cultural activities include daily events for enjoyment， entertainment， recreation， or social contribution . Participation in cultural activities can be“passive\" or \"active，\" interestingly， active cultural participation has been shown to be more effective in cognitive function than passive participation . In recent years， theatrical approaches have been reported to improve the health and cognitive function of older adults through active cultural participation . However， most of the studies reported to date have focused on cognitive function. Theatrical approaches may have a positive impact on physical and social function because they promote rich experiences and interaction among participants. The purpose of this study was to clarify the effects of a theater program intervention on the cognitive， physical， and social functions of older adults living in the community.\n\n【9】Materials and Methods\n\n【10】Participants\n\n【11】Participants were recruited in Akita prefecture， Japan. Our study was performed from June to October 2022. The participants aged 65years old or over， had the ability to walk independently and living at home without personal assistance. The exclusion criteria were dementia， major depression， severe hearing or a visual impairment， stroke，Parkinson's disease， another neurological disease， intellectual disability， need for support of care as certified by the Japanese public long-term care insurance system due to disability， and inability to complete cognitive tests at the baseline assessment. The demographic data comprised age，gender，education， and health variables including Body Mass Index (BMI) [kg/m²].\n\n【12】Intervention\n\n【13】Of the 43 participants who gave informed consent， they were assigned to the control group and theatre intervention group. Each group also received a 90-minute program once every two weeks for three months.\n\n【14】Multicomponent exercise program for the control group\n\n【15】As previouslyreported，amulticomponent exercise interventionWasperformed1。where cognitiveetrainingWas incorporated into the sessions combined with resistance and aerobic training. The control group was conducted by health and fitness instructors or trained care workers. The content of the program is to maintain and improve ADLs and lead to preventive care for the elderly. Each session included as follows； first， started with bending exercises such as per and lower limb stretching. After that， physical training was 10 min of aerobic exercises with cognitive stimulation and 20 min of resistance exercises with cognitive stimulation. The therapist adjusted the level of aerobic exercise and resistance exercises according to each participant's ability， and the participant rested when needed. The cognitive exercises included dual-task training.\n\n【16】Theatre intervention group\n\n【17】The theatrical intervention consisted of a basic program and an application program， and was conducted by longtime theater professionals and teaching staff. The basic program consisted of stretching， aerobic exercise， and vocal and emotional expression exercises for 30 min. Emotional expression exercises involved rhythmically imitating the words and emotions (anger，joy， sadness， etc.) of the instructional staff . The application program included chorus practice， dance， and dialogue practice based on a script created by the participants. The theatre script was produced by the Warabiza， but the lyrics to the theme song were written by the participants themselves . In addition， participants prepared their own costumes and props to be used in the play.\n\n【18】Assessment and outcome\n\n【19】We evaluated a physical performance consisting of grip strength(kg) and usual walking speed (m/s). Four cognitive subtests of the National Center for Geriatrics and Gerontology Functional Assessment Tool (NCGG-FAT)  were also assessed for each participant. Cognitive subtests are indicated as follow；\n\n【20】Components of NCGG-FAT\n\n【21】The computerized multidimensional neurocognitive test was performed on an iPad (Apple， Cupertino， CA， USA) with a 9.7-inch touch display. The task instructions were presented with aletter size of at least 1.0×1.0 cm’on the display. For this study， a trained operator supported each participant by setting up the tablet PC and running each test. Participants completed the NCGG-FAT subtests as follows.\n\n【22】Tablet Version of Word Recognition (WR)： This test is comprised of two computerized tasks of immediate recognition and delayed recall. In the first task of immediate recognition， participants were instructed to memorize 10 words， each of which was displayed for 2 s on the tablet PC. After that， a total of 30 words including 10target and 20 distracter words were shown to participants， and they were required to select the 10 target words immediately. This task was repeated for three trials. The average number of correct answers was recorded as a score ranging from 0 to 10. In another task， participants were asked to correctly recall the 10 target words after 20 min. The number of correctly recalled target words was scored ranging from0 to 10. Finally， we calculated the sum score of the two tasks of immediate recognition and delayed recall.\n\n【23】Tablet Version of Trail Making Test Version A (TMT-A) and Version B (TMT-B)： In the Trail Making Test Version A (TMT-A)\n\n【24】Table 1： Comparison of participant characteristics between Control and Theatre group.\n\n|  | Contral groupn=25  |  | Theatre groupn=18  |  | p value  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Median  | IQR  | Median  | IQR  | p value  |\n| Gender (% female)  | 88.0  |  | 50.0  |  | 0.000  |\n| Age (year)  | 73  | 6  | 71.5  | 9  | 0.407  |\n| Education (year)  | 12  | 2  | 14  | 4  | 0.286  |\n| BMI(kg/m²)  | 22.2  | 3.3  | 22.2  | 8.7  | 0.506  |\n\n【26】p<0.01， Mann-Whitney test， x2test task， participants were instructed to touch the target numbers in a sequence as rapidly as possible. Target numbers from 1 to 15 were randomly displayed on the tablet panel. In addition， the Trail Making Test Version B (TMT-B) instructions required participants to touch target numbers (e.g.， 1-15) and letters in turn.\n\n【27】Tablet Version of Symbol Digit Substitution Task (SDST)： In the Symbol Digit Substitution Task (SDST)， nine pairs of numbers and symbols were shown in the upper part of the tablet display. A target symbol was shown in the center of the tablet panel， and selectable numbers were displayed at the bottom. Participants were asked to touch the number corresponding to the target symbol shown in the central part of the tablet display as rapidly as possible. The number of correct numbers within 90 s was recorded.\n\n【28】Criteria of physical frailty\n\n【29】Frailty status was defined based on five dimensions of the Fried frailty index， including i) shrinking， ii) exhaustion， iii) low level of activity， iv) weakness， and v) slowness， 0 for robust， 1 to 2 for prefrail， and 3 to 5 for frail， and the frailty .\n\n【30】Criteria of social frailty\n\n【31】Makizako's social frail index was applied for this study， consisting of i) Living alone (yes)， ii) Talking with someone every day (no)， iii) Feeling helpful to friends or family (no)， iv) Going out less frequently compared with last year (yes)， v) Visiting friends sometimes (no)，0for robust， 1 for social prefrail， and 2 to 5 for social frail. According to the change of social frail status at the following-up period， robust persons classified at the baseline were grouped into three categories， such as robust， social prefrail， and social frail .\n\n【32】Statistical analysis\n\n【33】We compared the controlgroup and theatre group in demographics for age， gender， education， and BMI by using the Mann-Whitney test. Next， The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was applied to compare the results of physical function and UWS， GS， p<0.05；p<0.01； Wilcoxon signed rank test\n\n【34】Table 2： Comparison of physical and cognitive function pre-test and post-test in each group.\n\n【35】WM， TMT-A & B， and SDST between pre-test and post-test of this program for participants. The Wilcoxon signed rank test was applied to compare the results of the physical frailty ratio and social frailty between pre-test and post-test. Moreover， the Mann-Whitney test was applied to compare amount of change the physical and cognitive items for the control group and theatre group. SPSS Version 27.0 for Windows (SPSS INC.， Chicago. IL， USA) was used for the analysis， and the level of significance was set at p=0.05.\n\n【36】Results\n\n【37】The 43 participants were divided into 25 from the control group(mean age， 72.1 years) and 18 from the theatre group (mean age， 70.7years). The comparison demographics of participants for the control group and the theatre group were shown in Table 1. According to the result of y test， the theater group had a significantlyhigher percentage of males. Table 2 lists the results of physical functions and cognitive functions for the pre-test and the post-test. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to analyze the differences between pre-test and post-test and revealed significant differences in the UWS (p<0.05) for the control group， and the UWS (p<0.01) for the theatre group， however， there was no significant improvement in cognitive function both the control group and the Theatre group. Next， comparisons of the physical frailty and social frailty for the control group and the theatre group at the pre-test and the post-test were shown in Table3. As a result of the Wilcoxon signed rank test， physical frailty， and social frailty improved significantly after the intervention in the control group (physical frailty； p<0.01， social frailty； p<0.05) and theatre groups (physical frailty； p<0.05， social frailty； p<0.01).\n\n【38】Finally， as a result of the Mann-Whitney test was applied to compare the amount of change in the physical and cognitive items for control group and theatre group， the amount of the change in UWS in the theatre group was significantly higher than in the control group (p<0.05) .\n\n【39】Discussion\n\n【40】This study population was a significantly higher percentage of males for the theatre group than control group.

Especially，amount of the change in UWS in the theatre group was significantly higher than in the control group from pre-test to post-test. Pua et al. were reported that walking speed is strongly associated with balance ability and agility. In other words， we believe that walking speed improves when both balance capacity and agility are combined . The theatrical approach in this study may have been effective in improving gait speed because it incorporated dynamic and quick rhythmic movements， as well as mid-backposture and crouching movements in the play . On the other hand， WM and SDST for cognitive function showed a trend toward improvement after the intervention， but no statistically significant improvement was observed. However， because this participant consisted of healthy， independent-living participants， the cognitive functions were quite high to start with， and ceiling effects might have been present. Theatrical training requires the simultaneous execution of the characters lines and accompanying actions. The ongoing practice of this kind of complex multitasking may improve the efficiency of real-world dual-task processing. Therefore， we would like to further increase the number of participants and conduct further validation with participants with cognitive decline， such as MCI.\n\n【48】Most interesting in this study， the significant improvement in physical frailty after the intervention， especially was that the improvement in social frailty was markedly more pronounced in a theatre group. Several previous studies have found that increasing age， cognitive impairment， obesity， presence of multiple diseases，low education，andhospitalizationare risk factors forworsening frail status， whereas increased physical activity， women， overweight， low alcohol intake， higher education， living alone， and low baseline disability increase the likelihood of improving frailty . Although factors other than training need to be examined in detail， theatrical training may provide similar physical frailty improvement benefits as multi-component training. As Japan's population ages at an accelerated rate， social challenges faced by the elderly are increasing， and social frailty resulting from social challenges is attracting more attention. Also， the emergency situation of thorough social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic has consequently affected the spread of the epidemic， and our previous study also reported an increase in social frailty after the COVID-19 expansion . Moreover， Makizako et al. reported that among independent community-dwelling older adults who are not physical frail， those who are socially frail may be at greater risk of developing physical frail in the near future， and social frail may precede (and lead to the development of) physical frail . Therefore，prevention and improvement of social frailty is considered an important issue in aging society around the world. Jasmine et al. were reported that evidence on the effectiveness of complex interventions targeting reduction in socialvulnerability for improving health related outcomes (mortality， function， cognition， subjective health and healthcare use) in older adults living in the community. According to that report， social support and strengthening the community in which elderly people live in the area are necessary to improve social frailty， and furthermore， reducing social frailty may also help improve the condition of their health . Seeman et al. were identified that theater requires each person to perform in front of everyone and that a very powerful group dynamic was created when everyone experienced the same play. The participants in this study were also able to join forces and make friends to accomplish a play， and furthermore， not a single person dropped out. We have confirmed that theater programs can engage and motivate the elderly， and we have also shown that they can strengthen bonds in social situations.\n\n【49】The present study had several limitations. First， the sample sizes for both the control group and Theatre group were quite small. In a further study， we plan to increase the sample size. Second， the participants were not blind to interventions， and this study lacked a control group with no treatment. Case-control comparisons with blinding are needed in addition to before and after the intervention. Third， participants in this study may be healthful and higher cognitive function than non-participants. These requirements should be adjusted for further additional research in the future.\n\n【50】Conclusion\n\n【51】We have shown that a theatrical intervention can be as effective as the multicomponent exercise recommended in previous frailty prevention. Furthermore， the theatrical intervention was suggested to be effective in strengthening the community of participants， and improving social frailty. Therefore， theatrical intervention needs to be further studied to become a new intervention method for the prevention of frailty. Authors should discuss the results and how they can be interpreted from the perspective ofprevious studies and ofthe working hypotheses. The findings and their implications should be discussed in the broadest context possible. Future research directions may also be highlighted.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [{"text": " |  | Control group (n=25)  |  |  |  |  | Theatre group (n=18)  |  |  |  |  |", "content": "【0】Abstract\n\n【1】Background： In recent years， theatricalapproachhas been reported to improve the health promotion of the older adults.

Japan is likewise aging more rapidly than any other country， the percentage of the population aged 65 and over reached 23% in 2009， the highest in the world. Furthermore， by2030， one in three people will be 65 or older，and one in five will be 75 or older . Deterioration in physical and cognitive health with aging increases the risk of developing disability in older adults. Older adults remain at great risk for cognitive decline and， as a result， for increasingly poor quality of life. As for those reasons， previous studies have shown that (a) a decline in information-processing speed， (b) failure to engage in elaborative processing， (c) deficits in various types of problem-solving ability，(d) decrease in working memory capacity， and (e) lack of controllability . Suzuki et al. developed an intervention program in the form of a dual task in which physical exercise and cognitive tasks are performed simultaneously . Dual tasks require executive functions that are particularly important for Activities of Daily Living (ADL). Doi et al. reported that increased prefrontal activation during dual-tasks correlated with executive function in elderly patients with MCI . Other previous studies have also shown that interventions using dual-task training may be a promising approach for MCI patients . In our previous study also showed that our multi-component program could improve the cognitive and physical functions of older adults in community dwellers .\n\n【8】On the other hand，participation in cultural activities has recently been associated with cognitive function and other health outcomes. Cultural activities include daily events for enjoyment， entertainment， recreation， or social contribution . Participation in cultural activities can be“passive\" or \"active，\" interestingly， active cultural participation has been shown to be more effective in cognitive function than passive participation . In recent years， theatrical approaches have been reported to improve the health and cognitive function of older adults through active cultural participation . However， most of the studies reported to date have focused on cognitive function. Theatrical approaches may have a positive impact on physical and social function because they promote rich experiences and interaction among participants. The purpose of this study was to clarify the effects of a theater program intervention on the cognitive， physical， and social functions of older adults living in the community.\n\n【9】Materials and Methods\n\n【10】Participants\n\n【11】Participants were recruited in Akita prefecture， Japan. Our study was performed from June to October 2022. The participants aged 65years old or over， had the ability to walk independently and living at home without personal assistance. The exclusion criteria were dementia， major depression， severe hearing or a visual impairment， stroke，Parkinson's disease， another neurological disease， intellectual disability， need for support of care as certified by the Japanese public long-term care insurance system due to disability， and inability to complete cognitive tests at the baseline assessment. The demographic data comprised age，gender，education， and health variables including Body Mass Index (BMI) [kg/m²].\n\n【12】Intervention\n\n【13】Of the 43 participants who gave informed consent， they were assigned to the control group and theatre intervention group. Each group also received a 90-minute program once every two weeks for three months.\n\n【14】Multicomponent exercise program for the control group\n\n【15】As previouslyreported，amulticomponent exercise interventionWasperformed1。where cognitiveetrainingWas incorporated into the sessions combined with resistance and aerobic training. The control group was conducted by health and fitness instructors or trained care workers. The content of the program is to maintain and improve ADLs and lead to preventive care for the elderly. Each session included as follows； first， started with bending exercises such as per and lower limb stretching. After that， physical training was 10 min of aerobic exercises with cognitive stimulation and 20 min of resistance exercises with cognitive stimulation. The therapist adjusted the level of aerobic exercise and resistance exercises according to each participant's ability， and the participant rested when needed. The cognitive exercises included dual-task training.\n\n【16】Theatre intervention group\n\n【17】The theatrical intervention consisted of a basic program and an application program， and was conducted by longtime theater professionals and teaching staff. The basic program consisted of stretching， aerobic exercise， and vocal and emotional expression exercises for 30 min. Emotional expression exercises involved rhythmically imitating the words and emotions (anger，joy， sadness， etc.) of the instructional staff . The application program included chorus practice， dance， and dialogue practice based on a script created by the participants. The theatre script was produced by the Warabiza， but the lyrics to the theme song were written by the participants themselves . In addition， participants prepared their own costumes and props to be used in the play.\n\n【18】Assessment and outcome\n\n【19】We evaluated a physical performance consisting of grip strength(kg) and usual walking speed (m/s). Four cognitive subtests of the National Center for Geriatrics and Gerontology Functional Assessment Tool (NCGG-FAT)  were also assessed for each participant. Cognitive subtests are indicated as follow；\n\n【20】Components of NCGG-FAT\n\n【21】The computerized multidimensional neurocognitive test was performed on an iPad (Apple， Cupertino， CA， USA) with a 9.7-inch touch display. The task instructions were presented with aletter size of at least 1.0×1.0 cm’on the display. For this study， a trained operator supported each participant by setting up the tablet PC and running each test. Participants completed the NCGG-FAT subtests as follows.\n\n【22】Tablet Version of Word Recognition (WR)： This test is comprised of two computerized tasks of immediate recognition and delayed recall. In the first task of immediate recognition， participants were instructed to memorize 10 words， each of which was displayed for 2 s on the tablet PC. After that， a total of 30 words including 10target and 20 distracter words were shown to participants， and they were required to select the 10 target words immediately. This task was repeated for three trials. The average number of correct answers was recorded as a score ranging from 0 to 10. In another task， participants were asked to correctly recall the 10 target words after 20 min. The number of correctly recalled target words was scored ranging from0 to 10. Finally， we calculated the sum score of the two tasks of immediate recognition and delayed recall.\n\n【23】Tablet Version of Trail Making Test Version A (TMT-A) and Version B (TMT-B)： In the Trail Making Test Version A (TMT-A)\n\n【24】Table 1： Comparison of participant characteristics between Control and Theatre group.\n\n|  | Contral groupn=25  |  | Theatre groupn=18  |  | p value  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Median  | IQR  | Median  | IQR  | p value  |\n| Gender (% female)  | 88.0  |  | 50.0  |  | 0.000  |\n| Age (year)  | 73  | 6  | 71.5  | 9  | 0.407  |\n| Education (year)  | 12  | 2  | 14  | 4  | 0.286  |\n| BMI(kg/m²)  | 22.2  | 3.3  | 22.2  | 8.7  | 0.506  |\n\n【26】p<0.01， Mann-Whitney test， x2test task， participants were instructed to touch the target numbers in a sequence as rapidly as possible. Target numbers from 1 to 15 were randomly displayed on the tablet panel. In addition， the Trail Making Test Version B (TMT-B) instructions required participants to touch target numbers (e.g.， 1-15) and letters in turn.\n\n【27】Tablet Version of Symbol Digit Substitution Task (SDST)： In the Symbol Digit Substitution Task (SDST)， nine pairs of numbers and symbols were shown in the upper part of the tablet display. A target symbol was shown in the center of the tablet panel， and selectable numbers were displayed at the bottom. Participants were asked to touch the number corresponding to the target symbol shown in the central part of the tablet display as rapidly as possible. The number of correct numbers within 90 s was recorded.\n\n【28】Criteria of physical frailty\n\n【29】Frailty status was defined based on five dimensions of the Fried frailty index， including i) shrinking， ii) exhaustion， iii) low level of activity， iv) weakness， and v) slowness， 0 for robust， 1 to 2 for prefrail， and 3 to 5 for frail， and the frailty .\n\n【30】Criteria of social frailty\n\n【31】Makizako's social frail index was applied for this study， consisting of i) Living alone (yes)， ii) Talking with someone every day (no)， iii) Feeling helpful to friends or family (no)， iv) Going out less frequently compared with last year (yes)， v) Visiting friends sometimes (no)，0for robust， 1 for social prefrail， and 2 to 5 for social frail. According to the change of social frail status at the following-up period， robust persons classified at the baseline were grouped into three categories， such as robust， social prefrail， and social frail .\n\n【32】Statistical analysis\n\n【33】We compared the controlgroup and theatre group in demographics for age， gender， education， and BMI by using the Mann-Whitney test. Next， The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was applied to compare the results of physical function and UWS， GS， p<0.05；p<0.01； Wilcoxon signed rank test\n\n【34】Table 2： Comparison of physical and cognitive function pre-test and post-test in each group.\n\n【35】WM， TMT-A & B， and SDST between pre-test and post-test of this program for participants. The Wilcoxon signed rank test was applied to compare the results of the physical frailty ratio and social frailty between pre-test and post-test. Moreover， the Mann-Whitney test was applied to compare amount of change the physical and cognitive items for the control group and theatre group. SPSS Version 27.0 for Windows (SPSS INC.， Chicago. IL， USA) was used for the analysis， and the level of significance was set at p=0.05.\n\n【36】Results\n\n【37】The 43 participants were divided into 25 from the control group(mean age， 72.1 years) and 18 from the theatre group (mean age， 70.7years). The comparison demographics of participants for the control group and the theatre group were shown in Table 1. According to the result of y test， the theater group had a significantlyhigher percentage of males. Table 2 lists the results of physical functions and cognitive functions for the pre-test and the post-test. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to analyze the differences between pre-test and post-test and revealed significant differences in the UWS (p<0.05) for the control group， and the UWS (p<0.01) for the theatre group， however， there was no significant improvement in cognitive function both the control group and the Theatre group. Next， comparisons of the physical frailty and social frailty for the control group and the theatre group at the pre-test and the post-test were shown in Table3. As a result of the Wilcoxon signed rank test， physical frailty， and social frailty improved significantly after the intervention in the control group (physical frailty； p<0.01， social frailty； p<0.05) and theatre groups (physical frailty； p<0.05， social frailty； p<0.01).\n\n【38】Finally， as a result of the Mann-Whitney test was applied to compare the amount of change in the physical and cognitive items for control group and theatre group， the amount of the change in UWS in the theatre group was significantly higher than in the control group (p<0.05) .\n\n【39】Discussion\n\n【40】This study population was a significantly higher percentage of males for the theatre group than control group.

Moreover， Makizako et al. reported that among independent community-dwelling older adults who are not physical frail， those who are socially frail may be at greater risk of developing physical frail in the near future， and social frail may precede (and lead to the development of) physical frail . Therefore，prevention and improvement of social frailty is considered an important issue in aging society around the world. Jasmine et al. were reported that evidence on the effectiveness of complex interventions targeting reduction in socialvulnerability for improving health related outcomes (mortality， function， cognition， subjective health and healthcare use) in older adults living in the community. According to that report， social support and strengthening the community in which elderly people live in the area are necessary to improve social frailty， and furthermore， reducing social frailty may also help improve the condition of their health . Seeman et al. were identified that theater requires each person to perform in front of everyone and that a very powerful group dynamic was created when everyone experienced the same play. The participants in this study were also able to join forces and make friends to accomplish a play， and furthermore， not a single person dropped out. We have confirmed that theater programs can engage and motivate the elderly， and we have also shown that they can strengthen bonds in social situations.\n\n【49】The present study had several limitations. First， the sample sizes for both the control group and Theatre group were quite small. In a further study， we plan to increase the sample size. Second， the participants were not blind to interventions， and this study lacked a control group with no treatment. Case-control comparisons with blinding are needed in addition to before and after the intervention. Third， participants in this study may be healthful and higher cognitive function than non-participants. These requirements should be adjusted for further additional research in the future.\n\n【50】Conclusion\n\n【51】We have shown that a theatrical intervention can be as effective as the multicomponent exercise recommended in previous frailty prevention. Furthermore， the theatrical intervention was suggested to be effective in strengthening the community of participants， and improving social frailty. Therefore， theatrical intervention needs to be further studied to become a new intervention method for the prevention of frailty. Authors should discuss the results and how they can be interpreted from the perspective ofprevious studies and ofthe working hypotheses. The findings and their implications should be discussed in the broadest context possible. Future research directions may also be highlighted.", "index": 13741, "show": true, "start": 13741, "end": 13818, "province": ["格式规范性", "缺少换行"], "isEdit": false, "comment": "【40】"}], "startTime": "2024/09/24 11:40:23", "endTime": "2024/09/24 11:41:16", "cost": 53.201}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:31", "update_time": "2024-09-23 19:41:16", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 19:40:22"}

Associated injuries includedtraumatic aortic dissection and an acute subdural hematoma.We proceeded with posterior spinal decompression and fusion on the same day as the injury. His breathing status improved with postural drainage that was possible due to early spinal stabilization. The patient was discharged three months after surgery. As injuries to the thoracic spine result from high-energy trauma， patients are generally in poor health and surgical treatment is usually delayed. However， if a patient is medically stable， early surgical treatment should be considered despite other major injuries to reduce the risk of further spinal damage and facilitate post-injury care.\n\n【2】Keywords： Spine damage control surgery； Poor general condition； Thoracic fracture-dislocation\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Thoracic dislocation fracture often occurs due to high energy trauma， frequently complicating head injury， respiratory injury， and vascular injury. As a result， there are many cases in which surgery cannot be performed early after injury， and a consensus on optimal surgery timing has not been obtained. We undertook reconstruction and fixation of a thoracic dislocation fracture accompanying multiple trauma on the same day as the injury， which was useful for systemic management after surgery.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 74-year-old man was transported to our emergency department following a fall from a height of 6 m. Neurological examination revealed complete motor paralysis and sensory loss below thoracic level seven (T7)， with absent anal-bulbocavernosus reflexes. Radiographic and computed tomography imaging identified： Burst fracture of T4 (AO classification， 52-B2.3； load sharing classification， 7 points) ； fracture-dislocation of T5 (AO classification， 52-C1.3； load sharing classification， 9 points)； and spinal cord function， Frankel grade A . Associated injuries included acute subdural hematoma，traumatic aortic dissection， bilateral hemithorax， and bilateral clavicular fracture .\n\n【7】Emergency medical treatment comprised blood transfusion and thoracic drainage. After drain placement， cessation of bleeding into the chest cavity was confirmed via angiography； the patient underwent surgery for his spinal injuries 6 hours after sustaining the trauma.\n\n【8】Surgical Procedure\n\n【9】Following an incision along the thoracic spine， free bone fragments were excised. The T5vertebral arch was resected to decompress the spinal cord， and the damaged dura mater was repaired. Pedicle screws were inserted at the levels of T2 to T3 and T6 to T8 . The surgical time was 158 min， with an intraoperative blood loss volume of 748 mL.\n\n【10】Post-surgery， the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit for medical management. As the spinal injury had been stabilized early， postural drainage was possible and the patient's respiratory status and overall medical status improved. Three months post-surgery， the patient no longer complained of back pain. His motor paralysis and sensory loss had recovered to a Frankel classification grade B. He could maintain static sitting and could transfer into and out of a wheelchair with assistance.\n\n【11】Discussion\n\n【12】Thoracic spine injury usually results from high-energy trauma， such as a fall from a height or motor vehicle accident. For our patient， all three columns had been disrupted by the fracture-dislocation， with compression of the spinal canal. Early decompression and stabilization was performed to allow early mobilization and rehabilitation. Several factors must be considered when determining the timing of surgical treatment of thoracic spine fractures： Patients’age， clinical symptoms， neurological injury and impairment， status of accompanying injuries， and type of stabilization required (anterior， posterior or combined stabilization) . An anterior approach allows decompression under direct vision， rigid reconstruction of the anterior column， and sufficient correction of the spinal kyphosis. There is， however， a risk for increased bleeding from the vertebral bodies and epidural bleeding. A posterior approach is technically simpler than an anterior approach； the surgical stress on the patient is relatively lower. However， a posterior approach carries the risk for loss of the kyphosis correction and insufficient decompression. Although decompression of the spinal canal and stabilization should be performed as soon as possible， timing of the surgical treatment must be balanced with a patient's medical status. In trauma care of a patient with multiple fractures involving long bones， treatment is guided by the concept of Damage Control Orthopedic (DCO) surgery. Similarly， the concept of Spine Damage Control (SDC) surgery has recently been proposed for the management of patients presenting with multiple injuries including the spine， due to high energy trauma， the priorities being hemodynamic and spinal stabilization and improving respiratory status. As a majority of patients with thoracic spine injury are in a poor general condition， it is often required to wait until the surgery. However， even in a case with poor general condition such as our patient， from the point of view of damage control surgery， surgery early after injury is useful.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 11:29:14", "endTime": "2024/09/24 11:29:21", "cost": 6.465}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:31", "update_time": "2024-09-23 19:29:19", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 19:29:12"}

Four weeks prior to the presentation， the patient had tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2， and the cough continued as an aftereffect. The Best-Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) was 1.0 and0.6 in the right and left eyes， respectively. Fundoscopy demonstrated bilateral serous retinal and choroidal detachments in the left eye. Optical coherence tomography revealed bilateral serous retinal detachment and choroidal thickening. Fundus fluorescein angiography revealed multiple pinpoint leaks. This patient was diagnosed with a serous retinal detachment type of VKH disease after COVID-19. Steroid pulse therapy was immediately started， which had a good treatment response in the patient. The BCVA improved to 1.2 in the both eyes 2 months after starting the therapy.\n\n【3】Conclusion： COVID-19 infection could be a possible trigger factor for VKH disease. Because the exact mechanism for the development of VKH disease remains unclear today， it should be elucidated urgently.\n\n【4】Introduction\n\n【5】Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) disease occupies 8.1% of uveitis in Japan， ranking second only to sarcoidosis . The exact etiology of VKH disease remains unknown. However， T cell-mediated autoimmune responses against melanocyte-related antigens are thought to be involved in VKH development . In the acute stage， bilateral panuveitis caused by choroidal inflammation， inner ear disorder， and meningitis are frequently observed. The chronic or late stages are characterized by granulomatous uveitis， sunset glow fundus， vitiligo， and gray hair.\n\n【6】The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the latest pandemic infection， which lasted for approximately three years in Japan. The ocular manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection include chemosis， epiphora， and conjunctival hyperemia . Optic neuritis，uveitis (Benito BP)， . and VKH disease have been reported after SARS-CoV-2 infection as well. However， under the circumstances， we cannot determine whether the onset of VKH disease after COVID-19 was caused by chance. Santaramria et al. assumed that SARS-CoV-2 might be a trigger for developing VKH disease .\n\n【7】Herein， we report a case of a middle-aged male with symptoms of VKH disease， probably triggered by SARS-CoV-2， 1 week after COVID-19 affection， which， to the best of our knowledge， has not been previously reported in Japan.\n\n【8】A 57-year-old male patient presented with headache and bilateral diminution of vision for3 weeks. He had no history of tinnitus. Four weeks before presentation， he was diagnosed with COVID-19， as confirmed with a positive reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction of a nasopharyngeal swab.\n\n【9】The initial examination revealed the Best-Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) to be 1.0 and 0.6in the right and left eyes， respectively. The intraocular pressure was 14 mmHg bilaterally. Slit- lamp examination of the anterior segment was within normal limits bilaterally， including the absence of cells and flare. Dilated fundoscopy demonstrated multifocal serous retinal detachments without vitritis in both eyes  and choroidal detachment in the left eye.\n\n【10】Fluorescein angiography revealed dot hyperfluorescence and multiple areas of pinpoint hyperfluorescent foci with later-phase pooling in both eyes. Spectral-domain Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) (RS-3000 advance， Nidek Corporation， Japan) and swept-source OCT (PLEX Elite 9000， Carl Zeiss Meditec AG， Jena， Germany) confirmed a series of morphological changes(bullous serous retinal detachment， Retinal Pigment Epithelium[RPE] undulation， and significant choroidal thickening and the development of a membranous structure on the RPE beneath the foveal cystoid space in both eyes .\n\n【11】The diagnosis was acute onset of VKH disease after COVID-19 infection. Steroid pulse therapy was started by infusing methylprednisolone (Solu-Medrol； Pfizer， New York， NY， USA) at1000 mg/day for 3 days， followed by oral prednisolone (Predonine； Shionogi， Osaka， Japan) administration that was started at 40 mg/day and tapered by 5 mg/day every 4 weeks. The response was very good and BCVA reached 1.2 in both eyes 2 months after the therapy. RPE undulation and significant choroidal thickening improved 2 months after the therapy .\n\n【12】Discussion\n\n【13】SARS-CoV-2，which is a novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19， is associated with a multitude of adverse systemic effects beyond acute respiratory syndrome. Molecular mimicry has been proposed as a contributing factor to some ocular complications， including conjunctival hyperemia ， optic neuritis， uveitis ， VKH disease， and ampiginous choroiditis . The clinical manifestations of VKH disease are caused by an autoimmune response directed against melanin-associated antigens in SARS-CoV-2 may become a trigger for VKH disease， as have the target organs， i.e.， the eye， inner ear， meninges， and skin. Sensibilization of melanocytes by virus antigens is considered one ofthe causes of VKH disease . Flu-like symptoms antecedent to VKH disease would make sense as a virus infection. SARS-CoV-2 may become a trigger for VKH disease， as have several other viruses been considered triggers for the onset of VKH disease .\n\n【14】Bassili et al. reported that the Epstein-Barr virus was detected from a vitreous sample in a 24-year-old Korean woman with VKH disease . The Epstein-Barr virus was not detected although they checked the vitreous sample in nine patients with uveitis and two patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy . Taken together， they concluded the strong association between VKH disease and the Epstein-Barr virus . Their research is very important because it can be direct proof that the Epstein-Barr virus exists in a vitreous body in a patient with VKH disease.\n\n【15】Sugita et al. stated that T cells from the peripheral blood and intraocular fluid in patients with VKH disease cross-reacted with tyrosinase protein as well as withhighlyhomologous cytomegalovirus-specific sequences .\n\n【16】Yoshino et al. reported a case of a 31-year-old Japanese male patient who simultaneously had a positive influenza A virus antigen test result and VKH disease . He was treated with peramivir for influenza A at first and with steroid pulse therapy for VKH disease next . They speculate that influenza A virus infection contributes to the onset or exacerbation of VKH disease .\n\n【17】Chronic Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infection is estimated to infect3% of the world population . Additionally， HCV infection is implicated in the development of various autoimmune diseases .\n\n【18】Toitou et al. speculated a possible association between HCV infection and/or interferon treatment and the development of VKH disease. Several case reports of VKH-like diseases after Interferon-Alpha(IFN-a) administration in patients with hepatitis C were presented. Duan et al. reported that IFN-a treatment of hepatitis C can trigger VKH disease， and the cause of IFN-a-related VKH disease might be its T cell stimulating properties .\n\n【19】COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused bythe new coronavirus， SARS-CoV-2. Galeotti et al. reported that COVID-19 infection can trigger several autoimmuneandinflammatorydisorders .Previous reports support the role ofviral infection as an immunological trigger for VKH disease .\n\n【20】Conclusion\n\n【21】Altogether，COVID-19 infection could be a possible trigger factor for VKH disease. However， the exact mechanism for the development of VKH disease remains unclear today. Therefore， the possibility of the development of VKH disease after COVID-19 infection by chance cannot be denied.

It has become an important adjunct for clinical diagnosis and procedural guidance. We present a case report of a patient who presented to our Pediatric Emergency Department (PED) and was diagnosed with myocarditis using cardiac ultrasound at the start of her resuscitation. Point-of-care ultrasound was found beneficial in making a crucial diagnosis of myocarditis at the initial stage ofresuscitation. POCUS directed the quick management and eventual connection of the patient to Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) which contributed to the better outcome of the resuscitation.\n\n【2】Case Presentation\n\n【3】A 15 months old female child was referred to the PED of a tertiary care， university-affiliated， urban facility， due to 4 days of vomiting， restlessness and high fever. Apart from atopic dermatitis， the child was previously healthy and fully immunized.\n\n【4】Parents reported that 3 days prior to her presentation， she developed fever and shortness of breath. She was prescribed antibiotics by her pediatrician for pneumonia.\n\n【5】On the day of presentation to the PED， the pediatrician did not see any improvement in her condition and referred her to our PED since she appeared pale and lethargic.\n\n【6】On arrival to the PED she was obtunded， in severe respiratory distress and pale. Her vital signs were as follows： Oxygen saturation of 70%， heart rate160 bpm， blood pressure 85/58 mmHg， temp37.30°Cand a capillary refill time of 4 sec.\n\n【7】Further examination revealed clearlung sounds bilaterally， rapid heart sounds with no murmurs and no jugular vein distention. Her abdomen was soft， non-tender， with no enlargement of the liver or spleen. Peripheral pulses were felt very weak on palpation.\n\n【8】From triage， the child was transferred immediately to the resuscitation room. While attempts were being made to establish an IV access， the PED， POCUS trained， attending performed a POCUS examination following the \"RUSH\" protocol - Rapid Ultrasound for Shock and Hypotension. Cardiac echo revealed severely poor cardiac function  with an enlarged IVC and multiple B-lines  in both lung fields. Based on these findings， the child was deemed to be suffering from myocarditis with severe cardiac failure. She was connected to fluids and given a small bolus of 10 ml/kg with normal saline and later， due to poor response， inotorpe treatment was initiated.\n\n【9】Her initial blood tests revealed leukocytosis of 26，000 cells/pl with 34% neutrophils， hemoglobin9.7 g/dL and thrombocytosis of 543，000 cells/ul sodium level was 137 meq/L， potassium 7.6 meq/L， albumin 3.8 g/dL， uric acid 13.7 mg/dL， LDH 1024 U/L with a slight elevation in liver function tests. C-Reactive Protein (CRP) level was 0.4 mg/dL， venous blood gases demonstrated a pH of 6.9 with pCO， 34 mmHg，pO， 32 mmHg and HCO3 of 8.4 mmol/L.\n\n【10】Despite all efforts undertaken， blood pressure was not restored and after consultation with the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit (CICU) team， the child was intubated and put on an Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) machine in the PED resuscitation room. Once connected，blood pressure stabilized and the child was transferred to the CICU.\n\n【11】At the CICU the infant remained connected to the ECMO machine for a period of 8 days with gradual improvement of her cardiac function. After two weeks， she was weaned off from mechanical ventilation. Her nasopharyngeal swab culture subsequently revealed influenza A.\n\n【12】An echocardiogram prior to discharge showed mild dilation with low systolic function of the left ventricle and mild mitral regurgitation. The child was neurologically intact at discharge In the following months， the child was admitted twice to our emergency department. She was found to be with poor cardiac function and was later diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy.\n\n【13】Ultrasound Technique\n\n【14】The RUSH protocol assesses three main components： the pump- i.e. the cardiac system； the tank - i.e. volume status； and the pipes -i.e. the vascular system. A useful acronym in order to remember the exam components by is HI-MAP： Heart， IVC， Morrison's pouch(FAST)， Aorta and Pneumothorax.\n\n【15】Since aortic aneurysm or deep vein thrombosis are rare in children our exam focused on cardiac evaluation and volume status as reflected by the IVC and pulmonary edema.\n\n【16】The cardiac exam looks at the heart in four views：\n\n【17】1. Subxiphoid - the transducer is placed underneath the xiphoid with the probe marker directed to the right of the patient. The transducer is directed to the patient's left shoulder.\n\n【18】2. Parasternal long- the transducer is placed to the left of the manubrium with the probe marker towards the patient's right shoulder.\n\n【19】3. Parasternal short - while maintaining the same position as for the parasternal long view， the transducer is rotated 90° towards the patient's right hip.\n\n【20】4. Four chamber views -the transducer is placed at the point of maximal impulse， probe marker towards the patient's right and the transducer is angled towards the patient s right shoulder.\n\n【21】These views enable a gross assessment of cardiac function -normal， moderately decreased， severely decreased. In addition， the heart is inspected for pericardial effusion.\n\n【22】The IVC is examined by placement of the transducer beneath the xiphoid， probe marker towards the patient’s right and the transducer is perpendicular to the xiphoid. The diameter of the IVC is compared to the aorta where the normal ratio would be 0.8 to 1.2.\n\n【23】The lungs are examined by placement of the transducer in a mid-clavicular line with the probe marker towards the patient's head， over the right and left lung. Finding of lung gliding would rule out a diagnosis of pneumothorax. Finding of multiple B lines may suggest pulmonary edema\n\n【24】Review of the Literature\n\n【25】Several studies have reported on the benefit of rapid use of ultrasound in the emergency department as a tool which influences the decision on how to manage a patient in an unstable condition.\n\n【26】Ultrasound assessment of patients in shock is becoming the standard of care in emergency and critical care settings worldwide. One of the most common protocols used for this assessment is the Rapid Ultrasound in Shock (RUSH) examination.\n\n【27】The RUSH exam， a rapid evaluation of cardiac function， key vascular structures， and likely sources of hypotension， represents a comprehensive algorithm for the integration of bedside ultrasound into the care of the patient in shock. By focusing on a stepwise approach for evaluation the cause of shock defined here as \"Pump， Tank， and Pipes\"， clinicians will gain crucial anatomic and physiologic data to better care for these patients .\n\n【28】Bagheri-Hariri et al.  reported an overall sensitivity of the RUSH exam of 88% and specificity of 96%  with no significant difference between the emergency physician and radiologist as operators of this protocol .\n\n【29】The value of using the RUSH protocol has been reported in two case files of patients， one with hypotensive shock and the other with cardiac tamponade， who presented to the emergency department in shock and were managed promptly using the RUSH protocol during resuscitation71\n\n【30】ECMO is used in cases of cardiopulmonary failure to reestablish cardiac output and organ perfusion so that permanent end-organ injury， while awaiting reversal of cardiac and other organ disease processes， is prevented. An overall survival rate of 51% was seen in children who were supported with rapid-response ECMO after suffering from in-hospital cardiac arrest that did not respond to conventional CPR .\n\n【31】The use of Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) is still limited owing to low availability， especially in emergency departments. Nevet et al.  reported two children with acute myocarditis successfully treated with ECMO in the emergency department of a tertiary pediatric medical center. Given the urgency of their condition and its presumably reversible (viral) etiology， treatment with ECMO was initiated in the department's resuscitation room. The outcome was excellent， and cardiac function remained normal throughout the 6 and 10 months follow-up.\n\n【32】Myocarditis among pediatric patients varies in severity from mild disease to a fulminant course with overwhelming refractory shock and high mortality. Because the disease is potentially reversible， it is reasonable to use ECMO to bridge patients until recovery or transplantation. Nahum et al.  reported on the course and outcome of 12 children with acute fulminant myocarditis who were managed by ECMO due to refractory circulatory collapse. They demonstrated that ECMO can be safely and successfully used for children with acute fulminant myocarditis without a need for heart transplantation.\n\n【33】ThenewPALS recommendations from 2015 emphasize the advantage of connecting the patient toECMO during cardiopulmonary resuscitation. These recommendations rely on evidence from 4 observational studies of pediatric IHCA that have shown no overall benefit to the use of CPR with ECMO compared to CPR without ECMO， but have shown better outcomes when used during cardiac arrest in children with underlying cardiac disease .\n\n【34】While ECMO has been recognized in the latest PALS guidelines， ultrasound was not mentioned in the PALS section and only noted in the adult advanced cardiovascular support section， where the authors recommend that “Ultrasound (cardiac or non cardiac) may be considered during the management of cardiac arrest， although its usefulness has not been well established\".\n\n【35】We believe that due to the noninvasive nature of ultrasound and its ability to provide rapid and repeated assessment of physiology during resuscitation， this modality should move to the front line of emergency care. Integration of POCUS techniques such as the RUSH exam has the potential to augment the clinical evaluation and guide resuscitation to improve the patients outcomes.\n\n【36】Conclusion\n\n【37】This case illustrates the potential clinical impact of POCUS in the management of shock in the pediatric emergency department. The use of POCUS at the very start of resuscitation enabled the treating team to arrive to the diagnosis of severe myocarditis， and the early initiation of the complicated， drastic， yet lifesaving therapeutic option of ECMO， which ultimately improved the child’s prognosis.\n\n【38】It is reasonable to think that the rapid intervention enabled by the POCUS examination contributed to the good neurologic outcome in such a severe case.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 10:44:29", "endTime": "2024/09/24 10:44:49", "cost": 19.872}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:31", "update_time": "2024-09-23 18:44:49", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 18:44:28"}

Used in Morocco for its cosmetic food and therapeutic properties in particularly anemia and all blood diseases. It can be toxic if it is incorrectly dosed. We report 3 cases of nephrotoxicity collected in the nephrology and hemodialysis service of the IBNROCHD university hospital center in Casablanca： 3 women aged 15， 39 and 47 years， following the ingestion of infusion of this plant at doses indeterminate， presented with acute tubule-interstitial nephritis. These new cases of nephrotoxicity at Rubia tinctorum must challenge the need to know how to evoke the diagnosis， to inform， to fight against the trivialization of its consumption， to encourage research on the traditional pharmacopoeia allowing to identify their therapeutic properties in order to formalize， rationalize and codify their prescriptions.\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Rubia tinctorum (El FOUA) is a plant widely used for thousands of years as a source of red color with its variants for dyeing textiles ， in cosmetology， in food as an additive but also as a drug with many therapeutic properties. It is very widespread in the world and particularly in Europe， Asia and North Africa.\n\n【4】In Morocco and in the Mediterranean basin， it is a ubiquitous plant. It is used for dyeing purposes by obtaining a red dye intended for dyeing， painting and even food. Added to this is its medicinal use in many fields. Indeed it is very popular with Moroccan women， as a purgative， after childbirth. A decoction of the whole plant is prescribed in anemia and all diseases of the blood. Its daily intake is recommended to increase blood volume and improve the complexion.\n\n【5】However， Rubia tinctorum is very rich in anthraquinone derivatives. It is considered according to the World Health Organization (WHO) and some other health and food organizations (such as Health Canada or the French Ministry of Agriculture) as involving risks for the consumer. Recent studies have shown a certain toxicity especially on the kidney with a mutagenic or even carcinogenic power of certain anthraquinone derivatives .\n\n【6】Patients and Methods\n\n【7】We report 3 cases of nephrotoxicity collected in the nephrology and hemodialysis service of the IBNROCHD hospital center in Casablanca： Women aged 15 39 years and 47 years following the ingestion of infusion of this plant in undetermined doses to treat anemia.\n\n【8】Results\n\n【9】Observation 1\n\n【10】HE aged 15， with no particular pathological history， admitted to the nephrology department for a glomerular syndrome with renal insufficiency at 66 mg/L of plasma creatinine and 24-h proteinuria at 1 g/24 h and aseptic leukocyturia after taking Rubia tinctorum for ten days， infused several times a day for iron deficiency anemia.\n\n【11】On examination， the patient is apyretic， normo tensioned to 130/70 mmHg， presence of a protein cross with urinary strips without traces of blood， diuresis is calculated at 300 ml per day.\n\n【12】The assessment revealed an acute renal failure at 66 mg/L of creatinine， 24-h proteinuria at 1g/24 h without impact on the protidogram， sterile ECBU with leukocyturia at 200，000 e/ml. Kidney ultrasound showed good kidneys， well differentiated without dilation of the excretory tract.\n\n【13】Observation 2\n\n【14】LN aged 39， with no pathological history， hospitalized in the nephrology department for glomerular syndrome with 24-h proteinuria at 2 g/24 with severe acute renal failure at 90 mg/l of plasma creatinine and aseptic leukocyturia without hematuria or hypertension in the context of incoercible vomiting following the taking of\"elfoua\" for 5 days taken in front of a skin-mucous pallor.\n\n【15】On examination， the patient is non-pyretic， normo-tensioned at120/70 mmHg， diuresis is calculated at 500 ml per day， with two urine strips of protein withouthematuria on the urine strip. mg/L creatinine，24-h protein at 2 g/24 h without impact on the protidogram，ECBU sterile with leukocyturia at 120，000 e/ml. The renal ultrasound was without abnormality.\n\n【16】Observation 3\n\n【17】AH aged 47， hospitalized in nephrology for acute renal failure at 73 mg/l of plasma creatinine incidental discovery during a CPA assessment for cholecystectomy with the notion oftaking\"ELFOUA\"a week before admission.\n\n【18】On examination， the patient is apyretic， normo-tense， diuresis is kept at 1000 ml per day， with urine strip a protein cross without hematuria. The assessment revealed an acute renal failure at 73mg/L of creatinine， 24 h protein at 1 g/24 h without impact on the protidogram， ECBU sterile with leukocyturia at 100 000 e/ml. The renal ultrasound was without abnormality， patients underwent renal biopsy punctures which showed acute tubulointerstitial nephritis. Therapeutically all our patients were put on corticosteroid therapy with a good improvement in creatinine.\n\n【19】Discussion\n\n【20】Despite progress in pharmacology， the therapeutic use of plants is very present in certain countries of the world， especially those developing notwithstanding a medical system modern. Morocco by the richness and diversity of its flora constitutes a true phytogenetic reservoir with around 4500 plant species and subspecies， including Rubia Tinctorum  . In the literature， the data concerning intoxication in madder are rare and few documented. Use for food， curative or aesthetic purposes of certain plants possibly toxic， or at least a part ， can induce serious poisoning， even fatal.\n\n【21】These poisoning is a frequent accident in most regions of the world.\n\n【22】Rubia Tinctorum has been used for thousands of years. The properties most cited in the literature for this plant are ： Its diuretic activity and especially as a hypotensive， its emmenagogue activity， its activity in obstructions of the spleen， its purgative/laxative activity and its activity cholagogue.\n\n【23】The study of the chemical composition of the roots of Rubia tinctorum has shown its richness in anthraquinones in its two free and combined forms . Free anthraquinone forms have no marked pharmacological activity. These free genins present in the drug or formed by the beginning of gastric hydrolysis and which reach the intestine are absorbed at the level of the small intestine， are glucurono-conjugated at the hepatic level and largely eliminated by the urinary route. We also note the existence of an enterohepatic cycle.\n\n【24】The combined forms are neither absorbed nor hydrolyzed in the small intestine. When they reach the colon， they are hydrolyzed by B-glucosidases from the intestinal flora and the anthraquinones released are reduced and will act on intestinal motility . Action on the Na-K-ATPase pump in the cell membrane of enterocytes： By inhibiting the pump， sodium in the colon cells is increased， which leads to a decrease in the reabsorption of water and sodium. This explains the laxative effect. The excessive use of anthraquinones can lead to recto-colic melanoses ， by a cytotoxic effect .\n\n【25】As part of the assessment of the madder root safety ， used as food coloring， toxicity tests were carried out on mice. An acute toxicity test was carried out by administration for 14 madder root days at doses of 0， 500， 2000， 3500， and 5000 mg/kg of body weight. A male mouse receiving 5000 mg/kg body weight died before the end of the study， indicating that the maximum tolerated dose of GR was between 3500 and 5000 mg/kg body weight. A subacute GR toxicity test was also carried out with 62 mice of each sex， with a diet containing madder root at concentrations of 0.3； 0.6； 1.25； 2.5 and 5% for 90 days. All mice tolerated these doses. None of the mice treated with RG showed clinical signs of toxicity. Histopathological examination showed retention cysts in the kidneys and vaginal epidermal cysts in some of the treated or control mice. No hyperplastic， pre-neoplastic and neoplastic lesions and no pathological signs of toxicity were found. These results suggest that dietary exposure to GR at these doses has no acute or subacute toxic effects on mice .\n\n【26】Another study of chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity was carried out. For 90 days repeated doses of 0； 0.6； 1.2； 2.5 and 5.0% of the test substance. The results demonstrate toxic effects of madder root on the liver，kidneys and on the hematopoietic system .\n\n【27】Histopathological changes were mainly observed in the proximal renal tubules， such as vacuolar microvesicular degeneration in the cortex and caryomegaly in the external medulla， the lesions being evident even with 0.6%. In the external medulla， the increase in cell proliferation activity， appreciated by the proliferation of nuclear antigen cells， has been observed. The Severity of focal hepatocyte necrosis increased only in females， to 5.0%， while the increase in the relative weight of the liver but also that of conjugated bilirubin was evident in both sexes， at the dose 1.2%.\n\n【28】A more recent study of the carcinogenicity was conducted to elucidate the long-term effects of Rubia tinctorum and its target organs. Histologically， the frequency of caryomegaly and atypical hyperplasia of the tubules， as well as adenomas and carcinomas in the renal cells， increased significantly in the groups treated in both sexes. These results show that RG exerts an unequivocal carcinogenic power on the cells of the renal tubules and hepatocytes in rats .\n\n【29】Regarding toxicity in humans， an analysis of 11 studies treating colorectal cancers and the use of laxatives has shown that the use of laxatives has increased risk of colorectal cancer .\n\n【30】Other studies have mentioned anthraquinones specifically in evaluating the use of laxatives as a risk factor for cancer. Melanosis coli (discoloration of cells in the colon corresponding to cell death if it is due to excessive use of anthraquinones). In short， anthraquinones should not be used long term and improperly because of the risk of melanosis coli .\n\n【31】Conclusion\n\n【32】In the literature， renal toxicity linked to the consumption of elfoua has not been described in humans， but studies done in rats have shown that the administration of this plant can cause tubular necrosis， with nephritis interstitial. These effects have been observed following chronic ingestion of large doses. Cases have been declared and registered according to the pharmacovigilance center of Morocco.\n\n【33】The association of histological lesions and the taking of elfoua in this patient evokes its toxic effect on the kidney that constitutes a limit to the use of this plant despite its therapeutic qualities.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 11:14:39", "endTime": "2024/09/24 11:14:51", "cost": 11.727}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:31", "update_time": "2024-09-23 19:14:50", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 19:14:38"}

Anatomical characteristics of women's genitalia and physiological characteristics make it more likely to lead to gynecological infections， which significantly affect women's health and spirit . Therefore， LGTIs are important health issues that need to be concerned， monitoring and improved， especially in areas with a high prevalence of LGTIs.\n\n【3】Existing studies reported the prevalence of LGTIs in Vietnam to be widely ranging from 20%to 70% between regions . According to CDC ， the incidence and prevalence of various Reproductive Tract Infections (RTIs) vary greatly between countries and even between regions within a country. However， the epidemiological data suggest that RTIs are common in almost all of the developing countries in which they have been investigated .\n\n【4】Khmer community is a minority ethnics population that mainly stays in Southern Vietnam. Due to different living habits， personal hygiene， and environmental conditions， Khmer women have weak awareness of those diseases， along with their limited rate of access to education and knowledge. They also have psychological concerns in having the gynecological examination as well as attempt to ignore symptoms . Moreover， in many cases， LGTIs patients were undiagnosed since the signs and symptoms of LGTIs are not notable and specific . Therefore， data on the prevalence of LGTIs of the Khmer women population are very limited.\n\n【5】To fill in the gap， we carried out the study to determine the prevalence of LGTIs in reproductive age among Khmer women， clinical forms， and related factors. A total of 830 Khmer women was recruited to participate in the study， was performed clinical examinations and subclinical testings. Survey data collected plays an important role in providing the scientific basis for the reproductive health care of Khmer women in Vietnam.\n\n【6】Methodology\n\n【7】A community-based， cross-sectional survey was conducted among 830 Khmer women of reproductive age in Can Tho city. All participants were interviewed， followed by gynecological examination and laboratory tests.\n\n【8】Results\n\n【9】The average age of participants was 38.05. Of these， women of the age group <20 accounted for the lowest proportion (0.8%)， followed by the 20 to 29 years-old group with 174 people (21.0%)， the30 to 39 years-old group with 320 people (38.6%). There were 329 people aged ≥ 40， accounted for the highest rate (39.6%). The main occupation of the participants in the study was farmer， accounted for 65.0%. The others were at low rate.\n\n【10】According to statistical results of clinical examinations， 477Khmer women accounted for 57.5%， diagnosed with lower genital tract infections. Women in the age group of above 40 accounted for the highest rate (70.5%) of LGTIs compared to other age groups. The difference was statistically significant (p<0.05).\n\n【11】There were 281 out of 830 (33.9%) women diagnosed with cervicitis， accounted for 58.9% of the total of 477 cases of LGTIs. Vaginitis cases had 186 out of 830 cases in total (22.4%)， accounted for 38.9% of 477 cases of LGTIs. Besides， 10/830 cases (1.2%) were diagnosed with vulvitis， accounted for 2.1% of 477 cases of LGTIs.\n\n【12】Study on 4 age groups showed that the prevalence of vulvitis was100.0% in women under 20 years old. The women of sexually active age had a relatively high rate of cervicitis. The prevalence of cervicitis changed with age. Accordingly， the survey at age groups 20 to 29years old and 30 to 39 years old indicated a relatively high rate of cervicitis (p<0.05) among those groups. Besides， the rate of vaginal infections and vaginitis was higher with age increase.\n\n【13】There was a relationship between residence and the prevalence of LGTIs (p<0.05).In which， the group of LGTIs living in the rural areas accounted for the highest proportion with 76.1%. Besides， there was also a low prevalence of LGTIs in women living in urban areas (8.1%) and on boats and riverside areas (15.7%).\n\n【14】Among 477 Khmer women whose clinical examination showed manifestations of LGTIs， the high rates of cervicitis among women living on boats and riverside areas (84.0%) had a statistically significant difference (p<0.05) in comparison with rural and urban areas. Besides， the rate of vaginitis was lowest in this group (12.0%).\n\n【15】There was a relationship between occupation and the prevalence of LGTIs (p<0.05). Women diagnosed with LGTIs that worked as farmers accounted for the highest proportion with 68.9%. Besides， there was also a low prevalence of LGTIs in women who were petty traders (8.6%)， housewives (8.2%)， employees/workers (6.1%)， and others (8.2%).

Hypercoagulability and venous stasis during the perinatal period increase the risk of thrombosis. Iliac Vein Compression Syndrome (IVCS) is caused by compression of the left common iliac vein by the right common iliac artery and lumbar vertebra，leading to left common iliac vein stenosis， fiber adhesion and ultimately iliac vein thrombosis. IVCS is the main cause of acute iliac-femoral vein thrombosis. Herein， we report a case of a 38-year-old woman who was pregnant for 5 weeks and 5 days. She suddenly experienced swelling and pain in her left lower limb and was initially diagnosed with DVT and then IVCS upon further examination.\n\n【2】Keywords： Early pregnancy； Perinatal period； Gestation； Deep vein thrombosis； Iliac vein compression syndrome； Abortion\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) is a disease caused by abnormal blood coagulation in deep veins. Affected individuals can present lower limb swelling， pain and dysfunction due to obstructed blood flow. Thrombus detachment can cause a Pulmonary Embolism (PE)，leading to gas exchange disorder， pulmonary hypertension， right ventricular dysfunction， and even dyspnea， shock and death in severe cases. DVT and PE are collectively called Venous Thromboembolism (VTE). A series of changes during the perinatal period， such as hypercoagulability， uterine enlargement that compresses the inferior vena cava and pelvic vein， and venous stasis， increase the risk of thrombosis.\n\n【5】IVCS， alsoknown as Cockett syndrome or May-Thurner syndrome， is caused by the compression of the left common iliac vein bythe right common iliac artery anterior to it and the lumbar vertebra posterior to it， leading to left common iliac vein stenosis， fibrous adhesions after repeated intimal injuries， and finally iliac vein thrombosis. IVCS is one of the reasons why DVT is more common in the left lower limb . Some patients may have right iliac vein compression， and a small number of patients may have bilateral iliac or inferior vena cava involvement.\n\n【6】Although the relationship between gestation and DVT is known， there are few cases of iliac-femoral vein thrombosis during early pregnancy and the perinatal period.\n\n【7】Case Presentation\n\n【8】Medical history\n\n【9】A 38-year-old woman had 28-day menstrual cycles， 5 days of menses and 40 days of menopause. Color Doppler ultrasound revealed a fetal sac (1.7 cm x1.7 cmx0.8 cm) and a visible yolk sac in the uterus. The patient had a history of cesarean section 12 years ago and was usually anemic without other chronic diseases. The diagnosis was early pregnancy (5 weeks and 5 days of gestation). The pregnancy was unplanned， and the patient requested an abortion. Preoperative examinations showed a D-dimer concentration of 832 ng/ml (normal reference range： ≤250 ng/ml) and no other abnormalities. An abortion was scheduled for 1 week later. At 6 weeks and 3 days of gestation， she experienced swelling in her left lower limb in the morning， which became painful after getting out of bed. Therefore， she visited our hospital for emergency treatment. The physical examination revealed obvious swelling in her left lowerlimb，with red skin， high skin temperature， excessive skin tension， and Homans’ sign (+)； the circumference of the left calf was 4 cm larger than that of the right calf， and the circumference of the left thigh was 10 cm larger than that of the right thigh . The patient was preliminarily diagnosed with DVT of the left lower limb， and the possibility of IVCS could not be excluded. The patient’s D-dimer concentration was 2495 ng/ml. Color Doppler ultrasound indicated thromboses of the left iliac vein， femoral vein， popliteal vein and intermuscular veins of the calf. She denied past and family history of VTE and did not take oral contraceptives containing estrogen.\n\n【10】Diagnosis and treatment plan\n\n【11】Vascular surgeons and obstetricians and gynecologists jointly determined to first perform temporary inferior vena cava filter placement as emergency treatment to prevent a fatal PE， followed by an emergency abortion， anticoagulation treatment if there was no serious bleeding after the abortion， and last thrombectomy.\n\n【12】Diagnosis and treatment\n\n【13】1) Temporary inferior vena cava filter placement was performed， and the distal thrombosis of the inferior vena cava was found by intraoperative angiography. (Radiation dose： 12 mGy). 2) The patient was immediately transferred to the obstetrics and gynecology operating room for an induced abortion. Because the patient had approximately 6 cm H，O， and that in the left external iliac vein was approximately 15 cm H，O. Considering the severe compression of the left iliac vein， a 14 mm to 40 mm balloon was inserted to predilate the stenotic segment of the iliac vein， and a 14 mm-100 mm self-expanding stent was implanted in the stenotic segment. Postoperative angiography showed satisfactory removal of the venous thrombosis in the lower limbs， a good blood flow rate， and no obvious luminal stenosis . The pressure in the left external iliac vein was approximately 7 cm H，O (radiation dose： 180 mGy). No significant vaginal bleeding was observed during the operation. 5) Enoxaparin sodium (6000 IU， q12h) was administered after thrombectomy. 6) A thrombophilia-related examination was performed. Protein S activity was 38.7% (reference range 63.5%-149%)， and there were no abnormalities in antithrombin III， protein C， and APS-related antibodies. The result of the thrombophilia-related gene test was negative. Eight days after thrombectomy， both lower limbs were not swollen， with equal circumferences ， and the D-dimer concentration was 116 ng/ml； color Doppler ultrasound showed no thrombosis in the veins of both lower limbs and patent blood flow through the left iliac vein stent. 7) Eight days after thrombectomy， the inferior vena cava filter was removed， and enoxaparin sodium(6000 IU q12h) was administered postoperatively. 8) Thirty days after thrombectomy， the D-dimer concentration was 47 ng/ml； color Doppler ultrasound showed no thrombosis in the veins of both lower limbs and patent blood flow through the left iliac vein stent； contrast-enhanced CT showed satisfactory shape and location of the left iliac vein，patent blood flow through the stent， and relief of compression of theleft iliac vein . The patient was administered rivaroxaban(20 mg qd) as an anticoagulant.9) The examination at 3 months after thrombectomy showed no swelling in the lower limbs. The patient no longer felt heavy， sore or swollen legs， and her menstrual flow was normal. The D-dimer concentration was 45 ng/ml. Color Doppler ultrasound showed no thrombosis in the veins of both lowerlimbs，no deep venous return， and patent flow through the left iliac vein stent.\n\n【14】Discussion\n\n【15】Increased risk of DVT during gestation\n\n【16】A series of changes during the perinatalperiod， such as hypercoagulability， uterine enlargement that compresses the inferior vena cava and pelvic vein， and venous stasis， increase the risk of thrombosis. VTE is the leading cause of maternal death， and the incidence of VTE is 4 to 5 times higher during gestation than in the non-gestation period and is even higher during puerperium. DVT accounts for 75% to 80% of VTE during the perinatal period， and it often involves the iliac-femoral vein and occurs more commonly in the left lower limb . The lack of timely and accurate identification of risk factors for VTE is main reason that the incidence of and mortality associated with maternal VTE have not continued to decline worldwide over the past 2 decades.\n\n【17】IVCS is common in women of childbearing age， among whom women aged 20 to 40 years account for 60% to 85% of all IVCS patients. Compared with men， women are more prone to PE . Women are in a hypercoagulable state during gestation. During middle to late gestation， the enlarged uterus compresses the inferior vena cava and iliac vein， causing blood stasis in the veins of the lower limbs. The presence of IVCS further increases the risk of DVT. The severity of iliac vein stenosis varies with posture. Iliac vein stenosis is more severe in supine positions； therefore， the risk of thrombosis is higher in pregnant women who need to stay in bed most of the time to prevent miscarriages .IVCS is the leading cause of acute iliac-femoral vein thrombosis， with a true incidence rate of 18% to 49%. However， IVCS is often overlooked. Past medical history of VTE has been included as the main risk factors for VTE during the perinatal period， but the detection of IVCS has not been included in routine prenatal examinations， and the accurate identification of IVCS is essential for the prevention of VTE during the perinatal period. For women with a previous VTE or women with no previous VTE history but with the IVCS symptoms， color Doppler ultrasound or MRI should be performed to determine the presence of IVCS. For pregnant women with IVCS， preventive measures for VTE should be actively taken to reduce the incidence of DVT，but IVCS has not been listed as a risk factor in existing guidelines； therefore， related research should be designed and implemented to provide more evidence for inclusion .\n\n【18】Post-thrombosis syndrome (PTS) should not be neglected\n\n【19】In addition to leading to PE， if not treated effectively and in a timely manner during the acute phase， DVT can also cause venous return disorders of the limbs due to deep vein occlusion. In the process of organized repair， damaged venous valves lead to venous return， causing venous hypertension of the lower limbs and often severe sequela， known as PTS.Long-term high venous pressure in the lower limbs leads to tissue edema， the accumulation of metabolites and tissue malnutrition， mainly manifesting as heaviness， discomfort and swelling in the lower limbs， symptoms that aggravate after long-term standing or activity. Some patients may present with pain， increased muscle tension， varicose veins， pigmentation in the feet and lower legs， thickening and rough skin， pruritus and eczema-like dermatitis in/on affected limbs. Recurrentorprolonged chronic ulcers may occur in patients with severe cases. These symptoms seriously affect quality of life and result in high medical costs . Once DVT is diagnosed in the perinatal period， active treatment is needed to reduce the occurrence of PTS or acute DVT， prompt and effective anticoagulation treatment together with rapid thrombus removal can quickly restore venous return and improve valve function， which are important means to treat DVT and prevent PTS.\n\n【20】Abnormal increase in D-dimer\n\n【21】D-dimer is a coagulation and fibrinolysis marker that is used to rule out VTE in patients with low to moderate clinical suspicion of VTE， and D-dimer levels gradually increase significantly during gestation， peaking during late gestation. However， the use of this biomarker in pregnant women has limitations . The patient reported herein had an unplanned pregnancy. Her coagulation tests prior to the abortion revealed a significant elevation in D-dimer， but the elevation in D-dimer was not addressed. The patient had severe DVT 5 days later. Abnormally high D-dimer concentrations in women should not be ignored， and VTE management should be pursued for women who wish to undergo an abortion and those who have undergone abortions. A VTE risk assessment should be conducted at the earliest possible time for all pregnant women .\n\n【22】Conclusion\n\n【23】This case indicates that clinicians should be alert to the risk of DVT during early pregnancy and attach great importance to DVT management during the perinatal period. It is of great significance to screen for IVCS for the prevention and treatment of DVT. Once VTE occurs during the perinatal period， clinicians should closely monitor and actively treat such patients， so as to reduce the mortality rate and the occurrence ofthrombosis recurrence and PTS.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 10:43:05", "endTime": "2024/09/24 10:43:10", "cost": 5.033}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:31", "update_time": "2024-09-23 18:43:08", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 18:43:02"}

In addition， there was a rule that LD should be defined after 15mins'repetition， thus， it was clarified that LD is ominous not due to its late appearance after uterine contraction， but due to its frequent repetition， which was the same in the other FHR decelerations， thus， novel Hypoxia Index (HI) was the sum of all FHR deceleration durations (min). That showed the total duration of hypoxia as the heart rate was closely parallel to the PaO， lower than 50 mmHg in rabbit divided by the lowest FHR， which showed the hypoxic intensity， in fetal monitoring， and multiplied by 100 to make the index integer . The first target of the Hypoxia Index (HI) was the prevention of infantile cerebral palsy， where the HI was studied retrospectively in 22 infants who diagnosed by pediatric doctors， and intrapartum FHR record was preserved in obstetrics， of which HI was calculated.\n\n【3】Results： There was significant difference of cerebral palsy case numbers between 6 cases， whose HI was 25 or more， and 16 no cerebral palsy cases， whose HI was 24 or less .\n\n【4】Discussion 1： The HI of all 6 cases of cerebral palsy was 25 or more， while the HI of all 16 cases of no cerebral palsy was 24 or less. Thus， infantile cerebral palsy caused by intrapartum damage is prevented when HI is 24 or less in fetal monitoring. The HI is adopted all FHR decelerations including early， late and variable decelerations， as no lag time is included in the HI calculation， as well as sudden continuous fetal bradycardia. HI was evaluated in intrapartum FHR records of6 cases of cerebral palsy and 16 infants of no cerebral palsy， who were diagnosed by Pediatricians.\n\n【5】Discussion 2： Cerebral palsy will be prevented， if the HI is 24 or less in intrapartum fetal monitoring. The 25 or more HI cases can receive very earlytherapy for the treatment of cerebral palsy in neonatal stage， which will improve the therapeutic results of cerebral palsy. As late deceleration disappeared by maternal lateral posture， lateral posture is recommended in all of decelerations . The pattern classification method will be replaced by the objective numeric indices， where neonatal Apgar score and umbilical cord blood pH will be predicted by FHR score and also from the HI using regression equations， and reported attendant doctor in computerized FHR diagnosis. As the fetal blood pH is predicted also by the deceleration area by Cahill et al. ， fetal evaluation will be revolutionary changed to digital analysis.\n\n【6】Conclusion： All FHR decelerations are evaluated with HI. Cerebral palsy is prevented， if the HI is 24 or less in the birth. Early cerebral palsy treatment can be started in neonatal stage. Lateral posture is recommended in all decelerations.\n\n【7】Table 1： Hypoxia Index (HI) was 25 or more in all of 6 cerebral palsy cases， while HI was 24 or less in all of 16 no cerebral palsy cases.\n\n| Hypoxia Index  | Cerebral palsy cases  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Hypoxia Index  | Yes  | No  |\n| 25 or more  | 6  | 0  |\n| 24 orless  | 0  | 16  |\n\n【9】Cerebral palsy cases'y2test： P=0.0008<0.05， significant difference", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 10:20:19", "endTime": "2024/09/24 10:20:35", "cost": 15.768}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:31", "update_time": "2024-09-23 18:20:33", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 18:20:17"}

Consequently， vector control activities have been limited in dengue endemic areas. A cross-sectional descriptive studywas conducted in South Dagonand Htantabin Townships in Yangon Region， Myanmar， to conduct dengue vector surveillance during COVID-19 transmission period，2020. In South Dagon Township， 1，065 potential mosquito breeding containers were inspected and Aedes immature stages were found in 246 containers. Meanwhile， 309 Aedes infested containers out of 1，216 inspected containers were found in Htantabin Township. Discarded container type was the highest Aedes infested proportion in both townships and meanwhile， flower vase was the most common type container. Container Index (CI)， Household Index (HI) and Breteau Index (BI) for South Dagon and Htantabin Townships were 23.1% and 25.4%，65.6% and 71.4%， and 153.8and 163.5， respectively. Absence of house-to-house dengue vector surveillance during pandemic situation， health staff were mainly assigned to COVID-19 prevention activities and limitation of manpower were likely the main reasons for the increase of dengue vector abundance. Thus， it is very important to encourage the community to acquire the voluntary involvement in conducting dengue vector control measures to prevent the future dengue outbreak in the COVID-19 pandemic period.\n\n【2】Keywords： Dengue； Vector surveillance； COVID-19\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Dengue vector Aedes mosquito is also the main vector of Zika and Chikungunya diseases. Aedes control in Myanmar is primarily based on the utilization of chemical larvicides (temephos 1% sand granules)  which is mainly conducted by township health staff . However， with the emergence of COVID-19， dengue vector control activity was gradualy reduced. First COVID-19 case was reported in March 23，2020 and since then majority of the health staff were assigned to response in COVID-19 prevention activities . Moreover， people were strongly recommended to stay at home and partial lock down was applied in some areas of Yangon Region . Consequently， vector control activities were limited in dengue endemic areas and thus led to the favorable situation for dengue vector abundance.\n\n【5】Rainy season occurs normally from June to September in Myanmar is regarded as dengue season with the reported highest incidence of dengue cases although dengue occurs throughout the whole year . Therefore， it is important to conduct dengue vector surveillance activities during the rainy season to assess the dengue vector abundance under COVID-19 pandemic situation. Meanwhile， neighboring country， Singapore reported the dengue outbreak in 2020 with the recorded number of more than 14，000 cases . Another study conducted in Peru also suggested the increase of dengue incidence in all endemic regions during COVID-19 pandemic period . According to WHO， vector surveillance and control activities should be carried out continuously while observing the measures adopted by health authorities to control the pandemic of COVID-19with the participation of community .\n\n【6】In the present study， the main objective was to perform dengue vector surveillance in dengue endemic areas， particularly South Dagon and Htantabin Townships in Yangon Region. This study provided the crucial information for implementing of dengue vector control activities during COVID-19 transmission period in selected dengue endemic areas.\n\n【7】Table 1： Proportion of Aedes infested container types in South Dagon and Htantabin townships.\n\n| Container Type  | South Dagon  |  |  | Htantabin  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Container Type  | No. of inspected container  | No. of Aedes infested container  | %  | No. of inspected container  | No. of Aedes infested container  | %  |\n| Barrel  | 180  | 57  | 31.7  | 49  | 21  | 42.9  |\n| Bucket  | 75  | 33  | 44  | 39  | 13  | 33.3  |\n| Cement drum  | 180  | 60  | 33.3  | 117  | 15  | 12.8  |\n| Cement tank  | 9  | 3  | 33.3  | 35  | 7  | 20  |\n| Ceramic jar  | 87  | 30  | 34.5  | 188  | 39  | 20.7  |\n| Flower vase  | 438  | 9  | 2.1  | 612  | 99  | 16.2  |\n| Spiritual bowl  | 33  | 3  | 9.1  | 68  | 28  | 41.2  |\n| Discardec  | 63  | 51  | 81  | 108  | 87  | 80.6  |\n| Total  | 1065  | 246  | 23.1  | 1216  | 309  | 25.4  |\n\n【9】Materials and Methods\n\n【10】A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted in South Dagon (16°51'0\"N，96°140\"E) and Htantabin (17°8'0\"N 95°55'0\"E) townships from August 2020 to May 2021. South Dagon was one of the high dengue cases-reported townships in last 5 years (VBDC， Annual Report 2019). Meanwhile， Htantabin， a suburban area and located at outskirt of Yangon city， reported the highest dengue cases from January to June 2020. Thus， those two townships were selected purposively for the present study.\n\n【11】As precaution measures for COVID-19 transmission， the following measures were precisely performed during the activity：Applied minimum workforce (one entomologist， one epidemiologist， one Basic Health Staff (BHS) and one local ward authority)， applied personal protective measures (masks and face-shields)， routine temperature checking of survey team members and reduced the contact time with inhabitants.\n\n【12】Inspections of potential breeding habitats (presence or absence of Aedes mosquito immature stages) in and around household premises were inspected thoroughly by survey team following precaution measures as mentioned previously. Container type， size， place and type of water were noted down using checklist. Residents were requested to bring flower vases which were placed indoor to outside of the houses. In order to reduce communication time with residents， larvae and pupae were not counted and also water containers inside of the houses except flower vases were ignored in the present study.\n\n【13】Data analysis\n\n【14】Entomological data were analyzed by using R studio software and categorical data were shown in percentage. Following entomological indices were also applied to check the dengue vector abundance situation in the study areas.\n\n【15】1) Container Index (CI)： No. of positive containers/No. of inspected containers x 100%\n\n【16】2) Household Index (HI)： No. of positive houses/No. of inspected houses x100%\n\n【17】3) Breteau Index (BI)： No. of positive containers/No. of houses inspected×100\n\n【18】Total of 160 and 189 households were participated in South Dagon and Htantabin Townships， respectively. In South Dagon Township， total of 1，065 potential mosquito breeding containers were inspected and Aedes immature stages were found in 246 containers. Meanwhile，309 Aedes infested containers out of 1，216 inspected containers were found in Htantabin Township. In terms ofthe number of containers， flower vase was the highest number of containers in both townships with 438 and 612， respectively， and followed by barrel and cement drums in South Dagon and ceramic jars in Htantabin Township. However， discarded container type was the highest Aedes infested proportion among all types of containers with the percentage of 81%in South Dagon and 80.6% in Htantabin Township .\n\n【19】Container Index (CI)， Household Index (HI) and Breteau Index(BI) were 23.1% and 25.4%， 65.6% and 71.4%， and 153.8 and 163.5， respectively， for South Dagon and Htantabin townships .\n\n【20】Discussion\n\n【21】Among those 8 common types of containers (barrel， bucket， cement drum， cement tank， ceramic jar， flower vase， spiritual bowl and discarded)， flower vase container type was the highest number in both townships as a part of the Myanmar culture. One study conducted in Yangon  reported the very low proportion of Aedes infestation in flower vase container type . However， two studies conducted in Yangon in 2010 and 2011 stated that flower vase was one of the key containers for mosquito breeding . In the present study， proportion of Aedes infestation in flower vase was noticeably high in Htantabin Township which was the highest dengue case-reported township in 2020.\n\n【22】Discarded container type was the highest proportion of Aedes infestation in both townships and the same situation was reported in previous studies conducted in Hlaing Thar Yar  and South Dagon townships in Yangon. Majority ofthe health staff fromtownships were assigned to prevention and control of COVID-19 activities (MOH，2020) which led to the gradual decrease of dengue vector surveillance and control activities. It might be one of the major reasons that the high Aedes infestation in inspected containers especially in discarded and flower vase containers. One study conducted in Bangladesh reported the increase of dengue cases and the decrease of the dengue vector control activities during COVID-19 pandemic situation. Conducting house to house dengue vector surveillance during pandemic situation became the difficult task for health staff. Thus， it is very important to encourage the community to carry out voluntary vector control activities during the pandemic situation.\n\n【23】Table 2： Entomological indices in South Dagon and Htantabin townships.\n\n|  | South Dagon (160 households)  | Htantabin (189 households)  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Container Index (CI)  | 23.10%  | 25.40%  |\n| Household Index (HI)  | 65.60%  | 71.40%  |\n| Breteau Index (BI)  | 153.8  | 163.5  |", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 11:19:13", "endTime": "2024/09/24 11:20:11", "cost": 58.051}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:31", "update_time": "2024-09-23 19:20:10", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 19:19:12"}

We are reporting the case of a 31 years-old Caucasian woman who developed a chylothorax following childbirth， for which interventional radiology was the only successful treatment， after failure of conservative treatments. Regarding the few published cases and our， it seems that interventional treatment should be proposed as soon as postpartum chylothorax is diagnosed. It seems that interventional radiology， because of its small morbidity， should be considered first.\n\n【2】Keywords： Chylothorax； Childbirth；Lymphography\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Chylothorax is an uncommon type of pleural effusion， caused by leak of chyle into the pleural space due to a lesion of the Thoracic Duct (TD).\n\n【5】Its etiologies are usually classified as traumatic and non-traumatic. Traumatic causes are mainly represented by surgical trauma. However a less frequent mechanism consists in intra-thoracic hyper pressure caused by Valsalva maneuver. This can happen during the peripartum period， defining the postpartum chylothorax， whose management remains to date little consensual.\n\n【6】In this case report we describe for the first time chylothorax after childbirth treated by interventional radiology.\n\n【7】Case Presentation\n\n【8】A 31 years-old Caucasian female， without any significant past medical history， whose pregnancy was uneventful， presented to the emergency room for a left thoracic pain 1 month following childbirth. A chest CT-scan  disclosed a left-sided pleural effusion without any other abnormality. Diagnosis of chylothorax was performed following thoracocentesis.\n\n【9】After failure of a 3 months long-chain triglycerides free diet， the patient was referred to our department of thoracic surgery. A thoracic MRI， without injection of contrast ， was performed to study the anatomy of the TD， disclosing a TD in classical anatomical position， where as a lymphoscintigraphy revealed a chyle leak at T10 level .\n\n【10】A surgical intervention was then decided， consisting in right thoracoscopic ligation of the TD， at the level of the pulmonary ligament. An en bloc ligation was performed taking the TD and all the surrounding fatty tissue between the azygous vein and the esophagus. Unfortunately， a recurrence of the chylous leak was noted following regular food resumption.\n\n【11】Because the patient was reluctant to undergo a new surgery， alymphography was performed. It disclosed a plexiform organization of the TD under the diaphragm with the presence of an accessory lymphatic duct. A leak of contrast was highlighted at this level， located below the surgical clips. This examination also allowed guiding the percutaneous cisterna chyli puncture and a successful TD embolization .\n\n【12】Post-operative period was uneventful. The patient resumed a regular food 7 days after the procedure， without any evidence of new chyle leak.\n\n【13】Discussion\n\n【14】There are no specific recommendations for the treatment of chylothorax. However， it is admitted that for low outputs (<500 mL/day) conservative treatment can be preferred， where as immediate interventional treatments are preferable for high ones (>1， 5 liters per day) .\n\n【15】Postpartum chylothorax is a rare entity， for which management is not well defined. Indeed， so far only 3 cases have been described in the published literature .\n\n【16】Tornling et al.  have described in 1987 one case of chylothorax after childbirth for which conservatory treatment failed and needed surgical management. Same findings were reported by both Camerata et al. ， and Momose et al. ， with need for surgical treatment. In line with these data， conservative treatment failed in our patient. One can thereby wonder whether interventional treatment should immediately be considered in the management of chylothorax following childbirth.Two options are then possible： surgical treatment or Interventional Radiology (IR). Compared to the surgical option， IR has the advantage of being less invasive， and possibly leading to both diagnostic and treatment of the leak.\n\n【17】Inthepublishedliterature，the sensitivity ofMRlymphangiography and lymphoscintigraphy for the detection of atypical lymph vessel reach 100% and 79%， respectively . However， in our case both exams failed to demonstrate the anatomical variation of the thoracic duct， particularly its plexiform sub-diaphragmatic distribution， and the presence of an accessory channel finally highlighted by lymphography.However， in our case the MRI was performed without injection of contrast possibly decreasing its diagnostic capacities.\n\n【18】In conclusion， although few cases are so far reported， it seems that interventional treatment should be immediately considered in the management of chylothorax following childbirth. IR， in particular lymphography， seems to have the advantages of being possibly diagnostic and therapeutic. If MR lymphangiography is performed， it should always be with injection of contrast.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 10:19:09", "endTime": "2024/09/24 10:19:18", "cost": 8.597}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:31", "update_time": "2024-09-23 18:19:17", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 18:19:09"}

Late second trimester and early third trimester is the most common period of hepatic decompensation when most of the complications are seen. We hereby describe an unusual case where the diagnosis of cirrhosis was unknown till the time of delivery due to its asymptomatic nature. However， the diagnosis was finally made with high index of suspicion and was further optimally managed to achieve a successful pregnancy outcome. The aspects of optimal management have been discussed.\n\n【2】Keywords： Cirrhosis； Portal Hypertension； Pregnancy\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Pregnancy associated with cirrhosis is a rare occurrence. Nevertheless， pregnancy in a patient with cirrhosis and portal hypertension is a unique problem which needs specialized care. Pregnant patient with cirrhosis and portal hypertension is at risk of significantly increased foetal loss， oesophageal variceal bleeding， splenic artery aneurysm rupture， hepato-renal syndrome and hepatic decompensation . The complications and hepatic decompensation most commonly occur in the early third trimester (28 to 32 weeks of gestation). The present report describes a rare case with asymptomatic cirrhosis going undetected during pregnancy only to present with hepatic decompensation at the time of delivery and post-partum period.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 5h gravida multiparous 32 year old lady presented to emergency at 36 weeks and 5 days with complains of labour pains. She had been non-compliant with her antenatal visits with only two visits， one at 16h and another at 24th week of gestation. This was a precious pregnancy as she had two intrapartum still births associated with difficult delivery in the past. The patient had only 1 live issue who was 6 year old and was born of a caesarean section at term， done for meconium stained liquor in early labour. There was no history of any chronic medical or surgical illness.\n\n【7】On examination vitals were stable， with mild pallor and no icterus. Per abdomen uterus was term size with mild contractions and normal foetal heart rate. On per vaginal digital examination， cervix was 2 fingers loose and 30% to 40% effaced with intact membranes. The pelvis seemed to be inadequate for the baby. An emergency caesarean section was contemplated in view of anticipation of a difficult delivery. After shifting the patient to the operation theatre， spinal anaesthesia was given. Per operatively large dilated vessels (5 mm to 7 mm in diameter) were encountered subcutaneously and in the preperitoneal space. Some of them had to be secured with suture ties after being accidentally incised during surgery. A live male baby of 2.3 kg was delivered. Mild atonic post-partum haemorrhage occurred which could be controlled by uterine massage and uterotonics. Despite the best efforts， there was a blood loss of approximately 1.3 liters. An abdominal drain was inserted to prevent intra-abdominal collection. As the pre-operative haemoglobin was 7.7 gm %with a platelet count of 99，000/dL and an INR of 1.88， 1 unit of packed red blood cells and 4 units of fresh frozen plasma were transfused.\n\n【8】In the immediate post-operative period patient was comfortable， afebrile， maintained stable vitals and adequate urine output. However， the abdominal drain continued to produce an output of serosanguineous fluid at approximately 50 to 100 cc/hr. The blood investigations were remarkable in terms of deranged complete blood count (haemoglobin 8.8 gm %， platelet count 81，000/dL， and total leukocyte count 15，100/dL) and deranged liver function tests(total bilirubin 1.8 mg/dL， direct bilirubin 0.9 mg/dL， aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase-327/125IU/L，total protein-4.4 gm % and serum albumin-2.3 gm %). On day 2，peritoneal drain could not be removed in view of persistent high output of 1500ml to 1700 ml per day. Adequate amount of fluids were given keeping in mind the drain output， urine output and in sensible losses and peritoneal fluid became clear gradually. Ascitic fluid investigations revealed a white cell count of 1000/dL with 90% polymorphs， sugar-106 mg % and aprotein level of 0.7 gm %， suggestive of infected transudative fluid. Ultrasound examination of the abdomen revealed lobulated 17.7 cm liver with coarsened echotexture， splenomegaly(17.9 cm)， dilated portal vein (1.2 cm) and splenorenal collaterals， suggestive of cirrhosis with portal hypertension. However， there was no history of hematemesis， melena， recent jaundice or blood transfusion. And there were no stigmata of chronic liver disease that were evident.\n\n【9】Further investigations revealed negative tests for hepatitis B antigen， anti-hepatitis C antibody and autoimmune hepatitis antibody panel. Serum ceruloplasmin was done and Wilson’s disease was ruled out. Iron profile was done and the patient was found to be iron deficient， for which iron replacement was initiated. The blood and the ascitic fluid cultures failed to show any microbiological growth， however the patient was already on antibiotics when the samples were collected. A liver biopsy was planned as per the gastroenterologist's opinion to ascertain aetiology of cirrhosis， but was not done as the patient declined consent. Final diagnosis of liver cirrhosis with portal hypertension and secondary bacterial peritonitis was made. Treatment was started with beta-blocker (propranolol)， spironolactone， furosemide， intravenous albumin， stool softener and higher antibiotics in consultation with the gastroenterologist. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was also done and revealed grade 2oesophageal varices for which endoscopic variceal ligation was done. The peritoneal drain output reduced gradually allowing its removal on day 12. Stitches were removed on post operative day 20 and was discharged next day.\n\n【10】Discussion\n\n【11】Pregnancy with portal hypertension secondary to cirrhosis is a scenario which is rarely encountered but commonly associated with serious complications leading to significant morbidity and poor prognosis. Cirrhosis is uncommon in reproductive age group with a reported incidence of less than 45 cases per 100，000 women. Moreover， metabolic and hormonal derangements associated with cirrhosis lead to anovulation and hence infertility. In more recent times improvements in the treatment of chronic liver disease resulted in higher conception rates， making pregnancy with cirrhosis more common， however the exact incidence remains unknown. The diagnosis of cirrhosis usually surfaces in early pregnancy with routine evaluation or is known beforehand. Thus there is certain level of preparedness for screening and management of complications in the third trimester and peripartum period. Despite all measures， the pregnancy outcomes in cirrhosis remain dismal. The present case is unique in terms that a diagnosis of cirrhosis could be made only at the time of delivery. Even then， with appropriate timely recognition and management， a successful outcome was achieved.\n\n【12】Approximately up to 50% ofthe pregnancies in cirrhotic patients are expected to face complications， the most common being variceal haemorrhage and liver failure . Refractory ascites， hepatic encephalopathy， hepatorenalsyndrome。spontaneousbacterial peritonitis， post-partum haemorrhage and adverse fetal outcome are other complications which maybeencountered. The riskofvariceal haemorrhage is 400 times during pregnancy and remains one of the deadliest complications. Up to 80% patients with detectable varices are expected to bleed during the gestational period. The most common occurrence is during the late second and early third trimester， which is the period of maximum vasodilation . Although uncommon， splenic artery aneurysms also rupture and bleed around the same time period. The importance of splenic artery aneurysms lie in the requirement of a high index of suspicion to reach a diagnosis and its association with high rates of materno-fetal mortality. Secondary to increased intra-abdominal pressure during pregnancy， extravasation of fluid from splanchnic vessels is hindered， making ascites relatively uncommon as a complication during pregnancy. The rates of fetal wastage are alarming in cirrhosis with estimates reported in the range of 10% to 66%. Even with live births， the risk of prematurity is significantly high. A case series reported a prematurity incidence of 25% amongst live births in pregnancies in cirrhotic patients . It is important to recognize that the occurrence of complications in cirrhosis is often interlinked with one complication triggering the other. Variceal haemorrhage may precipitate hypotension， acute liver failure and thus hepatic encephalopathy. It also increases the risk of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis which in turn increases the risk of hepatorenal syndrome significantly. Thus prevention of complications in the first place remains an important goal.\n\n【13】Management of f pregnancy in cirrhosisentailscareful assessment of liver function， esophageal varices and screening of other complications followed by an individualistic approach for each case. The importance of maintaining hydration and avoiding hypotension cannot be overemphasized. Hypotension can precipitate hepatorenal syndrome and is a risk factor of hepatic decompensation and encephalopathy. The risk of hypoglycaemia is real and needs to be addressed on a regular basis with generous supplementation of simple sugars and fruit juices. Renal function should be monitored on a regular basis to pick up any dysfunction early. Regarding management of labour， choice of mode of delivery should be made as per obstetric indications. Underlying coagulopathy in cirrhosis often needs correction to prevent post-partum haemorrhage which is common and has been reported in 7% to 26% of the cases. Risk further increases with a caesarean section and blood products should be readily available during labour of such a patient. Regional anaesthesia should be preferred over general anaesthesia if required during operative delivery. And sedatives should be used minimally as they may precipitate hepatic encephalopathy.\n\n【14】In the present case， dilated pre-peritoneal veins and significant ascites amounting to continuous post-operative abdominal drain output were important markers towards portal hypertension. Since the patient had tolerated the course of gestation well without any symptoms，achronic significant systemic illness was hardly suspected. However， to our surprise， an unexpected diagnosis of cirrhosis uncovered on further evaluation. The patient was successfully managed with beta blockers (propranolol 20 mg thrice daily)， spironolactone (50 mg twice daily)， antibiotics for secondary bacterial peritonitis and ligation of esophageal varices which were picked up before they bled on screening upper gastrointestinal tract endoscopy.\n\n【15】It was difficult to maintain fluid balance because of large drain output， but formed an important part of the management. Fortunately in this case， the outcome was good for both the baby and the mother.\n\n【16】To conclude， the possibility of portal hypertension and liver cirrhosis should be borne in mind when significant ascites and dilated pre-peritoneal vessels are noted on caesarean section， irrespective of the course of pregnancy. Further evaluation and management by a multidisciplinary effort from the obstetrician， gastroenterologist and neonatologist holds the key to a successful pregnancy outcome.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 11:16:13", "endTime": "2024/09/24 11:16:29", "cost": 16.487}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:31", "update_time": "2024-09-23 19:16:29", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 19:16:11"}

Such a loss leads to severe emotional trauma which affects the social and professional aspects of the individuals'life. The term“anophthalmic socket”is defined as an orbit not containing an eyeball， but with orbital soft tissues and eye-lid structures . In cases of large anophthalmic sockets， the use of a solid ocular prosthesis may lead to lower lid laxity and deep superior sulcus due to the weight of the prosthesis. A hollow ocular prosthesis would be lighter and yet large enough to occupy the evident residual ocular space .\n\n【5】Numeroustechniques have been recommended to achieve weight reduction ofocularprostheses. Edias et al.  proposed a technique for making ocular prostheses for large anophthalmic cavities by introducing expanded polystyrene (Styrofoam) to the acrylic resin at the time of making the prosthetic sclera， aiming at reducing the weight of the prosthesis. The Styrofoam would be a part of the prosthesis； thus， adding some weight to the definitive prosthesis. Aggarwal et al.  described a two-step technique for acrylic resin packing with a wax spacer in between， which was later removed by lost wax technique. Kavlekar et al.  described a single-step， lost-salt technique to obtain a lightweight ocular prosthesis. Worrell  used sugar matrix (sugar mixture with egg white， i.e.， caster sugar in the ratio of 1：5) to fill the hollow portion of an ocular prosthesis that was evacuated by immersing in hot water. Maskey et al.  described a technique using putty spacer and matchsticks to aid in creating a hollow cavity. This paper describes a single step technique to create a hollowed ocular prosthesis using soap spacer.\n\n【6】Case Presentation\n\n【7】A 42 Year old male was referred to the Department of Prosthodontics，Crown and Bridge， Goa Dental College and Hospital， with a discolored ocular stock eye prosthesis which he had been using since past two years.\n\n【8】The patient presented with a history of trauma 3 years back to his eye followed by surgical enucleation of the socket. On examination， the eyelids were intact， the tissue bed was healthy and adequate depth was present between the upper and the lower eyelids sufficient enough for the retention of an ocular prosthesis.\n\n【9】Procedure\n\n【10】A stock eye was selected which matched the iris color of the patient’s eye.\n\n【11】2) A putty impression (Zhermack Elite HD+) of the stock eye was made to create a mold. A special tray was fabricated using clear auto polymerizing acrylic resin (DPI， India) in the putty mold . The borders of the tray were adjusted in the socket and vent holes were made. A mixing tip was attached to this tray which served as a handle and also allowed the flow of the light body addition silicone material (Aquasil Dentsply) to record the impression of the tissue bed .\n\n【12】3) A mold type III dental stone was obtained using a two pour technique.\n\n【13】4) Modeling wax (Modeling Wax， Deepti Dental Products of India Pvt. Ltd.) was poured in this cast to obtain a wax pattern which was modified on the patient to obtain proper contours .\n\n【14】5 The wax pattern was invested and de waxed.\n\n【15】on the tissue bed surface . These holes were then sealed using clear auto-polymerizing resin.\n\n【16】6) To create a putty spacer two sheet thickness of modeling wax was adapted on the inner surface of the mould， putty was placed and the flask was closed .\n\n【17】8) The iris positioning was done on the scleral blank using vernier caliper  . The iris was transferred from the stock eye to the sclera blank to verify the iris positioning.\n\n【18】7 During packing， the putty spacer was used during trial closure in-order to create a hollow space. Soap spacer made from melt and pour soap base (Melt and pour soap base， Soapy twist) was placed in the space created ， which was flushed out after acrylization by using hot water through two holes which were created 9 The tinting of the sclera was done using composite paints(SR Adoro Stains， Ivoclar Vivadent， Germany). A protective coating(G-Coat Plus， GC America Inc.) was applied after which a thin layer of wax was poured on the sclera. The prosthesis was re-invested， dewaxed， packed with clear acrylic resin. Processing was done and the prosthesis was polished and finished  and delivered to the patient . The patient was happy with the esthetics and comfort of the prosthesis.\n\n【19】Discussion\n\n【20】The aim of any prosthetic treatment is to bring the patient back to the society with a normal appearance. Glass was the material of choice for fabrication of ocular prosthesis till 1940s. With the invention and development of polymers， Polymethyl Methacrylate (PMMA) became the material of choice . Custom made ocular prosthesis using PMMA has various advantages such as- it is non brittle， better adaptation hence adding comfort to the patient， improved esthetics， longer serviceability， and easy to repair or polish.\n\n【21】Various impression techniques have been reported in literature such as direct impression/external impression technique， using stock ocular tray， impression with custom ocular tray， impression with stock ocular prosthesis， and wax scleral blank technique. Various impression materials like irreversible hydrocolloid， ophthalmic alginate，polyvinylsiloxane，tissueconditioners， and dentalimpression waxes can be used. For iris positioning different techniques using grid， glasses， facebow， vernier caliper， arbitrary marking have been reported. Light cure stains， paints， emax veneer， digital photography have been used to match the shade of the sclera .\n\n【22】In this case report， the impression is made with a custom ocular tray using polyvinyl siloxane impression material， a vernier caliper was used for recording the iris position and shade matching was done with acrylic paints. The use of a soap spacer which can be flushed out post acrylization makes the fabrication of a definitive hollow prosthesis easier. The described technique improves the adaptability of the prosthesis and allows for customization of the sclera with artistic skills. The hollow prosthesis reduces the weight and improves the acceptance of the prosthesis .\n\n【23】Conclusion\n\n【24】The prosthetic rehabilitation of an anopthalmous eye is a chalenging process. It is crucial to match the esthetics and also improve adaptability of the prosthesis. Hollowing out the prosthesis reduces the weight， improving patient acceptance towards the prosthesis. Painting the sclera allows full control ofthe prosthodontist to match the sclera of the natural eye.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 10:48:15", "endTime": "2024/09/24 10:48:30", "cost": 15.473}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:31", "update_time": "2024-09-23 18:48:30", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 18:48:14"}

We report a case of a large pleomorphic adenoma in the upper lip in a 42-year-old man with a 6-month evolution， which due to its size could be mistaken for a malignant lesion. Biopsy is essential to close the diagnosis in these cases and to exclude the hypothesis of a malignant lesion； the treatment was performed with surgical excision.\n\n【2】Keywords： Pleomorphic adenoma； Salivary gland tumor； Benign neoplasm\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Pleomorphic adenoma is the most common benign mixed tumor of the salivary glands. May occur in both major and minor salivary glands . This tumor usually presents as a solitary， painless， slow-growing nodular mass， with prevalence in females and with a higher occurrence between the third and sixth decade of life. Histologically， the lesion may present variable epithelial， myoepithelial and mesenchymal elements， usually presenting a well-circumscribed capsule. Epithelial cells can form ducts， islands， or cords of cells . Differential diagnoses include mucoepidermoid carcinoma， salivary gland tumors， mucocele， neurofibroma， schwannoma and secondary infections. Treatment consists of surgical excision of the lesion with a safety margin. Incomplete removal cases can cause recurrences. Post-surgical follow-up is essential to assess the possibility of malignant transformation .\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】Male patient， 42 years old， sailor， was referred to our department for presenting a painless swelling in the upper lip region. The patient reported evolution of the lesion of six months. During the anamnesis， the patient had a good general condition and reported being hypertensive controlled by medication. In the intra-oral clinical examination， the patient presented a large， solitary， painless， hardened， normocolored， pedunculated， smooth-surfaced tumor lesion in the region of the upper left labial mucosa， with an evolution of six months . Patient had a urine test result， performed six days before our appointment， without the presence of abnormalities.\n\n【7】Given the different diagnostic hypotheses， an excisional biopsy of the lesion was requested to clarify the diagnosis. The macroscopic material sent for analysis consisted of a soft tissue fragment， with a smooth surface， irregular shape， firm consistency， brown in color， measuring 20 mm x10 mm ×10 mm . Histological sections revealed a fragment of glandular neoplasia. Neoplastic cells form ducts with two or seven layers of cells containing hyaline material in their interior. In some fields， neoplastic cells displayed eccentric plasmacytoid-like nuclei. In other fields， the presence of deposition of hyaline material and myxoid material was observed. The neoplasm was delimited by dense fibrous connective tissue and showed， in some fields， neoplastic cells with a polyhedral shape that， sometimes，presented eccentric nuclei with a plasmacytoid shape. Completing the histopathological picture， a discrete mononuclear inflammatory infiltrate， extravasation of red blood cells and ectatic blood vessels of varying sizes were present in the specimen . The final diagnosis was compatible with pleomorphic adenoma.\n\n【8】The treatment was performed by surgical excision of the lesion and was uneventful . Antibiotic， anti-inflammatory， and analgesic were prescribed to control postoperative symptoms. The patient had a satisfactory recovery and within the expected parameters.\n\n【9】Discussion\n\n【10】Salivary gland tumors are complex lesions that are differentiated by the clinical-histological pattern. These lesions are rare and represent about 3% to 10% of all head and neck neoplasms . Most represent benign tumors， about 75% to 85%； females are the gender most affected by these tumors， the parotid gland represents the most affected location， it can occur in any age group， however， the highest reports occur between the third and sixth decade of life .\n\n【11】The AP represents the most common neoplasm of the salivary gland. Most of these tumors arise in the parotid gland. Intraorally， the most common sites are the palate， upper lip and buccal mucosa， areas that have many minor salivary glands. The name of this lesion refers to its varied histology， composed of epithelial， myoepithelial andmesenchymal structures . Clinically， the lesion is usually present as a unilateral， asymptomatic， slow-growing， well-circumscribed and most often encapsulated tumor， the overlying mucosa most often does not present ulceration .\n\n【12】Minor salivary gland tumors are uncommon and among them the pleomorphic adenoma is the most frequent. In a study of 82 cases of tumors in minor salivary glands carried out by Toida et al. ， pleomorphic adenoma was the most common tumor intraorally， with the palate being the most common site (44 cases) and females the most affected， with a male/female ratio of 1：3.2. The occurrence of pleomorphic adenoma in the lip represents about 20% to 40% of all intraoral pleomorphic adenomas . In the study by Toida et al.， of the 54 cases of intraoral pleomorphic adenoma， only 3 were in the upper lip . The upper lip is more affected than the lower lip in a ratio of 6：1， the exact cause of this discrepancy is not known， but it is believed that it is due to differences in the embryonic development of the upper and lower lips， another theory is that the cells tumors would be destroyed by the continuous presence of inflammatory cells in the lower lip induced by frequent traumatic events . Adenomas that occur on the lips appear to occur at a younger age than those that occur elsewhere， with a peak incidence between the third and fourth decade of life， with a mean of 33.2 years . According to a bibliographic survey of 38 cases of AP in the lip performed by Suka，2021，the upper lip was the most affected， with a predominance of the left side， males (21 cases) were more affected than females (17 cases)， the mean age was 43.3 years and the mean diameter of the tumors was2.6 cm . This information corroborates our case， as it is a 42-year old male patient with a lesion in the upper lip on the left side.\n\n【13】Due to its nonspecific clinical features， the differential diagnosis of AP in the upper lip includes a wide variety of pathologies： benign and malignant neoplasms of the salivary glands， sialolithiasis， leiomyoma， hemangioma， neurofibroma， schwannoma or infection with a foreign body . The diagnosis of pleomorphic adenoma is made by histopathological analysis： It usually presents as a proliferation of encapsulated epithelial and myoepithelial cells with the presence of stroma， which can be myxoid， chondroid or hyalinized. The epithelium may form ducts and cystic structures or may appear as islands or nests of cells . Imaging tests， such as magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography， can aid in the diagnosis， as they allow a better visualization of the location and size of the lesion， in addition to being useful for differentiating between a benign or malignant lesion .\n\n【14】The treatment of choice for AP in the lip is tumor excision with a safety margin， but some authors suggest performing aspiration biopsy before definitive removal of the tumor，the prognosis is good. Recurrence cases may be associated with incomplete tumor excision or capsule rupture. Malignant transformation presents about 2% to7% of cases . Some authors report that the occurrence of AP in the upper lip is more related to benign tumors， while the lower lip is more related to malignant lesions .\n\n【15】Conclusion\n\n【16】Finally， AP should be investigated and considered as a differential diagnosis in cases of painless tumor masses of the lips. Due to its non-specific clinical characteristics， diagnosis may be difficult， and for this， biopsy is indispensable，imaging tests can also be useful. Surgical excision is the treatment of choice for this lesion and periodic follow-up should be performed to reduce the chances of recurrence and malignant transformation.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 10:19:29", "endTime": "2024/09/24 10:19:52", "cost": 23.327}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:31", "update_time": "2024-09-23 18:19:50", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 18:19:27"}

While the most common metastasis sites for breast cancer are bones， liver，lung and brain ， the metastasis to parotid gland is extremely rare. Here we describe an unusual case of a patient， who presented with an isolated contralateral parotid lymph node metastasis from breast origin.\n\n【1】A 33-year-old mother， without any family history of breast cancer， was diagnosed with left breast tumor by breast ultrasound  and admitted to breast surgery in 2015. The patient was offered modified radical mastectomy and axillary lymph node dissection on November 17，2015， being classified as luminal B breast cancer IIA stage (pT2N0M0) according to the TNM classification of AJCC in 2009. Then the patient was given 7 cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy at the department of surgery from December 15， 2015 to June 15， 2016. This patient did not receive subsequent radiation therapy or hormonal therapy for unknown reasons. And， she had the tumor recurrence on the chest wall and thus was admitted to breast surgery on September 22， 2017.

She had no distant metastasis at that time and received intensity modulated radiation therapy， with the prescribed dosage of 60 Gy/30F for P-GTV and 50 Gy/25F for PTV. The targeted sites included the chest wall and supra/infra-clavicular nodal region. However， the patient refused to undergo subsequent chemotherapy and came back on February 26， 2018 because of an enlarged lymph node in her right upper neck with a diameter of 2 cm. Further examination identified the swollen lymph node as a tumor metastasis from contralateral breast origin . Therefore， 4 cycles of TP regimen and subsequent radiation therapy were given to target this isolated metastasis. In accordance with standard protocol， the patient is currently undergoing hormonal therapy (Letrozole plus Goserlin).\n\n【5】Confucius once said， “Things in the past are beyond redemption， but we can consummate what is in the future\".

A potentially blinding necrotizing retinitis can occur， with progressive deterioration of CD4+ T counts below 250 cells/cumm. This case highlights its unusual presentation in an HIV patient with normal CD4+ T counts. A 42-year-old gentleman presented with a week history of left eye diminution of vision. Clinical examination of the right eye was unremarkable while left eye showed anterior chamber and vitreous cells with a yellowish foveal lesion suspicious of toxoplasmic retinitis. He was seropositive for HIV， on therapy for ten years， with CD4+ T count 777 cells/cumm. Laboratory tests confirmed toxoplasmosis. He was started on oral anti-toxoplasma medication with tapering doses of oral and topical steroids. On subsequent follow-up， the patient had good visual and clinical improvement.\n\n【2】Keywords： Toxoplasmic retinitis； Human Immunodeficiency Virus； CD4+T count\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Toxoplasmosis is a zoonotic infection caused by the protozoal organism Toxoplasma gondii， an obligatory parasite of the cat. In an immunocompetent host， it is generally a benign self-limited infection； nevertheless， severe complications such as retinochoroidal involvement，have been known to occur. Ocular and Central nervous system toxoplasmosis is almost always seen in patients who are severely immunocompromised.\n\n【5】This case highlights the possibility of ocular toxoplasmosis in HIV positive individuals at normal CD4+T counts.\n\n【6】Case Presentation\n\n【7】A 42-year-old gentleman presented with a history of diminution of vision of the left eye for a week. The Best-Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA)， recorded on Snellen's chart， was 6/6， N6 in the right eye and 6/36， N24 in the left eye. Clinically， the anterior segment examination of the right eye was normal， and the left eye showed anterior chamber cells of grade 1 (Standardized Uveitis Nomenclature grading： SUN). Posterior segment examination of the right eye was unremarkable， while the left eye revealed vitreous cells of grade 1+ (National eye institute system grading) with a dense yellowish lesion suggestive of retinitis， involving inferior half of fovea， suspicious of ocular toxoplasmosis . Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) of the left eye showed few hyper-reflective dots in the vitreous and loss of foveal contour with hyper-reflective full-thickness foveal lesion . The patient was seropositive for HlV and on HAART medication for ten years with his recent (1 month since the time of presentation) CD4+ T count being 777 cells/cumm. Investigations revealed positive Toxoplasma gondii serology (IgG-453 IU/ml/IgM-9.4IU/ml)， positive Mantoux with induration of 23 mm. Systemic examination was normal. He was started on treatment with Tab. Septra DS (Trimethoprim 160 mg-sulfamethoxazole 800 mg) twice daily， along with Tab. Azithromycin 500 mg twice daily on day 1， followed by 500 mg once daily and topical prednisolone four times daily. On the follow-up visit after 3 days， consolidation of the lesion was noted，and oral wysolone 1 mg/kg body weight was added to the ongoing treatment. The consulting pulmonologist advised an additional INH prophylaxis. On the subsequent follow-ups， one week and one month later， the BCVA of left eye improved to 6/24， N8 and 6/9， N6 respectively. The posterior segment examination and OCT also showed a gross reduction in the size of the lesion in 2visits (Figures 2A，2B and 3A，3B]. During the course of disease he was treated with anti-toxoplasma medication for 8 weeks and a tapering dose of oral wysolone， 10 mg weekly taper for 7 weeks. Two months later， on completion of the course of treatment， BCVA of left eye had improved to 6/\n\n【8】N6 and the inflammation had subsided completely，leaving behind an atrophic scar without pigmentation inferior to the fovea . OCT showed improvement of foveal contour .\n\n【9】Discussion\n\n【10】Approximately 70% to 80% of HIV-infected patients are going to be treated for associated eye disorder throughout the course of their disease. In general， the CD4+ T-lymphocyte count has been accustomed to predict the onset ofbound ocular infections in patients who are seropositive. Patients with HIV infection are particularly susceptible to acute and reactive infections with Toxoplasma gondii， particularly when CD4+ T counts fall below 250 cells/cumm.\n\n【11】HIV patients with ocular toxoplasmosis must undergo a neurological evaluation； including imaging and lumbar puncture due to 30% to 50% of these patients have intracranial involvement. Toxoplasmic retinochoroiditis presents as areas of necrotizing retinitis， vitreous， and inflammation of the anterior segment， giving a classical picture of headlight in the fog’ which usually resolves spontaneously， but often leaves pigmented chorioretinal scars . The choroid and sclera may become involved secondarily . In our case， however， the posterior segment manifestation in the left eye was in the form retinitis alone without the involvement of choroid. Following treatment， the lesion resolved to leave behind an atrophic scar without pigmentation.\n\n【12】Ocular toxoplasmosis in immunocompromised individuals frequently demonstrates a relatively fulminant course . Potential presentations include multifocal disease in one eye， bilaterally active inflammation and/or extensive areas of necrotizing retinitis. Diagnostic confusion with viral retinitis may necessitate intraocular fluid analysis .\n\n【13】When the lesion is characteristic， the demonstration of IgG and IgM serum antibody gives a presumptive diagnosis and allows initiation of a specific therapy. In doubtful cases， it is possible to detect the parasite DNA by vitreous biopsy and PCR for Toxoplasma gondii .\n\n【14】Classical Triple regimen of anti-toxoplasma medications are given along with oral steroids to control inflammation. Steroids should be tapered and withdrawn a week prior to the completion of anti-toxoplasma medication. Intravitreal management option appears to be an effective treatment for immunocompetent patients， whereas systemic therapy is suggested in immunocompromised patients to prevent toxoplasmosis-related complications in the fellow eye or elsewhere in the CNS . Prophylaxis with anti-toxic medications is effective against disseminated toxoplasmosis in immunocompromised patients when CD4+ T count less than 100lymphocytes per cumm . In our case， the eye was quite with normal CD4+ T count in the successive follow-ups without prophylactic treatment.\n\n【15】Toxoplasmic retinochoroiditis need not necessarily manifest only in HIV positive individuals with low CD4+ T counts. It can occur at normal CD4+ T counts as well. However， the severity of inflammation， systemic involvement， and need of prolonged anti-toxo therapy in the latter condition is less when compared to the former.

According to the actual guidelines， screening tests are only offered until the age of 65. Afterwards， women are considered safe and thus no further follow up is proposed.\n\n【3】Recently， Dilley et al. showed that more than 20% of women diagnosed with cervical cancer are age 65 or older . They doubted the current guidelines and thought it's time to re-evaluate cervical cancer screening after age 65”. This reminds us of the situation in Lebanon.\n\n【4】We believe that we are losing the fight against cervical cancer in this country. In the World Cancer Day 2020， Dr E Dean stated that the goal is to have less than 4 new cases of cervical cancers per 100，000 women per year. In 2018， cancer of the cervix affected 4.1 per 100，000 women in western Asia   including Lebanon， thus the incidence in our country seems ideal.\n\n【5】However， in 2008 the lowest Age Standardized Incidence Rate (ASIR) values of cervical cancer were found in western and south-central Asia， with Lebanon having only 3.8 cases per 100，000women per year  . Ten years later， the ASIR increased to 5.7 per 100，000   and Lebanon became the country with the third highest incidence of cervical cancer in the Middle East  . In fact， according to the Lebanese ministry of public health cervical cancer cases are increasing， with 192 new cases in 2018 compared to less than 100 in2005 .\n\n【6】In western Asia， the highest incidence of cervical cancer is found in women aged 45 to 49 years， whereas in Lebanon the most affected age group is women above 75 years old  . Furthermore， when comparing new cases in Lebanon vs. Western Asia countries according to each age group， we found a ratio of 3.2% vs. 8.36% in the young (45 to 49 years) and older group (above 75 years old) respectively  . Thus， cervical cancer in Lebanon is more frequent in women after 75 years compared to our neighbors. This may be caused by an inadequate previous screening in these women. A studypublished in 2017 showed that our national prevalence of Pap smear screening is only 35%.\n\n【7】Moreover， death rates are higher in Lebanon. As mentioned above， 192 new cancer cases were registered in Lebanon in 2018along with 125 deaths， compared to 5，092 in western Asia and deaths . In our practice， patients are treated according to the international guidelines， thus the higher mortality rates seen in our country are probably related to patients presenting with more advanced disease and consequently less chance of survival. Likewise， the crude incidence rate， crude mortality rate， ASIR and cumulative risk at 75 years are higher in Lebanon compared to the other western Asia countries (6.3 vs. 3.9， 4.1 vs. 2.3， 5.7 vs. 4.1 and 0.6 vs. 0.4， respectively).\n\n【8】Cervical cancer is preventable through HPV vaccination， a vaccine that is not vet included in the Lebanese vaccination schedule. A cross-sectional study in 2018 showed that Lebanese physicians and mostly gynecologists do not follow the international vaccination recommendations ， thus many women remain unprotected.\n\n【9】Table 1： Cervical cancer incidence in Lebanon and Western Asia in 2018.\n\n| Indicator  | Lebanon  | Western Asia  | World  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Annual Number of New Cases  | 192  | 5092  | 569847  |\n| Death  | 125  | 2995  | 311365  |\n| Crude Incidence Rate  | 6.3  | 3.9  | 15.1  |\n| Crude Mortality Rate  | 4.1  | 2.3  | 8.2  |\n| Age-Standardized Rate  | 5.7  | 4.1  | 13.1  |\n| Age-Standardized Mortality Rate  | 3.6  | 2.5  | 6.9  |\n| Cumulative Risk (%) at 75 years  | 0.6  | 0.4  | 1.4  |\n| Cumulative Risk (%) at 75 years  | 0，4  | 0.3  | 0.8  |\n\n【11】Owing to the lack of awareness and appropriate screening， we are losing the battle against cervical cancer in Lebanon.

Incidence and epidemiological data on BT are still largely unknown， and the causes are multifactorial. Early detection and timely intervention are crucial in determining the outcome of the disease. In this report， we present a case of an Asian man with mild congestive heart failure， who was diagnosed with painless myocardial infarction and BT， and eventually achieved successful thrombosis resolution.\n\n【9】Case Presentation\n\n【10】Patient information\n\n【11】A 50-year-old Asian man， transferred from a community hospital， presented with slight shortness of breath upon waking from sleep， edema in his feet for three days， and a cough without production for the past month. He had a history of well-controlled hypertension for five years.

However， laboratory workup showed diabetes with a high fasting blood glucose level of 9.3 mmol/L， mild congestive heart failure with an NT-pro Brain Natriuretic Peptide (NT-pro BNP) level of 5176 pg/ml，Cardiac Troponin I (CTNI) <0.05 ng/ml. Electrocardiogram revealed sinus tachycardia， complete right bundle branch block， and an old anterior myocardial infarction. A chest computed tomographic scan showed mild pulmonary congestion and small bilateral pleural effusion.\n\n【16】Transthoracic Echocardiography (TTE) revealed a large left atrium and ventricle， hypokinesis of the left ventricle's apical and mid segments， and a large mural thrombus (2.64 cm x1.27 cm) at the apex of the left ventricle (Supplementary Video 1). The patient also had systolic dysfunction， with an estimated Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) of 38.9%.Additionally， anotherlarge mural thrombus (3.17 cm x2.04 cm) was found in the right ventricular apex ， with moderate tricuspid regurgitation and a maximum systolic pulmonary arterial pressure of41 mmHg， and minimal pericardial effusion.\n\n【17】Therapeutic interventions\n\n【18】Immediate subcutaneous enoxaparin was bridged with 1 mg/kg two times per day， followed by oral administration of warfarin reach.\n\n【19】Table 1： Summary of case report characteristics of myocardial infarction combined with biventricular thrombosis f：0 for No。1 for Yes。/ for Absence).\n\n| Myocardial Infarction Sites  | LVEF(%)  | PE/SE  | Mobile Thrombosis  | Thrombosis Remain  | Death  | References  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Anterior Infarction  | 37%  | 0/0  | 1#  | 1  | 0  | Friedman   |\n| Old Anterior and Inferior Infarction  |  | 0/0  | 1  | 1  | 1  | Paul   |\n| Pasteroinferior and Lateral Infarction  | 35%  | 0/1  | 0  | 1  | 0  | Espinola-Zavaleta   |\n| Apical Infarction  |  | 1/1  | 0  | 0  | 0  | Keeble   |\n| Old Anteroseptal Infarction  | 10%  | 1/0  | 0  | 1  | 1  | lda   |\n| Acute Right Ventricular and Inferior Infarction  | 20%  | 0/0  | 0  | 0  | /  | Kaya   |\n| Old Anteroseptal Infarction  | <20%  | 1/0  | 0  | 0  | /  | Mujer   |\n| Anterolateral Infarction  | 17%  | 1/0  | 1  | 1  | 1  | Soltani   |\n\n【21】LVEF： Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction， PE： Pulmonary Embolization， SE： Systemic Embolization\n\n【22】Supplementary Video 1： Biventricular thrombosis in left and right ventricular apex.\n\n【23】Supplementary Video 2： Thrombasis in the right ventricular apex.\n\n【24】potassium. However， seven days later， the INR ranged between1.2 and 1.6， and the patient suddenly developed hemoptysis， chest tightness， and hypoxemia while standing to urinate， with a blood pressure of 127/84 mmHg， pulse of 112 beats/min， and Spo2 of 92%. No significant changes were noted on the electrocardiogram， and TTE showed no signs of right ventricular pressure overload. Despite high suspicion of pulmonary embolism， computed tomography pulmonary angiography was not performed due to the patient’s refusal. On the second day， increased CTNI levels of 0.576 ng/ml were detected (normal range： 0-0.034 ng/ml) . The patient no longer had symptoms of hemoptysis， and the warfarin continued to be adjusted to make the International Normalized Ratio (INR)\n\n【25】Follow-up and outcomes\n\n【26】Subsequently， the patient was transported to the catheterization laboratory. Coronary angiography demonstrated 100% occlusive thrombosis in the proximal Left Anterior Descending artery (LAD)，adrug-elutingstentwasimplanted.Serialechocardiographic assessments were performed， and the thrombi gradually decreased in size at five days after adequate anticoagulation and disappeared at 12days after INR reach 2-3 .\n\n【27】Discussion\n\n【28】Biventricular Thrombosis (BT) is a rare but extremely dangerous disease whose epidemiological， etiological and clinical features have not been thoroughly studied. Despite the high prevalence of myocardial infarction， our literature analysis revealed that only 7 case reports of BT associated with MI were available in full.\n\n【29】Epidemiology\n\n【30】Since the number of BT cases due to MI is extremely rare， we refer to published knowledge on the epidemiology of left ventricular thrombus in myocardial infarction. The incidence of Left Ventricular (LV) thrombus was 6.3% to 15% in patients with ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI)， and 19.2% in those with anterior STEMI and LVEF less than 50%， after the widespread use of Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) . This indicates that BT maybe more common in patients with anterior STEMI and lower LVEF after PCI， just as what we found in our case. Considering the high prevalence of MI， it is possible that the incidence of BT is underestimated. Among seven reported cases associated with BT，3cases were old myocardial infarction and 5 cases of acute MI， and the features of them were list .\n\n【31】Pathophysiology\n\n【32】Thrombus formationinvolyesLthe threecomponentsCof Virchow's triad， which include blood stasis， endothelial injury， and hypercoagulability. Myocardial infarction has acute endothelial exposure with associated loss of myocardial contractility， and particularly anterior myocardial infarction with low LVEF， often involves the apex and can lead to blood stasis and endothelial injury . Blood stasis can be triggered by myocardial akinesis or dyskinesis， while endothelial injury can cause inflammation and hypercoagulability by exposing subendothelial tissue and collagen to the circulating blood， leading to the formation of thrombus. A 32-year-old male was reported to have an acute myocardial infarction combined with thrombosis that occurred after cocaine ingestion . The mechanisms of cocaine-induced myocardial infarction include coronary artery spasm and unstable plaques . Myocardialinfarction occurs when fragile， but not necessarily narrow atherosclerotic plaques are disrupted under hemodynamic stress . In our cases， as seen in the literature， anterior myocardial infarction with low LVEF supported the formation of BT.\n\n【33】Acquired and hereditary risk factorsSoften trigger hypercoagulability， accelerating thrombosis and embolism， such as Factor V Leiden mutation， antiphospholipid antibody syndrome， heparin-induced thrombocytopenia， anddanticoagulant protein deficiency. There has been one reported case of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) complicating anterior wall MI leading to BT formation， where COVID-19-induced hypercoagulability has been widely discussed . Our patient had no history of long-term medication use and showed no evidence of hereditary hypercoagulability，suggesting that decreasedventricular wall contraction caused by myocardial infarction was the key factor in thrombus formation.\n\n【34】Diagnosis\n\n【35】Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) is considered the gold standard for diagnosing intracardiac thrombi， but it's not commonly used in clinical practice. Instead， BT is usually found incidentally during routine TTE. Out of the seven cases reported，only one was diagnosed with BT through CMI ， while the others were diagnosed through TTE. This patient underwent a comprehensive evaluation at a community hospital， but incomplete testing may have led to missed diagnoses. During the further TTE exam， low echogenicity intracardiac masses were observed， along with a decreased Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) and weakened ventricular wall contraction. This finding is consistent with the five other cases reported where Myocardial Infarction (MI) was associated with BT. All of these patients had a significant drop in LVEF， with four of them having an LVEF below 30% (excluding the three cases where LVEF was not mentioned) . This supports the idea that decreased ventricular wall contraction resulting from MI is one of the key factors in BT formation， caused by slow blood flow and stasis.\n\n【36】Anterior STEMI， proximal LAD infarction， and LVEF below 30%are strong predictors of LV thrombus. However，thrombus formation can also occur in patients with an LVEF greater than 30% or in those with diabetes， which is a major cause of asymptomatic myocardial infarction. Therefore， health education should remind patients to watch their juice intake， as consuming more than 100% of daily recommended fruit juice intake can increase the risk of developing diabetes .\n\n【37】Therapy\n\n【38】Anticoagulant therapy remains the cornerstone of treatment for thrombotic diseases. According to the 2021 American Heart Association/AmericanStrokeAssociation stroke prevention guidelines， in patients with stroke or transient ischemic attack and LV thrombus， systemic antagonists， such as vitamin K antagonists， are recommended for treating left ventricular thrombus after MI for three months (Class I)， with a target INR value of 2 to 2.5 . In our case treatment， we used bridging low-molecular- weight heparin anticoagulation with warfarin， and achieved good results. Currently， new oral anticoagulant drugs are started to be use in the treatment of left ventricular thrombus ， and their efficacy in BT may need to be verified in left ventricular thrombus before they can be widely promoted.\n\n【39】Prognosis\n\n【40】The characteristics of thrombus mobility， including thrombus mobility and protrusion， have been used to identify patients at high risk of embolism. Among seven patients with myocardial infarction， three described thrombus mobility， and there were seven cases of pulmonary or systemic embolism， with four cases of residual thrombus and three deaths after the follow-up period ended . We reported that the patient's thrombus was resolved after 12 days of full anticoagulation with warfarin， with no evidence of embolism and a good prognosis.\n\n【41】Conclusion\n\n【42】Currently， the risk of BT in patients with myocardial infarction may be underestimated，especially in those with painless myocardial infarction. Clinicians should focus on high-risk populations， such as anterior wall myocardial infarction combined with low LVEF.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 11:44:56", "endTime": "2024/09/24 11:45:16", "cost": 19.009}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:31", "update_time": "2024-09-23 19:45:16", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 19:44:56"}

The common genetic factor that is associated with T2D is single nucleotide polymorphism. The aim of the present study was to assess the association between rs5219 of the KCNJ11 gene and rs11196205of the TCF7L2 gene with diabetes type 2. Total of 300 samples (150 T2DM patients and 150 non-diabetic controls) together with demographic factors were taken from public and private hospitals of the Southern Punjab. This was a case-control study and contained 150 T2D patients and 150controlled samples. To analyze the polymorphisms in KCNJ11 and TCF7L2， PCR-RFLP and Tetra-arm PCR were used. The findings of this study were that in KCNJ11 gene， homozygous AA genotype was predominant (83.33%) than the GG genotype (14%) and heterozygous genotype GA was present in very a small amount (2.66%) while in case of TCF7L2 gene， CC 28.00%， GG 27.33%and GC 44.67%.

The conclusion of this study is that rs5219 of the KCNJ11 gene and rs11196205 of TCF7L2 gene are not associated with diabetes type 2 in the Southern Punjab population.\n\n【2】Keywords： KCNJ11； TCF7L2； PCR-RFLP； Tetra-arm PCR； Insignificant\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus is a chronic multifactorial disorder described by high blood glucose level (hyperglycemia)， which is due to the resistance of insulin or lower insulin secretion . Both genetic and environmental factors play a significant role in the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Environmental factors are age， obesity， lack of physical activity， hypertension， diet， and smoking . International Diabetes Federation reported that in 2017， the number of patients with diabetes was 425 million and this ratio will increase to 629 million in 2045 . Pakistan is South Asia Country and diabetes and obesity is more common in South Asia. 12，000 deaths are noted every year in Pakistan due to diabetes. Different studies revealed that people in urban areas are more affected by this disease due to lack of physical activity， hypertension， and intake ofhigh-calorie food . For diabetes， Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) identified different susceptibility genes. Genetic factor is more involved in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus because of Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) . Different studies found many genes that are associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Among these genes， the potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily J member 11 (KCNJ11) gene and TCF7L2 gene are the main candidate genes for the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus. KCNJ11 gene is situated on the human chromosome at 11p15.1 and consists of one exon with no intronic sequences . Inward rectifier potassium ion channel (Kir6.2) protein is encoded by this gene. KCNJ11 gene plays a significant role in the secretion of insulin. Kir6.2 protein with Sulfonylurea Receptor 1 (SUR1)， forms K， channel . In the K channel， when these two proteins are combined then it mediates the secretion of insulin . When the level of glucose increases then it results in the closing ofthe K， channel and activation of voltage-gated calcium channels. The Channel of K allows the potassium ions entry. The Intracellular level of calcium ion increases when the cell membrane becomes depolarized due to the increased amount of potassium ions and result in insulin secretion . Insulin production and its secretion are controlled through glucose metabolism by the K， channel. Many KCNJ11 gene SNPs have been identified and among these SNPs， rs5219 has been gaining more consideration for its association with type2 diabetes mellitus . KCNJ11 gene polymorphism rs5219 is caused when at codon 23， glutamic acid is substituted into lysine amino acid . In this variation， guanine is changed into adenine. The Sensitivity of the potassium channel is reduced due to this variation and this substitution caused insulin resistance and leads to diabetes mellitus .\n\n【5】The genes which are elaborate in the cell multiplication and distinctness are regulated by the Transcription Factor 7-like 2 genes(TCF7L2) . This gene contains the High Mobility Group (HMG) box and also elaborates in the Wnt signaling channel that plays the principal role in galactose stability and this gene is the master regulator of the proinsulin a nuclear receptor for B-catenin is encoded by this gene that involved in lipid metabolism. Variants of TCF7L2gene increased the risk of T2DM with an impaired insulin secretion showed a strong association . Wnt wave channel is essential during normal functioning and this function is done by the same receptors in which Frizzled (Fz) and LDL receptor-related proteins are included . B-catenin is also important for the activation of many genes when it binds to the TCF receptor. In which Glucagon-Like-Peptide-1(GLP-1) is also included in this way the beta-catenin level is increased and also increased the growth of beta cells. When the mutation in the TCF7L2 gene impaired the secretion glucagon-like peptide-1 due to which production of insulin is low and beta-catenin level also reduced， also disturb the beta-cell proliferation .\n\n【6】Objectives of this study was to determine the SNP association with body mass index， fasting blood glucose， random blood glucose in controlled and cases subiects. The aim of this study was to determine the correlation between rs5219 of KCNJ11 gene and rs11196205 of TCF7L2 with type 2 diabetes mellitus in the population of Southern Punjab， if any.\n\n【7】Materialand Method\n\n【8】Study participants\n\n【9】A total of 300 were selected for the analysis including 150 cases and 150 controlled subjects from government and private hospitals of the Southern Punjab.\n\n【10】Data collection\n\n【11】To study the epidemiological factors such as age， gender， body mass index， smoking， and personal medical history， questionnaire was conducted for this purpose.\n\n【12】Anthropometric and biochemical evaluation\n\n【13】By using a standard protocol， anthropometric measurements such as height， weight， and waist were acquired. The calculation of BMI was done by dividing the body weight in kilograms by square of height in meters. A routine investigation of patients such as fasting and random blood glucose level， HbA1c was measured.\n\n【14】DNA extraction\n\n【15】In EDTA tubes， Sample of blood (3ml to 5 ml) from each participant was preserved and kept at -4℃ for storage. Inorganic DNA extraction method was used for DNA extraction and DNA was collected from the collected samples of blood and stored at-20C.\n\n【16】Genotyping KCNJ11 E23K Variant\n\n【17】For amplification of KCNJ11E23K polymorphic region，\n\n【18】PCR-RFLP method was used for this purpose， Oligonucleotide primersSsequences55GACTCTGCAGTGAGGCCCTA 3 and5'ACGTTGCAGTTGCCTTTCTT 3were used.

The amplification started with a preliminary denaturing step at 94C for 5 min along with 28 cycles of 94°C for 30 s， annealing at 59°C for30 s， and ultimate extension at 72°C for 30 s with a final elongation step at 72°C for 5 min. 209 bp PCR product was analyzed on 1.8%agarose gel electrophoresis. PCR product was restricted by Ban II enzyme. Restriction was carried out in volume of 20 u1. 8 ul PCR product，1 ul Ban II enzyme， 5 ul tango buffer and 6 ul distilled water. Keep it at 37 for °C sixteen hours. By electrophoresis on 3% agarose gel， restriction products were separated and presence of bands was shown under the fluorescence of UV light. 100 bp ladder was used to know the exact position of particular band size which differentiated the genotypes of KCNJ11 i.e.， for 150， 59 bp (GG)， 150， 59， 209 bp(GA) and 209 bp (AA).\n\n【19】Genotyping of TCF7L2 rs11196205 variants\n\n【20】The genotyping of rs11196205 (C/G) was done by the Tetra-ARMS-PCR(Tetra Primer Amplification Polymerase Chain Reactions) for the detection of single nucleotide polymorphism in TCF7L2 gene.

The significance level was considered at P<0.05. The correlation between DM and all demographical variables was studied by using binary logistic regression followed by logistic regression analysis which was carried out to find the association between DM and selected biochemical factors. A Chi-square test was performed for determining the risk factors frequency between control and diabetic patients. Also， the frequency of genotypes was determined by direct counting whereas，the frequency of alleles was found out with the help of Hardy Weinberg equilibrium calculator and to find the correlation between diabetes and rs5219 (SNP) of the KCNJ11 Chi-square test was applied.\n\n【24】Table 1： Primers and the product size of TCF7L2 genotypes.\n\n| S.NO  | SNP  | Primer Type  | Sequence  | Amplification Size  | Product Size  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1  | rs11196205  | Inner Forward  | CTGAAAGTTCTCAACATTTATAACTGCC  | 434bp  | C：253bpG：235bp  |\n| 1  | rs11196205  | Inner Reverse  | CAACCATAACTCTCTTACATACTGGTC  | 434bp  | C：253bpG：235bp  |\n| 1  | rs11196205  | Outer Fonward  | TAGATTGTCTCCTTTTGTTTCTGCTAC  | 434bp  | C：253bpG：235bp  |\n| 1  | rs11196205  | Outer Reverse  | TAAACATCTGACCTTGAAGCCTACC  | 434bp  | C：253bpG：235bp  |\n\n【26】Results\n\n【27】Genotyping of KCNJ11(rs5219)\n\n【28】KCNJ11 PCR amplification was carried out and produced a band size of 209 bp as shown in Figure 1.\n\n【29】The 209 bp band was digested with ban 2 enzyme and gave different genotypes pattern such as GG： 59 bp and 150 bp， AA： 209bp， GA： 59 bp， 150 bp and 209 bp .\n\n【30】Tetra-ARM-PCR for TCF7L2 analysis\n\n【31】The Tetra-ARM-PCR forTCF7L2 (rs11196205 C/G) that give the amplification of following products size in which 434 bp band as a control， 253 bp C wild type allele and 235 for the G mutant allele.\n\n【32】Association of various demographic and biochemical factors with diabetes\n\n【33】Through binarylogistic regression， different demographic factors were contrasted between cases who were suffering from diabetes and healthy individual. It was noted that family history that has p-value=0.000 and Planned diet that has p-value=0.001 were more significant between patients and control while smoking showed the significant relation between normal healthy individual and patients and has a p-value 0.005. The statistical relation was insignificant between control and patients about age， exercise， treatment regularity，gender， and marital status because they have a p-value greater than 0.05.\n\n【34】Through logistic regression testing，variousSbiochemical parameters were contrasted between T2D patients and healthy individuals. It was noted that all biochemical parameters were not associated with the incidence of developing T2D because all biochemical parameters have a p-value greater than 0.05 that denotes a non-significant association.\n\n【35】Through1binary logistic regression testing，different anthropometric measurements were contrasted between T2D patients and Normal people. It was noted that the waist and body mass index were highly significant linked with diabetes because both variables have a p-value greater 0.000 while weight was significantly associated with diabetes. The height is a non-significant parameter that was not associated with diabetes.\n\n【36】Association of rs5219 KCNJ11genotypes with the demographic， biochemical and anthropometric parameters associated with T2DM\n\n【37】Through the chi-square test， when different genotypes of the KCNJ11 gene were compared with various demographic， biochemical and anthropometric parameters then it was noted that all demographic and biochemical factors showed no association between the polymorphism of KCNJ11 and diabetes while BM1is a highly significant parameter and was associated with KCNJ11polymorphism while weight， height， and waist， were non-significant factors that were not linked with genotypes of KCNJ11.\n\n【38】Association of rs11196205 TCF7L2 genotypes with the demographic， clinical and biochemical parameters associated with T2D\n\n【39】From the test of chi-square when the different genotypes were contrasting with these risk factors that linked with DM. it was seen that age， genus， smoking， inheritance detail， exercise， planned diet， and marital information was the non-significant factors and are not linked with the one or more genotype . From the test of chi-square when the different genotypes were contrasting with these clinical factors linked with DM. it was seen that BMI， waist， fasting glycogen level， diastolic plasma pressures， systolic plasma pressures， HbAlc and， random plasma glycogen level was the non-significant factors and are not linked with the one or more genotypes.\n\n【40】Association of genotypic and allelic frequency of rs5219in KCNJ11 and rs11196205 in TCF7L2 with T2DM\n\n【41】The KCNJ11 genotype ofpatients and control showed insignificant results as the p-value is 0.415. The allelic frequency of A was 0.886in control and 0.846 in patients. Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was used to determine the allelic frequency in controland cases. In TCFL2gene， the p-value was the 0.62 that showed the non-significant linkage with the DM. The outcomes of genotypic distribution of the KCNJ11 (ns) = non-significant when P value is >0.05 gene and TCF7L2 gene polymorphism and allelic frequency in control and T2D patients were discussed in Table 5 .\n\n| Table 2： Association of demographic and biochemical parameters with type 2 diabetes.  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Demographic Parameters  | Category  | Cases  | Control  | Odd Ratio (95%CI}  | P-value  |\n| Age  | 31-40  | 23  | 30  | 1.2779 (0.7497)  | 0.123 |\n| Age  | 41-50  | 47  | 50  |  |  |\n| Age  | 1-60  | 43  | 35  |  |  |\n| Age  | 61-70  | 35  | 34  |  |  |\n| Age  | Above 70  | 2  | 1  |  |  |\n| Gender  | Male=1  | 71  | 83  | 0.6907 (0.4676)  | 0.334m  |\n| Gender  | Female=0  | 79  | 6  |  |  |\n| Smoking  | Single=0  | 34  | 16  | 3.8539(1.9833)  | 0.005  |\n| Smoking  | Marriec=1  | 116  | 134  |  |  |\n| Family History  | Yes=1  | 88  | 16  | 9.6218(4.3981)  | 0.000  |\n| Family History  | No=0  | 62  | 134  |  |  |\n| Exercise  | Yes=1  | 84  | 109  | 0.8963 (0.8561)  | 0.769 |\n| Exercise  | No=0  | 66  | 41  |  |  |\n| Treatment Regularity  | Regular=1  | 117  | 94  | 1.8590 (0.7913)  | 0.084m  |\n| Treatment Regularity  | Irregular=0  | 3  | 56  |  |  |\n| Biochemical Parameters  | Category  | Cases  | Control  | Odd Ratio (95%CI)  | P-value  |\n| Systolic Blood Pressure (mmHg)  | 120<=Normal  | 60  | /5  | 1.0062 (0.0311)  | 0.623m  |\n| Systolic Blood Pressure (mmHg)  | 121>=High  | 90  | 75  |  |  |\n| Systolic Blood Pressure (mmHg)  | 90<=Low  | 0  | 0  |  |  |\n| Diastolic Blood Pressure (mmHg)  | 80<=Normal  | 54  | 62  | 0.9614 (0.9252，0.9991)  | 0.096m  |\n| Diastolic Blood Pressure (mmHg)  | 81>=High  | 88  | 87  |  |  |\n| Diastolic Blood Pressure (mmHg)  | 60<=Low  | 8  | 1  |  |  |\n| BMI (kg/m²)  | 30>=Obese  | 60  | 8  | 4.5155 (2.9855)  | 0.000  |\n| BMI (kg/m²)  | 25-30=Overweight  | 45  | 38  |  |  |\n| BMI (kg/m²)  | 18.5-25=Normal  | 43  | 03  |  |  |\n| BMI (kg/m²)  | 18.5<=Underweight  | 2  | 1  |  |  |\n| FBG (mg/dL)  | 80-100=Normal  |  | 150  | 0.9919 (0.0529)  | 0.791m  |\n| FBG (mg/dL)  | 126 >=Diabetic  | 150  | 0  |  |  |\n| RBG (mg/dL)  | 170-200=Normal  | 0  | 150  | 1.0332 (0.0739)  | 0.074m  |\n| RBG (mg/dL)  | 220 >=Diabetic  | 150  | 0  |  |  |\n| HbA1c  |.6%=Normal  | 0  | 150  | 1.0944 (0.2228)  | 0.877m  |\n| HbA1c  | 5.7>=Diabetes  | 150  | 0  |  |  |\n\n【43】Discussion\n\n【44】T2DM is a Multifactorial disorder that is caused by both genetic and environmental factors whereby heritability level from family studies is predicted as 22% to 73% . Missense mutation may change the ATP binding region charge and reduce the ATP channel sensitivity. The rs5219 polymorphism is because of the conversion of G to A and in many studies； this polymorphism has been shown a positive association with T2D . This variation results in resistance to insulin. However， various studies did not show any association between rs5219 polymorphism and T2D . The results of East Asian population exposed that mutant A allele was more frequent in control as compared to cases . This polymorphism was associated with T2D in Tunisia population although in Ghanaian population， the mutant A allele was 99.9% predominant so this rs5219 variant did not exhibit any association with T2D . In this current study， there was majority of AA genotype and mutant allele A in both non-diabetic and diabetic patients thus，rs5219 (E23K)polymorphism was insignificantly associated with T2D. The difference between KCNJ11genotypes in two groups was found statistically insignificant as p value is 0.415. Our results of KCNJ11 gene were similar with other studies such as Iranian， Ghanian and Nigerian population which confirmed the non-significant association of KCNJ11 polymorphism with T2DM. On the other hand， these findings were found to be inconsistent with many studies like Korean and Mexican population. This difference may be due to the diversity of ethnicity， sample size and geographicallocation.\n\n【45】Based on the results ofthis study， the high significance of BMI was shown with the polymorphism of the KCNJ11 gene which conforms with the findings of the Euro-Brazilian population .

In many populations， it has been reported that E23K polymorphism of KCNJ11 is associated with blood pressure which is contraryto this study. According to our results，SBP and DBP are not associated with diabetes that is supported by findings of the Chinese population . Our study investigated the insignificant association of KCNJ11 with gender and age which is consistent with the findings of the Syria population . But KCNJ1Iwas significantly associated with age and gender in the population of Euro-Brazilian which is contrary to our findings . Age and gender are non-significantly associated with diabetes which following the findings of research conducted on the Iranian population .\n\n【49】The genes that are involved in the beta cell production is also known as the transcription factor 7 -like 2 gene . This gene carries the High Mobility Group (HMG) box and also involved in the Wnt the signaling route that plays the capital role in glucose maintenances and that gene is the prime manager of the proinsulin . A nuclear chemoreceptor for B-catenin is concealing from this gene that involved in lipid metabolism . Variation in TCF7L2 gene becomes greater the probability of Type 2 diabetes with a reduced insulin excretion showed a powerful association . From the old studies， also find out that within the intronic site of Transcription factor 7 like 2 nearby some SNPs which manifest a vigorous relationship with Type 2Diabetes .Our present study on Single nucleotide polymorphism(rs11196205) in TCF7L2 is not associated with the T2DM in Southern (ns)= non-significant when P value is >0.05\n\n| Table 4： Association of TCF7L2(rs11196205) genotypes with type 2 diabetes mellitus.  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Demographic Parameters  | Category  | CC  | GG  | GC  | P-value  |\n| Age  | 31-40  | 5  | 10  | 8  | 0.5530  |\n| Age  | 41-50  | 11  | 13  | 23  |  |\n| Age  | 1-60  | 15  | 15  | 13  |  |\n| Age  | 61-70  | 8  | 10  | 17  |  |\n| Age  | Above 70  | 1  | 0  | 1  |  |\n| Gender  | Male=1  | 20  | 26  | 25  | 0.327ms  |\n| Gender  | Female=0  | 20  | 22  | 37  |  |\n| Smoking  | Single=0  | 7  | 13  | 13  | 0.5480  |\n| Smoking  | Marriec=1  | 33  | 35  | 49  |  |\n| Family History  | Yes=1  | 22  | 27  | 39  | 0.672ns  |\n| Family History  | No=0  | 18  | 21  | 23  |  |\n| Exercise  | Yes=1  | 21  | 28  | 35  | 0.856ms  |\n| Exercise  | No=0  | 19  | 20  | 27  |  |\n| Treatment Regularity  | Regular=1  | 28  | 38  | 51  | 0.3350s  |\n| Treatment Regularity  | Irregular=0  | 12  | 10  | 11  |  |\n| Biochemical Parameters  | Category  | CC  | GC  | CC  | P-value  |\n| Systolic Blood Pressure (mmHg)  | 120<=Normal  | 16  | 17  | 27  | 0.689ms  |\n| Systolic Blood Pressure (mmHg)  | 121>=High  | 24  | 31  | 35  |  |\n| Systolic Blood Pressure (mmHg)  | 90<=Low  | 0  |  | 0  |  |\n| Diastolic Blood Pressure (mmHg)  | 80<=Normal  | 13  | 2  | 3  | 0.707ns  |\n| Diastolic Blood Pressure (mmHg)  | 81>=High  | 24  | 31  | 26  |  |\n| Diastolic Blood Pressure (mmHg)  | 60<=Low  | 3  | 15  | 33  |  |\n| BMI(kg/m2)  | 30>=Obese  | 0  | 1  | 1  | 0.907ns  |\n| BMI(kg/m2)  | 25-30=Overweight  | 11  | 16  | 16  |  |\n| BMI(kg/m2)  | 18.5-25=Normal  | 12  | 12  | 21  |  |\n| BMI(kg/m2)  | 18.5<=Underweight  | 17  | 19  | 24  |  |\n| FBG (mg/dL)  | 80-100=Normal  | 2  | 0  | 1  | 0.2388m  |\n| FBG (mg/dL)  | 126>=Diabetic  | 38  | 48  | 61  |  |\n| RBG (mg/dL)  | 170-200=Normal  | 3  | 1  | 1  | 0.2280  |\n| RBG (mg/dL)  | 220>=Diabetic  | 37  | 47  | 61  |  |\n| HbA1c  |.6%=Normal  | 0  | 3  | 2  | 0.618ms  |\n| HbA1c  | 5.7>=Diabetes  | 21  | 54  | 60  |  |\n\n【51】Punjab population and according to our awareness is the first analysis within this population.\n\n【52】TCF7L2 (rs11196205) showed the frequency of CC wild allele28%， GG 27.33% mutant homozygous， and GC 44.67% heterozygous in cases samples. While in control samples the frequency of CC wild allele 26.66%， GG mutant 32.00% homozygous and GC41.33% heterozygous. According to our research， the allelic ratio of the genotype TCF7L2 gene is not going to be significant while our results are correspondence by a study that was carried out in the South Western of Iran . Our finding results also interconnected with the Arab population of Khuzestan province which is also not related toT2DM. Meta-analysis was also done on the population of East Asian in which polymorphism of (rs11196205) was examined for five-time in TCF7L2 was strongly linked with T2DM and variation (rs11196205) in TCF7L2 was also linked to the T2DM in the population of China and Japan’s . The Different study determined the strong built linkage of TCF7L2 with T2DM at first was showed in the population of Iceland that has been copied later in Danish and America population. The causes of this unpredictability in results in several studies would be the dissimilar genetic report . Our research work manifests the non-significant relationship of TCF7L2along with fasting and random plasma sugar， Systolic blood pressure and Diastolic blood pressure that was correspondence along to the population of Japanese， Korean and German population.\n\n【53】Previous findings describe that the polymorphism in the TCF7L2gene was linked between males， not to a female. Correspondence to our research work， the ratio of DM in females is (37%) is more as to males (25%) in diabetic individuals. In existing research work， demographic and biochemical variables were also contrast within genotypes of TCF7L2 (rs11196205) and it is noticed that patients of diabetes manifest the no significant relationship with whole genotype.\n\n【54】Table 5： Distribution of genotypic and allelic frequencies of rs5219 in KCN11 and rs11196205 in TCF7L2 gene among cases and controls and their possible association with diabetes mellitus type 2.\n\n| Gene and SNP  | Parameters  | Genotype Percentage  |  |  | Allelic Frequency  |  | P-value  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| KCNJ11(rs5219)  | Genotype  | GG  | GA  | AA  | G  | A  | 0.415°  |\n| KCNJ11(rs5219)  | Controls  | 16(10.66%)  | 2(1.3%)  | 132 (88%)  | 0.1133  | 0.886  |  |\n| KCNJ11(rs5219)  | Patients  | 21(14%)  | 4(2.66%)  | 125 (83.33%)  | 0.1533  | 0.846  |  |\n| TCF7L2(rs11196205)  | Genotype  | CC  | GG  | GC  | C  | G  | 0.62 |\n| TCF7L2(rs11196205)  | Controls  | 40 (26.66%)  | 48 (32.00%)  | 62(41.33%)  | 0.426  | 0.573  |  |\n| TCF7L2(rs11196205)  | Patients  | 42 (28.00%)  | 41(27.33%)  | 67(44.67%)  | 0.416  | 0.583  |  |\n\n【56】Conclusion\n\n【57】The findings of this result study show that the polymorphisms rs5219 of KCNI11 and rs11196205 of TCF7L2 are not associated with diabetes as in case of KCNJ11 gene there was dominance of mutant allele A and genotype AA in non-diabetic and diabetic patients. Allele consisting of lysine in KCNJ11 gene is not responsible for affecting the K， channel activity and thus not related to diabetes. Our research work manifests that transcription factor 7 like 2 rs11196205polymorphisms are not linked along with a risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Effects of this condition on perinatal outcomes were inconclusive across a broad range of studies. We reviewed the literature on isolated oligohydramnios with perinatal outcomes. Electronic databases like PubMed，CINAHL， Web of Science，EMBASE，and Medline were searched from inception to 2022 using keywords and MeSH terms for perinatal outcomes and isolated oligohydramnios. Observational studies (Cohort， case-control) and systematic review & meta-analysis studies published in English were included. Whereas， letters of personal communications， case reports， and case series were excluded. Studies with singleton and low-risk pregnancy， cephalic presentation， and oligohydramnios (amniotic fluid index ≤5 cm) were included. Exclusion criteria were studies that include pregnancies with fetal malformation， chromosomal anomaly； growth restriction， and interventional drugs. We obtained 557 full texts from electronic databases but only35 articles met the inclusion criteria. The narrative review revealed that an association does not exist between isolated oligohydramnios and low Apgar score， non-reassuring fetal heartbeat pattern， fetal distress， and umbilical artery/vein pH less than 7.1/7.2. However， isolated oligohydramnios is significantly associated with higher rates of labor induction and cesarean sections. Nevertheless， the impact of isolated oligohydramnios on meconium-stained amniotic fluid and neonatal intensive care unit were inconclusive across the finding. Further large-scale follow-up studies are needed to better elucidate the available evidence.\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Adequate amniotic fluid volume is a sign of normal placental functioning and it is the most important component of biophysical profile for fetal well-being tests . Amniotic Fluid Index(AFI) is the preferred method of amniotic fluid measurement. To measure AFI， the uterus is divided into four equal quadrants. AFI is the sum of the deepest pocket from each quadrant. The normal range of AFI is 5 cm to 24 cm. Any value greater than 24 cm is considered as polyhydramnios and a value below 5 cm is oligohydramnios . Isolated Oligohydramnios (IO) refers to the presence of oligohydramnios without any fetal and maternal underlying conditions. Globally， IO incidence ranges from 0.5% to 5%.\n\n【4】Oligohydramnios has been associated with a variety of adverse perinatal outcomes prospective study conducted among 180 pregnant women at 37 to 40 weeks of gestation with IO with an AFI ≤5h percentile associated with low Apgar score and cesarean delivery . Likewise， study conducted among 3，050 women showed oligohydramnios carries an increased risk of adverse perinatal outcome， even in low-risk pregnancies after 40 weeks . Moreover， study conducted on oligohydramnios at or beyond 34 weeks gestation was showed antepartum oligohydramnios is associated with increased perinatal morbidity and mortality . A meta-analysis of studies showed an antepartum or intrapartum amniotic fluid index of less than or equal 5.0 cm is significantly increased risk of cesarean delivery for fetal distress and a low Apgar score at 5 min . Similarly， studies revealed， perinatal death， non-reassuring fetal status， meconium-stained fluid， need for resuscitation， admission to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU)， and risk of Operative Vaginal Deliveries (OVD).\n\n【5】However， recent studies showed IO is not associated with fetal growth restriction or an increased risk of adverse perinatal outcomes . Adverse perinatal outcomes were associated with IO due to the higher rates of obstetrical interventions . Additionally， a five retrospective cohort study isolated oligohydramnios showed at term by itself is not associated with increased obstetrical morbidity .\n\n【6】In contemporary obstetrics， termination is a recommended intervention for term pregnancy complicated with oligohydramnios. The time of intervention for IO complicated pregnancy remained controversial. However， clinicians are managing IO as they do for oligohydramnios at term . This approach leads to unnecessary obstetric intervention without a benefit . Besides， some studies suggested that AFI is not a good predictor of perinatal outcome alone in the case of IO . Hence， routine intervention for oligohydramnios at term may not be justified .\n\n【7】Findings about the effect of IO on obstetric and perinatal outcomes are inconclusive. Updated evidence on the effect of this condition on adverse outcomes will help health care providers to improve clinical interventions. This narrative review was designed to compare perinatal outcomes related to IO in low-risk singleton pregnancies and normal amniotic fluid volume.\n\n【8】Literature Search\n\n【9】Studies for this review were obtained from Pub Med， CINAHL， Web of Science， EMBASE， and Medline databases from inception to 2022 published the English language. The following keywords/MeSH terms were used for searching. Amniotic fluid， pregnancy， amniotic fluid index， perinatal outcome， obstetrics outcome， fetal outcome，neonatal outcome， isolated oligohydramnios， induction of labor， cesarean delivery， operative vaginal delivery， mode of delivery， instrumental delivery， Apgar score， non-reassuring fetal status， meconium stained amniotic fluid， meconium aspiration syndrome， perinatal morbidity， perinatal mortality， admission to neonatal intensive care unit， neonatal resuscitation， umbilical artery PH， and fetal weight. The bulian words (AND/OR) were used to combine the aforementioned keywords. Also， the search strategy has been complemented by checking the reference lists of the retrieved articles for additional articles.\n\n【10】Study Selection\n\n【11】We included observational studies (cohort and case-control) and meta-analysis. Inclusion criteria for this review were articles with a singleton pregnancy， cephalic presentation and define Amniotic Fluid Index (AFI) ≤ 5 cm， and outcomes compared with/without a control group (pregnancies with normal amniotic fluid volume). Exclusion criteria were studies that included pregnancies with fetal malformation， chromosomalanomaly or growth restriction and other obstetric complications. In addition， we excluded studies that did not clearly define the timeframe between measurements of the amniotic fluid index. Letters of personal communications， case reports， case series， and non-English language articles were also excluded.\n\n【12】The initial database search returned a total of 557 articles and 8meta-analysis review articles were retained for the narrative review. After the initial electronic database search， 7 additional relevant articles were identified through manual reference and Google searches. Though， this review is synthesized from 35 sources . A summary table is presented with study year， study design， sample size， key points， and limitation for the studies include in the review .\n\n【13】Findings\n\n【14】Isolated oligohydramnios and antepartum feta surveillance\n\n【15】Antepartum fetal surveillance is one of the indicators for fetal well-being in utero. IO was associated with an increased risk of abnormal Doppler indices of the umbilical artery， non-reactive for Cardio Topography (CTG) and a non-stress test . Similarly， a prospective matched case-control study revealed deceleration of fetal heart rate was significantly associated with IO . Furthermore， a review of meta-analysis indicated， when oligohydramnios cases were followed using fetal electronic monitoring during labor abnormal findings were detected. For this reason， obstetric interventions were high .\n\n【16】Isolated oligohydramnios and maternal outcomes\n\n【17】Isolated oligohydramnios and induction of labor： According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG)， diagnosis of oligohydramnios after 37 weeks is an indication for labor induction . Two prospective cohort studies aimed to evaluate perinatal outcomes in women with IO， depicted a risk of induction Wassignificantly highfor isolated1oligohydramnios. Correspondingly， a prospective case-control study over a period of 21 months from November 2014 to July 2016 was conducted on50 pregnant women complicated with complicated with IO. The result showed increased rate of induction of labor among women complicated with IO .\n\n【18】Furthermore， a retrospective cohort study (IO=987 & normal AFI=22，280) to analyzed the obstetric and perinatal outcome on IO showed higher labor induction among pregnancies complicated with IO . Also， IO was associated with significantly higher rates of labor induction as compared to pregnancies of normal amniotic fluid volume for fetal/maternal indications . These findings strengthen by a systemic review and meta-analysis study； in the twelve studies were included with 35，999 women： 2，414(6.7%) with isolated oligohydramnios and 33，585 (93.29%) with normal AFI. Women with isolated oligohydramnios had significantly higher rates of labor induction (OR=7.56， CI： 4.48).\n\n【19】Retrospective matched case-control study (IO=206， normal AFI=206) showed IO has no significant association with failure to the progress of labor or failed induction . A retrospective case-control study conducted on 138 women with uncomplicated oligohydramnios (IO) at term (AFI ≤ 5 cm) and a low Bishop score(≤ 6) compared with 67 women at 42 weeks’ gestation underwent induction oflabor showed insignificant difference between the group in induction progress . Similarly， Rainford and Manzanares et al. were reported there were no differences between the two groups in progress of induction of labor . In contrast to these findings， one study reported significantly higher rates of failed induction among preterm gestations presented with IO . The possible difference might arise from the study included only preterm pregnancy. Moreover， a single study conducted on women with IO required the use of drugs to manage tachysystole/hyperstimulation. Further longitudinal study is needed to accept for the impact. However， study conducted on there was no difference in duration of labor， need for oxytocin， and augmentation between women with IO and normal amniotic fluid index .\n\n【20】Isolated oligohydramnios and mode of delivery： A meta-analysis showed a higher incidence of obstetric interventions in the IO group (89/657；13.5%) compared with the control group(165/3306；5.0%) . Moreover， pregnancies complicated with IO showed a statistically significant association with operative vaginal delivery . However， a small Randomized Controlled Trial(RCT) showed there were no significant difference in assisted vaginal deliveries . The difference might be due to the small sample size in the RCT. Additionally， IO has no significant effect on instrumental delivery for the indication of NRFHBP (Non-Reassuring Fetal Heartbeat Pattern).\n\n【21】Table 1： Summary of studies on adverse abstetric and perinatal outcomes.\n\n| Author and year  | Design and sample size  | Key points  | Limitation  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fatima Chaudhry etal.2020  | Randomized Control Trial O=72 lO (expectant management)=72  | IO is not associated with a low Apgar score or MSAF.  | Used Chai square test and smallsample size.  |\n| Musthaq et al.   | Prospective cohort O=70 Normal AF=140  | IO didn't show any statically significant difference in perinataloutcome.  | Used Chai square test.  |\n| Nefise Nazli et al.   | Prospective case-controlO=159 Normal AF=165  | Io is not associated with a higher rate of cesarean section.  | Used Chai square test and inclusion ofpost-term pregnancy for comparison.  |\n| Samata Gupta et al.2018  | Retrospective case controlO=51 Normal AF=176  | IO is not an indicator of adverse perinatal outcome.  | Used Chai square test (it showedweak association).  |\n| Neeta Sarma   | Prospective case-controlD=100 Normal AF=300  | IO adversely affects the perinatal outcome.

Similarly， a prospective cohort study was carried out in women with isolated oligohydramnios(n=70) and normal pregnancy (n=140))were included. The finding revealed significant number of IO women have undergone emergency caesarian section (X=12.98，p=0.003) . In addition， numerous findings of prospective， retrospective and case control studies depicted women with IO had a higher rate of cesarean delivery compared to women of normal amniotic fluid . These finding supported by pioneer meta-analysis study which includes eighteen reports (10，551 women) showed， women with IO were associated with a significantly increased risk of cesarean delivery . Likewise， the recent meta-analysis which includes six studies (27，526 women)； women with isolated oligohydramnios were significantly higher rates of Cesarean delivery (RR： 2.16；95% CI； 1.85). However， study conducted on 87 women pregnant beyond40 completed weeks showed no significant effect of IO on the risks of CD .Moreover， a prospective matched case-control (matched for gestational age and Bishop-score) study conducted on women with IO 120， and normal AFI=116， women with isolated oligohydramnios were not significantly different to the control group . Similarly， Convey and Ghosh et al. studies showed no difference between the groups in the rate of CD for fetal distress . The difference might be due to the inclusion of high-risk pregnancies in the control group  and inclusion of preeclamptic women in control group and analysis of small sample size (IO=49 Normal AFI=284) .\n\n【26】In addition to meta-analysis discussed above and multiple longitudinal studies indicated， cesarean deliveries specifically for the reason of NRFHRP/fetal distress were significantly lower in women with normal amniotic fluid than IO . A finding from a prospective cohort study conducted in Pakistan revealed that the risk of CD was increased by 3-folds among women with isolated oligohydramnios under the induction of labor . Nevertheless， statistically significant association was not reported in these studies . The difference might be inclusion of high-risk pregnancies， showing weak association and inclusion high blood pressure pregnant women in the studies respectively.\n\n【27】Additionally， a large retrospective cohort study conducted on 987pregnancies complicated by isolated oligohydramnios and to 22，280low-risk pregnancies with normal AFI. The showed intrapartum cesarean delivery due to NRFHRP and dystocia was significantly associated with IO. However， after controlling potential confounders like parity and induction of labor the risk of CD in IO was similar to their counterparts . This finding may be supported by a higher rate of CD in IO which might partially attributable to obstetricians’ practice choices .\n\n【28】A retrospective cohort study exclusively conducted on IO complicated pregnancies showed that rate of CD in early term and late-term pregnancies were high compared to full-term pregnancies. However， there is no significant difference between the early period(37.8%) and the late period (35.3%). Also， there was no significant difference in induction of labor in term pregnancy classifications. Therefore， to conclude the cause for cesarean delivery directly related with IO or other possible risk factors， it needs further RCT studies with controlling potential confounders.\n\n【29】Neonatal and perinatal outcomes\n\n【30】Isolated oligohydramnios and Apgar score： Apgar score can be used for rapid assessment of newborn well-being and it has five components： appearance， pulse rate， respiration， reflex irritability， and muscle tone. First minute Apgar score shows how well the baby tolerated the birthing process and the 5h-minute tells the health care provider how well the baby is doing outside the uterine environment. Although low fifth minute Apgar score is associated with long-term severe neurologic sequels many studies in the literature showed an absence of association between IO and fifth minute Apgar score.\n\n【31】Similarly， a prospective case control study conducted on 80women with isolated oligohydramnios and these were compared with 320 with normal AFI. The finding showed there is no difference between the cases and controls as regards of fifth minute Apgar score. Matched case-control study conducted on IO=120， Normal AFI=116 also revealed the same finding . This evidence supported by with large retrospective cohort (IO=987 Normal AFI=22，280) study conducted by Ashwal et al. In addition， meta-analysis of four articles which includes 3，943 pregnant women (IO=679(17.2%)， Normal AFI=3264(82.8%)has the same result .\n\n【32】Correspondingly， a large retrospective cohort study conducted on after induction of labor women with normal AFI and induced labor because of IO had no significant effect on the first minute Apgar score less than four . Additionally， retrospective matched case-control study conducted on women with IO=206， and Normal AFI=206showed no significant difference in first minute Apgar score between the groups . Those findings is also supported by a comparative study among women with IO and normal amniotic fluid after 41weeks of pregnancy . Similarly， findings from two studies were revealed isolated oligohydramnios is not associated with low first minute Apgar score . Furthermore， a small RCT conducted among actively and expectantly managed women with IO revealed no significant difference on first， fifth-， and tenth-minute Apgar score.\n\n【33】On the contrary， a meta-analysis indicated that IO was associated with low first and fifth minute Apgar scores. However， after they excluded studies with extreme values， IO had evidence of effect only on the first minute Apgar score less than seven . Similar findings were reported from two meta-analyses . A meta-analysis on IO published by Chauhan et al. showed antepartum and intrapartum oligohydramnios were associated with low fifth minute Apgar score， which might be because of the inclusion of high-risk pregnancies in the analysis .\n\n【34】Isolated oligohydramnios and non-reassuring fetal heartbeat pattern/fetal distress & umbilical artery acidosis Case-control and retrospective cohort studies showed Io had an association with NRFHBP . NRFHBP and the first minute Apgar score have poor sensitivity for fetal status and outcome， cord pH is a direct measure of the fetal oxygenation status . Also， many published works including meta-analyses explicitly showed no relationship between IO and NRFHBP， fetal distress and umbilical artery/vein less than 7.1/7.\n\n【35】Isolated oligohydramnios and meconium-stained amniotic fluid： Meconium-stained amniotic fluid during the intrapartum period is an indicator of fetal distress. Most recent studies suggest that an association exists between IO and MSAF. In contrast， other studies concluded IO had no effect on MSAF. However， the association of MSAF and IO was gestational age-dependent . A meta-analysis  showed no difference in the rate of meconium-stained amniotic fluid and IO. However， it increased the risk of meconium aspiration syndrome (RR： 2.83， CI1.70). Conclusive evidence is needed on the association of MSAF with meconium aspiration syndrome and poor neonatal outcomes， and status of meconium (thick or thin). Moreover， the inclusion of different indicators of fetal compromise along with MSAF is important.\n\n【36】Isolated oligohydramnios and admission to neonatal intensive care unit： Many prospective/retrospective cohort， case-control and meta-analysis studies showed IO has no significant effect on NICU admissions. However， a meta-analysis and some epidemiologic studies revealed IO has a significant effect on admission to NICU . The observed difference might be due to the inclusion of preterm and intrauterine growth restriction neonates in the studies . For conclusive results， a large RCT is important.\n\n【37】Isolated oligohydramnios and neonatal morbidity/mortality：IO has no association with the following outcomes： immediate cry， hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy， need for neonatal resuscitation and phototherapy， transit tachypnea of the newborn， hypoglycemia， sepsis， seizure， hypothermia， meconium aspiration syndrome， jaundice， intubation， and stillbirth . Similarly， IO showed an absence of significant association with composite adverse neonatal outcomes (cesarean/operative vaginal delivery due to NRFHRP， low Apgar score， umbilical artery pH<7.10， neonatal intensive care admission， meconium aspiration syndrome， and intubation or hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy) . Moreover， IO did not show differences in perinatal mortality or morbidity compared to normal amniotic fluid volume . However， a study conducted in Nepal evidenced an association between early neonatal death and IO .\n\n【38】Isolated oligohydramnios and birth weight： Neonatal/fetal weight indicates fetal wellbeing in the uterus. Comparison studies showed there was no difference in birth weight less than 2000/2500gramsbetween门pregnancies complicated bby IOand normal amniotic fluid volume . Neonates born to mothers with isolated oligohydramnios had a higher risk of low birth weight compared with normal amniotic fluid volume. However， their weight difference had no clinical significance. Furthermore， a similar finding was observed from a meta-analysis study .\n\n【39】Conclusion\n\n【40】Studies show that IO increases the rate of induction. Moreover， a lot of findings depicted woman with IO had a higher rate of cesarean delivery compared to a woman with normal amniotic fluid. More than 20 studies including meta-analyses reported low first， fifth， and tenth-minute agar score has no relation with IO. Similarly， this narrative review revealed that a relationship doesn’t exist between IO and NRFHBP， fetal distress and umbilical artery/vein less than7.1/7.2. Moreover，IO didn'tshow differences in perinatal mortality or morbidity compared to normal amniotic fluid volume. Even though the weight difference had no clinical significance， neonates born from mothers with isolated oligohydramnios had a higher risk of low birth weight compared with their counterparts. Furthermore， the impact of IO on MSAF and neonatal intensive care unit was inconclusive across the results. For decisive evidence large RCT and inclusion of different indicators of fetal compromise along with MSAF is important.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 11:33:24", "endTime": "2024/09/24 11:34:27", "cost": 62.798}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:31", "update_time": "2024-09-23 19:34:27", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 19:33:24"}

The virus has since spread all across the world. Fever， fatigue， and respiratory problems， which can progress to pneumonia， are some of the symptoms. Symptoms usually emerge between 2 days and14 days.\n\n【2】Since being exposed to said virus， patients develop new， persistent or recurrent chronic health problems known as post-COVID diseases. Even Patients who did not suffer COVID-19symptoms in the days or weeks following their infection may also develop post-COVID issues. These conditions， also known as Long COVID，long-haul COVID， post-acute COVID-19， might manifest themselves as various combinations of health issues throughout days or weeks. Long term complications of these conditions include issues of cardiovascular system， respiratory system， neurologic system， psychiatric conditions etc.\n\n【3】Dysarthria is one of the reported post COVID condition. ASHA refers to Dysarthria as “a group of neurogenic speech disorders characterized by \"abnormalities in the strength， speed， range， steadiness， tone， or accuracy of movements required for breathing， phonatory， resonatory， articulatory， or prosodic aspects of speech production\" . These abnormalities are due to one or more sensorimotor problems-including weakness or paralysis， in coordination， involuntary movements， or excessive， reduced， or variable muscle tone .\n\n【4】Typically dysarthria is caused due to any pathophysiological altercations in the nervous system like cerebrovascular incidents， neural infection， and degenerative conditions etc. Dysarthria following COVID-19 infection is predominantly caused either due to stroke ， or due to infections ofnervous systems like meningitis and encephalitis . However， very rarely COVID-19virus by itself directly damages the speech musculature thus causing dysarthria. Even though some authors have reported skeletal muscle pain and weakness in cases post-COVID-19 ， it is seldom reflected in the speech and language functions. In this report， we present such a case that did not have marked motoric weakness but had significant dysarthric component post COVID.\n\n【5】Objectives\n\n【6】Report the in depth evaluation of case with Dysarthria Post COVID-19 infection.\n\n【7】Detail the relationship between post-COVID condition and dysarthria.\n\n【8】Methods\n\n【9】A 52-year-old male with a history of COVID-19 came to our department after 8 months of post-infection. The client reported progressive slurring of speech， left-sided tongue deviations， and swallowing difficulty following COVID-19 infection. The client underwent objective as well as subjective evaluation for all the speech and language parameters.\n\n【10】Screening MRI of brain was done followed by nerve conduction study. The client underwent detailed subjective evaluation of all the speech subsystem during which each speech subsystems namely； respiratory， phonatory， articulatory，resonatory and prosodic， were assessed using various task. Respiratory subsystem was assessed by observing the client's breathing at rest as well as during speech. To assess the patient s respiration， he was instructed to take a deep breath in via the mouth and let it out slowly. The patient was instructed to count to 20 as rapidly as possible on one breath to assess respiration in speech. During this the client’s breathing pattern， effort， capacity etc during expiration and inspiration was recorded. Phonatory subsystem was assessed by asking the client to produce /a/， /i/， /u/ sound at length as well as during conversation with the client. The duration to which the client can prolong the vowel is jotted together with the pitch， loudness and quality of client’s voice. Pitch and loudness scaling was carried out to assess pitch and loudness range. The first task for assessing articulatory subsystem included conversing with the client while the second task included picture/topic description. During the course of these tasks， the errors in production of various consonant and vowel sounds are recorded with comment on overall intelligibility of speech. Resonatory system was assessed by asking the client to produce /mae/ and /pae/alternatively. The perceptible difference between both the sounds was scrutinized. Also， the nasality during phonation of /a/ was noted. Prosodic system assessment included the reading of contrastive stress words and informal assessment of rhythm and intonation during various conversation instances (questions， narratives， statements etc).\n\n【11】Objective evaluation conducted included Dr. Speech (Tiger DRS， Inc) for phonatory-respiratory system， Electroglottography(Tiger DRS， Inc) for phonatory system. Fundamental frequency， jitter， shimmer， amplitude tremor， ofthe sounds /a/， /e/ and /u/ were recorded using Dr Speech software. Frenchay Dysarthria Assessment was administered for rating the overall severity of dysarthria .\n\n【12】Dysphagia evaluation was carried out subjectively. The client was asked whether he cough or choke while eating. He was also asked whether he had difficulty in clearing throat following which the client was observed while drinking } cup of cold water and then while eating a cookie. The client was questioned whether he had any difficulties swallowing， eating quickly， or having limits on the sorts of things he could consume.\n\n【13】Objective evaluation impression\n\n【14】Oromotor examination was carried out subjectively to chart the weakness at the level of articulators. Structural abnormality of lips at rest was observed. The patient was asked to give an exaggerated smile to check lip spreading. Lip seal was assessed by blowing air into cheeks and by maintain for 15 sec. And then the patient was asked to say /P/./P/ crisply and clearly for 10 times. Lips articulatory movements were tested by repeating “oo ee” for 10 segments in 10sec. The movements of lips in conversation were observed. Palatal maintenance was assessed by asking the patient to say-“ah-ah-ah\"for. Tongue at rest was assessed by asking the patient to open his mouth. Tongue functions like protrusion， elevation，lateral movements were assessed. Alternate movements of tongue were assessed by asking the patient to say \"ka la” for 10 times as quickly as possible. Intelligibility of words was also assessed.\n\n【15】Results functioning of Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) that regulates the blood pressure . The altered neurochemical changes in RAS system can bring about atrophy and weakness of muscles， as the RAS axis catalyses major functions like contractile activity and damage control through the regulation of sodium balance， fluids volume， and some other hemodynamic features， of the muscles . These alterations in the physicality of muscles could be reflected in diminished functions of the speech subsystems too， because of its motoric nature.\n\n【16】Table 11 reveals the obiective evaluation done andtheir respective results. The client’s imaging reports reveal mild diffuse neuroparenchymal atrophy. Nerve conduction study report shows， Axonal motor neuropathy involving bilateral peroneal nerves. Electroglottography results show normal glottal wave morphology with all the quotients within normal limits， however， voice evaluation through Dr Speech reveals hoarse voice with predominantly breathy voice quality. Results of the standardized test， Frenchay Dysarthria Assessment ， used to evaluate severity of dysarthria reveals mild dysarthria.\n\n【17】The results of Dr. Speech and EGG are depicted in Table 2， 3respectively.\n\n【18】Correspondingly， the voice quality and glottal wave pattern obtained from each is represented as Figure. The Dr. Speech values depicts the client to be having moderate hoarse voice as EGG results reveal the glottal wave to be mildly affected with normal quotients.

As shown in the Table 4， results of subjective evaluation of all subsystems of speech with swallowing assessment convey the patient to be mildly dysarthric.\n\n【30】Discussion\n\n【31】Through an in depth evaluation， our client was provisionally diagnosed with mild Dysarthria. The client possessed weakness in the speech musculature. Surprisingly， the weakness commenced after the recovery from COVID-19 infection. However， the client did not have any conventional positive etiology for his dysarthric component albeit having hypertension. The hypertension as well originated as a post COVID-19 condition. The diffuse parenchymal atrophy reported in the imaging can be attributed to age related neurophysiological alterations. It cannot account for the speech deficits portrayed by the client， as it developed acutely post COVID-19 as opposed to progressive slurring typically reported in age-related speech deteriorations. Furthermore， the peroneal neuropathy reported in the client， would not directly affect speech. Hence， considering all of these facts， we can establish that hypertension was the direct cause of dysarthria. Even though hypertension has been along-established risk factor for dysarthria by virtue of its role in cardiovascular incidences， it in itself is rarely considered as the causative agent. Our case report substantiate the finding that hypertension alone can lead to weakness in muscles thereby leading to dysarthria.\n\n【32】The pathophysiology behind this sequela can stem from the degrading effect of hypertension on the body. As most of the muscles involved in speech are highly vascular in nature， they are immensely vulnerable to the adverse effect of hypertension. The prolonged contraction in these muscles as a response to increased blood pressure can bring about generalized soreness in them， which would result in overall fatigue with mild dysarthric speech. Another major reason that dominates the previous could be that COVID-19 virus interacts with the angiotensin converting enzyme and angiotensin receptors located in the endothelium thereby altering the pathophysiological\n\n【33】Table 4： Impressions of subjective evaluation.\n\n| Subjective evaluation  |  | Results  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Evaluation of subsystem  | Articulation  | Distorted lingual sounds with reduced intelligibility of speech  |\n| Evaluation of subsystem  | Phonation  | /a：/-6.05s  |\n| Evaluation of subsystem  | Phonation  | /i/-5.98s  |\n| Evaluation of subsystem  | Phonation  | /u：-5.77s  |\n| Evaluation of subsystem  | Phonation  | s/z-0.77s  |\n| Evaluation of subsystem  | Respiration  | Abdominal breathing present with inadequate respiratory support  |\n| Evaluation of subsystem  | Resonation  | Hyponasal sound with reduced nasal emission.  |\n| Evaluation of subsystem  | Prosody  | Inadequate stress  |\n| Swallowing Assessment  |  | Chewing difficulty for solids and occasionally chocking is observed after drinking liquids.

The qualities include normal， hoarse， harsh and breathy and is rated on a 4 points scales with 0as normal and 3 as severe. The results show that client has severe breathiness during the production of all the three vowels.\n\n| Pocal wave regularity 0 1 2 3 Vocal Fold regularity Glottal Closure time -40 -20 10 Normal +10 +10 +10 Figure 2： Voice wave regularity.

According to the figure there is mild ta moderate irregularity of glottal wave with mild hypoadduction of vacal fald in aur client.  |\n| --- |\n\n【37】Adding onto this， is the age related changes occurring in the neuromotor system. As age progress the muscles tends to show morphological changes like loss of fiber， loss of mass， reducedtonicity etc. with functional difficulties including reduced rate and range of movement . As our client is just beginning the fifth decade of his life， these degenerations would not have been severe. Nevertheless， as the neuromotor compensatory skills lessen with increasing age， the COVID-19 infection attack would have made the motoric system more vulnerable，henceforth adding to the already existing weakness.\n\n【38】Hence， compiling all the points of discussion we can effectively point out COVID-19 and post COVID hypertension as causative agent of dysarthria in our client.\n\n【39】Conclusion\n\n【40】Apart from the debilitating and life threatening results of COVID-19 infection， it can also cause secondary conditions like hypertension， dysarthria etc. through alteration of systems like RAS. This can hinder the quality of life in the infected patient post recovery. Therefore， it is necessary for us to understand and report these effects and help in rehabilitating these conditions with success.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 11:13:02", "endTime": "2024/09/24 11:13:51", "cost": 49.087}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:31", "update_time": "2024-09-23 19:13:51", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 19:13:02"}

These complications range from epistaxis and sinusitis to pneumothorax and pharyngo-esophageal perforation . In a recent integrative review， eight case reports described the occurrence of esophageal and/or pharyngeal perforation related to the insertion of the NGT . Here we report an unusual case of oropharyngeal perforation opposite the left tonsillar compartment while trying to insert a NGT tube under general anesthesia.\n\n【1】A 58-year-old woman with arterial hypertension Was scheduled for ar esophagogastroduodenoscopy to explore dysphagia. During the procedure， the patient presented with major facial emphysema without hemodynamic failure， leading to an emergency intubation. A chest scan was performed finding diffuse mediastinal emphysema， without visible perforation. Probabilistic antibiotic therapy was started with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. Due to the persistent suspicion of esophageal perforation， a new CT scan was performed. It found a nasogastric probe in the left para-pharyngeal space along the jugulo-carotid arteries following a probable perforation of the oropharynx opposite the left tonsillar compartment . There was a subcutaneous emphysema， pneumomediastinum and pneumoperitoneum of contiguity. However， a secondary esophageal perforation couldn’t be excluded， though not visible on the CT scan. The nasogastric tube was removed in the operating room by the ENT team. An endoscopic examination was realized， finding ulcerations of the oropharynx without visualizable entry point. Treatment with PPI was started and the initial antibiotic therapy was continued.\n\n【2】The patient was finally extubated after 14 days of mechanical ventilation under the cover of suitable analgesia， after corticosteroid systemic therapy. She also had antibiotic therapy with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and fluconazole for 14 days to cover a possible mediastinitis. After extubation， the evolution was quickly favorable on the ENT and respiratory level with complete weaning in oxygen，and withoutlaryngeal dyspnea. In terms offood， the ENT opinion recommended the abstention of oral food for at least 7 days， apart from the gelled water which is allowed， to help healing of the pharynx. On the infectious level， the patient was treated with cefepime for nosocomial pneumonia caused by Serratia marcescens and Klebsiella oxytoca.\n\n【3】NGT tube insertion is considered a simple and innocuous procedure，yet it isassociatedwithsevereadverseevents. Complications can include perforation of the pharyngo-esophageal region. An iatrogenic parapharyngeal abscess in an eelective laparoscopic cholecystectomy， which developed after several attempts of NGT insertion， was reported . Another case report described how a nasogastric tube perforated the posterior nasopharynx in the midline and had dissected along the posterior mediastinum entering the left pleural space and causing pneumomediastinum .Misplacing NGT tube occurs because of the lack of consensus on a standard method of this device insertion and placement assessment. Also monitoring the insertion of NGT tube with the help of technologies such as electromagnetic device or the endoscopy method is topical， in order to reduce the incidence of these iatrogenic avoidable complications.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 10:30:05", "endTime": "2024/09/24 10:31:48", "cost": 103.191}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:31", "update_time": "2024-09-23 18:31:46", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 18:30:03"}

However， migration and early spontaneous expulsion of the screw after treatment of the symphysis pubis disjunction is considered rare. We present a report of a 64-year-old man who， after a fall from a height， presented with a disjunction of the pubic symphysis treated with two-plate fixation and presence of screw migration into the bladder and spontaneous expulsion one month after surgery.\n\n【2】Keywords： Screw； Pelvic fracture； Internal fixation； Bladder foreign body\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Disjunction ofthepelvic ring is associated with a 7%to 25%incidenceofurinarytract injuries . Treatment with an anterior plate in the pelvis is recommended as a fixation method for disjunctions of the pubic symphysis . Because the fixation is performed in the joint area， micro movements occur and may cause plate breakage or loosening of screws . The literature demonstrates that late screw loosening with migration to the bladder is relatively common . In this study， we report a case of migration to the bladder and early (one month) spontaneous expulsion of the screw after anterior pelvic ring surgery with plates in the pubic symphysis.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】Male patient， 64 years old， victim of a fall from a roof， approximately three and a half meters high on November 254， 2021. Upon admission to the orthopedic emergency room， after physical examination and imaging tests， the opening of the pubic symphysis chapter II was diagnosed.\n\n【7】Both the patient and the fracture remained stable throughout the treatment， and it was decided not to temporarily fix the pelvis with an external fixator. After carrying out all the preoperative preparation， the definitive orthopedic surgical procedure was performed seven days after the trauma. A pelvic approach was used through the Pfannenstiel access， with associated detachment to protect the urinary bladder. The orthopedic surgical technique used was the placement of two orthogonal plates， one superior and one anterior. Top plate was large fragment DCP with 4 mm x4.5 mm screws. The anterior reconstruction plate was made of small fragments with 4 mmx3.5mm screws. Satisfactory radiographic control was performed at all stages .\n\n【8】On January 015， 2022， the patient reported spontaneously eliminating， via urine， 1 screw 3.5mm from the anterior plate after loosening the plate. After examination of excretory urography associated with cystoscopy， it was confirmed the formation of a fistula in the anterior wall， close to the transition with the lateral/medial bladder fundus， around 0.6 cm .\n\n【9】The formation of the fistula was due to a foreign body reaction (friction against the bladder) after loosening the 3.5 mm screw， and after its formation it was encompassed by the organ. From the urological point of view， we proceeded in an expectant manner， keeping the patient using an indwelling urinary catheter for 30 days associated with the use of the antibiotic Bactrim (sulfamethoxazole + trimethoprim) for 10 days and ultrasound control to confirm the closure of the orifice. From the orthopedic point of view， watchful waiting was maintained； with no weight bearing for two months associated with radiographic control and computed tomography.\n\n【10】Discussion\n\n【11】Screw migration to the bladder after disjunction of the pubic symphysis with exit through the urethra has been reported as an extremely rare event . Bladder injury can be caused by the trauma itself， considering theproximity ofthe organ to thebone，byherniation of the bladder into the symphysis or by iatrogenic injuries . Perry and Husmann  observed that 50% ofurethral injuries after fracture of the pelvis in women were not diagnosed by inadequate urological evaluation.\n\n【12】Fridman et al.  and Sho et al.  reported a patient with spontaneous expulsion of the implant after fixation of the pubic symphysis similar to our case. Peled et al.  reported that there was an injury to the bladder during the trauma， therefore， the possibility that the screw migrated through the injured area cannot be excluded.\n\n【13】ThepubicCsymphysisis afibrous joint thateexhibits micromovements during walking. Therefore， when the surgeon performs fixation ofthe pubic symphysis， in the pelvic ring， loosening of the screw and/or breakage of the screw and plate is common . What is observed in the literature is the presence of this complication in patients with disjunction symphysis pubis treated with a plate， in which migration of the screw to the bladder generally occurs late . Hosseini et al. reported a case of bladder perforation due to screw loosening seven weeks after pelvic surgery， which was treated with cystoscopic screw removal. Unlike the previous case described by Hosseini et al.， our case involved the exceptional case with migration of the screw to the bladder with spontaneous elimination1 month after surgery， still in a state of convalescence and without any complaints. This reinforces the lack of diagnosis due to previous bladder injury， which may have favored its migration， despite the patient still being at rest.\n\n【14】Matta  advocated a single， curved pelvic plate with four or six holes with 3.5 mm screws. Some researchers have advocated the use of double plates， longer 4.5 mm screws or even two-hole plates with similar results . To avoid the instability generated by fixation of the pubic symphysis， fixation with two plates was chosen a 4.5DCP in the upper region and a 3.5 anterior reconstruction plate. The doubt raised by the authors was the need for posterior fixation of the sacroiliac joint and the use of long V-shaped anterior screws， which could stabilize the pelvis， preventing screw migration.\n\n【15】Conclusion\n\n【16】This report is intended to alert orthopedic surgeons to be careful with the fixation ofthe pubic symphysis and to look for the diagnosis of bladder injuries due to trauma， avoiding complications such as migration of the screw to the bladder.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 10:22:36", "endTime": "2024/09/24 10:23:27", "cost": 51.537}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:31", "update_time": "2024-09-23 18:23:25", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 18:22:33"}

So called orbital pseudotumor， idiopathic orbital inflammation syndrome， nonspecific orbital inflammation， and orbital inflammatory syndrome， the name of \"non-specific inflammatory pseudotumor\" was adapted in 1954 by Umiker and Iverson  to differentiate these tumors from other neoplastic processes and insist on their benign inflammatory nature .\n\n【8】Inflammatory pseudotumors of the orbit are included in the group of extra pulmonary inflammatory pseudotumors， which account for less than 5% of all inflammatory pseudotumors . These inflammatory pseudotumors account for approximately 10% of all orbital mass lesions and are particularly common in children and young adults . The forms of the elderly are rare .\n\n【9】The association in the same patient of an orbital inflammatory pseudotumor and a Graves ophthalmopathy remains exceptional and unusual situation with only a few sporadic cases reported in the world literature . This situation represents a real challenge for health practitioners since the differential diagnosis between the two entities is not easy to make . We report the original case of idiopathic orbital inflammatory pseudotumor associated with Graves' ophthalmopathy in elderly patient.\n\n【10】Case Presentation\n\n【11】A 62-year-old woman with no significant pathological history was referred to our department for exploration of right insidious ocular pain gradually worsening for two months. The somatic examination was without abnormalities except for a discreet right exophthalmia. Orbital ultrasound revealed upper and lower palpebral oedematous infiltration and homogeneous swelling of the right lacrimal gland. Baseline biology was within normal limits： total blood count， erythrocyte sedimentation rate， C-reactive protein， serum calcium， ionogram， creatinine， transaminases， muscle enzymes， lipid parameters， blood glucose， and serum protein electrophoresis. Thyroid tests did not show abnormalities： total thyroxine (fT4) at 9.2pmol/l， Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) at 1.08uUI/ml， negative anti-thyroglobulin antibody (anti-Tg) at 48 IU/ml (<120)， negative anti-thyroperoxidase antibody (anti-TPO) at 30 IU/ml (<120)， and negative anti-TSH receptor antibodies (anti-rTSH) at 0.3 IU/ml(<1).\n\n【12】Histopathological examination ofthe biopsy of the right lacrimal gland resulted in dacryoadenitis. Subsequent investigations had eliminated an underlying systemic disease (connective tissue disease， vasculitis， granulomatosis， hemopathies， and cancers). The diagnosis of idiopathic inflammatory pseudotumor of the orbit/dacryoadenitis type was retained. The patient was treated with systemic glucosteroids with a favorable outcome.\n\n【13】Two years later， the patient returns to our consultation because of acute and painful bilateral exophthalmia associated with a decrease in visual acuity.\n\n【14】Somatic examination noted asymmetrical， non-reducible， and painful bilateral exophthalmos with bilateral upper lid retraction. These signs were more prominent in the left eye . There was also a homogeneous and painless goiter.\n\n【15】Biology revealed hyperthyroidism： fT4 at 25.4 pmol/l and TSH at 0.01 uIU/ml. Cervical ultrasound demonstrated moderate， homogeneous， micro nodular， and hyper vascularized goiter. The thyroid immunity demonstrated positive anti-rTSH auto antibodies at 2.5 IU/ml. Anti-Tg and anti-TPO antibodies were always negative(15IU/mland 35IU/ml). The diagnosis of Graves disease complicated by thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy was retained. The patient was treated with methimazole (30 mg/day) and prednisone (1 mg/kg/day) with a favorable outcome： Fast disappearance of functional complaints， normalization of thyroid tests at two months， and normal appearance of orbital Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) at six months .\n\n【16】Discussion\n\n【17】The association of idiopathic orbital inflammatory pseudotumor with a thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy is exceptional and unusual. In fact， Yan et al.  in their large series of 209 cases of orbital inflammatory pseudotumors， found no association with a thyroid eye disease； and the systematic review of the literature made in 2015 by Shen et al.  found only 7 cases of this association.\n\n【18】This association was described with different types of idiopathic orbital inflammatory syndromesS：：myositis，SsIclerosing orbital inflammation， IgG4-related lymphoplasmacytic infiltrative disorder， dacryoadenitis， and lymphatic inflammatory pseudotumor .\n\n【19】The chronology of these two diseases in the same patient is variable； most often they occur specially in time . More rarely， a concomitant diagnosis of the inflammatory pseudotumor of the orbit and Graves ophthalmopathy has been reported . The diagnosis of this association represents a real challenge for clinicians tor several reasons：\n\n【20】The inflammatory pseudotumor of the orbit can mimic a Graves 'ophthalmopathy， especially in the so-called\"euthyroid graves'disease\" forms . The bilateral forms of the orbital in flammatory pseudotumors， observed in 25% of cases， can also pose the differential diagnosis with thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy ，\n\n【21】Gravesophthalmopathy can sometimespresent2as unilateral ocular involvement and mimic an idiopathic orbital inflammatory pseudotumor .\n\n【22】Thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy can cause enlarged lacrimal glands or true \"thyroid eye disease-related autoimmune dacryoadenitis\" as well as an orbital tissue enhancement secondary to inflammation， inducing confusion with authentic idiopathic orbital inflammatory pseudotumor .\n\n【23】These similarities in the clinical and radiological presentations of these two diseases explain the diagnostic difficulties， particularly in cases occurring simultaneously .\n\n【24】The exact pathophysiology of this association is not yet well understood . A common dysimmunitary mechanism at the origin of both entities is often mentioned as a promoting factor . This theory is comforted by the association with other autoimmune diseases in three of the four cases of Bijlsma and Kalmann . In addition， a significant association of these two diseases with anti-55-kD auto antibodies protein of eye muscle membrane antigens in porcine models has been objectified . These cases classically respond favorably to systemic corticosteroids .\n\n【25】Conclusion\n\n【26】As rare as it is， this unusual association deserves to be known by all health practitioners to avoid diagnostic delays and improve the prognosis that may be reserved，especially for Graves ophthalmopathy.\n\n【27】Our observation is characterized by its occurrence in an \"older adult\" patient (over 60 years).

It affects 6 per 100，000 with the highest prevalence in males， whites， and people with 60 years of age or older， with age increasing both， its prevalence and incidence. Potential risk factors for ALS include family history， heavy manual labored occupations， football， agricultural work， pesticides， chemicals， smoking and electric shocks .\n\n【4】The primary symptoms include unilateral but progressive weakness in the distal limbs without remission and relapse. Atypical presentation can include weight loss， cognitive impairment， emotional alteration and fasciculations. Muscle cramps and twitches with positive Babinski sign is also seen . The duration between the onset of symptoms and diagnosis of ALS is about a year. And by that time nearly 50% to 70% of motor neurons become nonfunctional. The Cleveland group， based on experimental design hypothesizes that the onset of disease is due to the vulnerability of motor neuron itself， whereas disease progression is the result of immune responses characterized by neuroinflammation，particularly the activation of microglia .\n\n【5】In the early 1990s， riluzole (rilutek)， a putative blocker of glutamate release， was established as the first drug for ALS. Riluzole became the gold standard drug which paved the way for newly formulated drugs in the treatment of amyotrophiclateral sclerosis. There are currently five drugs for the management of ALS， namely Rilutek， Tiglutik， Exservan，Radicava and Nuedexta . The first three being different formulations of generic Riluzole. Furthermore， Neudexta is indicated for the treatment of certain unspecific neurologic symptoms， but not for ALS itself.\n\n【6】FDA has approved a new oral drug named “Relyvrio” for the treatment of ALS in adults . Experts had concerns regarding the effectiveness of the drug which were ruled out in updated clinical trials data. Relyvrio is a compound of two drugs， sodium phenylbutyrate and taurursodiol. Sodium phenylbutyrate helps in elimination of ammonia from the body while taurursodiol helps liver in detoxification .\n\n【7】The drug formerlyknown as AMX0035 can be taken orally or be administered through a feeding tube . Relyvrio is taken within 1 h of its preparation either orally or through feeding tube. Initial dosing is one packet per day for starting three weeks (3 weeks) followed by a maintenance dose of one packet twice daily.\n\n【8】The efficacy of Relyvrio was tested in a 24-week multicenter， randomized， double-blind，placebo-controlled，parallel group study. The trial showed that the patients treated with relyvrio had a slower decline in daily functioning with longer overall survival as observed， as compared to controls on placebo .\n\n【9】The pathophysiological mechanism of action is aimed to reduce endoplasmic reticulum stress and mitochondrial dysfunction associated with protein misfolding and aggregation， the ultimate pathogenesis of ALS. Some potential side effects seen with the administration of relyvrio were diarrhea， abdominal pain， nausea， and upper respiratory tract infection. Taurursodiol， a bile acid， can affect patients with problems associated with enterohepatic circulation of bile acids， thus patients with liver dysfunction or with other known comorbid should consult a specialist before intake. The prescribing information lists additional risks associated with relyvrio's administration . It’s not known whether it's contraindicated in pregnantladies or children.\n\n【10】ALS is a debilitating disease with a difficult diagnosis， poor prognosis， shorter survival periods and currently has no cure . With the advances being made in drug therapies， relyvrio can be a breakthrough in the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis， with its enhancing effects on life expectancy，as compared to the old drugs in use for ALS. More studies investigating the efficacy and efficiency of Relyvrio in patients with ALS and other related neurological disorders and comorbidities are required to give a better insight of the long-term outcomes of the usage of drug for which longer and larger trials are required.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 11:23:32", "endTime": "2024/09/24 11:23:51", "cost": 18.625}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:31", "update_time": "2024-09-23 19:23:49", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 19:23:30"}

Due to high toxicity，stability and diverse structures， aflatoxins in food chain is an increasing global food safety concern. This study sought to isolate and identify aflatoxigenic fungi， as well as detect the presence of Aflatoxin in food and feed samples. Grains and kernels from various agricultural produces were collected from regions in and around Mysore. Fungal cultures obtained from the samples were subjected to morphological， microscopical examinations； followed by chemical and chromatographic studies. The HPLC analysis indicated 129/220 fungal isolates produced aflatoxins and showed a population distribution of 43% of A. flavus， 29% of A. parasiticus，7% of A. furnigatus， 7% of A. oryzae，5% of A. ochraceus， 4% of A. versicolor and 3% of A. tamarii and 2% of A. niger.\n\n【2】Keywords： Aflatoxins； ITS sequencing； HPLC； TLC； Aspergillus\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Globalization of the food industry has led to the vast spread of food commodities and also illnesses related it， which are mostly caused by fungi with Aspergillus flavus being an important postharvest fungus in grain stores. Along with their secondary metabolites termed as “Mycotoxins， fungal infestation has raised concern on public health due to their toxic properties . Among them， Aflatoxin (AF) contamination in food has gained importance worldwide due to their hazardous impact on both human and animal populations as carcinogens， mutagens and teratogens . Aflatoxins are a group of difuranocoumarin derivatives produced through the polyketide pathway by filamentous fungi of the genus Aspergillus. Mycotoxins produced by members of Aspergillus are commonly known as \"Aflatoxins\". The main producers include species of A. flavus， A. furnigates， A. parasiticus and A. nomius that are predominant in tropical and subtropical regions . There are about 20 different types of AFs identified as byproducts of Aspergillus contamination in food commodities such as cereals， nuts， fruits， oilseeds， and dried fruits both in field and storage . The most predominant AFs in food，agriculture， and dairy products that are designated as Aflatoxin B1， B2， G1， G2， M1， and M2 . Among these， Aflatoxins B1 (AFB1) is classified as a group 1A carcinogen by International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) due to its substantial liver damage and hepatocellular carcinoma apart from plentiful of deleterious health conditions .\n\n【5】Activities during crop cultivation (preharvest， harvest and postharvest)， and other factors such as temperature， humidity and pest damage affect the level of infection of grains by mycotoxigenic fungi. Aflatoxin contaminated food and feed incur huge losses to farming communities as the harvest is made unwholesome for consumption. Aflatoxin contamination of 88% with concentration of5 ug/kg and 14 g/kg (AFB1)， 58 g/kg (AFG1) was reported in stored maize in Benin respectively. Agbetiameh et al. ， reported that 35% of 509 (326 maize and 183 groundnut) samples had detectable aflatoxin . A study conducted in Doha， Qatar revealed aflatoxin contamination in spices and nut samples as 371.6 ng/g and 534.15 ng/g， respectively . Al-Jaal et al.  highlighted the limitations on studies of aflatoxin contamination of food and feed globally and in the Gulf Cooperation Council countries (GCC). In recent years， numerous studies have revealed high levels of aflatoxins and fungal contamination in rice in many countries . However， mycotoxin-producing fungi are less commonly reported for rice than for many other cereal crops .\n\n【6】In order to protect the consumers from the aflatoxin effects， many countries have set stringent regulations in monitoring and surveillance of aflatoxin levels in for human food as well as animal feed. The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) limit AF concentration to 15 ppb to30 ppb (parts per billion). According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) ， the concentration of AFs in the range of 4 ppb to 30 ppb is allowed in human food， depending on the importing countries. In the United States， the maximum limit of aflatoxin in the human food - except for milk is 20 ppb， while in the European Union it is 2 ppb to 4 ppb.\n\n【7】According to Sowley ， the prevalence of mycotoxins， especially aflatoxins and its associated health problems is a silent threat in developing countries where most of the people are oblivious of the dangers associated with the consumption of contaminated produce. Therefore， monitoring and management of mycotoxins in food and feed is an important prerequisite in food industry. The objective of the study was to isolate and identify aflatoxigenic fungi and detect aflatoxin in various food samples from farms， stores and markets in and around Mysore， Karnataka，India.\n\n【8】Methods\n\n【9】Chemicals and reagents\n\n【10】Mycotoxins (Aflatoxin B1(AFB1)， Aflatoxin B2 (AFB2)，Aflatoxin G1 (AFG1)， Aflatoxin G2 (AFG2)， Ochratoxin A (OTA)， Fumonisin B1 (FB1)， Patulin， Citrinin， Zearalonone (ZEA)， Deoxynivalenol(DON) and T-2 toxin)， Potassium Chloride (KCl)， Sodium Chloride(NaCl)， hemin， TMB (3，3'，5，5'-Tetramethylbenzidine) substrate reagent set， Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA)， Potato Dextrose Broth(PDB)， Coconut Cream Agar (CCA)， chloroform， acetone， methanol acetonitrile and glacial acetic acid required for present study were procured from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis， USA) unless mentioned otherwise. All the solutions were prepared with ultra-high purity water. All other solvents and reagents used in the experiments were of analytical grade. Ultrapure water (Mill-Q， Millipore， India) was used throughout this study. Standards of mycotoxins were prepared according to manufactures protocol and diluted from stock solutions to working concentration (1 mg/mL) in absolute methanol (HPLC grade).\n\n【11】Collection of samples suspected for fungal contamination\n\n【12】As it isknown， foodandfeedareconsidered as the major reservoirs of aflatoxin producers； grains and kernels from various agricultural produces namely， wheat， paddy， maize， groundnut， sorghum， and spices viz.，chili， and pepper were collected from regions in and around Mysore， India. All the samples were weighed to a sample size of 250gm， respectively and stored at 4℃ for the isolation， identification and molecular detection of Aspergillus species and further analysis of the extracted aflatoxins. The schematic representation adapted in the present work for isolation of aflatoxigenic fungi is depicted in the Figure 1.\n\n【13】Physical examination\n\n【14】Isolation of aflatoxin producers from the fungal isolates： The isolation of fungal strains from the collected samples was performed according to Abbas et al. Initially， the grains and kernels were surface sterilized by rinsing 3 to 4 times with distilled water followed by thorough washing in 1% Sodium hypochlorite + 0.1% Tween 20for 10 min to 15 min by rapid shaking. This was followed by final washing of 3 to 5 times in sterile distilled water for 5 min each. Disinfected samples were allowed to air dry on blotting paper.Grains and kernels of 4 to 6 numbers were added to 1% Potato Dextrose Broth (PDB) and incubated at 25°C for 48 h to 72 h. After incubation， the grains suspected of fungal growth were transferred onto petri-dishes containing 1% Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA) and incubated at 25°C for 2 to 4 days. The resultant fungal colonies on PDA petri plates were further observed and purified. Obtained fungal isolates were subjected to screening and identification by morphology， microscopy， molecular and chromatographic methods as discussed in the following sections.\n\n【15】Table 1： List of standard fungal cultures utilized in the present work\n\n| S.No  | Name of the fungal strain  | Source  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1  | Aspergillus fiavus  | NCIM 152  |\n| 2  | Aspergillus parasiticus  | MTCC 2797  |\n| 3  | DFR11  | DFRL， Mysore， India  |\n| 4  | DFR12  | DFRL， Mysore， India  |\n| 5  | DFR13  | DFRL， Mysore， India  |\n\n【17】The single spore cultures of Aspergillus isolates were subcultured on PDA slants， overlayed with 5% glycerol and maintained in 4C. The reference strains and Aspergillus isolates available from the in-house repository were also utilized as positive controls in the present study and are listed in the Table 1.\n\n【18】Microscopical analysis of Aspergillus species： Obtained fungal colonies were examined for their phenotypic morphologies as per Diba et al. The fungal isolates with characteristic morphologies similar to Aspergillus species were selected and further studied by microscopy using lactophenol cotton blue stain. The slides were then viewed under the light microscope (NIS-Elements imaging software， Nikon， India) and examined for characteristic features of Aspergillus species.\n\n【19】Chemical analysis\n\n【20】Ammonium vapor test： Ammonium vapor test was performed on 3-day old fungal cultures as per Fani et al. The cultures grown on Coconut Cream Agar medium (CCA) according to Degola et al.， containing fungal colonies were placed upside down， and a drop(approximately200ul)of 25% ammonia solution (v/v) wasaddedonto the lid of each fungal petri-dish and color development was carefully observed. Pink color pigmentation upon contact with ammonium vapors served as an indication for the aflatoxin production and these isolates were selected for further analysis.\n\n【21】Ultraviolet (UV) light test： For Ultraviolet (UV) light test， the fungal colonies were grown on CCA plates at 28°C for 5 to 7 days and tested for characteristic blue fluorescence on the reverse side of each petri-dish under long-wavelength (365 nm) UV light.\n\n【22】Molecular analysis\n\n【23】Fungal DNA extraction： Genomic DNA extraction from fungal samples was carried out using phenol： Chloroform： Isoamyl alcohol method. A loopful of mycelium or spore suspension from purified fungal isolates was inoculated into 50 ml of sterile Potato Dextrose Broth (PDB) (Himedia， Mumbai， India). The inoculated PDB flasks were incubated at room temperature for 48 h to 72 h with mild agitation of 100 rpm. The mycelium growth was harvested from the inoculated flasks by filtration through Whatman filter paper No. 3and snap-frozen with liquid nitrogen. The frozen mycelium was pulverized and ground to powdered form using a sterile mortar， pestle and stored at -20°C until further use. A small amount of mycelial powder was collected into a sterile 1.5 ml eppendorftube and crushed with micropestle and 500 ul of lysis buffer (pH 8) (100 mM Tris-HCl， 50 mM EDTA， 150 mM NaCl and 10% SDS) was added and kept in a water bath for 5 min at 60°C. After boil lysis， the suspension was allowed to cool and 10 ul of 100 ug/ml proteinase K was added and incubated at 56°C for 1 h. After protein lysis， equal volumes of phenol (approximately 500 pl) was added and centrifuged at 12000rpm for 5 min at 4C conditions. The supernatant was collected in a fresh eppendorf tube and 200 ul of chloroform： Isoamyl alcohol(24：1， v/v)， 200 pl of phenol was added and mixed thoroughly by inverting the tubes. Tubes were then centrifuged at 12000 rpm for 5min at 4°C. The supernatant was collected in a fresh tube and phenol， chloroform； isoamyl alcohol step was repeated 3 times. Collected supernatants were pooled together and equal volumes of chloroform were added and subjected to centrifugation at 12，000 rpm for 5 min at4C. Supernatants thus collected were treated with 500 ul of ice-cold ethanol or isopropanol and incubated at -80°C for 30 min. After DNA precipitation the tubes were subjected to centrifugation at 12，000 rpm for 10 min at 4C. The DNA pellets were washed two times with 70%ethanol (v/v) and dried in a vacuum chamber. Resultant DNA was resuspended in 50 ul of Tris-EDTA and stored at -20°C until further iise Screening of aflatoxin positive fungal isolates by gene-specific PCR： Gene-specific PCR targeting two genes of the metabolic pathway encoding toxin chemotypes viz.，nor-1 and aflR for aflatoxin production in fungal isolates were conducted . The primers for the targeted genes are mentioned in the Table 2. Each PCR reaction consisted of 20 ul of reaction volume with 1x PCR buffer， 1.5 mM of MgCl2， 80 uM of each dNTPs， 1.0 U of Taq polymerase， 10 ng to 00 ng of template DNA and 6 uM each of forward and reverse primers. The reaction was carried out for 35 cycles in Eppendorf master thermal cycler (Hamburg， Germany) with denaturation at 94℃ for 1 min， annealing of 56°C， 58°C for nor-1 gene and afiR gene， respectively for 1 min， extension at 72°C for 1 min. The DNA was initially denatured for 5 min at 94°C and finally extended for 8min at 72°C before termination of the amplification. PCR amplicons thus obtained were resolved on 1% agarose gel by electrophoresis technique and visualized under UV transilluminator.\n\n【24】Identification0ofafatoxinpositivefungalisolatesby Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) sequencing： The species-level identification of plausible aflatoxin positive fungal isolates was carried out by the Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) sequencing. The amplification of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS.8S-ITS2) region in ribosomal DNA (rDNA) of fungal isolates by PCR was performed and sequencing of the amplicons for identification of the isolates was carried out.\n\n【25】PCR amplification of Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) region： Genomic DNA of the aflatoxin positive fungal isolates was used as a template for the PCR amplification of their IT'S regions. Universal primers namely ITS1 and ITS4 were utilized as forward and reverse primers  for the amplification . Each PCR reaction of consisted of the 2.5 pl of 1x PCR buffer， 2.0 pl of 2.5 mM dNTPs， 1.5 ul of each primers ITS1 and ITS4 (10 pmol/ml)， 1.0 pl of50 mM MgCl2，0.2 ul Taq DNA polymerase (5U/ml)， 1.0 ul of 10 ng/ml DNA and 15.3 ul of distilled water. The PCR reaction was carried out in Eppendorf master thermal cycler (Hamburg， Germany) and the program was set with an initial denaturation of DNA for 4 min at95°C followed by 35 cvcles. Each amplification cvcle consisted of three steps： Denaturation for 60 sec at 95℃， annealing for 45 sec at 56℃and elongation for 2 min at 72℃. Final elongation of 72℃ for 8 min was used at the termination of the program. The resultant amplified products were analyzed by gel electrophoresis on 1% agarose gel in1x TBE buffer. The resolved gel was then visualized under UV light and the desired amplicons of 550 bps were excised and gel purified by GenElute Gel Extraction kit (Sigma， Bangalore， India).\n\n| Table 2： Primer sequences used in the present work  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Gene  | Primer  | Sequence   | Size (bp)  | References  |\n| nor-1  | nor1F  | TTGGCCGCCAGCTTCGACA  | 367  | In this study  |\n| nor-1  | nor1R  | TCGCTGAAGGCAGTCGGAT  | 367  | In this study  |\n| aniR  | afiR Fwd  | GCACCTGTCTTCCCTAACA  | 400  | Priyanka et al.  |\n| aniR  | afiR Rev  | ACGAACATGCTCAGCAAGTA  | 400  | Priyanka et al.  |\n| ITS  | ITS 1  | TCCGTAGGTGAACCTGCGG  | 550-600  | White et al.  |\n| ITS  | ITS4  | TCCTCCGCTTATTGATATG  | 550-600  | White et al.  |\n\n【27】Sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region：The gel purified PCR products encoding ITS regions were sequenced according to Sanger et al. The sequencing reaction was maintained at a volume of 10 ul， containing 2.0 ul of ITS4 primer， 4.0ul of a premix of Dynamic ET terminator (Amersham Biosciences) and 4.0 pl of the purified ITS -PCR product (100 ng/ml). The PCR tubes were then placed in the Mastercycler thermocydler gradient(Eppendorf) and set to perform 35 cycles with the conditions of initial denaturation for 2 min at 95°C， followed by denaturation for1 min at 95℃， annealing for 1 min at 55℃， elongation for 1 min at60℃ and final elongation for 5 min at 60C. Analysis of the resultant sequences was performed by ABI 3500 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems，USA). The obtained sequences were compared with those available in the GenBank of the National Center for Biotechnology and Information (NCBI)， using the BLAST search tool .\n\n【28】Chromatographic analysis\n\n【29】Extraction and cleanup of mycotoxins： Depending on the matrices of the test samples， the toxin extraction procedure was performed with slight modifications. The samples size of 50 gm for solid samples (food) and 100 ml for samples in liquid state was used in the extraction procedure. Non fatty test samples such as wheat， maize， and sorghum were mixed with 100 ml of methanol： water(55：45， v/v) and for samples with fatty matrices and spices， like groundnuts， chili， pepper， and turmeric， 2 gm of NaCl and 50 ml of hexane were additionally added to the above mentioned solvent system. The samples were then blended in a blending jar at high speed for 5 min to 10 min and filtered through Whatman No.4 filter paper. The filtrate was mixed with equal volumes of chloroform and shaken vigorously for 1 min to 2 min and left undisturbed for separation. The lower phase was collected and evaporated to near dryness under a gentle stream of liquid nitrogen. The sample was then redissolved in 10 ml of methanol： Water (80：20， v/v). Further clean-up of the extracted toxin was preceded with specific immunoaffinity columns(LCTech， Germany) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Elutions were collected in 2 ml methanol and stored at- 20°C until further use. Standard aflatoxin B1 (AFB1)， B2 (AFB2)， G1 (AFG1)， G2 (AFG2)， Citrinin (CIT)， Deoxynivalenol (DON)， Fumonisin B1 (FB1)， Ochratoxin A (OTA)， Patulin (PAT)， T2 toxin (T2) and Zearalenone (ZEA) (Sigma-Aldrich， USA) were prepared according to the supplier’s instructions.\n\n【30】Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC)： Toxin extracts and aflatoxin standards (AFB1， B2， G1， and G2) of 10 ul each were spotted on thin-layer chromatography Silica gel 60 F254 plates (Merck， Darmstadt，\n\n【31】Germany) in dark conditions. The plates were developed in the mobile phase consisting of chloroform： acetone solution (85：15， v/v) for 60min and air-dried for 3 min to 5 min in dark conditions. The plates were then visualized under long wavelength Ultraviolet (UV) light(365 nm) for the presence of fluorescent spots viz.， blue color (AFB1and AFB2) and green color (AFG1 and AFG2). The Retardation Factor (Rf) values were calculated and compared to the Rf values of the aflatoxin standards. The solvent phase (chloroform： Acetone)and extracts from non-toxigenic isolates were used as the negative control in the experiment.\n\n【32】High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC)：Quantitative and qualitative analysis of the aflatoxin extracted from fungal isolates and suspected food samples was carried out using HPLC analysis as per Priyanka et al. ， with minor modifications Toxin extracts and aflatoxin standards of 10 ul each were injected onto the RP-C18 column (Jasco， UK) with dimensions of 3 umx250mmx 46 mm. The analysis was performed on a JASCO HPLC system(JASCO， UK) with a fluorescence detector at wavelength settings of emission at 365 nm and excitation at 455 nm with a flow rate of 0.8ml/min and mobile phase consisting of water： Acetonitrile： Glacial acetic acid (52：47：1，v/v/v). For other mycotoxins (OTA，DON， and ZEA) emission wavelengths were set at 365，336 and 262 nm at a flow rate of 1.2 ml/min. Fumonisin B1 (FB1) was analyzed using a UV detector with an excitation wavelength of 455 nm and a flow rate of0.8 ml/min. The solvent system consisted of methanol： Acetonitrile：Acetic acid (50：40：10 v/v)， methanol： Water (70：30 v/v)， methanol：Water (80：20 v/v)， acetonitrile： Water (40：60) for OTA， FB1，DON， and ZEA respectively.\n\n【33】Result and Discussion Isolation of Aspergillus species from diverse sources\n\n【34】A total of 220 fungal cultures were isolated from the collected food and agricultural samples suspected for fungal infestation. These isolates were screened for the presence of aflatoxin producers by phenotypic characters， chromatography and molecular methods. The Figure 2 depicts the morphological and biochemical tests performed on the fungal isolates in the present study. As a preliminary step in screening， macro and micro-morphological features were observed and 196 isolates were screened with characteristics morphologies of Aspergillus strains. The presumptive Aspergillus isolates were then screened for aflatoxin production by ammonium vapors test and UV light test . A total of 188 isolates developed pink color pigmentation upon contact with ammonium vapors and characteristic blue fluorescence under long wavelength (365 nm) of UV light. For further confirmation and identification； tests such as molecular methods (gene-specific PCR， ITS sequencing) and chromatography(TLC and HPLC) were performed for the fungal isolates.\n\n【35】Identification of aflatoxigenic Aspergillus species\n\n【36】The suspected fungal isolates were subjected to genomic DNA amplicon size against 100 bps DNA ladder.\n\n【37】Table 3： List of aflatoxin producing isolates obtained in the present study.\n\n| Species name  | ITS  | TLC  | HPLC  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| A. iavus  | 80  |  |  |\n| A. fumigatus  | 13  | 1  |  |\n| A. niger  | 4  | 1  |  |\n| A. oryzae  | 4  |  |  |\n| A. ochraceus  | 10  |  |  |\n| A. parasiticus  | 55  | 52  | 52  |\n| A. tamarn  | 6  |  |  |\n| A. versicolor  | 5  | 0  |  |\n| Total  | 177  | 131  | 129  |\n\n【39】extraction by phenol， chloroform， isoamyl alcohol method. Obtained DNA  were utilized in the molecular methods for further screening and characterization of the aflatoxin producing isolates.\n\n【40】Putative fungal isolates screened from the morphological and biochemical tests were examined for the presence of aflatoxin encoding genes namely nor-1 and afiR-1. Gene-specific PCR amplification of nor-1 and aftR-1 was carried out with the respective primers mentioned in the Table 2. Amplicons of 367 bps and 400bps were considered positive for the presence of nor-1  and aflR-1  genes respectively. A total of 178 isolates from 188were found positive for the presence of one or both the genes (nor-1，170 isolates； aflR， 168 isolates).\n\n【41】Fungal isolates positive for aflatoxin encoding genes were subjected to sequencing for the identification of Aspergillus species. Sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS.8S-ITS2) of ribosomal DNA (rDNA) was performed by amplification of the region by IT'S1 and ITS4 primers  with standardized PCR program. An amplicon of 550 bps  was gel purified and utilized for sequencing procedure. The BLAST analysis of resultant nucleotide sequences and comparison with those available at Gen Bank， NCBI，  revealed a total of 177 out of 220 fungal isolates as members of Aspergillus family. The percentage distribution of members of Aspergillus family recovered in the present study is depicted in  accounting for 43% of A. flavus， 29% of A. parasiticus， 7% of A. fumnigatus， 7% of A. oryzae， 5% of A. ochraceus， 4% of A. versicolor and 3% of A. tamarii and 2% of A. niger. size against 1 Kb DNA ladder.\n\n【42】Chromatographicanalysis 1 toxin extracts from Aspergillus species\n\n【43】Chromatographic analysis (TLC and HPLC) of the mycotoxin extracts from the Aspergillus isolates was performed as the confirmatory tests for the presence of aflatoxin. The toxin extracts from the isolates were spotted on silica gel plates and tested by TLC method.

Due to high toxicity，stability and diverse structures， aflatoxins in food chain is an increasing global food safety concern. This study sought to isolate and identify aflatoxigenic fungi， as well as detect the presence of Aflatoxin in food and feed samples. Grains and kernels from various agricultural produces were collected from regions in and around Mysore. Fungal cultures obtained from the samples were subjected to morphological， microscopical examinations； followed by chemical and chromatographic studies. The HPLC analysis indicated 129/220 fungal isolates produced aflatoxins and showed a population distribution of 43% of A. flavus， 29% of A. parasiticus，7% of A. furnigatus， 7% of A. oryzae，5% of A. ochraceus， 4% of A. versicolor and 3% of A. tamarii and 2% of A. niger.\n\n【2】Keywords： Aflatoxins； ITS sequencing； HPLC； TLC； Aspergillus\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Globalization of the food industry has led to the vast spread of food commodities and also illnesses related it， which are mostly caused by fungi with Aspergillus flavus being an important postharvest fungus in grain stores. Along with their secondary metabolites termed as “Mycotoxins， fungal infestation has raised concern on public health due to their toxic properties . Among them， Aflatoxin (AF) contamination in food has gained importance worldwide due to their hazardous impact on both human and animal populations as carcinogens， mutagens and teratogens . Aflatoxins are a group of difuranocoumarin derivatives produced through the polyketide pathway by filamentous fungi of the genus Aspergillus. Mycotoxins produced by members of Aspergillus are commonly known as \"Aflatoxins\". The main producers include species of A. flavus， A. furnigates， A. parasiticus and A. nomius that are predominant in tropical and subtropical regions . There are about 20 different types of AFs identified as byproducts of Aspergillus contamination in food commodities such as cereals， nuts， fruits， oilseeds， and dried fruits both in field and storage . The most predominant AFs in food，agriculture， and dairy products that are designated as Aflatoxin B1， B2， G1， G2， M1， and M2 . Among these， Aflatoxins B1 (AFB1) is classified as a group 1A carcinogen by International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) due to its substantial liver damage and hepatocellular carcinoma apart from plentiful of deleterious health conditions .\n\n【5】Activities during crop cultivation (preharvest， harvest and postharvest)， and other factors such as temperature， humidity and pest damage affect the level of infection of grains by mycotoxigenic fungi. Aflatoxin contaminated food and feed incur huge losses to farming communities as the harvest is made unwholesome for consumption. Aflatoxin contamination of 88% with concentration of5 ug/kg and 14 g/kg (AFB1)， 58 g/kg (AFG1) was reported in stored maize in Benin respectively. Agbetiameh et al. ， reported that 35% of 509 (326 maize and 183 groundnut) samples had detectable aflatoxin . A study conducted in Doha， Qatar revealed aflatoxin contamination in spices and nut samples as 371.6 ng/g and 534.15 ng/g， respectively . Al-Jaal et al.  highlighted the limitations on studies of aflatoxin contamination of food and feed globally and in the Gulf Cooperation Council countries (GCC). In recent years， numerous studies have revealed high levels of aflatoxins and fungal contamination in rice in many countries . However， mycotoxin-producing fungi are less commonly reported for rice than for many other cereal crops .\n\n【6】In order to protect the consumers from the aflatoxin effects， many countries have set stringent regulations in monitoring and surveillance of aflatoxin levels in for human food as well as animal feed. The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) limit AF concentration to 15 ppb to30 ppb (parts per billion). According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) ， the concentration of AFs in the range of 4 ppb to 30 ppb is allowed in human food， depending on the importing countries. In the United States， the maximum limit of aflatoxin in the human food - except for milk is 20 ppb， while in the European Union it is 2 ppb to 4 ppb.\n\n【7】According to Sowley ， the prevalence of mycotoxins， especially aflatoxins and its associated health problems is a silent threat in developing countries where most of the people are oblivious of the dangers associated with the consumption of contaminated produce. Therefore， monitoring and management of mycotoxins in food and feed is an important prerequisite in food industry. The objective of the study was to isolate and identify aflatoxigenic fungi and detect aflatoxin in various food samples from farms， stores and markets in and around Mysore， Karnataka，India.\n\n【8】Methods\n\n【9】Chemicals and reagents\n\n【10】Mycotoxins (Aflatoxin B1(AFB1)， Aflatoxin B2 (AFB2)，Aflatoxin G1 (AFG1)， Aflatoxin G2 (AFG2)， Ochratoxin A (OTA)， Fumonisin B1 (FB1)， Patulin， Citrinin， Zearalonone (ZEA)， Deoxynivalenol(DON) and T-2 toxin)， Potassium Chloride (KCl)， Sodium Chloride(NaCl)， hemin， TMB (3，3'，5，5'-Tetramethylbenzidine) substrate reagent set， Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA)， Potato Dextrose Broth(PDB)， Coconut Cream Agar (CCA)， chloroform， acetone， methanol acetonitrile and glacial acetic acid required for present study were procured from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis， USA) unless mentioned otherwise. All the solutions were prepared with ultra-high purity water. All other solvents and reagents used in the experiments were of analytical grade. Ultrapure water (Mill-Q， Millipore， India) was used throughout this study. Standards of mycotoxins were prepared according to manufactures protocol and diluted from stock solutions to working concentration (1 mg/mL) in absolute methanol (HPLC grade).\n\n【11】Collection of samples suspected for fungal contamination\n\n【12】As it isknown， foodandfeedareconsidered as the major reservoirs of aflatoxin producers； grains and kernels from various agricultural produces namely， wheat， paddy， maize， groundnut， sorghum， and spices viz.，chili， and pepper were collected from regions in and around Mysore， India. All the samples were weighed to a sample size of 250gm， respectively and stored at 4℃ for the isolation， identification and molecular detection of Aspergillus species and further analysis of the extracted aflatoxins. The schematic representation adapted in the present work for isolation of aflatoxigenic fungi is depicted in the Figure 1.\n\n【13】Physical examination\n\n【14】Isolation of aflatoxin producers from the fungal isolates： The isolation of fungal strains from the collected samples was performed according to Abbas et al. Initially， the grains and kernels were surface sterilized by rinsing 3 to 4 times with distilled water followed by thorough washing in 1% Sodium hypochlorite + 0.1% Tween 20for 10 min to 15 min by rapid shaking. This was followed by final washing of 3 to 5 times in sterile distilled water for 5 min each. Disinfected samples were allowed to air dry on blotting paper.Grains and kernels of 4 to 6 numbers were added to 1% Potato Dextrose Broth (PDB) and incubated at 25°C for 48 h to 72 h. After incubation， the grains suspected of fungal growth were transferred onto petri-dishes containing 1% Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA) and incubated at 25°C for 2 to 4 days. The resultant fungal colonies on PDA petri plates were further observed and purified. Obtained fungal isolates were subjected to screening and identification by morphology， microscopy， molecular and chromatographic methods as discussed in the following sections.\n\n【15】Table 1： List of standard fungal cultures utilized in the present work\n\n| S.No  | Name of the fungal strain  | Source  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1  | Aspergillus fiavus  | NCIM 152  |\n| 2  | Aspergillus parasiticus  | MTCC 2797  |\n| 3  | DFR11  | DFRL， Mysore， India  |\n| 4  | DFR12  | DFRL， Mysore， India  |\n| 5  | DFR13  | DFRL， Mysore， India  |\n\n【17】The single spore cultures of Aspergillus isolates were subcultured on PDA slants， overlayed with 5% glycerol and maintained in 4C. The reference strains and Aspergillus isolates available from the in-house repository were also utilized as positive controls in the present study and are listed in the Table 1.\n\n【18】Microscopical analysis of Aspergillus species： Obtained fungal colonies were examined for their phenotypic morphologies as per Diba et al. The fungal isolates with characteristic morphologies similar to Aspergillus species were selected and further studied by microscopy using lactophenol cotton blue stain. The slides were then viewed under the light microscope (NIS-Elements imaging software， Nikon， India) and examined for characteristic features of Aspergillus species.\n\n【19】Chemical analysis\n\n【20】Ammonium vapor test： Ammonium vapor test was performed on 3-day old fungal cultures as per Fani et al. The cultures grown on Coconut Cream Agar medium (CCA) according to Degola et al.， containing fungal colonies were placed upside down， and a drop(approximately200ul)of 25% ammonia solution (v/v) wasaddedonto the lid of each fungal petri-dish and color development was carefully observed. Pink color pigmentation upon contact with ammonium vapors served as an indication for the aflatoxin production and these isolates were selected for further analysis.\n\n【21】Ultraviolet (UV) light test： For Ultraviolet (UV) light test， the fungal colonies were grown on CCA plates at 28°C for 5 to 7 days and tested for characteristic blue fluorescence on the reverse side of each petri-dish under long-wavelength (365 nm) UV light.\n\n【22】Molecular analysis\n\n【23】Fungal DNA extraction： Genomic DNA extraction from fungal samples was carried out using phenol： Chloroform： Isoamyl alcohol method. A loopful of mycelium or spore suspension from purified fungal isolates was inoculated into 50 ml of sterile Potato Dextrose Broth (PDB) (Himedia， Mumbai， India). The inoculated PDB flasks were incubated at room temperature for 48 h to 72 h with mild agitation of 100 rpm. The mycelium growth was harvested from the inoculated flasks by filtration through Whatman filter paper No. 3and snap-frozen with liquid nitrogen. The frozen mycelium was pulverized and ground to powdered form using a sterile mortar， pestle and stored at -20°C until further use. A small amount of mycelial powder was collected into a sterile 1.5 ml eppendorftube and crushed with micropestle and 500 ul of lysis buffer (pH 8) (100 mM Tris-HCl， 50 mM EDTA， 150 mM NaCl and 10% SDS) was added and kept in a water bath for 5 min at 60°C. After boil lysis， the suspension was allowed to cool and 10 ul of 100 ug/ml proteinase K was added and incubated at 56°C for 1 h. After protein lysis， equal volumes of phenol (approximately 500 pl) was added and centrifuged at 12000rpm for 5 min at 4C conditions. The supernatant was collected in a fresh eppendorf tube and 200 ul of chloroform： Isoamyl alcohol(24：1， v/v)， 200 pl of phenol was added and mixed thoroughly by inverting the tubes. Tubes were then centrifuged at 12000 rpm for 5min at 4°C. The supernatant was collected in a fresh tube and phenol， chloroform； isoamyl alcohol step was repeated 3 times. Collected supernatants were pooled together and equal volumes of chloroform were added and subjected to centrifugation at 12，000 rpm for 5 min at4C. Supernatants thus collected were treated with 500 ul of ice-cold ethanol or isopropanol and incubated at -80°C for 30 min. After DNA precipitation the tubes were subjected to centrifugation at 12，000 rpm for 10 min at 4C. The DNA pellets were washed two times with 70%ethanol (v/v) and dried in a vacuum chamber. Resultant DNA was resuspended in 50 ul of Tris-EDTA and stored at -20°C until further iise Screening of aflatoxin positive fungal isolates by gene-specific PCR： Gene-specific PCR targeting two genes of the metabolic pathway encoding toxin chemotypes viz.，nor-1 and aflR for aflatoxin production in fungal isolates were conducted . The primers for the targeted genes are mentioned in the Table 2. Each PCR reaction consisted of 20 ul of reaction volume with 1x PCR buffer， 1.5 mM of MgCl2， 80 uM of each dNTPs， 1.0 U of Taq polymerase， 10 ng to 00 ng of template DNA and 6 uM each of forward and reverse primers.

The DNA was initially denatured for 5 min at 94°C and finally extended for 8min at 72°C before termination of the amplification. PCR amplicons thus obtained were resolved on 1% agarose gel by electrophoresis technique and visualized under UV transilluminator.\n\n【24】Identification0ofafatoxinpositivefungalisolatesby Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) sequencing： The species-level identification of plausible aflatoxin positive fungal isolates was carried out by the Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) sequencing. The amplification of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS.8S-ITS2) region in ribosomal DNA (rDNA) of fungal isolates by PCR was performed and sequencing of the amplicons for identification of the isolates was carried out.\n\n【25】PCR amplification of Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) region： Genomic DNA of the aflatoxin positive fungal isolates was used as a template for the PCR amplification of their IT'S regions. Universal primers namely ITS1 and ITS4 were utilized as forward and reverse primers  for the amplification . Each PCR reaction of consisted of the 2.5 pl of 1x PCR buffer， 2.0 pl of 2.5 mM dNTPs， 1.5 ul of each primers ITS1 and ITS4 (10 pmol/ml)， 1.0 pl of50 mM MgCl2，0.2 ul Taq DNA polymerase (5U/ml)， 1.0 ul of 10 ng/ml DNA and 15.3 ul of distilled water. The PCR reaction was carried out in Eppendorf master thermal cycler (Hamburg， Germany) and the program was set with an initial denaturation of DNA for 4 min at95°C followed by 35 cvcles. Each amplification cvcle consisted of three steps： Denaturation for 60 sec at 95℃， annealing for 45 sec at 56℃and elongation for 2 min at 72℃. Final elongation of 72℃ for 8 min was used at the termination of the program. The resultant amplified products were analyzed by gel electrophoresis on 1% agarose gel in1x TBE buffer. The resolved gel was then visualized under UV light and the desired amplicons of 550 bps were excised and gel purified by GenElute Gel Extraction kit (Sigma， Bangalore， India).\n\n| Table 2： Primer sequences used in the present work  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Gene  | Primer  | Sequence   | Size (bp)  | References  |\n| nor-1  | nor1F  | TTGGCCGCCAGCTTCGACA  | 367  | In this study  |\n| nor-1  | nor1R  | TCGCTGAAGGCAGTCGGAT  | 367  | In this study  |\n| aniR  | afiR Fwd  | GCACCTGTCTTCCCTAACA  | 400  | Priyanka et al.  |\n| aniR  | afiR Rev  | ACGAACATGCTCAGCAAGTA  | 400  | Priyanka et al.  |\n| ITS  | ITS 1  | TCCGTAGGTGAACCTGCGG  | 550-600  | White et al.  |\n| ITS  | ITS4  | TCCTCCGCTTATTGATATG  | 550-600  | White et al.  |\n\n【27】Sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region：The gel purified PCR products encoding ITS regions were sequenced according to Sanger et al. The sequencing reaction was maintained at a volume of 10 ul， containing 2.0 ul of ITS4 primer， 4.0ul of a premix of Dynamic ET terminator (Amersham Biosciences) and 4.0 pl of the purified ITS -PCR product (100 ng/ml). The PCR tubes were then placed in the Mastercycler thermocydler gradient(Eppendorf) and set to perform 35 cycles with the conditions of initial denaturation for 2 min at 95°C， followed by denaturation for1 min at 95℃， annealing for 1 min at 55℃， elongation for 1 min at60℃ and final elongation for 5 min at 60C. Analysis of the resultant sequences was performed by ABI 3500 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems，USA). The obtained sequences were compared with those available in the GenBank of the National Center for Biotechnology and Information (NCBI)， using the BLAST search tool .\n\n【28】Chromatographic analysis\n\n【29】Extraction and cleanup of mycotoxins： Depending on the matrices of the test samples， the toxin extraction procedure was performed with slight modifications. The samples size of 50 gm for solid samples (food) and 100 ml for samples in liquid state was used in the extraction procedure. Non fatty test samples such as wheat， maize， and sorghum were mixed with 100 ml of methanol： water(55：45， v/v) and for samples with fatty matrices and spices， like groundnuts， chili， pepper， and turmeric， 2 gm of NaCl and 50 ml of hexane were additionally added to the above mentioned solvent system. The samples were then blended in a blending jar at high speed for 5 min to 10 min and filtered through Whatman No.4 filter paper. The filtrate was mixed with equal volumes of chloroform and shaken vigorously for 1 min to 2 min and left undisturbed for separation. The lower phase was collected and evaporated to near dryness under a gentle stream of liquid nitrogen. The sample was then redissolved in 10 ml of methanol： Water (80：20， v/v). Further clean-up of the extracted toxin was preceded with specific immunoaffinity columns(LCTech， Germany) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Elutions were collected in 2 ml methanol and stored at- 20°C until further use. Standard aflatoxin B1 (AFB1)， B2 (AFB2)， G1 (AFG1)， G2 (AFG2)， Citrinin (CIT)， Deoxynivalenol (DON)， Fumonisin B1 (FB1)， Ochratoxin A (OTA)， Patulin (PAT)， T2 toxin (T2) and Zearalenone (ZEA) (Sigma-Aldrich， USA) were prepared according to the supplier’s instructions.\n\n【30】Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC)： Toxin extracts and aflatoxin standards (AFB1， B2， G1， and G2) of 10 ul each were spotted on thin-layer chromatography Silica gel 60 F254 plates (Merck， Darmstadt，\n\n【31】Germany) in dark conditions. The plates were developed in the mobile phase consisting of chloroform： acetone solution (85：15， v/v) for 60min and air-dried for 3 min to 5 min in dark conditions. The plates were then visualized under long wavelength Ultraviolet (UV) light(365 nm) for the presence of fluorescent spots viz.， blue color (AFB1and AFB2) and green color (AFG1 and AFG2). The Retardation Factor (Rf) values were calculated and compared to the Rf values of the aflatoxin standards. The solvent phase (chloroform： Acetone)and extracts from non-toxigenic isolates were used as the negative control in the experiment.\n\n【32】High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC)：Quantitative and qualitative analysis of the aflatoxin extracted from fungal isolates and suspected food samples was carried out using HPLC analysis as per Priyanka et al. ， with minor modifications Toxin extracts and aflatoxin standards of 10 ul each were injected onto the RP-C18 column (Jasco， UK) with dimensions of 3 umx250mmx 46 mm. The analysis was performed on a JASCO HPLC system(JASCO， UK) with a fluorescence detector at wavelength settings of emission at 365 nm and excitation at 455 nm with a flow rate of 0.8ml/min and mobile phase consisting of water： Acetonitrile： Glacial acetic acid (52：47：1，v/v/v). For other mycotoxins (OTA，DON， and ZEA) emission wavelengths were set at 365，336 and 262 nm at a flow rate of 1.2 ml/min. Fumonisin B1 (FB1) was analyzed using a UV detector with an excitation wavelength of 455 nm and a flow rate of0.8 ml/min. The solvent system consisted of methanol： Acetonitrile：Acetic acid (50：40：10 v/v)， methanol： Water (70：30 v/v)， methanol：Water (80：20 v/v)， acetonitrile： Water (40：60) for OTA， FB1，DON， and ZEA respectively.\n\n【33】Result and Discussion Isolation of Aspergillus species from diverse sources\n\n【34】A total of 220 fungal cultures were isolated from the collected food and agricultural samples suspected for fungal infestation. These isolates were screened for the presence of aflatoxin producers by phenotypic characters， chromatography and molecular methods. The Figure 2 depicts the morphological and biochemical tests performed on the fungal isolates in the present study. As a preliminary step in screening， macro and micro-morphological features were observed and 196 isolates were screened with characteristics morphologies of Aspergillus strains. The presumptive Aspergillus isolates were then screened for aflatoxin production by ammonium vapors test and UV light test . A total of 188 isolates developed pink color pigmentation upon contact with ammonium vapors and characteristic blue fluorescence under long wavelength (365 nm) of UV light. For further confirmation and identification； tests such as molecular methods (gene-specific PCR， ITS sequencing) and chromatography(TLC and HPLC) were performed for the fungal isolates.\n\n【35】Identification of aflatoxigenic Aspergillus species\n\n【36】The suspected fungal isolates were subjected to genomic DNA amplicon size against 100 bps DNA ladder.\n\n【37】Table 3： List of aflatoxin producing isolates obtained in the present study.\n\n| Species name  | ITS  | TLC  | HPLC  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| A. iavus  | 80  |  |  |\n| A. fumigatus  | 13  | 1  |  |\n| A. niger  | 4  | 1  |  |\n| A. oryzae  | 4  |  |  |\n| A. ochraceus  | 10  |  |  |\n| A. parasiticus  | 55  | 52  | 52  |\n| A. tamarn  | 6  |  |  |\n| A. versicolor  | 5  | 0  |  |\n| Total  | 177  | 131  | 129  |\n\n【39】extraction by phenol， chloroform， isoamyl alcohol method. Obtained DNA  were utilized in the molecular methods for further screening and characterization of the aflatoxin producing isolates.\n\n【40】Putative fungal isolates screened from the morphological and biochemical tests were examined for the presence of aflatoxin encoding genes namely nor-1 and afiR-1. Gene-specific PCR amplification of nor-1 and aftR-1 was carried out with the respective primers mentioned in the Table 2. Amplicons of 367 bps and 400bps were considered positive for the presence of nor-1  and aflR-1  genes respectively. A total of 178 isolates from 188were found positive for the presence of one or both the genes (nor-1，170 isolates； aflR， 168 isolates).\n\n【41】Fungal isolates positive for aflatoxin encoding genes were subjected to sequencing for the identification of Aspergillus species. Sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS.8S-ITS2) of ribosomal DNA (rDNA) was performed by amplification of the region by IT'S1 and ITS4 primers  with standardized PCR program. An amplicon of 550 bps  was gel purified and utilized for sequencing procedure. The BLAST analysis of resultant nucleotide sequences and comparison with those available at Gen Bank， NCBI，  revealed a total of 177 out of 220 fungal isolates as members of Aspergillus family. The percentage distribution of members of Aspergillus family recovered in the present study is depicted in  accounting for 43% of A. flavus， 29% of A. parasiticus， 7% of A. fumnigatus， 7% of A. oryzae， 5% of A. ochraceus， 4% of A. versicolor and 3% of A. tamarii and 2% of A. niger. size against 1 Kb DNA ladder.\n\n【42】Chromatographicanalysis 1 toxin extracts from Aspergillus species\n\n【43】Chromatographic analysis (TLC and HPLC) of the mycotoxin extracts from the Aspergillus isolates was performed as the confirmatory tests for the presence of aflatoxin. The toxin extracts from the isolates were spotted on silica gel plates and tested by TLC method. When visualized under UV light， the spots on the silica gel plates emitted blue and green fluorescence indicating the presence of Aflatoxin B1， B2， and Aflatoxin G1， G2 respectively . The Rf values of the test toxins were compared to that of the standard aflatoxin values and observations were drawn. A total of131 Aspergillus isolates were able to produce extracts emitting blue fluorescence suggesting AFB production .\n\n【44】The toxin extracts found positive for the presence of blue fluorescence form TLC analysis were subjected to High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). A volume of 20 ul of the extracts was loaded into the HPLC system and analyzed. The Retention time(tR) and area of the peak were noted down and compared with values of the standard AFB1. The observations as depicted in Figure isolates. showed similar Retention time (tR) intervals of 8.114 min as that of the standard AFB1 and the respective peak areas revealed the quantitative analysis of the aflatoxin present in the extracts. Among the tested 131Aspergillus isolates， 77 of A. flavus and 52 of A. prasiticus were found to produce AFB1 whereas the remaining TLC positive Aspergillus members did not produce aflatoxins .\n\n【45】Conclusion\n\n【46】A total of 220 fungal cultures were isolated from the collection and were screened morphologically and examined for microscopic features. Isolates were further screened by biochemical， molecular methods and identified by ITS sequencing. HPLC analysis revealed129 isolates for aflatoxin production (77 of A. flavus and 52 of A. prasiticus). From our observation， it is recommended to carryout routine analysis of grains， food and feed in order to limit aflatoxin contamination in food chain.

It was found on admission that the patient had had psoriasis vulgaris； the patient had no therapy for six years and he had no regular checkups. Due to progression and high CT scan severity score and elevated serum IL-6， the decision was made to administer the patient tocilizumab. Upon administration， psoriatic lesions were in retreat. Even though there are some reports describing tocilizumab induced psoriasis， some studies have demonstrated a high level of IL-6 in psoriatic plaques. Therefore， therapies that disrupt IL-6 signaling could be a treatment option for psoriasis.\n\n【2】Case Presentation\n\n【3】A 38-year-old male patient was admitted to our hospital with bilateral pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. On admission， the patient’s history showed that he had had psoriasis vulgaris for eight years. At the time of disease onset， the patient went to a dermatologist where he was prescribed methotrexate. As the patient reported， he was in remission while using this drug. However， six years ago， he stopped taking the therapy and stopped going to regular checkups. With no therapy， the disease was active again. On admission， the physical examination revealed well-demarcated， non-coherent， silvery plaques overlying a glossy homogeneous erythema on extremities and trunk.\n\n【4】The patient also reported fever， fatigue and cough a few days before the admission. He was prescribed vitamins and antipyretic by his general practitioner， but he was not feeling better. On the day of the admission， he was examined in our hospital and the X-ray imaging revealed bilateral pneumonia. Inflammation markers were elevated (CRP 113 mg/L) and nasopharyngeal swab was taken for a PCR analysis to a SARS-CoV-2. As a part of the regular procedure for physical examination， oximetry was performed， and the patient's peripheral oxygen saturation was about 95%， so he was given oxygen support. During the hospital stay， he was prescribed therapy as per COVID-19 guidelines and it included intravenous antibiotics， probiotics， vitamins and low molecular weight heparin. The following morning， during the regular visiting round， it was observed that the patient wasn’t clinically and subjectively better， so it was decided to perform a CT scan of thorax. This diagnostic procedure confirmed bilateral interstitial pneumonia in progression with a CT severity score 17 out of 25. This score indicated that the pneumonia was severe and IL-6 blood analysis was done. Serum IL-6 was elevated (50.84 pg/mL)， so our anesthesiologist coordinator was consulted about the next step. The decision was made to administer tocilizumab i.v.(in recommended dose 8 mg/kg). Two days after the administration oftocilizumab， the patient was clinically and subjectively better， inflammation markers in laboratory analysis showed a drop while the psoriatic lesions were in retreat . The ongoing hospital stay was without complications and the patient's peripheral oxygen saturation was about 98% without oxygen support. Ten days later， the patient was discharged from the hospital. Written informed consent for this paper and clinical images was obtained from the above-mentioned patient.\n\n【5】Discussion\n\n【6】Biologics approved for psoriasis by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) includes： Etanercept， infliximab and adalimumab (all targeting TNF-a)， ustekinumab (targeting IL-12/IL-23 p40)， secukinumab， ixekizumab (targeting IL- 17A) and brodalumab (targeting IL-17A receptor) . It is known that psoriasis pathogenesis is linked to TNF-a， IL-23， and IL-17 signaling pathways， but there are some associations to IL-6， too . Serum levels of IL-6 are interpreted as a marker of the inflammatory activity in psoriasis as well as an indicator of treatment response . IL-6 is produced by a wide range of cell types in psoriatic plaques (including keratinocytes， fibroblasts， endothelial cells， DCs， and macrophages) in response to several stimuli， such as IL-1，TNF-a， IL-17 and IL-36 .\n\n【7】Tocilizumab is a humanized antihuman Interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor antibody. It is an approved biologic medication for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Several cases of tocilizumab induced psoriasis have been described do far. Studies about these unwanted events imply that approximately ten to fifteen days after the induction dose of tocilizumab， psoriatic plaques developed (skin biopsies confirmed diagnosis) . Tocilizumab-induced psorias is was suspected and the treatment was stopped while the psoriatic lesions resolved quickly with corticosteroids . One report showed that after the administration of intravenous tocilizumab， as a therapy for rheumatoid arthritis， psoriatic-like lesions developed (lesion biopsy was not performed because the patient's consent was not obtained)； however， on administration of subcutaneous tocilizumab on same patient， as higher doses of tocilizumab could be administered by subcutaneous injection rather than by intravenous injection， also shortening the dosing interval， psoriatic-like lesions improved .\n\n【8】On the other hand， there is a report about a young woman with juvenile idiopathic arthritis who was given etanercept but it induced psoriasiform skin lesions diagnosed by skin biopsy . Because of this adverse reaction to etanercept， intravenous tocilizumab was induced in the therapy and four weeks later， an improvement was observed in the skin lesions . Further， six months later， she was in clinical remission of JIA and the skin lesions had resolved .\n\n【9】Conclusion\n\n【10】So far， the experience with IL-6 inhibitors in psoriasis is limited， as other signaling pathways have been approved as therapeutic targets(etanercept， infliximab， adalimumab， ustekinumab， secukinumab， ixekizumab and brodalumab) . Some studies have demonstrated a high level of IL-6 in psoriatic plaques， therefore therapies that disrupt IL-6 signaling could be a treatment option for psoriasis.\n\n【11】We contacted our patient 10 days after discharging him from the hospital to inquire about his condition， and we were told that psoriasis was relapsed again . The patient was advised to visit the dermatologist to be prescribed the therapy he needed. Hopefully， the patient will start with biologics and will achieve remission.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 11:32:51", "endTime": "2024/09/24 11:33:13", "cost": 22.435}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:31", "update_time": "2024-09-23 19:33:11", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 19:32:49"}

However， unlike other solid organs such as kidneys and liver， only 15% to 25% oflungs from donors are transplanted . Therefore， Ex Vivo Lung Perfusion (EVLP) has become an essential tool to expand the number of lung donors in recent years.\n\n【2】Case Presentation\n\n【3】A 52-year-old male with a past medical history of depression and atrial fibrillation was offered as a potential Maastricht III donor. The patient had a P/F of 320 mmHg， normal bronchoscopy， and condensation on the Right Lower Lobe (RLL) on the X-ray and CT scan . Grafts were accepted for in situ evaluation. During the assessment， asystole was confirmed 45 min after withdrawal with a warm ischemic time of 30 min. After flushing and macroscopic inspection of the grafts， modest bilateral edema was discovered along with RLL atelectasis. Therefore， an Ex Vivo Evaluation (EVLP) was considered for a reconditioning and further evaluation of the organs. Miscommunication between the harvesting and implanting teams resulted in separate storage and transport of the. Nevertheless， EVLP evaluation was approved， and the organs were brought to the perfusion lab where additional table surgery was required. A 1/2，3/8-inch “y’connector with a piece of priming hues on the 1/2 end and a silk ligature around each dissected pulmonary artery was used to adapt the circulatory circuit . The same was done for the airway， a pace of hues with ventilator adapter in a 1/2 end of the y connector. While a silk ligature around the 3/8 end of the connector and the left main bronchus was enough to fitting and secure it ， an extra maneuver was required due to a size discrepancy of the main right bronchus. The short remaining trachea was split， and a supplementary pace of hues was placed over the 3/8 end to adapt the gauge . Thus， securing it with a tie was possible and final reassembly of the airway was accomplished. Extra silk sutures on the edge of the bronchus were placed and tied on the 1/2 end to prevent displacement during ventilation . After table surgery the organs were placed in the perfusion chamber  and modified ex-vivo Lund protocol was followed. During 90 min of perfusion， the lungs showed steady PA pressure， PVR， proper flow， substantial improvement of the atelectasis and edema， and compliance and reduction in peak pressure. PO2 after the evaluation was >450 mmHg.The lungs were accepted for transplant， then flushed and cold preserved to be implanted in a 64-year-old female with severe pulmonary fibrosis requiring a bilateral lobar transplant.\n\n【4】Unfortunately，aa problematicpostoperative duee to multiple complications， starting with a severe pulmonary graft dysfunction requiring postoperative ECMO overlapped with severe pancreatitis， followed by an untreatable hemolytic uremic syndrome， leads to a multiorgan failure and death 55 days after the transplant.\n\n【5】Discussion\n\n【6】Lung transplantation is an accepted modality of care for patients with end-stage lung diseases. However， as dedicated centers grapple with an ever-growing waiting list， graft shortage，approximately 10%to 13% oflung transplant candidates die waiting every year . Lung utilization rate is 15% to 20% from eligible multiorgan donors ， the lowest of solid organs. Some alternatives such as marginal donors， lobar transplantation ， living-related donors， Donation after Circulatory Death (DCD) donors， have been introduced to overcome this shortage. In addition， ex vivo lung perfusion is safe and effective alternative to solve donor shortage in lung transplantation.\n\n【7】Ex Vivo Lung Perfusion (EVLP) is an alternative to conventional approaches for donor lungassessment， reconditioning， and preservation in clinical lung transplantation. Allowing re-evaluation of questionable donor lungs before implantation and seizing the opportunity to repair injured donor lungs that are otherwise unsuitable for transplantation.\n\n【8】In our experience， EVLP has positively impacted our program， increasing the overall transplant activity by 14% from perfused organs with an additional 5% from lung donors assessed with EVLP intentions that are transplanted immediately. However， EVLP requires several technical considerations， such as long stems of PA and trachea for table surgery and organ emplacement. This case represents a typical challenge during clinical EVLP and a successful way to evaluate and yield a lung donor.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 11:36:35", "endTime": "2024/09/24 11:50:26", "cost": 831.336}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:31", "update_time": "2024-09-23 19:50:24", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 19:36:33"}

Different types of COVID-19 vaccine-associated kidney diseases have been reported mostly following mRNA vaccine. The underlying mechanism remains unclear. Recently we treated 3 patients who developed acute tubulointerstitial nephritis and membranous nephropathy following COVID-2019 inactivated vaccine. We wish to share with others these potentially rare conditions and offer our experience in treatment.\n\n【2】Keywords： Coronavirus disease 2019； Inactivated vaccine； Membranous nephropathy； Acute tubulointerstitial nephritis\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】To date， globally there are over 240 million confirmed cases of Coronavirus Disease 2019(COVID-19) and over 4.9 million related deaths . In face of this severe pandemic， active immunization becomes a major tool in the control of the COVID-19 pandemic . Since the first case of COVID-19 infection was reported in December 2019 ， 194 vaccines have gone through pre-clinical trials， and 128 vaccines are in clinical development stage worldwide . With the increase in the number of vaccinations， nearly all approved vaccine types have been implicated in kidney diseases. Most cases have been related to mRNA-based vaccines， and both glomerular diseases  and Acute Tubulointerstitial Nephritis (ATIN)  have been reported. Here， we report 3 patients who received inactivated virus vaccination and went on and developed de novo Membranous Nephropathy (MN) in one patient and ATIN in the other two patients.\n\n【5】Patient 1， a healthy 57-year-old woman， developed bilateral ankle edema the day after the first dose of inactivated COVID-19 vaccine. The edema resolved spontaneously within a few days， but reappeared after her second dose. On admission to the hospital， her sitting blood pressure was112/67 mm/Hg and serum creatinine was 37 umol/L， albumin was 28.5 g/L， Immunoglobulin (Ig) G was 6.3 g/L. The urinalysis showed microhematuria 1+ and 1.6 g of proteinuria in 24 h. Both her serum and kidney biopsy were positive for anti-Phospholipase A2 Receptor (PLA2R) antibody. The biopsy showed MN. The renal pathology was illustrated in Figure 1. Secondary causes of MN， including specific drugs， infections and malignancy were excluded. After 4 weeks treatment with losartan， the patient's edema resolved although the proteinuria remained the same.\n\n【6】Patient 2 was a 53-year-old woman with a history of glucose intolerance on no treatment. One week after the first vaccination， she developed symptoms of fatigue， chest tightness and palpitation. These symptoms persisted after the second jab. She also developed urine froth and nocturia. On hospital admission，her serum creatinine was 322 umol/L. The urine analysis was negative for blood and there was ±proteinuria. 24-h urine protein showed the presence of microalbumin at 69.9 mg. Total serum IgE was 2486 IU/ml. Two weeks after admission； the patient underwent a kidney biopsy. Her repeat serum creatinine was 357 umol/L. The result showed ATIN  with negative Immunofluorescent (IF) staining. She was commenced on prednisolone at 0.5 mg/kg (total 30 mg). Five weeks later， her serum creatinine fell to nearly normal.\n\n【7】Table 1： Case characteristics.\n\n|  | Age/Sex  | Past medicalhistory  | Vaccine type；manufacturer  | Days fromvaccination toonset  | Relapse after2nd dose， Ifgiven  | Presentation  | Kidney biopsy(Pathologydiagnoses)  | Treatment  | Outcome  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Patient 1  | 51/F  | Healthy  | Inactivatec COVID-19Vaccine， from Sinovac  | 1 day  | Y  | NS  | MN  | ARB (Losartan)  | PR  |\n| Patient 2  | 52/F  | Abnormalglucose tolerance  | Inactivated COVID-19Vaccine， from Sinovac  | 7 days  | Y  | AKI  | ATIN  | Cs (Prednisolone0.6mg/Kg)  | CR  |\n| Patient 3  | 37/F  | Hashimoto thyroiditis  | Inactivatec COVID-19 Vaccine， from Biokangtai  | 14 days  | N  | AKI  | ATIN  | Cs (Prednisolone1mg/Kg)  | CR  |\n\n【9】KB： Kidney Biopsy； MN： Membranous Nephropathy； ATIN： Acute Tubulointerstitial Nephritis； ARB： Angiotensin II Receptor Blocker； Cs： Corticosteroids； PR： Partial\n\n【10】Remission； CR：Complete Remission\n\n【11】Patient 3 was a 37-vear-old woman. She was admitted to our hospital following a week history of abdominal distension， acid reflux and bilateral loin pain after receiving inactivated COVID-19 vaccine. On admission， she was found to have a serum creatinine of 195umol/L with hematuria 2+and proteinuria 2+. The same patient was also found to have a mild thyroiditis on biochemical and immun ology assay and an anti-nuclear antibody ANA of 1 in 320. A kidney biopsy showed ATIN  with negative IF staining. She was treated with prednisolone at 1 mg/kg (55 mg in total) which was tapered off gradually. At her follow-up visit 3 months later，her serum creatinine had returned to near normal. The main characteristics and laboratory test results of the 3 patients are shown in Table.\n\n【12】Discussion\n\n【13】As the worldwide hospitalization rate and mortality rate are reduced through intensive and extensive vaccination On an international scale， the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines have drawn more public attention. Recently， there have been some reports about the development of de novo/relapse/worsening kidney diseases after COVID-19 vaccination. However， this is not the first-time vaccine has been implicated in kidney diseases. Influenza vaccine and tetanus-diphtheria-poliomyelitis vaccine  have been reported to induce Minimal Change Disease (MCD). One study found viral RNA in inactivated influenza vaccines that might have contributed to the development of Anti-Neutrophil Cytoplasmic Antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis . But the mechanism of these vaccine-associated diseases remains unclear.\n\n【14】Inactivated COVID-19 vaccines should be the safest  among all different vaccine types. Inactivated vaccines generally destroy the nucleic acid component of the virus rendering the virus non-infectious through physical or chemical methods. Therefore， only complete or partial virus particles with or without adjuvant are present in the vaccine. The immunogenic mechanism of inactivated vaccines depends on the stimulation of T helper type 1 (Th1)-based T-cell responses and production of Receptor-Binding Domain(RBD)-specific binding antibody and neutralization antibodies to provide protection . However， Th1 cells have also been described as the pathogenic subset that might contribute to the development of organ-specific autoimmune diseases .\n\n【15】None of the 3 patients reported here were known to have past history of kidney disease or autoimmune disease. There may be a causal relationship between the vaccine and patient 1’s MN， because of the temporal relationship between the onsets of the PLA2R associated membranous nephropathy. We hypothesize that certain component in the vaccine may trigger a loss of tolerance to the PLA2R antigen on the podocyte， which ultimately leads to de novo MN. Patient 2 and 3 appeared to have positive ANA which would suggest they might carry a predisposition to immune-mediated disease. The immune response caused by inactivated vaccine or adjuvant may induce the development of de novo ATIN in such highly sensitive patients. We speculate that some components of the inactivated COVID-19 vaccine might induce abnormal regulation of the immune system in susceptible individuals， and lead to these new-onset kidney diseases. However， further studies are needed to elucidate the exact mechanisms in these conditions.\n\n【16】After the initial therapies， all 3 patients developed symptomatic relief and a favorable outcome. We believe that the renal sequelas of the inactivated vaccines are limited， and our treatment may be used\n\n| Table 2： Laboratory finding on admission.  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Patient 1  | Patient 2  | Patient 3  | Reterence interval  |\n| Urinalysis  |  |  |  |  |\n| Gravity  | 1.024  | 1.01  | 1.008  | 1.030  |\n| Sugar (mmol/L)  | NG  | NG  | 28  | <2.8  |\n| Blood (ery/ul)  | 0.3  | 0.3  | 0.3  | <0.3  |\n| Protein(g/L)  | 3.5  | 0.3  | 0.3  | <0.1  |\n| TPU (g/d)  | 1.9  | 0.268  | 0.193  | <0.14  |\n| RBC-Sediment (/ul)  | 70  | 18  | 3  | 0-18  |\n| WBC-Sediment (/ul)  | 24  | 21  | 29  | 0-23  |\n| COND—Sediment (Ms/cm)  | 28  | 8  | 6  | 15.1-27  |\n| Cast- Sediment(/ul)  | 2.08  | 0.91  | 0.62  |.5  |\n| B-J protein  | NEG  | NEG  | NEG  | NEG  |\n| Blood chemistry tests  |  |  |  |  |\n| HGB(g/L)  | 141  | 96  | 105  | 115-148  |\n| WBC (10^9/L)  | 8.95  | 8.42  | 7.63  | 3.93  |\n| Eosinophils(%)  | 2.80%  | 3.20%  | 3.50%  | 6-Jan  |\n| Neutrophils(%)  | 60.10%  | 73%  | 65.60%  | 44-72  |\n| TP(g/L)  | 49.9  | 82.5  | 80.6  | 66-87  |\n| Alb (g/L)  | 28.6  | 40.5  | 40.8  | 35-52  |\n| UA (mmol/L)  | 212.4  | 314.1  | 199.1  | 142.2  |\n| Urea nitrogenfmmol/L)  | 3.6  | 13.6  | 5.4  | 2.07  |\n| Creatinine(mmol/L)  | 48  | 337  | 215  | 44-80  |\n| TC (mmol/L)  | 8.58  | 3.72  | 3.34  | <5.2  |\n| ALT(IU/L)  | 8.3  | 32  | 2.7  | 0-33  |\n| AST(IU/L)  | 14.6  | 25  | 13.9  | 0-32  |\n| CRP (mg/L)  | 0.35  | 27.3  | 25.58  | <5  |\n| ANA  | 1：100  | 1：320  | 1：320  | <1：100  |\n| Anti-GBM antibody  |  |  |  |  |\n| PR3-ANCA (RU/ml)  |  |  |  |  |\n| MPO-ANCA (RU/ml)  |  |  |  |  |\n| PLA2R antibody (RU/ml)  | 48.12  |  |  | <15  |\n| Total IgE (IU/mL)  | NA  | 2486  | NA  | 0-100  |\n| SARS-CoV-2-IgG (S-CO)  |  |  | ±  | 0-1  |\n| Kidney biopsy  | MN  | ATIN  | ATIN  |  |\n\n【18】TPU： Total Protein Urinary； WBC： White Blood Cell； HGB： Hemoglobin； B-J protein： Bence-Jones Protein；ANA： Anti-Nuclear Antibody； TC： Total Cholesterol； ALT Alanine Aminotransferase； AST： Aspartate Aminotransferase； CRP： C-Reactive Protein； TP： Total Protein； Alb： Albumin； GBM： Glomerular Basement Membrane PLA-2R： Anti-Phospholipase A2 Receptor Antibody； UA： Uric Acid； ANCA： Anti-Neutrophil Cytoplasmic Antibodies； MN： Membranous Nephropathy； ATIN： Acute\n\n【19】Tubulo-Interstitia as a reference for other physicians that may face similar situation.

Emergency coronary angiography excluded significant coronary artery obstruction and hence the tentative diagnosis of Myocardial Infarction with Non Obstructive Coronary Arteries (MINOCA) was made. The following diagnostic work-up highlights the importance of a standardized approach to patients with MINOCA.\n\n【2】Keywords： Chest pain； Acute coronary syndrome； Coronary angiography； MR sequences\n\n【3】Abbreviations\n\n【4】ECG： Electro Cardio Gram； IVS： Inter Ventricular Septum；IVUS： Intra Vascular Ultra Sound； LAD： Left Anterior Descending Artery；LVEDD： LV End Diastolic Diameter； MINOCA： Myocardial Infarction with Non Obstructive Coronary Arteries； MRI： Magnetic Resonance Imaging； OCT：Optical Coherence Tomography； RCA： Right Coronary Artery； STEMI： ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction\n\n【5】Learning Objectives\n\n【6】To understand the importance of a standardized approach to establish the diagnosis of MINOCA.\n\n【7】Tobe able to identify the different etiologies ofMINOCA and their respective management.\n\n【8】History of Presentation and Past Medical History\n\n【9】A 59-year-old female patient experienced a sudden episode of heavy chest pain after work， upon which she called the emergency ambulance service. Except for a history of cervical syndrome and chronic lower back pain， not requiring medication， the patient was previously fit and well. Upon arrival of the emergency physician a 12-channel ECG was recorded ， which showed atrial fibrillation with inferior and antero lateral ST-segment elevation (II， III， aVF & V4-V6) on top of hyper-acute T-waves in the antero lateral leads (V4-V6). Accordingly， the physician contacted our coronary care unit for emergency coronary catherization based on the tentative diagnosis of acute ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI). The patient was loaded with 250 mg of intravenous Acetylsalicylic Acid (ASA) and 60 mg of oral prasugrel. Additionally， 5000 IE of unfractionated heparin and 80 mg of atorvastatin were administered on site. The transport to our hospital byhelicopter was uneventful and according to protocol. The fulminant ST-segment changes in the initial ECG， however， were nolonger visible on follow-up ECG . Instead， inverted T-waves were recorded in leads V2-V5 without evidence of significant ischemia in the inferior leads.\n\n【10】Investigations\n\n【11】Emergency coronary angiography   revealed non-significant coronary artery disease with 20% proximal Right Coronary Artery (RCA)stenosis and 10% distal Left Anterior Descending (LAD) stenosis after the origin of the second diagonal branch. Hence， excluding a type I myocardial infarction. Left ventriculography was unremarkable with preserved ejection fraction and no signs ofregional wall motion abnormalities or a Takotsubo-like pattern.\n\n【12】The findings of left ventriculography were confirmed by transthoracic echocardiography， which showed a virtually normal echocardiogram. The thickness of the Intra Ventricular Septum (IVS) was measured at 11 mm alongside a regular Left Ventricular End Diastolic Diameter thesecond diagonal branch.

E and F) Left ventriculography -Regular left ventricular function without evidence of regional wall motion abnormalities (LVEDD=46 mm)]anddpreserved ejection fraction. The only pathological findings were a left ventricular diastolic relaxation abnormality (E/A=0.81，E/e'=9.67) and a slightly enlarged left atrium(Left atrium =40 mm). Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) revealed a structurally and functionally normal heart without evidence of fibrosis， edema or late gadolinium enhancement on T1- and T2-mapping. In-hospital ECG monitoring showed stable sinus rhythm without episodes of atrial or ventricular arrhythmias. The isolated episode of atrial fibrillation on admission had no recurrence and was hence interpreted within the scope of the acute myocardial event without a need for long-term oral anticoagulation. Ambulatory七twenty-four-hour electrocardiographic (Holter) monitoring confirmed normal sinus rhythm without any arrhythmic events.\n\n【13】Management\n\n【14】The case at hand presents a typical example of MINOCA of unclassified origin. Significant coronary artery disease was excluded by emergency coronary angiography and extended non-invasive cardiac work-up revealed no signs ofsignificant cardiac disease. While an additional in vasive diagnostic work up is sometimes warranted，it is not always feasible. Upon recognition of non-significant coronary artery disease further diagnostics， including coronary imaging and acetylcholine provocation testing for vasospastic angina， had to be delayed due to the arrival of another acute STEMI. Repeat coronary angiography was denied by the patient for now. Hence， potential differential diagnosis includes vasospastic angina， coronary artery dissection， plaque rupture/erosion or thromboembolism. Upon3-months follow-up the patient was fine and free of symptoms\n\n【15】Discussion\n\n【16】MINOCA is a growing entity in the differential diagnosis of acute chest pain. At present， it occurs in approximately 5% to 6%of cases with acute myocardial infarction . However， there is a large variability in its reported prevalence (up to 15% in selected studies)， which may be attributed to the lack of a universal definition of the disease. The introduction of the Fourth Universal Definition of myocardial infarction finally offered specific diagnostic criteria for MINOCA， which were revisited by a scientific statement paper from the American Heart Association (AHA) in 2019 . The three key diagnostic criteria for MINOCA include the presence of acute myocardial infarction (a rise and fall pattern of troponin and clinical evidence of ischemia)， non obstructive coronary arteries (including moderate coronary atherosclerotic stenosis of up to 50%) and the absence of an alternate diagnosis for the clinical presentation， such as sepsis， pulmonary embolism or myocarditis .\n\n【17】Coronary angiography is the main diagnostic tool in the initial workup of patients with chest pain and myocardial infarction. After exclusion of significant coronary artery stenosis， coronary vascular imaging and coronary function assessment should be performed. Intra Vascular Ultra Sound (IVUS) and Optical Coherence Tomography(OCT) allow visualization of plaque disruption， coronary thrombi or emboli and coronary artery dissection. Provocation testing with intracoronary acetylcholine may help to facilitate the diagnosis of coronary vasospasm . While an acceptable level of safety has been reported recently for provocativetesting，significant arrhythmicevents occur in up to 6% of cases (including 3% ventricular arrhythmias) . If coronary angiography remains inconclusive， left ventriculography should be performed to assess left ventricular function and look for wall motion abnormalities，resembling Takotsubo Syndrome or other cardiomyopathies .\n\n【18】The following non-invasive diagnostic work-up should include echo cardio graphic assessment as well as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) in most cases.

Although Thyroglobulin (TG) is rarely expressed in MTC， our previous studies found that there was a certain percentage of TG-positive MTC in clinical practice. We hereby aimed to explore the clinicopathological features of MT'C cases with positive expression of TG.\n\n【2】Methods： We conducted a retrospective study from June 2006 to October 2017. All the recruited cases were divided into two groups： TG-positive group and TG-negative group. Demographics， clinical profiles and pathological details were reviewed and following immunohistochemical analyses were conducted for recruited cases.\n\n【3】Results： Of All patients included， 25 were female and 25 were male， with a medium age of 46.7 years old. The proportion of cases with a tumor mass smaller than 1 cm in diameter in the TG-positive group was significantly higher than that in the TG-negative group (46.15% / vs. 5.56%/， P=0.001). The proportion of clinical stage I and stage II MTC cases in the TG-positive group was significantly higher than that in the TG-negative group (53.85% / vs. 11.11%/，P=0.001). In addition， the number of patients with lymph node metastases in the TG-positive group was significantly smaller than that in the TG-negative group (P=0.016). And the TG-positive group had a lower rate of calcium salt deposition than the TG-negative group (7.14%/ vs. 36.11%/， P=0.045). The TG-positive groups had also lower rate of tumors with Amyloid deposits than the TG-negative group (50% / vs. 83.3% /，P=0.016). Immunohistochemical tests showed that TG-positive cells were not only limited to the follicular structures， but also expressed in non-follicular structures such as nests， cords and sheet structures. TG-positive cells showed partially synchronous immune response to CT， CgA， Syn and CEA， which could be differentiated from mixed medullary follicular carcinoma， suggesting that TG positive cells are not the remnants of the thyroid follicular cells. MTC cells showed the ability to express TG and CT， CgA， Syn， CEA simultaneously.\n\n【4】Conclusion： TG-positive MTC cases had significantly smaller size of tumor， lower rate of lymph node metastasis， earlier clinical stages， and better prognosis than TG-negative MTC cases in this study.\n\n【5】Keywords： Medullary thyroid carcinoma； Thyroglobulin； CT； CEA； CgA；Syn\n\n【6】Introduction\n\n【7】Medullary Thyroid Cancer (MTC) is the third most common thyroid malignancy. It is an independent clinicopathologic entity， with unique incident rate and specialized methods for diagnosis and treatment. It originates from the parafollicular or Calcitonin-producing cells (Ccells) and maintains the features ofthese cells . Computed tomography assay is of great significance to the diagnosis of thyroid myelin cancer. However， pathological diagnosis is currently considered to be the gold standard for the diagnosis ofthyroid myelin-like cancer， and with the popularization and application of new molecular detection techniques in pathological practice， pathological diagnosis has developed into the era of organic combination of morphological diagnosis and molecular pathology diagnosis . Thyroglobulin (TG) has been used as a marker for thyroid carcinoma for many years due to its high sensitivity and specificity to different thyroid carcinomas. TG is expressed in more than 95% of papillary and follicular carcinomas， but usually reduced in poorly differentiated carcinoma and absent in anaplastic carcinoma . Hales et al discovered TG-positive immunoreaction in MTC that does not produce TG normally. Scholars had different interpretations on it， but the biological significance ofthe TG in MTC is rarely discussed. There was a report that conducted clinicopathological and prognostic analysis of the MTC with immunoreaction to TG in China ， but it was speculated that the TG-positive cells were in the remnants of thyroid follicular cells or the atypical follicular carcinoma .\n\n【8】In this study， TG-positive cells were not only limited to the follicular structures， but also present in non-follicular structures such as nested， bundle-like and fluke structures as well. Thus， we compared similarities and differences of clinical， histological and immunohistochemical features between the TG-positive and the TG-negative MTC groups， and then discussed possible clinical treatments and prognosis.\n\n【9】Patients and Methods\n\n【10】Patients\n\n【11】A total of 210 cases of MTC were surgically and pathologically diagnosed in Zhejiang Cancer Hospital from June 2006 to October2017， from which only 50 cases were included in the retrospective statistical analyses，excluding 160 cases that do not meet the diagnostic criteria .\n\n【12】The inclusion criteria were as follows：  WHO performance status of I to II；  serum calcitonin (CT) level ≥ 500 pg/Ml；  Pathological diagnosis met MTC standards；  The patient had a serum TG test. The exclusion criteria were as follows：  There was no pathological tissue examination or the clinical data were incomplete； the patient had significant cardiac， hematopoietic， hepatic， or renal dysfunction or received chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy within 4 weeks before random assignment.\n\n【13】All patients provided written informed consents. This study protocol was consistent with the ethical guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Institution of Anji Hospital， Zhejiang University (IRB number： 2018AN0381).\n\n【14】Demographics， levels of serum CT， TG and other biomedical indicators， pathological diagnostics and clinical data of all the recruited patients were collected. The clinical manifestations， TNM stages ， pathological characteristics and prognosis were summarized. Pathological analysis was carried out by Hematoxylin-Eosin (HE) pathological staining and immunologic tissue chemistry.\n\n【15】Immunohistochemistry\n\n【16】Formalin-Fixed d Paraffin-Embeddedd(FFPE)tissie sections were stained with HE for histologic examination. Immunostaining was performed to the FFPE sections using antibodies against thyroglobulin (TG， 1：600， DAKO)， Calcitonin (CT， 1：150， DAKO)， Chromogranin A (CgA， 1：600， DAKO)， Synaptophysin (Syn， 1：150， DAKO)， Thyroid Transcription Factor-1(TTF-1， 1：1500， DAKO)， Ki-67(1：1000， DAKO) and Carcinoembryonic Antigen (CEA，1：600， DAKO) using an indirect immunoperoxidase technique. All antibodies were from DAKO (Denmark). For antibody staining， sections were heated for antigen retrieval for 5 min at 120°C in 0.01M citrate buffer pH 9.0. The immunohistochemical method was an indirect method for peroxidase labeling. The positive staining of TG， CT， CgA and Syn was localized in the cytoplasm， the positive staining of CEA was located in the capsule， and the positive staining of TTF-land Ki-67 was located in the nucleus. Brown indicated positive， while no staining indicated negative.\n\n【17】Statistical methods\n\n【18】Values are presented as Mean ± SEM. Statistical analyses were conducted using Graph Prism software (SAS Institute). Statistical comparisons between groups were analyzed for significance by two-tailed t test or one-way ANOVA with Chi-square test. Results were considered significant at P values of <0.05.\n\n【19】Results\n\n【20】Baseline demographics， tumor featuresSand clinical features\n\n【21】A total of 50 patients were included， among which were 25females and 25 males， with a mean age at 50.5 years. The TG-positive group (10 females and 4 males) accounted for 71.43%，and the TG-negative group (15 females and 21 males) accounted for41.67%. The medium age of TG-positive group was 52 years， while the medium age of the TG-negative group was 48 years. However， there was no statistical significance between two groups in gender or age. Among all cases， 8 had a tumor smaller than 1 cm in diameter，41 larger than 1 cm in diameter， and 1 with unknown tumor size. Among cases with a tumor smaller than 1 cm， 6 were TG-positive， accounting for 46.15% of all TG-positive cases， and only 2 were TG negative， accounting for 5.56% of all TG-negative cases (P=0.001). Among all cases， 11 were diagnosed with Stage I or II MTC， and38 with Stage III or higher. Among all Stage I and II MTC cases， 7were TG-positive， accounting for 53.8% of 13 TG-positive cases， and4 were TG-negative， accounting for only 11.1% of all TG-negative cases (P=0.001). The results showed significant differences between the TG-positive and the TG-negative groups in tumor size and MTC staging. However， there was no significant difference between the two groups in mass number， the range of the affected thyroid gland and the level of calcitonin .\n\n【22】Pathologic characteristics between the TG-positive and the TG-negative groups\n\n【23】The pathological diagnosis of MTC remains the gold standard. The structure of MTC was diverse， with both groups showing follicular， adenoid， nested， organoid， island， trabecular， bundle-like， and fluke structures. The Amyloid deposits and neuroendocrine-type tumors are major characteristics of MTC .\n\n【24】In this study， 50% of the TG-positive cases had Amyloid deposits in tumor tissues， compared to 83.33% in the TG-negative group(P=0.016). The neuroendocrine tumor structure was present in not only limited to the follicular structures， but also present in non-follicular structures such as nested， bundle-like and fluke structures.\n\n【25】Table 1： Comparison of clinical features of TG-pasitive MTC and TG-negative 78.57% and 88.89% of the TG-positive group and the TG-negative group， respectively. And calcium salt deposition was less merged in the carcinoma tissue of the TG-positive group than of the TG-negative group (7.14% vs. 36.11%， P=0.041). In addition， the rate of lymph node metastasis in the TG-positive group was significantly lower than that in the TG-negative group (50% vs. 83.3%， P=0.016). The proportion of the thyroid capsule invasion and internal dissemination ofthyroid was lower in the TG-positive group， but there was no statistical significance (0% vs. 19.44%， P=0.070). Furthermore， both groups showed similar characteristics of the vascular tumor thrombus (14.29% vs. 16.67%，P=0.837)， nerve invasion (14.29% vs.11.11%，P=0.756)， distant metastasis (0% vs. 2.78%， P=0.529)， cancer nodule (28.58% vs. 30.56%， P=0.891)， nodular goiter (64.29% Vs.36.11%，P=0.072)， follicular structure (85.72% vs. 77.781%，P=0.529)， neuroendocrine tumor structure (78.57% vs. 88.89%， P=0.345) and cell morphology (78.57% vs. 91.67%，P=0.200).\n\n| Total  | TG+(n=14)  | TG-(n=36)  | X  | P  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Sex  |  |  |  |  |\n| M  | 4  | 21  | 3.571  | 0.06  |\n| F  | 10  | 15  | 3.571  | 0.06  |\n| Age  |  |  |  |  |\n| >50  | 8  | 17  | 0.397  | 0.53  |\n| ≤50  | 6  | 19  | 0.397  | 0.53  |\n| Tumor size  |  |  |  |  |\n| ≤1cm  | 6  | 2  | 11.52  | 0  |\n| >1cm  | 7  | 34  | 11.52  | 0  |\n| The range of thyroid tissue involvement  |  |  |  |  |\n| Unilateral  | 13  | 25  | 3.029  | 0.08  |\n| Bilateral  | 1  | 11  | 3.029  | 0.08  |\n| Mass number  |  |  |  |  |\n| 1  | 10  | 22  | 1.054  | 0.31  |\n| >1  | 3  | 14  | 1.054  | 0.31  |\n| Calcitonin level  |  |  |  |  |\n| >2000  | 1  | 11  | 1.419  | 0.23  |\n| <2000  | 6 (7 untested)  | 18 (7 untested)  | 1.419  | 0.23  |\n| Clinical stage  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | 7  | 4  | 10.02  | 0  |\n| >Ⅱ  | 6  | 32  | 10.02  | 0  |\n| In 14 cases of TG-positive MTC， the tumor size and mass number was unknownin 1 case， so the clinical level also lack for that case  |  |  |  |  |\n\n【27】Immunohistochemical tests showed that TG positive cells were\n\n【28】Table 2： Comparison of histalogical characteristics of TG-pasitive MTC and TG-negative MTC.\n\n|  | TG+(n=14)  | TG-(n=36)  |  | P  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Follicular structure  |  |  |  |  |\n| Yes  | 12  | 28  | 0.397  | 0.529  |\n| No  | 2  | 8  | 0.397  | 0.529  |\n| Neuroendocrine tumor structure  |  |  |  |  |\n| Yes  | 11  | 32  | 0.891  | 0.345  |\n| No  | 3  | 4  | 0.891  | 0.345  |\n| Cell morphological characteristics  |  |  |  |  |\n| Mainly polygonal cells  | 11  | 33  | 1.637  | 0.2  |\n| Mainly spindle cells  | 3  | 3  | 1.637  | 0.2  |\n| Amyloid substance  |  |  |  |  |\n| Yes  | 7  | 30  | 5.821  | 0.016  |\n| No  |  | 6  | 5.821  | 0.016  |\n| Calcium salt deposition  |  |  |  |  |\n| Yes  | 1  | 13  | 4.196  | 0.041  |\n| No  | 13  | 23  | 4.196  | 0.041  |\n| Nodular goiter  |  |  |  |  |\n| Yes  | 9  | 13  | 3.247  | 0.072  |\n| No  | 5  | 23  | 3.247  | 0.072  |\n| Thyroid capsular invasion  |  |  |  |  |\n| Yes  | 5  | 20  | 1.587  | 0.207  |\n| No  | 9  | 16  | 1.587  | 0.207  |\n| Internal disseminatian of thyroid  |  |  |  |  |\n| Yes  | 0  | 7  | 3.165  | 0.07  |\n| No  | 14  | 29  | 3.165  | 0.07  |\n| Vascular tumor thrombus  |  |  |  |  |\n| Yes  | 2  | 6  | 0.043  | 0.837  |\n| No  | 12  | 30  | 0.043  | 0.837  |\n| Nerve invasion  |  |  |  |  |\n| Yes  | 2  | 4  | 0.096  | 0.756  |\n| No  | 12  | 32  | 0.096  | 0.756  |\n| Cancer nodule  |  |  |  |  |\n| Yes  | 4  | 11  | 0.019  | 0.891  |\n| No  | 10  | 25  | 0.019  | 0.891  |\n| Lymph node metastasis  |  |  |  |  |\n| Yes  | 7  | 30  | 5.821  | 0.016  |\n| No  | 7  | 6  | 5.821  | 0.016  |\n| Distant metastasis  |  |  |  |  |\n| Yes  | 0  | 1  | 0.397  | 0.529  |\n|  |  |  | 0.397  | 0.529  |\n\n【30】They revealed partially synchronous immune response to TG as well as to CT， CgA， Syn and CEA. Compared with the TG-negative group， the rate of positive Ki-67(>1%) in the TG-positive group was lower (60% vs. 82.35%) .\n\n【31】TG was negative expression in MTC (x100).\n\n【32】There was no significant difference in the positive rate of CT， CgA， Syn， CEA and TTF-1 between the two groups .\n\n【33】Prognostic analysis\n\n【34】Follow-up was ended on 60 months. The mean follow-up was52 months (range： 48 to 60 months). During the follow-up， there was only one case of death in each group. One of the patients from the TG-positive group died of tumor recurrence 3 years after the operation， whereas one of the patients from the TG-negative group died of bone metastases 5 years after the operation. There was no significant difference in survival rate between two groups.\n\n【35】Discussion\n\n【36】Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma (MTC) is a malignant tumor with neuroendocrine characteristics， categorized as an APUD system tumor.Although accounting for about 4% to 10% ofall thyroid cancer incidences， MTC is responsible for about 13.4% of all the thyroid cancer-related deaths . Therefore， it is necessary to develop a more specialized and sensitive prognosis metric for MTC in clinical practice.\n\n【37】MTC can synthesize and secrete CT， CgA， Syn， CEA and so on. TG is a protein precursor of triiodothyronine and thyroxine， and is produced exclusively by thyroid follicular cells， both benign and malignant. There were a few researchers proposed that TG， as a mature product of terminal secretion appeared in MTC， suggests low malignancy and slow invasion behavior of the tumor， TG-positive MTC has a better prognosis than TG-negative MTC . However， the study on expression of TG in MTC is rarely reported worldwide.\n\n【38】Table 3： Comparison of immunohistochemistry of TG-pasitive MTC and TG-negative MTC.\n\n|  | TG+MTC (n=14)  | TG-MTC (n=36)  | X  | P  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| CT  |  |  |  |  |\n| Pasitive  | 13  | 35  | 2.55  | 0.11  |\n| Negative  | 1  | 0 (1 untested)  | 2.55  | 0.11  |\n| CgA  |  |  |  |  |\n| Pasitive  | 13  | 36  |  |  |\n| Negative  | 0 (1 untested)  | 0  |  |  |\n| Syn  |  |  |  |  |\n| Pasitive  | 12  | 33  |  |  |\n| Negative  | 0 (2 untested)  | 0 (3 untested)  |  |  |\n| CEA  |  |  |  |  |\n| Pasitive  | 8  | 25  | 0.66  | 0.42  |\n| Negative  | 1 (5 untested)  | 1(10 untested)  | 0.66  | 0.42  |\n| TTF1  |  |  |  |  |\n| Pasitive  | 12  | 28  | 0.01  | 0.94  |\n| Negative  | 2  | 5 (3 untested)  | 0.01  | 0.94  |\n| Ki-67  |  |  |  |  |\n| ≤1%  | 2  | 3  | 1.1  | 0.29  |\n| >1%  | 3 (9 untested)  | 14(19 untested)  | 1.1  | 0.29  |\n\n【40】This study retrospectively analyzed 50 MTC cases with TG tested， in order to further understand characteristics and biological significance of TG-positive MTC， and to speculate that whether TG could be used as an indicator of the prognosis for MTC.\n\n【41】In this study， we found that there were more females than males in 14 cases of TG-positive MTC， and the average age of onset was 46.7 years old， which is in agreement with the Tumors of Endocrine Organs， 2006 WHO in which the average age of onset of sporadic cases was 50 years old， with slightly higher incidence in females. We also found， 46.15% of cases in the TG-positive group have a tumor smaller than 1 cm in diameter， much higher than 5.56% in the TG-negative group. The number of cases with a tumor size more than 1cm was 0 in TG-positive MTC group and 7 in the TG-negative group. It is widely believed that the survival time of the MTC patients is shorter and the prognosis is poor when the tumor is larger than 4 cm in diameter. The proportion of late stage MTC (stage III or higher) in the TG-positive group was lower than that in the TG-negative group (46.15% vs. 88.89%， P=0.001)， which may indicate that TG positive MTC has better prognosis. According to some reports ， both a primary tumor diameter more than 4 cm and thyroid capsular invasion， which are both indicators of Stage III MTC， have an effect on the prognosis of MTC patients.\n\n【42】Pathological diagnosis is the gold standard. Microscopically， the tissues of the MTC are mainly composed of polygonal cells and spindle cells. The typical medullary carcinoma can be either well-defined or directly infiltrating the surrounding thyroid tissue. Nested， bundle-like and fluke structures can be found arranged in the tumor . There are more or less fibrous septums full of vessels between tumor cell nests. Amyloid structure can be found in the intercellular space of the tumor and interstitial cells， which is composed of eosinophilic and amorphous substance produced by cancer cells through a variety of methods. In this study， the rate of the Amyloid substance deposition in tumor of the TG-positive group was significantly lower than that of the TG-negative group(50% vs. 83.33%， P=0.001). According to the histological structure， MTC can be divided into several histological types， which are often mixed. The diagnosis of MTC is mainly according to a variety of permutations composed of spindle cells and epithelioid cells， and combined with immunohistochemical expression of CT， CgA， Syn， CEAandTTF-1.Both TG-positive MTC and TG-negative MTC have a variety of structures： follicular structures also appear in the fluke type； glandular-like and follicular-like structures are mixed in nesting type； most of them have neuroendocrine structures. The proportion of follicular structures in two groups was similar， which indicates that the tumor cells of follicular structure may not necessarily express TG. The TG-positive cells are not necessarily the remaining thyroid follicular cells or the atypical follicular carcinoma.\n\n【43】Xu Lai et al. reported that the 15-year survival rate of MTC with nodular goiter was significantly higher than that of MTC without nodular goiter， indicating that the prognosis of MTC with nodular goiter was excellent . The proportion of nodular goiter in the TG-positive group was higher than that of the TG-negative group (64.3%vs.36.1%)， although there was no statistical difference， which could be due to small sample size and insufficient follow-up time in this study. The main route of MTC metastasis is regionallymph node metastasis. With the increase of tumor volume，the rate oflymph node metastasis is increased gradually. The most common sites of metastasis are tracheoesophageal groove lymph nodes and cervical lymph nodes， followed by upper mediastinal lymph nodes. Research showed that cervical lymph node metastasis is an important prognostic factor for MTC . However， a multifactor analysis revealed that cervical lymph node metastasis might not be an independent risk factor for prognosis.\n\n【44】The rate of lymph node metastasis in the TG-positive group was significantly lower than that in the TG-negative group (50% vs. 83.33%， P=0.016). One patient in the TG-positive group and5 patients in the TG-negative group had upper mediastinal lymph node metastases. Upper mediastinal lymph node metastasis is a characteristic of MTC. The upper mediastinal lymph node metastasis may spread from VI region lymph nodes along recurrent laryngeal nerve or from the pretracheal or paratracheal lymph nodes through lymph circulation. And the upper mediastinal lymph node metastasis may be an important cause of lung metastasis. No pulmonary metastases were found in patients of the two groups in this study.\n\n【45】The invasion of the thyroid capsular and vessel is related to a decreased survival rate of MTC patients. The TG-positive group had lower rate of capsular invasion (35.71% vs. 55.56%) and vascular invasion (14.29% vs. 16.67%) than the TG-negative group， but there was no significant difference. Tumor with vascular invasion is prone to distant metastasis. The most common distant metastatic sites are lung，liver， bone and brain. In this study， one case ofthe TG-negative group had lumbar and sacral metastases， but no distant metastases were found in the TG-positive group.\n\n【46】In the present， most of studies on MTC refer to CT and CEA， including serum level and immunohistochemical expression in tissue cells. Calcitonin is a sensitive and specific marker of MTC，and it is also an important indicator for preoperative diagnosis and postoperative follow-up. The high level of serum CEA>50% is reported to be high level in serum. The expression level of CEA is synchronous with CT. Previous study discovered that the combination of CT and CEA could increase the diagnostic sensitivity of MTC to 95.7% . There are lot similarities between MTC and other thyroid tumors in the morphological characteristics； therefore， the diagnosis of medullary cancer by optical microscopy alone has certain risks and limitations. Immunohistochemical stainingis an important means of examination for auxiliary diagnosis. The commonly used markers include CT， CEA， CgA， Syn and TTF-1. A large majority of MTC tumor cells express CT. In this study， almost all cases of MTC expressed CT， except for one TG-positive case that was CT-negative， and one TG-negative case whose CT was unmeasured. In the TG-positive group， CT was mostly weakly or partially positive； indicating that CT may also be an important indicator of MTC prognosis， which supported the findings of our previous article in 2017， but the prognosis in MTC was still unclear . In this study， except for one CEA-negative case in each group， all other cases were positive for CEA. Positive immunoreactions to several neuroendocrine substances including CgA and Syn were detected in both TG-positive and TG-negative groups， which confirmed that MTC is endocrine-derived.\n\n【47】TTF-1 can be used as a marker of thyroid neuroendocrine carcinomas， such as medullary carcinoma. In this study， 2 cases in the TG-positive group and 5 cases in the TG-negative group showed negative results for TTF-1 staining， whereas the other cases were positive for TTF-1. TTF-1 was a more sensitive marker of thyroid carcinoma than other markers . It is expressed in more than 90% of thyroid carcinomas， with the exception of anaplastic carcinoma in which its sensitivity is close to zero.\n\n【48】Few studies have focused on the expression of TG in MTC. Hales et al.， for the first time， proposed that TG is expressed in the MTC. Some researchers had conducted clinicopathological and prognostic analysis of MTC and found immunoreaction to TG ， which is consistent with the findings in this study that immunohistochemical TG-positive cells was not only limited to the follicular structures， but also present in non-follicular structures such as nested， bundle-like and fluke structures， with partially synchronous immune response to CT， CgA， Syn and CEA as well， whereas the normal thyroid tissue wrapped around MTC did not show corresponding positive reactions.\n\n【49】MTC often invades the surrounding tissues and causes lymph node metastases. Therefore， early operation is the key to the treatment. Other therapeutic options including different extent of thyroidectomy， radiotherapy and chemotherapy schemes ； however， few of them are effective in curing MTC. In recent years， great progress has been made in molecular targeted therapy. The 5years survival rate of MTC is about 60% to 75%； with early diagnosis and standardized treatment， the survival rate can reach 90%. This study found that， compared with TG-negative MTC， TG-positive MTC was significantly smaller in tumor size， had a lower rate of lymph node metastasis， and was inclined to be categorized into earlier clinical stages， which indicated better prognosis. There was one death 3 years after operation in the TG-positive group and one death five years after operation in the TG-negative group. There was no significant difference between two groups in survival rate， which may be due to the limited follow-up time. From our study， it can be speculated that TG can be an indicator of the prognosis of MTCand provide a theoretical basis for molecular targeted therapy.\n\n【50】There are some limitations in our study， including the limited number ofpatients and region， which cannot represent all MT'C cases globally. Furthermore， only a few patients got genetic tests due to financial limitations， so we did not carry out the analysis of molecular genetic characteristics. Nevertheless， so far there has been a very limited research on TG expression in MTC. This studyretrospectively analyzed a number of MTC cases with TG expression and found a relationship between pathological morphological characteristics and clinical prognosis of TG-positive and TG-negative MTC. Further studies with larger sample size and extended follow-up time combined with molecular biology indicators are required in the future to fully understand the biological significance of TG expression in MTC，and improve prognosis and clinical evaluation of treatment of MTC.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 11:24:48", "endTime": "2024/09/24 11:25:45", "cost": 57.221}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:30", "update_time": "2024-09-23 19:25:45", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 19:24:48"}

The ulcer started as a nodule which ruptured and formed an ulcer. The latter enlarged gradually with mild pain and occasional foul-smelling discharge. We prepared him for excision biopsy and split thickness skin grafting. The histology result showed squamous cell carcinoma. The photomicrograph is shown on figure two.\n\n【2】Aim： To show that skin cancers may be occurring in younger people in recent years.\n\n【3】Keywords： Albino； Skin cancer； Solar damage\n\n【4】Introduction\n\n【5】Albinism is an autosomal recessive condition that results in inadequate or absence of melanin in the skin and other tissues. The melanocytes， the cells that produce melanin， though present， fail to produce the pigment because an enzyme， tyrosinase， is either absent or does not produce enough melanin. Therefore， there is variable absence of melanin depending on the degree of activity of the enzyme. Besides， focal failure of the enzyme in different parts of the body gives rise to conditions such as ocular albinism or isolated absence of melanin in the hair or any other part of the body.\n\n【6】The main culprit in the aetiology of skin cancers is ultraviolet radiation . On the electromagnetic spectrum the ultraviolet radiation occupies the wave lengths between 400 nm and200 nm， 400 nm to 700 nm being the visible spectrum. Ultraviolet radiation- A， B and C presently have health significance. Ultraviolet radiation A was initially thought to affect mainly the aging process by causing wrinkles but it has recently been implicated as a cofactor to UVB . The latter is known to cause most of the skin cancers because it gets to the earth in significant amounts Ultraviolet radiation C does not get to the earth in significant amounts because the ozone layer filters it out. However， production of fluorocarbons by human activity is making the ozone layer thinner and this will make UVC to steadily increase its appearance on the earth. It has been shown that the shorter the wavelength of ultraviolet radiation， the more the carcinogenic effect on the skin. Therefore UVC， having the shortest wave length among the ultraviolet rays， will cause more skin cancers if it gets to the earth in significant amount. Carcinogenicity of UV radiation is caused by mutation on the DNA . Photochemical damage by UV radiation is repaired by P gene products and the repair mechanism is impaired with aging giving rise to skin cancers .\n\n【7】Case History\n\n【8】This is the case of a thirteen-year-old male albino who presented to us with a scalp ulcer of one-year duration. The ulcer started as a nodule which continued to increase in size and ruptured spontaneously to discharge a foul-smelling fluid. There was mild continuous pain and occasional fever. Dressing of the ulcer with honey and administration of tablets purchased over the counter did not heal it. Neither the patient nor his parents had education on sun protection for albinos .\n\n【9】On examination the patient was chronically ill looking， mildly pale， anicteric and afebrile. The vital signs were a temperature of 36.8C， pulse rate of 86 beats/minute and respiratory rate of 20cycles/minute. There was extensive solar keratosis over the head， neck and upper limbs. The trunk and lower limbs had fewer solar keratosis. A fungating ulcer that measured 6 cm by 6 cm was located on the scalp，superior and lateral to the right ear. The posterior auricular， occipital， submandibular， submental and cervical lymph nodes were not palpable. The other regions of the body were grossly normal. We made a clinical diagnosis of basal cell carcinoma. The investigations done and their results were packed cell volume (32%)， urine analysis was normal. Excision biopsy of the lesion was done and the histology result was squamous cell carcinoma .\n\n【10】Discussion\n\n【11】Our index patient is 13 years old and presented one year after the lesion started. Therefore， the cancer started at twelve years of age. This is an early age for albinos to develop skin cancer even in our tropical climate where the full impact of the sun is felt. It is believed that although a lot of the damage is done in childhood， skin cancers develop later in life. Indeed， one source quotes fifty percent of skin damage to have occurred at 15 years . There is increase in the global incidence of skin cancers and now we are beginning to see these cancers in younger age groups. Therefore， the question to be answered by research is whether more UV radiation， especially UVC， is reaching the earth due to human activity. A retrospective study of skin cancers in our hospital for the last two decades will show the age profile the patients and younger people may be having skin cancers. However， the records of patients in the last 20 years are unreliable in our hospital. Most of the skin cancers are cause by UVB but UVC is known to be more carcinogenic if significant amount of the latter gets to the earth.\n\n【12】The finding of squamous cell carcinoma in our patient is not surprising because Asuquo et al. have shown that skin cancers in albinos in our community are more commonly squamous cell carcinoma and not basal cell carcinoma as seen in Caucasians .\n\n【13】The management of skin cancers in our community is a challenge for many reasons namely ignorance， late presentation， and poverty. Ignorance and late presentation can be addressed by education of the people on radio， television and health talk in different institutions. Albino parents and the affected children， when they are old enough to understand， should cover the body with the right color that does not absorb UV radiation (e.g. white)， use a hat with a wide brim or umbrella in the sun， do outdoor activities when UV radiation is least(between 6 am and 10 am and after 4 pm)， use sunscreen with a sun protection factor of 15 and report early to hospital for treatment of solar keratosis and ulcers . The government should treat skin lesions in albinos free or give a substantial waiver for the treatment.\n\n【14】Conclusion\n\n【15】Skin lesions in albinos are curable if presentation is early. The government and health care workers should do everything possible to help this socially stigmatized group of people in Africa.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 10:57:26", "endTime": "2024/09/24 10:58:02", "cost": 36.279}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:30", "update_time": "2024-09-23 18:58:00", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 18:57:24"}

Thelong-term goal is restoration of function but in the short-term we often focus on obtaining adequate soft tissue coverage.\n\n【2】These injuries， when untreated or poorly managed， lead to sequela and limitations that are often irreparable， causing great harm to the economicaly active population.\n\n【3】There are many techniques described in the literature for wound coverage and normally， the most common options are free flaps， skin grafts， Vacuum-Assisted Closure (VAC) dressings and“second intention healing\". Different factors must be considered when choosing one surgical technique over another， especially the pattern of lesion， patient， surgeon and institution. However， many techniques are not reproducible in other locations due to the cost and population type.\n\n【4】On our case report， we describe a fairly cheap and effective treatment used on a patient with a severe soft tissue injury on the dorsum ofthe foot.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】In January 2022，21 years-old male was involved in a motorcycle accident with an important soft tissue injury on the dorsum of the left foot， associated with an open dislocation of the Chopart(midtarsal) joint. He was first treated at another institution to approach the open dislocation 14 days before admission in our institution.\n\n【7】At our facility we observed a 14 cm × 8 cm wound covered by dry necrosis and important exsudate， in addition to medial and plantar wounds， sutured in the previous hospital . After the X-ray trauma series for foot and ankle， we identified a remaining dislocation of the midtarsal joint which was confirmed with a CT scan. Urgent surgical treatment was performed on the same day in order to restore articular congruence.\n\n【8】Due to the severity of the soft tissue lesion， a closed reduction of the Chopart articulation was performed and fixed with two 1.5 mm Kirschner wires in talonavicular joint and one 1.5 mm Kirschner wire in calcaneocuboid joint. In addition to the bone procedure， we surgically debrided and washed the wound with 6 liters of 0.9% saline solution. The vast soft tissue loss didn't allow for primary wound suture and we chose to close the injury with a sterile polyethylene prosthesis . Patient remained hospitalized for 5 days to monitor wound healing.\n\n【9】Weekly visits were made for 60 days， followed by fortnightly follow-ups for another 60 days.\n\n【10】Forty-eight days after the operation， the patient was admitted to our emergency room due to leakage of secretion in the dressing， and partial loosening of the polyethylene prosthesis was observed. Suture of the distal component of the dressing was performed with nylon thread，under local anesthesia.\n\n【11】Weight bearing was planned to start six weeks after surgery， but due to this minor episode of dressing loosening it was postponed to eight weeks after major healing of the injury was visualized through the prosthesis. Full weight bearing on the operated limb was allowed 70 days after surgery. technique， coverage was maintained for a period of 6 weeks.\n\n【12】Four months after the first procedure， although the excellent aspect of the wound， a minor lesion remained on the central area of the wound and surgeons proposed another intervention with removal of the dressing and a minimal skin graft coverage . He was readmitted for operative treatment on May 2022 but after removal of the prosthesis the injury was completely granulated and no additional procedure was necessary .\n\n【13】Considering that the technique was adapted for larger lesions， this coverage maintenance period will be influenced according to the location and size of the lesion to be treated. It is common during the treatment that some stitches may becomeloose over the weeks. When this loosening occurs， the patient should be submitted to a partial revision and a new suture， on an outpatient basis， to avoid leakage of secretions and contamination ofthe wound. The suture used must be adapted to the lesion site as well as the thickness of suture thread. In general， simple， or U-shaped stitches are suitable and facilitate revision in case of loosening.\n\n【14】Last follow-up visit was on June 2022， 30 days after removal of the prosthesis and five months after the surgery. Patient remained with excellent outcome， with minimal complaints regarding residual edema and paresthesia. The wound on the dorsum was completely healed and patient was allowed to return to work as tolerated.\n\n【15】In very large wounds， complete or partial healing may occur， leaving small， but already granulated areas that can be supplemented with grafting. In general， coverage with a propylene orthosis restores a very close to natural shape and appearance， with good sensitivity to the area.\n\n【16】Surgical Technique\n\n【17】The technique used in this case report consists of an adaptation of the technique proposed by Figueiredo ， initially for cutaneous losses from the fingertips and later expanded for greater cutaneous losses， both in the hand and in other parts of the limbs.\n\n【18】The original technique consists ofusing a synthetic polypropylene cover that is flexible and resistant to cover the entire bloody area， to contain all the inflammatory exudate， preventing its extravasation. This exudate is later progressively converted into fibrinous tissue and this later replaced by granulation tissue. In the original initial In the case presented， the patient was taken first to the operating room for debridement of the wound and bone fixation. Coverage with polypropylene was performed at the same time. In the first week， it is likely for that the dressing to become slightly moist due to a slight extravasation of secretion. After the first week， a weekly dressing change was performed with a superficial cleaning of the covering with 70% alcohol. It is common for the patient to be anxious with the appearance of fibrinous over the weeks， mistaking it for pus. It is important to reassure the patient to maintain adherence to treatment. Over the weeks， some areas take on a darkened color due to the differentiation of the granulation tissue.\n\n【19】At approximately 6 weeks， the patient underwent revision of the sutured covering due to loosening of some stitches.\n\n【20】At approximately 12 weeks， the removal of the coverage and grafting of an area that had not yet been epithelialized was programmed.Bythe dressing appearance it seemed to beconsiderable. After removing the cover it was observed that the epithelialized tissue was larger than estimated， leaving only a discrete central area fully granulated.\n\n【21】Antibiotics were not used for prophylaxis or treatment during the patient's follow-up.\n\n【22】Discussion\n\n【23】The foot and ankle area is a common site of traumatic injuries that generate a loss of skin coverage and possible exposure to deep structures. These lesions will require coverage methods that may need a variety of reconstruction procedures to reduce the risk of infection， necrosis of noble structures and specially to avoid other undesirable outcomes such as amputations .\n\n【24】Autologous grafts and flaps require a trained team， not always available in treatment centers， in addition to generating an additional damage to the donor site， which increases treatment morbidity . Negative pressure therapy is a relative expensive treatment， not always covered by the healthcare insurance， whether public or private.\n\n【25】The use of polypropylene prosthesis is a technique of low complexity of execution， besides being accessible and low cost， making it viable and reproducible ， regardless of the level of technical capacity of the surgeon and the structure of the center where the treatment is being instituted.\n\n【26】Therefore， it is believed that the technique in question should be part of the arsenal of alternatives for the treatment of skin lesions followed by traumatic events， especially at the level of the foot and ankle， given the good result that can be obtained， as well as exemplified in the reported case.\n\n【27】The application ofthis technique on foot and ankle area transcends the indications primarily described by Figueiredo  and some details should be considered due to its weight bearing characteristics. First， we recommend at least six weeks non weight bearing on the operated limb but this period could be extended according to the severity and the progression of the wound. Second， we suggest that suture of the prosthesis should be performed with very close stitches to avoid leakage of the secretion.\n\n【28】Respecting these instructions， we believe that excellent outcomes could be achieved with very little expenses， and we recommend that the technique should be widespread to other surgeons especially in areas with budget limitations.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 10:26:55", "endTime": "2024/09/24 10:28:23", "cost": 87.785}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:30", "update_time": "2024-09-23 18:28:21", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 18:26:53"}

This report aimed to highlight a rare case of tongue-base angioleiomyoma excised by TransOral Robotic Surgery (TORS). A rare case report of angioleiomyoma of the tongue base in a 72-year-old man who presented with hoarseness， muffled voice and stridor. Preoperative endovascular embolization was performed owing to the high vascularity of the lesion， followed by TORS using the da Vinci Robotic System. The tumor was excised completely with minimal complications. There were no signs of local recurrence during the follow-up period. Tongue-base angioleiomyoma poses treatment challenges owing to its vascularity and difficult location. We suggest that the appropriate treatment of tongue-base angioleiomyoma should consist of embolization and tracheostomy， followed by TORS excision. To our knowledge， this is the first use of robotic minimal invasive technique for excision of angioleiomyoma in this location.\n\n【2】Keywords： Angioleiomyoma； Tongue base； Trans Oral Robotic Surgery (TORS)\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Angioleiomyoma (ALM) is a benign soft-tissue tumor originating in the smooth muscle of blood vessels. It usually measures from a few millimeters to 2 cm. As the tumor is painless and slow-growing， diagnosis may be delayed. Median age at diagnosis is 45 years； there is a small male predominance (58%) . ALM appears histologically as a well-circumscribed capsulated tumor； alpha-Smooth Muscle Actin (SMA) positivity on immunohistochemistry is considered a good diagnostic marker . Treatment is by surgical excision. Recurrence is uncommon， unless the tumor was not removed completely，and prognosis is good. Malignant transformation has not been reported .\n\n【5】ALM rarely occurs in the oropharynx and oral cavity， especially the tongue base. This report describes a case of tongue-base ALM and the first use of TransOral Robotic Surgery (TORS) for the treatment of ALM in this location.\n\n【6】Case Presentation\n\n【7】A 72-year-old man presented with hoarseness， muffled voice， stridor， and mild dyspnea that appeared during minor physical activity， in addition to unintentional weight loss of 4 kg in the last vear. His medical history was remarkable.\n\n【8】Clinical examination revealed an oropharyngeal tongue-base lesion and an offensive smell from the oral cavity. Laryngoscopy exposed a vascular 2.6 cm mass pushing the epiglottis posteriorly and filling the vallecula inferiorly . Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) revealed an oval well-circumscribed space-occupying lesion located between the tongue base and epiglottis，hyperintense throughout and strongly enhanced on T2-weighted scans. The lesion caused partial obstruction of the oropharyngeal airways with slight asymmetry to the left . No metastases were identified.\n\n【9】Considering the benign appearance of the tumor and its high vascularity， a preoperative biopsy was not taken to avoid the risk of excessive bleeding which could lead to airway obstruction. Accordingly， concerns of intraoperative bleeding prompted the use of preoperative endovascular embolization， which was performed by an invasive neuroradiologist under general anesthesia. Diagnostic catheter angiography demonstrated that the left lingual artery was the sole supply source to the lesion. Therapeutic catheterization was followed by endovascular embolization using a coaxial catheter system. During navigation of the microcatheter， minor bleeding was observed from the artery supplying the tumor and promptly stopped with liquid embolic glue. Total devascularization of the tumor-feeding artery was achieved without complications. The absence of distal obstructions was verified by iniections to the vertebral arteries.\n\n【10】TROS was performed under general anesthesia 3 days later . Surgery was preceded by preventive tracheotomy for intraoperative protection of the airway and safer postoperative management. The tongue base was exposed using a Crowe retractor， and visualization of the oropharynx was achieved with an 8 mm， 30-degree， three-dimensional endoscope that was inserted， facing upward， through the retractor. A 5 mm monopolar cautery and 5 mm Maryland dissector were then inserted and brought into endoscopic view. The tumor was excised en-bloc with 0.5 cm margins using the da Vinci Robotic System [Intuitive Surgical Inc.， Sunnyvale CA， USA). The TORS procedure took 110 min. Moderate bleeding events occurring during the procedure were managed with electrocautery， vascular clips， and biological glue； there was no excessive intraoperative bleeding or other perioperative complications.\n\n【11】The postoperative course was uneventful. The patient was fed via a nasogastric tube for the first 2 days and then proceeded to soft oral intake. He was treated with antibiotics (cefamezin and metronidazole) and decannulated prior to discharge within 5 days. At the 1-year follow-up， there were no signs of local recurrence， and the stoma was closed.\n\n【12】Postoperative histopathologic examination revealed a well-circumscribed 2.3-cm ALM composed of myocytes and vascular spaces， with no nuclear atypia and low mitotic activity. Immunohistochemistry staining was negative for HMB45， S100， and desmin， and positive for SMA. Ki67 proliferation index was 4% to 5%， indicating a benign neoplasm .\n\n【13】Discussion\n\n【14】We presented a case of ALM in the tongue base. To our knowledge， a few cases of tongue ALM have been described， and only several specifically in the tongue base .\n\n【15】The clinical differential diagnosis of ALM of the tongue includes hemangioma， lymphangioma， vascular malformation， abscess， lingual thyroid， and other benign mesenchymal tumors such as fibroma， neurofibroma， and granular cell lesion. In our case， the intense enhancement of the lesion on T2-weighted images and T1-weighted images with gadolinium pointed to a hypervascular pattern， narrowing the differential diagnosis to a vascular mass.\n\n【16】Surgical approaches to tongue-base tumors include transoral excision， submandibular approach， suprahyoid OT lateral pharyngotomy， and lip split with mandibulotomy. For small and well-encapsulated lesions， transoral excision is preferred. However， gaining adequate access to the tongue base can be challenging owing to its remote location and the presence of important neurovascular structures .Fan et al.  used an ultrasonic harmonic scalpel with an advanced hemostasis mode in 12 patients with other tongue-base benign lesions. The technique yielded good outcomes with minimum complications but was limited by lack of depth perception and low visualization ofthe surgical field with inadequate lesion exposure .\n\n【17】More recently， Danic et al.  and Kim et al.  described two cases of tongue-base ALM， in a 76-year-old man and a 2-month-old infant， respectively， who underwent endoscopic surgery with a harmonic scalpel. Additionally， Marden et al.  managed a tongue-base ALM that bled vigorously during diagnostic biopsy with endovascularembolization followed one daylater byhemiglossectomy with mass resection.\n\n【18】In the present case， the vascularity of the tumor prompted our decision to perform preoperative endovascular embolization of the selective tumor-feeding branch (left lingual artery)， as described by Marden et al. ， followed by surgical excision. However， unlike the previous cases ， we used a TORS approach. TORS has been reported to overcome the limitations of traditional surgical methods andto improve surgeon dexterity，precision， and depthperception . By providing three-dimensional visualization， it allows for complete tumor removal with fewer complications while preserving important structures and nerves. We found the procedure to be safe and efficient for excision of a tongue-base ALM. The main disadvantages of TORS are the relatively high operating costs and absence of tactile feedback. However， the advantages seem to outweigh the disadvantages. This report supports the use of a robotic minimal invasive technique for excision and partial glossectomy of benign lesions at the tongue base， especially vascular lesions like ALM.\n\n【19】In conclusion， we report a rare case of a tongue-base ALM that posed treatment challenges owing to its vascularity and difficult location. Treatment consisted of embolization and tracheostomy followed by TORS excision. To our knowledge， this is the first report documenting treatment of tongue-base ALM using TORS. We achieved optimal visual exposure that allowed for safe and complete tumor excision with minimal complications.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 10:43:38", "endTime": "2024/09/24 10:43:47", "cost": 9.338}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:30", "update_time": "2024-09-23 18:43:47", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 18:43:37"}

We present a woman with CH and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus(SLE)， whose Fertility Preservation (FP) in pregnancy-prohibitedphase may have contributed to BP control and a livebirth. A 33-vear-old woman with CH and SLE conceived twins in SLE remission， without BP control. Both SLE flare and superimposed preeclampsia occurred， and the pregnancy was terminated because of renal dysfunction at 20 weeks. She presented with depression and decreased medical adherence， resulting in prolonged hypertension and pregnancy prohibition. FP was started 40 weeks after stillbirth， and a blastocyst was preserved at the fifth oocyte retrieval. Her medical adherence improved， and her BP became 120-130/90-100 mmHg. After thawed embryo transfer， she conceived a singleton pregnancy. Her BP was 120-130/70-90 mmHg during this pregnancy. At 32 weeks， she delivered a baby due to abnormal findings in Cardiotocogram. In this case， FP may have contributed to BP control and a livebirth. To our knowledge， this is the first report of FP in a pregnancy-prohibited woman with CH or SLE.\n\n【2】Keywords： Autoimmune disease； Fertility preservation； Hypertension； Pregnancy； Systemic lupus erythematosus\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Pregnancy with Chronic Hypertension (CH) is a high-risk pregnancy because the incidence of Superimposed Preeclampsia (SPE)， preterm birth， Fetal Growth Restriction (FGR)， fetal/neonatal death， maternal death， and maternal cardiovascular morbidities such as heart failure， renal failure， stroke， and pulmonary edema are 3 to 10 times more frequent in patients with CH than in normotensive women . It is well accepted that Blood Pressure (BP) control， before conception or since early pregnancy， is important. However， the target BP is controversial. The International Society for the Study of Hypertension in Pregnancy (ISSHP) states that the target BP should be in the range of 110-140/80-85 mmHg ， and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence(NICE) recommends a target BP of 135/85 mmHg . In contrast， in 2019， the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommended that anti-hypertensive therapy for CH should be started when pregnant women have a BP≥160/110 mmHg， and that the target BP should be 120-159/80-109 mmHg . This recommendation is based on the finding that strict control of diastolic BP did not improve maternal/fetal outcomes. In April 2022，however，ACOG revised the target BP to 140/90 mmHg ， based on the results of the Chronic Hypertension and Pregnancy study.\n\n【5】Pregnancy with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is also a high-risk pregnancy . A study including patients with active and inactive disease at conception， showed a significantly higher incidence of hypertension， renal disease， preeclampsia， preterm delivery， cesarean delivery， FGR， and neonatal death in women with SLE than in women without SLE . For women with SLE， conception is recommended after at least 6 months disease remission， which is based on reports showing that pregnancy loss is significantly higher in women who had active SLE during 6 months before conception than in those who were in remission for >6 months before conception . In Japan， the criteria for pregnancy in women with autoimmune disease are based on renal function. The estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) should be ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m. No such criteria for BP exist .\n\n【6】Here we present the case of a woman with CH and SLE who had a healthy baby after BP was controlled before pregnancy. It was suggested that embryo preservation during pregnancy-prohibited period may have contributed to improvement in depression and medical adherence， resulting in BP control and a livebirth. To our knowledge， this is the first report on the embryo preservation in pregnancy-prohibited woman with CH or SLE.\n\n【7】Case Presentation\n\n【8】A 21-year-old woman presented to our hospital with cheek erythema， oral ulcers， finger arthralgia， and thrombocytopenia； she was subsequently diagnosed with SLE at the department of rheumatology in our hospital. Her BP was normal， and her medical history was uneventful. An evaluation of the patient’s family history showed that her mother had hepatic cancer， but there was no family history of autoimmune diseases， hypertension， thrombosis， or sudden death. The patient showed positive results in autoantibody tests for anti-DNA， anti-RNP， anti-Smith， anti-SSA， anti-SSB， and Lupus Anticoagulant (LA)， and negative results for anti-cardiolipin and anti-B2 Glycoprotein I (B2-GPI). SLE flares were observed twice during the following 2 years. During the second flare， her BP was130/80 mmHg. Subsequently， she was in remission and was taking 7mg/day Prednisolone (PSL) and 4 mg/day Tacrolimus (TAC). She got married at the age of 30 years， and her disease remained in remission. She conceived spontaneously at 31 years of age， but the pregnancy resulted in a miscarriage at 7 weeks. LA and anti-B2-GPI tests were repeated 8 weeks after the miscarriage， but both showed negative results.\n\n【9】The patient subsequently visited a private fertility clinic， and her BP that time was 137/89 mmHg. She conceived dichorionic diamniotictwins after intrauterine insemination in a natural ovulatory cycle at 33 years of age. At 5 weeks of gestation， her BP was 138/102mmHg. At 9 weeks， she presented with thrombocytopenia and skin erythema， and an SLE flare was diagnosed. Her PSL and TAC doses were augmented， and treatment with Hydroxychloroquine sulfate(HCQ) was initiated . At 13 weeks， she was referred to our Obstetrics and Gynecology (OBGY) department， a tertiary perinatal care center， and was subsequently managed in cooperation with the rheumatology department at our institute. At 13 weeks， LA test again showed negative result. Hypertension (150/110 mmHg) was observed at 13 weeks， and methyldopa， labetalol， and amlodipine were administered； however， her BP remained around 150/90mmHg. She was admitted at 17 weeks because thrombocytopenia had not improved. Although intensive immunosuppression therapy， including intravenous immunoglobulin， augmentation of PSL， and initiation of Cyclosporin A (CyA) and azathioprine， was administered for the SLE flare，the thrombocytopenia did not improve. At 20 weeks， rapid progression of renal dysfunction was observed， which was indicated by changes in the serum creatinine levels (from 0.86 mg/dL to 1.19 mg/dL) and the eGFR (from 62.0 mL/min/1.73 m² to 43.4mL/min/1.73 m). Her serum uric acid levels were also elevated (6.8 mg/dL). Because the patient's thrombocytopenia and renal dysfunction did not improve despite intensive immunosuppressive therapy， we concluded that SPE was complicated with the SLE flare， although the gestational age was only 20 weeks. Considering the gestational age， we recommended termination of pregnancy for maternal safety. After obtaining informed consent， therapeutic termination was performed\n\n【10】Table 1： Summary of embryo preservation trials.\n\n| Trial  | Weeks afterthe still birth  | Stimulation  | Number of QQcytesretrieved  | Number ofpreservedtrophoblasts  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1s1  | 40  | Short  | 4  | 0  |\n| 2d  | 56  | CC  | 1  | 0  |\n| 3d  | 64  | CC  | 2  | 0  |\n| 41h  | 68  | CC  | 2  | 0  |\n| 51h  | 72  | CC  | 2  | 1  |\n\n【12】CC： Clomiphene Citrate at 20+2 weeks using a cesarean section， and two babies (292 gand 272g) were delivered.\n\n【13】Afterthestillbirth，immunosuppression therapy was administered more intensively， including steroid pulse therapy (intravenous methylprednisolone， 1，000 mg/day for 3 days)， initiation of mycophenolate mofetil (which is contraindicated during pregnancy)， and augmentation of CyA. As a result， her serum creatinine levels decreased， and platelet counts increased. Although her hypertension was prolonged， she was discharged 28 days after stillbirth.\n\n【14】Following the discharge， SLE was treated with PSL， CyA， HCQ， and belimumab， and renal function test results and platelet counts were controlled within normal ranges . However， her BP remained around 150-160/100-110 mmHg； therefore， pregnancy was not permitted. She became depressed soon after the stillbirth； at approximately 20 weeks after stillbirth，her depression became severe， and she stopped taking prescribed medicines. She contemplated suicide， but it was avoided with the help of a psychiatrist.\n\n【15】As we could not predict when pregnancy would be permitted， a prenatal team of doctors suggested embryo preservation to the fertility treatment team. We proposed that the couple undergo embryo preservation 36 weeks after the stillbirth to preserve fertility. The couple chose to proceed with the embryo preservation. Embryo preservation started 40 weeks after the stillbirth . The stimulation methods and outcomes are shown in Table 1. The first trial used the “short”protocol， and the following trials used administration of Clomiphene Citrate (CC). A blastocyst with good morphology was preserved for the first time at the fifth trial 72weeks after the stillbirth. Following the embryo preservation trials， the patient’s depression had ameliorated， and her adherence of medicines improved. Her BP was 120-130/90-100 mmHg， with the systolic BP falling into the normal range. SLE was in remission， and LA was negative once again. Rheumatology and OBGY doctors had a conference and permitted her pregnancy 76 weeks after the stillbirth.\n\n【16】After obtaining informed consent from the couple regarding the risks of pregnancy that included a possibility of twin pregnancy(2% in single blastocyst transfer)， an SLE flare， preterm birth which could result in a neonatal mortality/morbidity， and the risk of mortality/morbidity to the patient， a thawed Embryo Transfer (ET) was performed in a spontaneous ovulatory cycle 80 weeks after the stillbirth. The patient developed a singleton pregnancy. In this pregnancy， her BP was maintained around 120-130/70-90 mmHg. However， serum creatinine was elevated to 0.97 mg/mL at 32+4weeks， and she was subsequently admitted. At 32+5 weeks， elevated serum creatinine (1.06 mg/dL)， decreased eGFR (53 mL/min/1.73m’)， and abnormal findings on Cardiotocogram (loss of variability) were observed； therefore， an emergency cesarean was performed. A 1，580 g baby was delivered with a 5-min Apgar score of 9. After delivery，the serum creatinine levels became normal. Both the mother and baby were in good health 1 year after the delivery.\n\n【17】Discussion\n\n【18】We presented the case of a woman with CH and SLE whose first pregnancy resulted in a miscarriage， the second pregnancy (without pre-conceptional BP control) resulted in therapeutic termination at20 weeks， and the third pregnancy (with pre-conceptional BP control) resulted in a livebirth.\n\n【19】First， we estimated that the patient's hypertension was drug-induced due to administration of PSL and TAC for approximately10 vears.\n\n【20】Second， we diagnosed an SLE flare and SPE during the second pregnancy. In the management of pregnancy in patients with SLE， differential diagnosis of SLE flares and Hypertensive Disorders of Pregnancy (HDP) is important because the treatment for an SLE flare is immunosuppression， while the final treatment for HDP is termination of pregnancy . However， a differential diagnosis may be challenging for clinicians because both conditions present with proteinuria， hypertension， and lower-extremity edema， and may also have systemic effects . In this case， we concluded that both SLE flare and SPE were present because immunosuppressive therapy did not control the disease； therefore，therapeutic termination at 20 weeks was done. A twin pregnancy is a strong possible cause of SPE at an early gestational age. Postpartum improvement of renal dysfunction and thrombocytopenia supports this diagnosis.\n\n【21】Third，wediscussedthesafetyofAssistedReproductiveTechnology(ART) in women with SLE. The most serious complication associated with ovarian stimulation and ovarian hyper stimulation syndrome is thrombosis . To avoid thrombosis， selection of appropriate ovarian stimulation， a \"freeze all” strategy， and appropriate heparin administration should be performed， especially for those with Anti-Phospholipid Antibodies (APAs) . To avoid thrombosis in thawed ET， a natural ovulatory cycle is the first choice. If hormone replacement is necessary， non-oral natural estradiol andprogesterone should be administrated . Furthermore， single ET should be performed to avoid the risks associated with multifetal pregnancy. ART is not indicated in the women with acute flare， poorly controlled arterial hypertension， pulmonary hypertension， advanced renal disease， severe valvular or heart diseases， or major previous thrombotic events . In this case， we considered that the patient had alow risk ofthrombosis，because her anti-mullerian hormone was low (0.84 ng/mL)， her APAs were negative， and she had no previous episode of thrombosis. In addition， because her platelet count was>10×104 /uL， the risk ofovarian bleeding with Oocyte Retrieval (OR) was low. Therefore， we concluded that ovarian stimulation and OR were acceptable in this case.\n\n【22】Fourth， we discussed the validity of ET in this case as the patient’s BP was 120-130/90-100 mmHg with a relatively high diastolic BP. As mentioned in the introduction， the target BP is controversial in pregnancy in women with CH， with ISSHP，NICE，andACOG having different guidelines. In a retrospective analysis of 215 women with CH， Ueda et al. showed that systolic BP<130 mmHg within 14 weeks of gestation reduced the risk of developing early-onset SPE . We(Kurashiki Central Hospital) participated in this study and recognized the importance of systolic BP control. In this case ET was performed in 2020 when the international guidelines for target diastolic BP ranged from 85 mmHg to 110 mmHg. Therefore， we believed ET to be acceptable in this case.\n\n【23】Lastly， we discussed Fertility Preservation (FP) in women with SLE， who are prohibited from getting pregnant. It is well accepted that SLE itself is not a cause of infertility . However， administration of Cyclophosphamide (CPA) decreases ovarian reserve， resulting in decreased fertility . Additionally， when a woman with SLE is advised not to conceive for a long period， her fertility decreases because of a decreased ovarian reserve and oocyte ageing . It is demonstrated that clinicians should give information on FP，including cryopreservation of embryos/oocytes/ovarian tissue， to the female patients with SLE who are going to be administrated with CPA， in European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology(ESHRE) guidelines  and American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) guidelines . Accordingly， FP counseling before CPA administration is a common practice at present. In Japan， there have been reports on this issue since 2015. However， FP counseling for women with SLE who are advised not to conceive for a long period is not yet a common practice； FP counseling for these women is not present in the ESHRE or ASRM guidelines. A review by Italian doctors showed that FP should be considered for women who are advised not to conceive for a long period ， suggesting that FP had been practical in Italy or European nations in these cases. However， we could not find such reports in English. We believe that FP for women prohibited from pregnancy is not yet a common practice because it is undetermined whether ART in women with SLE during a pregnancy-prohibited period is safe and effective. Additionally， we could not find the reports on FP in women with CH.\n\n【24】In conclusion， we present a woman with CH and SLE， in whom post-stillbirth depression and medical adherence improved during embryo preservation， resulting in systolic BP control and a livebirth. We reported this case because it provides in formation on FP in women with CH or SLE during pregnancy-prohibited period. However， the safety and effectiveness on this approach is undetermined，and careful consideration is necessary on a case-by-case basis.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 11:10:35", "endTime": "2024/09/24 11:11:57", "cost": 81.086}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:30", "update_time": "2024-09-23 19:11:57", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 19:10:35"}

Disseminated coccidiomycosis affects approximately1% of patients. Most common extrapulmonary sites are skin， bones， central nervous system， and soft tissue. Even more rare is the presentation of symptomatic genital tract infections and prostatitis. We present a rare case of disseminated coccidioidomycosis in a 60-year-old male with poorly controlled diabetes and Polycythemia Vera (PV) who presented with dysuria and suprapubic tenderness found to have a prostate abscess， splenic lesions and cavitary pneumonia.\n\n【2】Case Report： A 60-year-old man with a history of uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus (hemoglobin A1c 12.5%) and myocardial ischemia， presented with a three-week history of suprapubic abdominal pain， dysuria， unintentional 25-lb weight loss， and left lower leg numbness and weakness.

The organism’s spores are typically transmitted via inhalation and have shown an increase in the annual rate of infection， from a rate of 5.3 per100，000 in 1998 to a rate of 42.6 per 100，000 in 2011， in endemic areas . Approximately 1%of patients who are infected， develop disseminated coccidioidomycosis， with the most common extrapulmonary sites being skin， bones， central nervous system， and soft tissue . Even more rare is the presentation of symptomatic genital tract infections and prostatitis as a manifestation of disseminated coccidioidomycosis. In fact， there have only been 18 confirmed cases and 6 suspected cases， but only one known recorded case of prostate abscess due to disseminated coccidioidomycosis. We present a rare case of disseminated coccidioidomycosis in a 60-year-old male with poorly controlled diabetes and Polycythemia Vera (PV) who presented with dysuria and suprapubic tenderness found to have a prostate abscess， splenic lesions and cavitary pneumonia.\n\n【6】Case Presentation\n\n【7】A 60-year-old man with a history of uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus (hemoglobin Alc12.5%) and myocardial ischemia， presented with a three-week history of suprapubic abdominal pain， dysuria， unintentional 25-lb weight loss， and left lower leg numbness and weakness. He is a truck driver in Southern California delivering goods to construction sites. On admission， he was tachycardic with heart rate of 108 beats per minute and physical exam was notable for suprapubic tenderness. Laboratory workup was significant for leukocytosis of 16.44 bil/L (normal range 4.80bil/L to 11.80 bil/L)， urinalysis positive for pyuria with moderate bacteriuria and glucose >500 mg/dL， and final cultures grew only mixed flora. Computed Tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis with and without contrast showed a complex multiloculated 7.9 cm×8.1 cm× 10.4 cm prostatic abscess  with regional colitis and cystitis and heterogeneous peripheral ill-defined splenic lesions concerning for splenic abscess . CT of the chest was also obtained given the patient's history of weight loss and concern for malignancy， and this revealed cavitary right upper lobe opacities on a background of extensive micronodularity， most pronounced in the right upper lobe(miliary pattern) . The patient underwent radiologic-guided drainage ofthe prostate and splenicabscesses. Bronchoalveolar Lavage (BAL) was also performed， which showed fungal spherules consistent with Coccidioides organisms . Cultures of his prostatic and BAL fluid grew Coccidioides immitis， and serum Coccidioides serology by immunodiffusion were positive for IgM and IgG， confirming disseminated coccidioidomycosis. Antibody titers by complement fixation were negative. The patient was treated with voriconazole (4 mg/kg q12h for 9 days)， micafungin (100 mg daily for 5 days)， and amphotericin B (5 mg/kg for 9 days) in the acute setting and transitioned to oral fluconazole at 800 mg daily once the organism was known and infection was better controlled. Our patient reported symptomatic improvement following drainage of both the prostatic and splenic abscess along with several days of antifungal therapy. He was subsequently discharged with plans to continue fluconazole daily， for at least one year as suppressive therapy.\n\n【8】In addition， during the admission， our patient had persistent polycythemia with hemoglobin ranging from 17.0 g/dL to 20.2 g/dL(normal range 10.5 g/dL to 15 g/dL) and hematocrit 48.7% to 63.8%(normal range 32% to 46%). On review ofhis medical records， a JAK exon 12 mutation had been identified one year prior， but he was lost to follow up and was yet to initiate any medical therapy. At a one-month outpatient hematology follow-up visit， the patient was started on hydroxyurea and aspirin based on a newly established diagnosis of PV.\n\n【9】In regards to the response to therapy by his disseminated coccidioidomycosis infection， he underwent repeat imaging at a nine-month follow up visit， which revealed complete resolution of the prostatic abscess  and significant reduction in size of the pulmonary lesions . Considering the clinical and radiographic improvement， his fluconazole dose was reduced to 400mg daily. In addition， around the same time his hemoglobin was noted to be 13.8 g/dL and hematocrit 39.1%.\n\n【10】Discussion\n\n【11】This case represents a rare clinical entity of disseminated Coccidioides involving the genitourinary tract. Fewer than forty cases of Coccidioides involving the genitourinary tract have been identified in men， of which less than twenty involved the prostate . A retrospective review of 3，676 prostate pathology reports (from biopsy and surgery)， from two hospitals in areas endemic to C. immitis， found four cases of previously unrecognized Coccidioidal infection of the prostate， suggesting that the condition， though rare， may be underdiagnosed .\n\n【12】Due to its non-specific presentation， the diagnostic workup of genitourinary Coccidioides infection is challenging. Coccidioidal prostatitis may present with symptoms similar to that of acute bacterial prostatitis， with urinary obstruction and prostatic ten derness on exam . Urine cultures may be helpful in diagnosing prostatic involvement especially when done after performing a prostate massage to express prostatic fluid， and the yield is improved when using a fungal culture growth medium . However， fungal cultures of urine specimens are not routinely performed if fungal prostatitis is not suspected. In cases where clinical improvement is not seen within 48 h of medical therapy， further investigation with trans-rectal ultrasound or CT scan may be warranted .\n\n【13】While guidelines are lacking regarding prostatic abscess from coccidiomycosis， Abdelmoteleb et al. suggest that in cases where prostatic abscesses are larger than 1 cm or do not quickly resolve with antimicrobial therapy， drainage of the infected site should be considered， in order to prevent formation of fistulas to surrounding structures . These samples shouldbe sent for fungal， mycobacterial， and bacterial cultures， and may assist in confirming the overarching diagnosis ofdisseminated coccidioidomycosis，particularlyinendemic areas. Guidelines by the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) for management of disseminated Coccidioidomycosis recommend treatment with amphotericin B until clinical stabilization followed by itraconazole or fluconazole， with adjunct surgical intervention in select cases-those with large abscesses， bony sequestration， instability of spine， or nerve impingement .\n\n【14】Whileprimarypulmonary coccidioidomycosismay be asymptomaticin as many as 60% ofpatients， concern for disseminated coccidioidomycosis should be high inpatients with certain epidemiologic factors and/or risk factors (e.g.， immunocompromised state) . Interestingly， both， disseminated coccidioidomycosis(~1% of coccidioidomycosis cases) and prostatic abscess (0.5% of urologic cases) are exceedingly rare . Those with HIV/AIDS off of antiretroviral therapy are especially at risk for prostatic abscesses and disseminated coccidioidomycosis . One study also showed patients with poorly controlled diabetes (average blood glucose>200 mg/dL) were more likely to develop disseminated Coccidioides infections with reduced response to treatment .\n\n【15】Moreover， a case series performed by Blair et al. showed that patients with hematologic malignancies including leukemia (27%)， lymphoma (27%)， multiple myeloma (13%)， myelodysplastic (4%)， or myeloproliferative disorders， which included agnogenic myeloid metaplasia and PV (9%) were at higher risk of dissemination. Fatality from coccidiomycosis， while being disposed to such co-morbidities， was also noted to be much higher (50% when disseminated and 27%when pulmonary alone). However， it is possible that malignancy-associated morbidity and mortality from coccidiomycosis could have been exacerbated by chemotherapy or corticosteroids with associated immunosuppression . While untreated PV may progress to immunocompromising conditions such as myelofibrosis and acute leukemia， PV does not necessitate fungal prophylaxis according the NCCN guidelines， as there has not been a direct relationship with increased rates of fungal infections .\n\n【16】It is suggested that cellular immunity plays a significant role in fighting acute coccidioidal infections and therefore， patients with dampened cellular immunity are more susceptible to coccidioidal infection， particularly with risk for dissemination . A retrospective review by Santelli et al.， concluded that individuals with diabetes were more likely to have cavitary lung disease and of those with diabetes， individuals with uncontrolled serum glucose concentrations were likely to have disseminated infection . Diabetes has been shown to significantly weaken cellular immunity(delayed type sensitivity) reactions . Prior publications have also reported increased occurrence of relapsed infection and increased difficulty in controlling disseminated coccidioidomycosis infection， in those with uncontrolled diabetes . While it is difficult to provide a direct correlation between uncontrolled diabetes and severity of coccidioidomycosis infection， tighter serum glucose control and frequent monitoring has been recommended to perhaps prevent complications of disseminated cocci. As for the underlying history of Polycythemia Vera， some studies have shown some correlation between myeloproliferative diseases and occurrence of Coccidioides infection perhaps compoundedby chemotherapy， which was not yet used in our patient .\n\n【17】Conclusion\n\n【18】Rates of coccidiomycosis disseminating to prostate and spleen with abscess formation is extremely rare. Our patient with poorly controlled diabetes may have suffered from resultant cellular immune dysfunction， increasing propensity to disseminated coccidiomycosis. In patients with poorly controlled diabetes in an endemic area， patients (namely men) who present with signs of urinary tract infection should be evaluated for possible fungal prostatitis and prostatic abscess. Our patient responded well to source control with drainage of the prostate. He was treated with broad spectrum anti-fungal in the acute setting and transitioned to long-term fluconazole， with remission of infection at 9-month follow-up. In order to prevent relapse， however， aggressive management of diabetes may be imperative in prevention of relapse. Finally， while PV may not have contributed to the initial infection， chemotherapy that may be used for treatment could increase risk of morbidity from disseminated coccidiomycosis， highlighting the importance of sufficient therapy.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 10:59:12", "endTime": "2024/09/24 11:00:51", "cost": 99.378}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:30", "update_time": "2024-09-23 19:00:50", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 18:59:10"}

Virilizing ovarian tumors constitutes less than 0.2% of cases of hyper and rogenism and less than 1% of all ovarian tumors. Granulosa Cell Tumors (GCTs) usually produce estrogens， and hence， cause symptoms and signs of estrogen excess. GCT mostly present as perimenopausal and postmenopausal women with complaints of abnormal uterine bleeding. There are two distinct histological types， Adult GCT(AGCT) and Juvenile GCT (JGCT)， which display different clinical and histopathological features. Adult Granulosa Cell Tumors (GCTs) are the most common type of ovarian sex cord tumors and account for 1% to 2% of all ovarian tumors. Juvenile granulosa cell tumor on the other hand is less common and occurs mainly in premenarchal girls.\n\n【2】We are reporting a case ofan adolescent female presenting with features hyper and rogenism such as hirsutism，breast atrophyand clitoromegaly. On ultrasound， a cystic ovarian mass of 8.8 cmx6.4cm x 5.5 cm was seen in midline from which bilateral ovaries couldn't be demarcated. She underwent staging laparotomy followed by left salpingo-opherectomy which was histopathologically reported as adult granulosa cell tumor. Young age and androgen secreting nature of adult granulosa cell tumor make this case rare and worth reporting.\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Granulosa Cell Tumors (GCTs)， adult type are the most common type of ovarian sex cord tumors and account for 1% to 2% of all ovarian tumors and 3% to 5% of all ovarian malignancies. Granulosa cell tumors usually produce estrogens， and hence， cause symptoms and signs of estrogen excess. Endometrial hyperplasia was seen in 50% of the cases while adenocarcinoma uterus in 5% to 15% of the cases. GCT mostly present in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women with complaints of abnormal uterine bleeding .\n\n【5】Androgen secreting tumors in a female can arise from ovaries or adrenals. Among these， virilizing ovarian tumors constitutes less than 0.2% of cases of hyper androgenism  and less than1% of all ovarian tumors . Ovarian tumors that commonly present with hyper androgenism include Leydig cell tumors， Sertoli cell tumors， steroid cell tumors-not otherwise specified and ovarian the comas .\n\n【6】We are reporting a case of an adolescent female with features of hyper androgenism and ovarian mass which was histopathologically reported as adult granulosa cell tumor. Youngage and androgen secreting nature of adult granulosa cell tumor make this case rare and worth reporting.\n\n【7】A 16 years old unmarried female reported to our Gynae OPD with complaints of delayed and scantyperiods and hirsutism over last 2 years， followed by secondaryamenorrhea for last 6 months She attained her menarche at 12 years of age and her previous menstrual cycles were normal with regular flow. On examination， signs of verification such as breast atrophy (Tanner stage 2)， hirsutism and clitoromegaly were present. Per abdominal examination was normal. On per rectal examination， an ill defined mass was felt in midline of approximately 5 cm x 4 cm， cystic， non-tender and freely mobile. The patient's vital parameters and other physical fin dings were normal.\n\n【8】On USG， a large lobulated septated cystic mass of 8.8 cm x6.4cm×5.5 cm was seen in midline in lower abdomen with bilateral ovaries couldn’t be seen separately. Rest of abdomen viscera and bilateral kidneys and adrenals were within normal limits. On MRI， USG findings were corroborated， bilateral ovaries can't be seen separately and bilateral adrenals and uterus were normal. On，lab investigations， serum DHEAS  & S. testosterone (156.31) were markedly raised while serum FSH， LH and other tumor markers(CA 125， alpha FP， S. beta HCG， S. LDH) were WNL. There was no significant family history of malignancy. She was planned for staging laparotomy with a provisional diagnosis of androgen secreting ovarian sex cord stromal tumor. On laparotomy， no gross ascites or peritoneal or omental deposits were present. Peritoneal wash fluid sent for cytology. Uterus， right ovary and right fallopian tube were WNL while a left ovarian multiloculated cyst of 4 cm x6 cm was seen with intact capsule. Left fallopian tube was also WNL. Left salpingo-opherectomy was done and was sent for HPE.\n\n【9】On histopathological examination， to our surprise， this was reported as adult type granulosa cell tumor Stage IA1 with presence of typical Call-Exner bodies and coffee bean shaped nucleus. Serum inhibin levels done after HPE， one week postoperatively were normal. This diagnosis of androgen secreting variety of a commonly known estrogen secreting tumor， lead us to undergo literature search and publish this unusual presentation . Patient resumed her menses in very next cycle of surgery and her virilizing and hirsute features got resolved， other than clitoromegaly， during her follow up examination at 3 months. She have no complaints for last one year of follow up and is on regular follow up with USG and serum testosterone and DHEAS levels .\n\n【10】Discussion\n\n【11】Granulosa Cell Tumors (GCT) is derived from the granulosa cells of ovary. They constitute less than 5% of all ovarian tumors and more than 70% of the sex cord-stromal tumors. There are two distinct histological types -Adult GCT (AGCT) and Juvenile GCT (JGCT)， which display different clinical and histopathological features. AGCTs are more common (95%) and are usually seen in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women. JGCTs are rare tumors， representing 5% of all GCTs and usually occur in premenarchal girls and young women. On microscopic examination， two characteristics distinguish juvenile from adult granulosa cell tumors： The nuclei of juvenile granulosa cell tumors are rounded， hyper chromatic and un-grooved with moderate to abundant eosinophilic or vacuolated cytoplasm， and the theca cell component is luteinized .\n\n【12】The majority of patients with GCT will present with one or a combination of the following clinical symptoms： Abnormal vaginal bleeding， abdominal distention， and abdominal pain. Other clinical manifestations are breast tenderness， uterine myo-hypertrophy， and endometrial hyperplasia. All these are consistent with an estrogen- secreting tumor. The endocrine function of GCTs， specifically the production of estrogens， has been repeatedly demonstrated by assessment of the end organ i.e.， endometrium， and measurements of peripheral levels of estrogen before and after surgery. Also， there are studies where selective ovarian venous catheterizations during surgery have the secretion of large quantities of estrogen from the ovary harboring the GCT . On molecular level， FOXL2 gene is required for the normal development of the granulosa cell and mutation of FOXL2 seen in 97 % of adult GCT and is considered as pathognomonic for GCT (particularly adult GCT) . This mutation leads to unregulated aromatase action and excessive estrogen production by action of aromatase on androstenedione in GCT's.\n\n【13】GCTs are low potential malignant neoplasms with the capacity forlocal or lymphatic extension， particularly to the para-aortic lymph nodes. As GCTs usually detectable in early stages due to features of hyper estrogenism， unilateral oophorectomy is recommended treatment for women who wish to preserve their fertility. However， GCT has a tendency for late recurrence and once the tumor recurs it’s fatal in 80% cases . Therefore， it is important to have a circulating marker as an early predictor or recurrent disease.\n\n【14】Estrogens are generally produced by GCTs， but role of estrogens as a tumor marker is limited， as no correlation between serum estrogen levels and tumor load was noted .\n\n【15】Other tumor markers being considered for GCT are Inhibin B and MIS. In the postmenopausal women， with depletion of ovarian follicles， inhibin levels become undetectable. But in GCT， inhibin(predominantly inhibin B) is secreted by granulosa cells， thus inhibin B can be used as a marker for GCT in premenopausal and postmenopausal women. Inhibin act as autocrine and paracrine granulosa cell growth factors and hence， levels of inhibin reflect the tumor burden. However， not all GCTs express inhibin  and epithelial ovarian tumors especially the mucinous variety may also secrete inhibin (82% cases) suggesting that inhibin is not specific for GCT . MIS is also formed in granulosa cells during reproductive life and parallels changes in inhibin levels in GCT. Also， an elevated level of MIS is highly specific for GCT.\n\n【16】Occasionaly， patients with GCTs also presents with decidual reaction of the stroma or secretory characteristics of the glands nendometrium which consistent with tumor production of progesterone. Rarely， virilizing changes as primary or secondary amenorrhea， hirsutism， and clitoral hypertrophy， deepening of the voice， masculine features and acne due to elevated testosterone levels are seen in GCTs.\n\n【17】Androgen secreting adult type GCT is a rare tumor in young females but was do reported over years. Castro et al. reported first case androgenic adult GCT in a prepubertal female presented with hirsutism， raised serum testosterone and 17-hydroxyprogesterone levels. Unilateral salpingo-opherectomy was done and histopathology showed findings suggesting adult type GCT. A reported case of Juvenile GCT， with androgenic manifestations in a 13-year-old girl was also found. Juvenile GCT is as such less common and usually manifest estrogenic features. Her plasma testosterone level was elevated and pelvic ultrasonography revealed a left adnexal cyst(14.4 cm x 9.1 cm x9.7 cm). The patient underwent an exploratory laparotomy， revealing a left ovarian cystic tumor reported as juvenile granulosa cell tumor on histopathology .\n\n【18】Although， androgen secreting GCT are similar to estrogen secreting GCTs in histopathology， it is suggested that they may have a sertoli-leydig cell component which can cause androgen secretion in these women . Another hypothesis is based on the two-cell hypothesis of estradiol production i.e. granulosa cells produce estradiol if the precursor testosterone is secreted by adjacent theca cells. However， in androgenic granulosa cell tumors， few theca cells and lack of aromatase activity of varying degrees in granulosa cells， were seen， leading to accumulation of androgens as they can’t be converted to estradiol .\n\n【19】Although， Inhibin B is commonlyused as tumor markers for GCT but Inhibin B levels were normal in above mentioned cases including our case. While serum testosterone and DHEAS levels were raised in all of these cases， but use of these as tumor markers is still a matter to be subiected for further research. Other serum biochemical markers were also reported to be raised in androgenic GCTs by some authors.\n\n【20】Niwa et al.  reported a 32-year-old Japanese woman， with signs of virilization & pelvic mass on USG with raised serum LH， serum testosterone and DHEAS levels. She underwent laparoscopic right salpingo-opherectomy and the tumor was diagnosed as an adult-type GCT. The reason for the elevation of LH levels in this case was not clear but serum LH levels falls to normal range after surgery. Authors proposed the role serum LH levels in such females for follow up.\n\n【21】Honda et al.  reported another rare case of androgenic adult GCT in a 29 year old female presenting with secondary amenorrhea and adnexal mass and no other signs of virilization. On investigation serum testosterone levels and aPTT were raised which returned to normal levels after surgery. Authors proposed role of an inhibitor to an APTT-based clotting factor being produced by tumor causing raised APTT.\n\n【22】Conclusion\n\n【23】Authors conclude that preoperative diagnosis of androgenic GCT is not feasible and histopathology remains the gold standard. But， a possibility of androgenic GCT should be considered in women with virilizing features and ovarian mass. During follow up of these cases， serum biochemical markers which were raised preoperatively such as serum testosterone & DHEAS in present case along with established tumor marker for GCT i.e.， serum inhibin B levels， in addition to clinical examination and pelvic imaging at regular intervals， should be done. Further research and need of analysis of existing literature is required on time to time basis in order to suggest relevant tumor markers， follow up and prognosis in these cases.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 11:39:40", "endTime": "2024/09/24 11:39:53", "cost": 13.374}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:30", "update_time": "2024-09-23 19:39:53", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 19:39:39"}

It can be diagnosed antenatally， especially in male fetuses. Megalourethra is a cystic dilation of the anterior urethra， mainly resulting in pulmonaryhypoplasia and renal insufficiency in the neonatal period. Techniques are available (vesico-amniotic shunt， fetoscopy) to remove or overcome the obstacle and thus improve the neonatal and subsequent prognosis. It is essential to look for associated malformations， which are more common in megalourethra than in other conditions of the anterior urethra.\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Megalourethra is a cystic dilation of the urethra that can be identified antenatally. It results from an obstruction of the distal urinary tract that can affect the bladder and kidneys in the fetus and in the neonate. This condition belongs to Lower Urinary Tract Obstructions (LUTOs). It is a rare entity with few cases reported in the literature， and its descriptions have mostly been included in more general publications concerning LUTOs. Based on a case encountered in August 2021， this article is aimed at describing and better understanding this condition， providing avenues for its management， and addressing neonatal prognosis.\n\n【5】Clinical Case\n\n【6】A 31-year-old patient， G4P1 (one elective abortion， one full-term vaginal delivery of a healthy boy， one early spontaneous miscarriage)， with no relevant medical or surgical history， was referred at 19+2 Weeks of Amenorrhea (WA) for megabladder， bilateral ureterohydronephrosis， and suspected hypospadias.\n\n【7】The first trimester ultrasound (12+6 WA) was unremarkable and noninvasive prenatal testing was normal. A Cytomegalovirus (CMV) seroconversion was noted in the second trimester of the pregnancy.\n\n【8】The ultrasound performed at 19+2 WA revealed bilateral nephromegaly associated with megabladder and cystic dilation of the penis . The amniotic fluid volume was low-normal (Phelan Index： 8.7 cm) and the fetus was eutrophic. There was no evidence of fetal CMV infection on ultrasound. A first vesicocentesis was performed at 19+4 WA and a second one was scheduled at 19+6 WA to evaluate the fetal renal function. The urinary ionogram was pathological and B2-microglobulin was increased in the urine， indicating fetal renal failure. The molecular karyotype performed on the amniotic fluid was normal.\n\n【9】The follow-up ultrasound performed at 21+0 WA showed the same abnormalities as previously described， but with the addition of oligohydramnios (index： 5.2 cm)，and hyperechoic renal cortices.\n\n【10】After explanation of the situation and prognosis  in our fetal medicine center， the couple requested medical termination of pregnancy. This request was accepted by the medical ethics committee.\n\n【11】The feticide (intracordal sufentanil and intracardiac potassium chloride) and expulsion (induced by mifepristone at D-2 and misoprostol) occurred at 22+0 WA. The patient gave birth to a male child， 520 g and 29 cm.\n\n【12】As the couple did not want an autopsy， no exhaustive post-mortem examination was performed. We noted an enlarged penis ， no palpable erectile body and an unremarkable abdominal wall. Macroscopically， the urinary meatus appeared permeable . These findings， although not comprehensive， are consistent with a diagnosis of primary megalourethra .\n\n| Vesicocentesis  | 19+4WA  | 19+6WA  | Normal values |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Osmolality (mOsm/L)  | 252  | 245  | <200  |\n| Sodium (mmol/L)  | 122  | 118  | <100  |\n| Potassium {mmol/L)  | 5  | 5  |  |\n| Chloride (mmol/L)  | 98  | 95  | <90  |\n| Calcium (mmol/L)  | 2  | 2  | <0.95  |\n| 32-micraglabulin (mg/L)  | >4  | 18.345  | <0.3  |\n\n【14】Table 2： Differential diagnosis.\n\n【15】Discussion\n\n| Cystic dilation of the penis -differential diagnosis  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Anterior urethral vave  |  |\n| Preputial stenosis  |  |\n| Urethral stenosis  |  |\n| Primary megalourethra  |  |\n| Prune-Belly syndrome  |  |\n| Umbilical cord loop in the pelvic region  |  |\n\n【17】Definition\n\n【18】The first clinical use of the term “megalourethra” dates from 1955and the first prenatal ultrasound diagnosis from 1989 . enlarges， its wall thins， and the erectile bodies become progressively hypoplastic.Some authors describe the primary forms as fusiform， i.e. with absence of all the penile erectile bodies， and the secondary forms as scaphoid， where only the corpus spongiosum is a plastic . This morphological distinction can be seen after birth .\n\n【19】Congenital megalourethra results from an aplasia of penile erectile tissue causing abnormal dilatation of the anterior urethra due to the lack of supporting tissue . Urinary stasis is therefore the consequence of the swelling of the urethra that lacks support. The swelling has a valve-like effect and prevents urine from flowing out. These cases can be considered as primary megalourethras . In other so-called secondary cases， urethral dilation is related to a distal urethral obstruction that may result from a valve phenomenon or urethral or preputial stenosis . As a result， the urethra\n\n【20】Epidemiology\n\n【21】Urogenital tract anomalies are the third most common non-chromosomal anomalies. It is estimated that 3.8 children out of1，000 births are affected by this type of conditions， which makes up approximately 20% of the anomalies diagnosed antenatally. Megalourethra is a rarity among these anomalies .\n\n【22】Embryology\n\n【23】Congenital megalourethra is characterized by the absence of penile mesodermal tissue. The cloacal membrane is composed of two layers， theendoderm andthe ectoderm. The mesodermal mesenchyme migrates towards the cranial pole of the cloacal membrane and forms the genital tubercle between the cloacal membrane and the umbilicus. On either side of the cloacal membrane， the mesoderm forms the urogenital folds. More laterally， the labioscrotal swellings are formed. These different structures are the embryonic precursors of the male and female external genitalia.\n\n【24】In response to androgen production in the male fetus， the mesoderm of the genital tubercle elongates and enlarges to form the cavernous bodies and glans penis. At the same time， the urethra is formed by tubularization of the endoderm， while the skin and prepuce develop from the ectoderm. The genital swellings will fuse to form the scrotum.\n\n【25】In the case of secondary megalourethra， the embryological origin of the anomaly is thought to be a defect in the epithelial canalization of the glandular urethra .\n\n【26】Antenatal description\n\n【27】On ultrasound， the male fetus exhibits an ovoid dilation of the urethra extending to its distal end. LUTO signs can also be found on antenatal examination： megabladder， ureteral dilation， and possibly hydronephrosis with changes in renal echostructure and oligohydramnios . In some cases， a posterior urethral valve with the \"keyhole sign\" Figure 6 is visible on ultrasound， reflecting dilation of the posterior urethra， and may be the consequence of a severe stenosis of the anterior urethra .\n\n【28】On ultrasound， cystic dilation ofthe penis should not be mistaken for a loop of the umbilical cord near the pelvic region of the fetus； the distinction is made by using color Doppler  .\n\n【29】Associations\n\n【30】Megalourethra is a rare sign of the Prune-Belly syndrome that combines bladder hypertrophy， ureteral dilatation and abnormalities， hydronephrosis， bladder activity disorders， aplasia or hypoplasia of the muscles of the anterior abdominal wall， and cryptorchidism. Although the etiology is not clearly established， it seems that the primum movens is urethral atresia and the resulting obstruction of the distal urinary tract .\n\n【31】In their series of 10 cases， Amsalem et al.  described a VACTERL association； four fetuses had clubfoot and two had anal atresia. Some authors have associated megalourethra with anorectal malformations， esophageal atresia， VATER association， trisomy21， or dental， intestinal， and musculoskeletal malformations . Therefore， there might be some malformative associations to look for in case of megalourethra， while other anomalies of the anterior urethra are isolated in most cases .\n\n【32】Management\n\n【33】Vesico-amniotic shunt consists in placing a catheter between the fetal bladder and the amniotic cavity. This allows the bladder to empty， to artificially eliminate the lower urinary obstruction， and to decrease the pressure in the upper urinary tract .\n\n【34】It is also possible to perform a fetoscopy with cystoscopy to make the diagnosis and， if necessary， to perform a meatotomy or a valve removal，or to place a urethral stent . While the technique is more complicated， its benefits compared to the shunt and its effectiveness cannot be ascertained due to the small number of cases.\n\n【35】These treatments are based on case series concerning LUTOs in general， some of which have included a few cases of megalourethra.\n\n【36】Neonatal consequences\n\n【37】The consequences of megalourethra are the same as those of LUTOs， namely： Pulmonary hypoplasia due to oligohydramnios， progressive renal failure due to vesico-ureteral reflux， micturition disorders，incontinence， recurrent urinary tract infections， and sexual dysfunction .\n\n【38】The prognosis is worse in case of bilateral ureterohydronephrosis， renal cysts，and oligo-or even anamnios. This is all the more true if the onset is early during pregnancy . Some authors have described the primary forms as having a poorer prognosis .\n\n【39】Postnatal renal function is difficult to predict. Fetal kidney appearance does not seem to correlate with fetal urine biochemistry， and both ultrasonographic kidneyappearance and renal biochemistry should be considered in assessing fetal renal function . However， fetal urine biochemistry by vesicocentesis is not unanimously accepted for assessing fetal renal function， and even less for predicting it postnatally .\n\n【40】Long-term consequences\n\n【41】Studies tend to show an increase in overall survival in the case of prenatal intervention but they do not provide strong evidence of improvement in neonatal kidney function， let alone in the longer term.\n\n【42】Penile dysfunctions result in impotence， extensive dilation of the penis preventing correct vaginal intromission， and during micturition， urethral congestion and penile dilation. Few adult cases have been described in the literature. Surgical management is possible to obtain an acceptable aesthetic and functional result . Antenatal removal of the obstacle allows recovery of a normal penile morphology， which would suggest that penile functions are better preserved and that reconstructive surgery is not necessary，but this could not be proven .\n\n【43】Megalourethra is a rare condition that can easily be detected in the antenatal period， although the definitive diagnosis is more akin to a diagnosis of exclusion for its primary form. In such cases， it is essential to perform a complete fetal morphological examination in order to search for associated conditions or syndromes and repercussions on the urinary tract. As in all forms of LUTO， the neonatal prognosis depends on the severity of renal insufficiency and pulmonary hypoplasia， two parameters that are difficult to assess antenatally and even more difficult to predict postnatally. Therapeutic options exist to allow emptying of the urinary tree and hopefully preserve or improve postnatal renal and pulmonary function by maintaining sufficient diuresis and amniotic fluid volume.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 11:26:19", "endTime": "2024/09/24 11:26:38", "cost": 18.684}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:30", "update_time": "2024-09-23 19:26:37", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 19:26:18"}

Coronary artery aneurysms or ectasia develop in approximately 15% to 25% of untreated children with the disease and may lead to myocardial infarction，sudden death， or ischemic heart disease. Despite an overlap of clinical features with toxic shock syndrome， children with Kawasaki disease generally do not develop shock.\n\n【2】Cases： Two adolescent children who presented with a toxic shock-like illness， and were subsequently diagnosed with Kawasaki disease shock syndrome when coronary artery abnormalities were found on transthoracic echocardiography.\n\n【3】Conclusion： Pediatricians and pediatric cardiologists alike should be aware ofthis potentially severe form of manifestation of the Kawasaki disease which needs to be differentiated from the multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children.\n\n【4】Introduction\n\n【5】Kawasaki Disease (KD) constitutes an acute febrile vasculitis of unknown etiology associated with the development of arterial Coronary Artery (CA) abnormalities and myocardial infarction. Its etiology remains unknown， although specific viral agents or virus-like cytoplasmic inclusion bodies in the tissue of Kawasaki disease patients have been implicated . Although standard treatment comprises intravenous immunoglobulin and aspirin， some children exhibit refractory disease， necessitating the use of alternative therapies such as corticosteroids and anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha.\n\n【6】The “Kawasaki Disease Shock Syndrome”(KDSS) is characterized by myocardial dysfunction， earlier-onset and more severe CA involvement， and poor response to standard therapy . In recent years during the COVID-19 pandemics there have been overlapping cases presenting with hemodynamic instability， hypotension， shock and coronary artery involvement leading to a diagnostic dilemma between KDSS and Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C). Here we present two adolescent boys who had KDSS and discuss their differentiating features from MIS-C.\n\n【7】Case Series\n\n【8】Case 1\n\n【9】A previously healthy 13-year-old Kosovar Albanian， teenager boy weighing 64 kg presented with a 7-day history ofhigh fever，headache， vomiting with diarrhea， myalgia， and generalized rash. There was a two-day history of abdominal pain， erythema of the oral mucosa， and bilateral conjunctivitis. On admission he was febrile (39.8°C)， tachycardic (145/min)， hypotensive (75/55 mmHg)， poorly perfused， (capillary refill time 5s). He had bilateral non-exudative conjunctival injection without focal neurological signs， generalized lymphadenopathy， red lips and punctate ulcers on his buccal mucosa， red fissured lips， and a widespread maculopapular rash with target lesions. There was no evidence for periungual desquamation at any stage. Abdominal examination revealed right upper quadrant abdominal tenderness.\n\n【10】Laboratory evaluation showed an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 112 mm/h and a C-reactive protein level of 232 mg/dl.Other laboratory investigations showed mild thrombocytopenia (142×10， mild neutrophilia ， decreased level of serum sodium(123 mmol/l)， and potassium (3.4 mmol/l)， mild renal impairment(urea 7.2 mmol/l and creatinine (92 umol/l)， slightly increased liver transaminases (gamma-glutamyl transferase 69 IU/l and alanine transaminase 72 UI/l). Staphylococcus aureus was detected from nasal and pharyngeal swabs. A coagulopathy workup yielded a negative result.\n\n【11】Because of his hypotension patient was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) due to ongoing hemodynamic instability. Initially， fluid resuscitation and electrolytes correction was done (20 ml/kg in the first hour and 10 ml/kg in the next two hours). Broad-spectrum antibiotics were administrated (Ceftriaxone and Amikacin). Due to persistent hypotension one dose of fresh serum plasma was given (10 ml/kg). His hypotension remained problematic despite adequate volume expansion and inotropic support (Dopamine).\n\n【12】Clinical suspicion was between Kawasaki disease and multisystem inflammatory syndrome. The possibility of KD was raised， and clinical investigations were continued. There were no features of heart ischemia on the electrocardiogram . A chest X-ray showed significant cardiomegaly and pulmonary stasis. Abdominal ultrasound examination revealed a normal liver， pancreas， and both kidneys， with slightly drops of the gallbladder. Transthoracic echocardiography on the second day of admission (day 9 of illness) was performed. Echocardiography examination showed a small pericardial effusion and mild AV valve regurgitation. Biventricular systolic dysfunction was noted. 2-Dechocardiography showed a giant and generalized dilatation and loss of normal tapering of the Left Main Coronary Artery (LMCA)， measuring in the proximal to distal part from 9 mm to 16 mm (Boston z-score +9.3) . Pulse and color Doppler examinations showed sluggish anterograde flow . Both branches of the LCA were dilated： The Left Anterior Descending (LAD) artery diameter was 8 mm (Boston z-score +7.8)， and the circumflex artery measured at 7 mm (Boston z-score +7.1). Right Coronary Artery (RCA) diameter was normal.\n\n【13】After transthoracic echocardiography findings， a diagnosis for KDSS was made， and the patient was treated immediately with Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIG) (2 g/kg)， divided into two doses. Also， a high dose of Aspirin (70 mg/kg) was added. His general condition improved during the next 48 h and subsequently became afebrile. He was normotensive and with a normal capillary refill time. There was resolution of the fever， conjunctivitis， and oral mucositis by day 10 of admission. The transthoracic echocardiography was repeated every two days which showed pericardial effusion being completely resolved with improved left ventricular systolic function. Persistent proximal LCA， LAD， and circumflex artery dilatation were noted. Serial blood results showed resolution of inflammatory markers with transient anemia (Hgb -92 g/l). He was discharged on low-dose aspirin (2mg/kg). Repeated transthoracic echocardiography4 weeks later showed normal systolic function of both ventricles with an unchanged dimension of the LCA.\n\n【14】Case 2\n\n【15】A previously healthy 11-year-old Kosovar Albanian adolescent boy presented to the Pediatric Emergency Department with a 4-day history of high fever， headache， generalized arthralgia， and rash， with nausea， vomiting， and diarrhea. He required ICU admission for ongoing hemodynamic instability. At the admission， he was febrile(40.4C) and unwell， with hypotension (70/55 mmHg)， tachycardia(142/min)， and poor capillary refill time (5 sec). Neck stiffness was noted without local or generalized neurological signs. During ie山the clinical examination bilateral non-purulent conjunctivitis， erythematous rash over the trunk and extremities，red lips， strawberry tongue， and punctate ulcers on his buccal mucosa were noted. He was the second child of non-consanguineous healthy parents， born at full term with unremarkable past medical history.\n\n【16】Laboratory investigations showed an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 122 mm/h， C-reactive protein level of 288 mg/dl，borderline thrombocytopenia (42 10/l)，leukocytosis (14.3×10)，hyponatremia(119 mmol/l)， hypokalemia (3.1 mmol/) and hypochloremia (89mmol/l). Renal impairment was manifested with high levels of urea(15.6 mmol/l) creatinine (134 umol/l). His B-natriuretic peptide was5.560 ng/l (normal range <100 ng/l) and his troponin-I level 1.10ug/l (normal range <0.04 ug/l). Microbial cultures were negative. His hypotension persisted despite adequate fluid resuscitation (50 ml/kg in total for 24 h) and inotropic support (Dopamine). The diagnosis of KD was considered in view ofhis clinical features. Electrocardiogram was normal. X-ray of the chest revealed cardiomegaly with increased bronchopulmonary markings. The abdominal ultrasound examination was normal. Transthoracic echocardiogram on day 7of illness revealed severe biventricular dysfunction with a fractional shortening of 19%， moderate AV valve regurgitation， and diffuse dilatation ofthe right coronaryartery of 6.1 mm (z-score +6.2) . The LCA system was normal in appearance and dimensions.\n\n【17】The patient was treated with 2 g/kg IVIG divided into two doses， and antiplatelet therapy (Clopidogrel and Aspirin -70 mg/kg/d) was administrated. Two broad-spectrum antibiotics (Cefotaxim and Amikacine) and methyl-prednisolone (3 mg/kg/d) divided in three doses were included in the drug treatment. Omeprazole was given parenterally to prevent gastric injury. His general condition improved during the next 36 h and subsequently became afebrile. In the next three days， he was normotensive and with normal capillary refill time. Except for clinical condition， there was an echocardiographic improvement of global heart function over the subsequent days. After2 weeks of admission a repeat transthoracic echocardiogram showed normal biventricular function with persistent RCA dilatation. At day18 of the illness patient was discharged home as being clinically well， and on low-dose aspirin (3 mg/kg/d).\n\n【18】The above reported cases were presented during early winter， from different places of Kosovo， respectively， within 4 weeks of each other to different outer metropolitan hospitals.\n\n【19】Discussion\n\n【20】Kawasaki Disease (KD) is an acute vasculitis of unknown origin that involves predominantly the coronary arteries， is the leading condition causing acquired heart disease in industrialized countries and an important cause of long-term cardiac morbidity . Its etiology remains unknown， although specific viral agents or virus-like cytoplasmic inclusion bodies in tissues of KD patients have been implicated .\n\n【21】Kawasaki disease is the main cause of childhood-acquired cardiac disease in developed countries， with an incidence of 174 in 100，000per year in children less than 5 years of age， such as Japan. Children in the age group of 6 months to 5 years are the most susceptible The diagnosis of KD is based on clinical criteria established in 1993by the American Heart Association， according to which the most important criterion was the presence of fever for more than 5 days， together with at least four of the five principal criteria： bilateral non-purulent conjunctivitis， erythematous oral cavity， red fissured lips and “strawberry' tongue， polymorphous skin rash， cervical lymphadenopathy (usually unilateral)， erythema， and edema of the hands and feet. Additional findings in children with KD include irritability， mood alterations， gastrointestinal discomfort， diarrhea arthralgia/arthritis affecting large joints (30%)， hydrops of the gallbladder， and liver dysfunction.\n\n【22】CA involvement can range from transient mild dilatation or ectasia， occurring in up to 40% of patients， to giant Coronary Artery Aneurysms (CAA).\n\n【23】Standard treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin and aspirin reduces the incidence of coronary artery lesions from 20%to5%.\n\n【24】The mortality rate among children is less than 1%， with the most significant complications from ischemic cardiomyopathy presenting during the convalescent phase .\n\n【25】In the absence of diagnostic tests， identification of KD requires a high index of suspicion for the cardinal diagnostic features . In addition to fever lasting ≥ 5 days， the diagnosis is made with clinical features which include polymorphous rash， palmar and plantar edema of the extremities， non-exudative conjunctival injection， oral mucous membrane changes， and lymphadenopathy. The risk of thrombosis is very high when giant coronary aneurysms develop promptly . There is overlap in clinical features between TSS and KD， although shock and organ dysfunction are unusual features of KD. Non-invasive diagnostic imaging techniques， such as echocardiography and magnetic resonance imaging， may be helpful in diagnosing subclinical myocardial infarction . Cardiac dysfunction is a feature of TSS but CA dilatation and aneurysms have not been previously been reported in children and adults . Although our two patients presented with clinical features highly suggestive for TSS， they did not meet the criteria for diagnosis. Clinical presentation， laboratory analysis， and transthoracic findings were similar to the recently described KDSS， which is distinguished from \"classical KD by shock， hypotension and myocardial dysfunction. Thrombocytopenia and coagulation abnormalities， which are rarely seen in KD， appear common in KDSS .\n\n【26】Similarly， COVID-19 related MIS-C associated with shock can lead to a delay in diagnosing KDSS as there are common presentation features such as hemodynamic instabilityy。 hypotension， and myocardial dysfunction with fever. MIS-C responds rapidly to steroids and inotropic agents leading to the complete resolution of clinical symptoms without the need for IVIG. Nonetheless， giant coronary artery aneurysms rarely occur in the course of COVID-19 antibody positive infants even afterIVIGadministration .MIS-C-related shock commonly occurs with significantly elevated inflammatory markers， low platelet count， but without hypoalbuminemia， no peripheral extremity or mucosal changes， absent lymphadenopathy， and no evidence of sterile pyuria or thrombocytosis. Coronary artery involvement occurs more commonly with KDSS， and gallbladder hydrops is one of the characteristic features of KD .\n\n【27】However， the included studies were retrospective case-control studies， and some ofthe data reported in the literature were irregular or incomplete with potential publication bias， making the included sample size and data incomplete. The exploration of KDSS still needs prospective， large sample， and multicenter-joint researches. The symptoms of children with KDSS are basically in line with typical KD， yet with a longer duration of fever， more severe inflammatory indicators， and more cardiac abnormalities than non-shocked KD.\n\n【28】Conclusion\n\n【29】Our presented cases highlight that children with KD may present with a toxic shock-like illness.

Its quick identification in its typical presentation， the elimination of the most severe alternative diagnosis and its management must be known in order to be adapted to the athlete's sporting objectives. Atypical forms with slow recovery are rare and represent a real diagnostic challenge. We report the case of a professional rugby player who presented an atypical Stinger injury and detail its management. This original case is an opportunityto provide a comprehensive review of the different forms and presentations of these traumatic plexopathies and their management.\n\n【2】Keywords： Plexus brachial； Sport traua； Stinger；COVID-19\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Two main types of brachial plexus injuries are traditionally described： Obstetric brachial plexus paralysis and adult stretch injuries. Both are serious and require specialized care. A third case exists：The traumatic plexopathy of the brachial plexus， better known as Stinger injury or Burner injury. It is little known to the orthopedic surgeon， yet it is a very frequent and common injury in high-level contact athletes. Owen Farrell， England rugby halfback， said when he refused to come out on suspicion of a knockout during a match at the 2021 Six Nations Tournament： \"It’s just a stinger； it has nothing to do with me.\"\n\n【5】The classic injury mechanism is a direct impact on the shoulder involving the upper limb on one side and the head on the opposite side. This corresponds to the classic move made by a tackler in rugby. This result in compression and stretching of the brachial plexus， which in some cases can lead to a transient plexopathy of the brachial plexus called a stinger injury . Stinger in French \"dard\"refers to the symptomatology of the injury. The Stinger injury is described as an electric discharge running through the upper limb. The symptoms are generally resolved in 1 min to 2 min. They are characterized by an immediate sensation of burns and electric discharges going through the entire upper limb associated with an important weakness， even with a total paralysis of the upperlimb. In some cases， weakness of the upper limb persists over time， especially in the muscles innervated by the proximal roots (C5 and C6)； these symptoms may persist for several days or weeks .\n\n【6】The 2020/2021 COVID-19 epidemics highlight a certain neurotropism of this type of coronavirus. This tropism can be manifested by mononeuropathy or multifocal neuropathy . Beside the known attacks of the central nervous system and their symptoms such as anosmia or ageusia， a tropism of this virus for the nervous elements composing the brachial plexus has been highlighted .\n\n【7】Case Presentation\n\n【8】We present the case of a professional rugby player with a long recovery traumatic plexopathy in an athlete who was infected with the COVID-19 virus.\n\n【9】We then propose， based on the literature data， an update on the Stinger lesion in high-level athletes.\n\n【10】We present the case ofa professional rugby player of the \"Stade Francais”evolving as secondline in the French professional league. On November 29h， 2020 in a match following a tackle on the right shoulder ， he presented a Stinger injury characterized by a transient paralysis of the entire right upper limb associated with significant paresthesias. Within minutes of the accident， an almost complete regression of symptoms was noticed. Unlike the usual evolution of the Stinger injury， the patient presented persistent discomfort during training and weakness of the right upper limb motivating a consultation3 months after the trauma. During our clinical examination， we observed： Hypoesthesia of the shoulder stump， pain and muscle weakness major on the external rotators of the right shoulder， we also noted an irritative syndrome (pseudo-Tinel sign of the supra-clavicular region)， the overall being compatible with incomplete C5， C6 involvement.\n\n【11】Standard X-ray of the cervical spine， dynamic bilateral positional Doppler ultrasound，electroneuromyogram of both upper limbs and MRI ofthe right brachialplexus were performed in order to document the lesions and to eliminate a differential diagnosis (Parsonage Turner syndrome and thoracic-brachial outlet syndrome). The paraclinical evaluation was normal except for the brachial plexus MRI showing diffuse hyperfixation of the right brachial plexus. The diagnosis slow recovery Stinger lesion is therefore retained. The treatment consisted of rehabilitation in order to open the cervico-thoraco-brachial clamp associated with the prescription of low-dose pregabalin to treat the irritative syndrome. At 6 months after the trauma， the patient was seen in consultation. He presented a total regression of symptoms with， in particular， a strength in external rotation at 5/5 (symmetrical isometric test) as well as a normal sensitivity of the shoulder stump. However， there is still a mild supraclavicular irritation syndrome. The return to competitive sport was performed at 6 months with a “pad\" on the right shoulder as protective gear.\n\n【12】Discussion\n\n【13】Focus on the Stinger injury in high-level athletes\n\n【14】Kawasaki et al. have shown that 33.9% of professional rugby players experience at least one Stinger injury in a season， with a recurrence rate of 37.0% . Nevertheless， as these lesions are well known and commonplace among contact athletes， their incidence is probably underestimated .\n\n【15】The mechanism involved in most cases combines downward traction of the upper limb and forced lateral flexion of the head on the side opposite the injury. This mechanism leads to a stretching of the brachial plexus associated in certain cases with a foraminal compression of the nerve roots of the brachialplexus. These traumatic stretch injuries of the brachial plexus are classified according to the Seddon Sunderland classification . They are in the majority of cases type 1 (Neurapraxia) and rarely of type 2 (Axonotmesis). Type3 lesions (Neurotmesis) are not part of the Stingerlesions and belongs to the well-known management of tear out lesions of the brachial plexus .\n\n【16】Grade 1 lesions lead to a demyelination process without axonal damage. In grade 2 lesions， the axons and myelin sheath are affected leading to a process of Wallerian degeneration， but the Schwann cells as well as the perinerve and epinerve remain intact. As previously mentioned， the Stinger injury corresponds to an immediate sensation of burning and electrical discharges running through the entire upper limb associated with significant weakness or even total paralysis of the upper limb. In some cases， weakness persists in the upper limb， more marked in the muscles innervated by the proximal roots (C5and C6)， but it can also affect any of the muscles of the upper limb； these symptoms can persist for several weeks or even months .\n\n【17】Clinical examination and management\n\n【18】The context， the description of the symptoms， the spontaneous resolving character in less than two minutes and the experience of the lesions by the athlete easily allows to make the diagnosis of Stinger injury. In case of atypical symptoms (bilateral damage， damage to the lower limbs) or in case of doubt， it is needed to consider the trauma as a cervical spine damage (immediate immobilization with a cervical collar and exit on a stretcher) . The acute clinical examination should initially focus on eliminating differential diagnoses， such as cervical spine trauma or a shoulder girdle injury. Secondly， a complete motor and sensory examination of the upper limb concerned must be carried out， paying particular attention to the muscles innervated by the C6 and C7 roots， which are the most frequently affected.\n\n【19】As a matter of course， even in the typical injury cases， a complete clinical examination must be repeated after the game and regularly during the first two weeks. Indeed， a normal clinical examination in the acute phase does not prevent the occurrence of symptoms in the hours or days following the trauma . In case oftypicallesions，there is no indication to carry out further investigations. On the other hand， if the symptoms persist， the clinical examination must be repeated. It will try to asses' pain in the cervical spine， a sensory or motor deficit in the upper limb， the presence of a supra or infra clavicular pseudo Tinel's sign， an asymmetry of the radial pulse or a muscular atrophy especially in the shoulder (Deltoid， supra and infraspinous fossa) in order to eliminate a differential diagnosis.\n\n【20】After careful palpation of the cervical spine， a Spruling test is performed. If there is associated neck pain， the diagnosis can be guide to a cervical radicular damage . The Spruling test consists of applying compression，rotation and homo-lateral tilt to the lesion. The maneuver is positive when it triggers radicular symptoms in the upper limb. Patients with Stinger injury have no neck pain and a negative Spruling test .\n\n【21】The value of complementary investigation in Stinger injury is controversial. In cases of typical lesions with quick resolving symptoms， no further investigation is indicated.On the other hand， in case of persistent or recurrent symptoms or in case of doubt， imaging and electro-neuro-myograms can help to document the lesion and eliminate differential diagnoses.\n\n【22】Standard and dynamic cervical X-rays， as well as cervical MRI， are used to identify a spine facture， as well as cervical roots damage. Literature data seem to highlight anatomical predispositions of the cervical spine to the occurrence of Stinger injuries . Indeed， a higher incidence of foraminal or cervical canal stenosis has been found in athletes with repetitive Stinger injuries .\n\n【23】In case of persistent symptoms， we perform a dynamic arterial and venous positional Doppler ultrasound in order to rule out a cervicothoracic outlet syndrome.\n\n【24】The ENMG performed after 6 weeks in case of \"long stinger\"allows on the one hand to eliminate a pre-ganglionic damage of the brachial plexus and on the other hand to specify， if any， the level of the damage .\n\n【25】Brachial plexus MRI is also only performed in cases of \"long Stinger\" and if all other investigations are normal. Hypersignal of the involved roots is currently found in stretch lesions of the brachial plexus14.\n\n【26】Management and return to sport\n\n【27】The management of these injuries is mainly based on physical rest， pain management and rehabilitation.\n\n【28】Feinberg et al.  propose an algorithm of management and return to sport according to the type of injury following the Sunderland classification .\n\n【29】Grade 1 lesions (Neurapraxia) are divided into three categories related to the severity of the symptoms. The lesion known as \"mild grade 1\" is defined by an immediate regression of the symptoms. In this context the sports activity can be continued immediately. In the case of \"moderate grade 1\" injuries， the symptoms persist during the sporting activity and end after the match， while in the case of \"severe grade 1\"injuries， the symptoms persist for over 24 h. In moderate or severe injury， the sport activity must be stopped， the clinical exam must be repeated regularly and the paraclinicals investigations in order to eliminate a trauma of the cervical rachis must be carried out. The return to sport can be considered as soon as the symptoms disappear.\n\n【30】For Sunderland's grade 2 lesions， sports activity must be stopped immediately for 15 days minimum. The clinical exam must be repeated.\n\n【31】Paraclinical investigation are performed for cervical spine trauma， an EMG should be performed if symptoms persist for more than 15days. The return to sport can be considered as soon as the symptoms regress and paraclinicals investigations are normal.\n\n【32】In order to reduce the incidence of spine and nerve injuries， sports federations have progressively changed the rules of high-risk sports by being more and more restrictive and by sanctioning risky behaviors more severely. For example， at rugby，head-on tackles， high tackles and tackles above the waist are now prohibited in France and in most international competitions.\n\n【33】Regardingequipment， although their benefits are not scientifically validated， wearing \"pads\" on the shoulders in order to absorb shocks and the use of medical devices limiting hyperextension such as the“Cowboy-Collar\" for American soccer players are becoming more and more common 16.\n\n【34】Conclusion\n\n【35】The damage to the nervous system due to the neurotropism of COVID-19， although still unknown， seems to be more and more described and documented， the most common disorders are anosmia and agueusia. In addition to these， mononeuropathy or multifocal peripheral neuropathy have been described. Plexus lesions in patients with severe covid-19 infection were initiallyanalyzed as \"resuscitation neuropathies\"and consequences of prone sessions. The existence of a few cases of the upper limb deficits in patients who have not had any prone sessions has suggested the existence of a COVID-19 tropism for the nervous elements of the brachial plexus.\n\n【36】In our case the athlete had a positive COVID-19 PCR test on9/11/2020，during a systematicscreening of an official competition.He had no symptoms and was able to return to training and competition as soon as the regulatory isolation was over.\n\n【37】The occurrence of a stinger lesion in a professional athlete who played rugby intensively andhad neverpresented this symptomatology， brought us to search an additional subjacent lesion. The MRI showed diffuse damage to the roots of the brachial plexus.\n\n【38】We are unable to state that the lesion developed by the player is related to his contamination by COVID-19. But this leads us to wonder： \"Did a neurotropism of the COVID-19 virus in the brachial plexus facilitate the occurrence of a Stinger lesion and slow down his recuperation?", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [{"text": "16", "content": "【0】Abstract\n\n【1】The traumatic plexopathy of the brachial plexus， called Stinger lesion， is little known to the orthopedic surgeon， yet it is a very frequent and common injury in high-level contact athletes.

Historically this term was used to describe those with microangiopathic hemolytic anemia， thrombocytopenia and renal failure not associated with diarrhea. But now it is used to describe the complement mediated Thrombotic Microangiopathy (TMA) which does not have ADAMTS13 deficiency or documented shiga toxin as an etiological agent. aHUS is generally associated with genetic or acquired defect of regulation of complement on host cells. In aHUS， infections are usually considered as trigger and not the causes of disease . Secondary HUS is associated with Streptococcus pneumonia and influenza virus， apart from transplantation， cancer， cytotoxic drugs， autoimmune diseases and pregnancy . These infections are considered as causes of HUS and not just triggers.\n\n【2】In normal homeostasis， factor H and factor I are the regulatory molecules interacting with activated complement factors like C3b， thereby protecting red cells， platelets and endothelial cells fromlysis . If this fails， then the disbalance between activation and regulation may cause formation of membrane attack complexes on platelets and endothelial cells leading to platelet activation and endothelial damage respectively. This may trigger activation of coagulation system along with platelet aggregation leading to microthrombi formation within the vasculature. Thus aHUS can be perceived as severe complement dysregulation attacking red cells， platelets and endothelial cells in contact with plasma . The typical clinical trial of Microangiopathic Hemolytic Anemia (MAHA)， thrombocytopenia and organ damage in aHUS is a complement mediated process； hence it is logical that therapeutic complement inhibition may be effective in aHUS.\n\n【3】In Mumbai， malaria is rampant and endemic. We have a severe and rare not previously reported case of P. vivax induced aHUS.\n\n【4】An 18-year-old Indian male， presented to local facility for fever with chills and was treated as uncomplicated malarial fever. He was given chloroquine， amoxicillin clavulanate， and subsequently primaquine after confirming normal Glucose 6 Phosphate Dehydrogenase (G6PD) test. The patient was transferred to LTMGH hospital a week later for generalized weakness， persistent fever and oliguria. Physical examination showed blood pressure of 112/70 mmHg， subconjunctival hemorrhage， facial puffiness and mild icterus. His rapid malarial antigen test was positive， complete blood count revealed hemoglobin of 9.4 g/dl， WBC count 11500/pl， platelets of 47000/p1l. Peripheral smear showed schistocytes， helmet cells， spherocytes， reticulocytosis， and low platelets . The laboratory investigation revealed Total bilirubin 5.2 mg/dL， indirect bilirubin 2.6 mg/dL，serum Aspartate Transaminase (AST) and serum Alanine Transaminase (ALT) were 93 units/L and 92units/L respectively. Blood urea nitrogen was 48 mg/dL and creatinine 6.1 mg/dL. Serum Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH) 1278 U/L (ref： 140-250 U/L). Investigation for iron deficiency anemia showed normal serum iron-78 mcg/dL (ref： 50-150)， total iron binding capacity (TIBC)-345 mcg/dL (ref： 300-350). Prothrombin time was 11.2 sec (control <13) and International Normalized Ratio (INR) 1.0 (control<1.25)， Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (APTT) 28.6 sec ， fibrinogen 337 mg/dL. Other serological tests for common coexistent infections like dengue and leptospirosis were negative. Urine routine microscopy showed Red blood cells 10-15/hpf， Epithelial cells 1-2/hpf， Pus cells 4-5/hpf. Ultrasonography showed normal sized kidneys. ADAMTS 13 levels were 114.21% normal (50% to 160%).\n\n【5】On day four of his admission， creatinine increased to 7.9 mg/dl and blood urea nitrogen to 120 mg/dL， and he developed oligoanuria with respiratory distress. Patient was intubated and put on ventilatory support. Hemodialysis was initiated and patient was given alternate day hemodialysis and received packed red cells transfusion in view of persistent hemolysis and resultant low hemoglobin. He was given Inj. artesunate 2.4 mg/kg loading dose， followed by 1.2 mg/kg for 7 days， inj. ceftriaxone 1g antiemetics， antipyretics， and supportive care in ICU. Initially there was no response to hemodialysis with persistent oliguria. He required mechanical ventilation for seven days. After nine days of initiation of hemodialysis， urine output began to improve and creatinine reduced to 3.5 mg/dl and urinary output increased to 2500 ml/24 h on day 13of admission. He was discharged on day 20 with Hemoglobin of 9.9g/dl， creatinine 1.1 mg/dl and absent schistocytes in peripheral smear.\n\n【6】Discussion\n\n【7】Microangiopathy is now seen not only in hematology but also in rheumatology and infectious diseases. Malaria which is well known for hemolysis has not yet been described to cause AHUS.\n\n【8】According to world malaria report of 2017， number of malaria cases reported from India is 1.3 million and deaths at 23，990 . The incidence of acute renal failure due to malaria in India is around4% to 17.2%. Renal manifestations range from mild proteinuria aniddurinary ssediment abnormalities， acutee1tubularr necrosis， glomerulonephritis and acute interstitial nephritis， all leading to acutekidney injury. The mechanisms for renal involvement are many including microcirculation blockade by parasitized RBC leading to acute renal insufficiency， immune system activation leading to complement activation causing immune complex deposition and glomerulonephritis as well as a secondary hemolytic uremic syndrome. Cortical necrosis has also been described in malaria .\n\n【9】Complement activation is central in aHUS； release of C5 a along with increased activity of tissue factor produces a procoagulant state of endothelium. ADAMTS13 is zinc containing metalloproteinase enzyme acting as von Wille Brand (vWF) factor cleaving protease. This helps to keep in checkvWF polymers in plasma. Low ADAMTS13levels would be seen in congenital or acquired Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP) which would be close differential. This patient had classical microangiopathy， severe renal failure and a normal ADAMTS13 fulfilling the criteria for aHUS. This hospital is a 1500 bedded Municipal General Hospital in Mumbai in the state of Maharashtra. There is frequently an inability to procure a medication， because sometimes it's not licensed or unavailable for this institution. The use of eculizumab to reverse the complement mediated disease has been well described for aHUS， paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria， and generalized myasthenia gravis and even in other disorders like Guillain Barre Syndrome where complement mediated demyelination is implicated . The occurrence of TMA in this case of complicated malaria attributed to aHUS brings the important role of complement system in picture. Eculizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks terminal complement by binding to C5. Early use of eculizumab in such patient can help in recovery from renal failure， prevent the need of hemodialysis and also reduce the mortality inherently associated with such illness. If eculizumab was available we would have used it even without our ability to be secure that this was a complement mediated aHUS (by demonstration of reduced factor H and I activity). Therefore， dialysis was the only option along with supportive therapy as eculizumab was not available for a therapeutic intervention. Fortunately this patient recovered from his renal failure. As malaria is a common entity in India，onehas to be aware of AHUS as a rare and dreaded complication of malaria. Eculizumab， if and when available would be the drug of choice.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 11:17:43", "endTime": "2024/09/24 11:18:46", "cost": 63.274}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:30", "update_time": "2024-09-23 19:18:45", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 19:17:42"}

The routine coagulation profile consists of Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (APTT)， Prothrombin Time (PT)， and International Normalized Ratio (INR).\n\n【5】Deranged coagulation profile is commonly seen in critically ill patients due to severe sepsis， Disseminated Intravascular Coagulopathy (DIVC)， and drug-induced. It complicates the management of critically ill patients requiring surgical intervention. Transfusion of Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP)and other blood products such as cryoprecipitate and platelet concentrate is indicated prior operation to prevent severe bleeding intra- and post-operatively.\n\n【6】Uncorrected coagulation profile despite transfusion of blood products should raise the suspicion of alternative diagnoses such as Lupus Anticoagulant (LA)， which is not uncommonly reported in critically ill patients. It is usually characterized by a persistent prolonged APTT despite correction. However， strong LA can present with a prolonged APTT，PT and INR\n\n【7】Case Presentation\n\n【8】A 54-year-old man was admitted for sepsis secondary to infected right Below-Knee-Amputation stump (BKA). He had a background history of ischemic heart disease and diabetes mellitus with End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) on regular hemodialysis and history of right BKA for diabetic foot ulcer.\n\n【9】As he was in severe sepsis， he required urgent Above-Knee-Amputation (AKA). However， his preoperative coagulation profile was deranged with prolonged Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (APTT) 131.9 sec， PT 35.3 sec， and International Normalized Ratio (INR) 3.70. Full blood counts showed hemoglobin 9.2 g/dL， white cell count 21×10/L，and platelet count 502×10/L. He was not on heparin or any anticoagulant.\n\n【10】Initial impression was coagulopathy secondary to sepsis. Despite transfusion with Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP)，his coagulation profile worsened with the highest APTT>180 sec and INR 10 without any bleeding event. APTT and PT were not corrected by immediate and 2 h incubation mixing tests， with factor VIII level of 600% and hyperfibrinogenemia. These findings were suggestive of strong LA.\n\n【11】Intravenous methylprednisolone was administered， and plasmapheresis was performed twice\n\n【12】Table 1： Serial coagulation profile monitoring.\n\n| Day of Admission  | Coagulation Profile  |  |  | Remarks  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Day of Admission  | APTT (second)  | PT (second)  | INR  | Remarks  |\n| Day 1  | 52.9  | 16.1  | 1.31  |  |\n| Day 3  | 131.9  | 35.3  | 3.7  |  |\n| Day 4  | 112.6  | 43.5  | 4.87  | Transfused 2 units FFP  |\n| Day 5  | 135.6  | 46.3  | 5.29  | Transfusec 4 units FFP  |\n| Day 6  | 133.5  | 47.8  | 5.52  | Transfusec 2 units FFP  |\n| Day 7  | 155.7  | 50.4  | 5.92  |  |\n| Day 8  | 169  | 48.9  | 5.69  |  |\n| Day 10  | 137.3  | 49.1  | 5.72  |  |\n| Day 13  | 176.8  | 51.5  | 6.1  |  |\n| Day 14  | >180  | 62.1  | 7.8  | Transfusec 2 units FFP  |\n| Day 15  | >180  | 65.5  | 8.37  | Transfused 2 units FFP  |\n| Day 16  | >180  | 49.5  | 5.78  |  |\n| Day 17  | 146.4  | 46.4  | 5.31  | Startec onVMethylprednisolone 50mg OD  |\n| Day 18  | >180  | 69.5  | 9.05  |  |\n| Day 19  | 116.4  | 45.2  | 5.12  | Plasmapheresis x1  |\n| Day 20  | 98.4  | 51.1  | 6.03  | Plasmapheresis x2  |\n| Day 21  | >180  | 53.5  | 6.4  |  |\n| Day 22  | >180  | 75.4  | 10.08  | Went in for operation AKA  |\n| Day 23  | 75.1  | 37.4  | 4  | Day 1 post operation  |\n\n【14】APTT： Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time： PT： Prothrombin Time； INR：International Normalized Ratio； FFP： Fresh Frozen Plasma； AKA： Above Knee Amputation with transient improvement in the coagulation profile. However， the levels became deranged again with APTT>180 sec， PT 75.4 sec， and INR 10.08.\n\n【15】With the impression of acquired LA， AKA was performed with preoperative tranexamic acid， desmopressin，and platelet transfusion for platelet dysfunction in ESRD. The surgery was successfully carried out with an estimated blood loss of 400 ml. Day 1 post-operative， his APTT was 75.1 sec， PT 37.4 sec， and INR 4.00.\n\n【16】LA confirmatory test revealed a positive Staclot LA and a prolonged Dilute Russell's viper venom time of 181.2 sec.\n\n【17】Discussion\n\n【18】A deranged coagulation profile can be due to factor deficiency， presence of specific factor inhibitor or LA. Identification of the underlying cause is important as some disorders increase the risk of bleeding while the others are prothrombotic. The initial approach to a prolonged APTT or PT is to rule out an artefactual abnormality due to a mixture of heparin solution with blood， use of anticoagulant， or due to liver disease . An additional test that can be done is a mixing test to differentiate between a coagulation factor deficiency and the presence of an inhibitor.\n\n【19】LA is an inhibiting antibody which causes prolonged APTT in vitro despite its prothrombotic activity. In sepsis， DIVC is the foremost important diagnosis of coagulopathy. However， persistently deranged coagulation profiles in a non-bleeding patient， which are not corrected with FFP transfusion or vitamin K should raise the suspicion of LA. Although rare， acquired LA is one of the possible differential diagnoses and has been reported in literature to be frequently developed in critically ill patients .\n\n【20】Lupus Anticoagulant-Hypoprothrombinemia Syndrome(LAHS) should be considered in LA with a prolonged PT and INR An acquired factor II deficiency in association with the acquired lupus anticoagulant complicates the management further as it may predispose the patient to both thrombosis and severe bleeding . PT is usually relatively insensitive to LA；however， a strong LA might give rise to a falsely increased PT . A factor II level and an uncorrected PT mixing test can help to differentiate a strong lupus anticoagulant from LAHS.\n\n【21】Managing a sick patient with the presence of LA and deranged coagulation profile who needs a surgical intervention may pose a big dilemma for the surgeons and physicians. In the present case， surgical intervention is the definitive management in acquired LA associated with severe sepsis from the infected stump. Improvement of the coagulation profile post-operatively indicated the infected stump was the most likely source of LA formation. Therefore， it is imperative to diagnose acquired LA as they differ in the coagulability state especially in the decision for surgical intervention and in critically ill patients whom the risk of thromboembolic event is high.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 11:37:15", "endTime": "2024/09/24 11:37:23", "cost": 8.4}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:30", "update_time": "2024-09-23 19:37:23", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 19:37:14"}

If not managed appropriately it can lead to chronic pain and suffering. This case report presents a 55-year-old postman who was seen in the clinic complaining of persistent pain over the instep of his right foot with no history of trauma. His pain was localized to the first metatarsophalangeal joint with some radiation to the heel. MRI revealed an isolated avulsion fracture ofthe first metatarsal， which was initially missed on X-ray. In this case， the patient was successfully treated with a mixture of steroid and local anesthetic injections. Following our intervention， the Manchester Oxford Foot Questionnaire reduced from 33 to 0. The goal of this article is to raise awareness of this rare finding for doctors who may face this in A&E， Orthopedic clinics or at a GP practice.\n\n【2】Keywords： Avulsion fracture； Peroneus longus； Conservative management\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】An isolated fracture of the peroneus longus tendon at the base of thelst metatarsal joint is a rare entity often unable to diagnose using X-ray upon the initial presentation. There is no gold standard treatments by which these injuries can be managed. Various case reports have shown where surgeons have used a combination of their own personal preference and the clinical picture in front ofthem. Management options vary from conservative using a lower leg cast  and restricted physical exertion with regular follow up . In the case of failed conservative management we must also consider surgery which includes percutaneous fixation ， or excision of the non-healed fracture fragment and arthrodesis . This case therefore possesses both a diagnostic and management challenge to doctors who face it.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】This case report brings to light a 55-years-old postman who presented to clinic with pain in his right foot for over two months. The pain was confined to the right first metatarsophalangeal joint with occasional radiation to instep and over the heel. This pain was in association with occasional cramping in his right calf muscle and was aggravated by standing or walking and relieved at rest. There was no history of trauma to his foot and this pain was insidious in onset.\n\n【7】Upon examination he was able to stand erect with plantigrade feet. There was a prominent bunion over the right foot. Both heels were in normal valgus alignment and went into varus on standing at the tip of toes.\n\n【8】Further examination revealed the patient was tender over the posteromedial aspect of calf just above the heel and as well as at the knot of Henry. It was noted that the pain got worse on hyperextension at the first metatarsophalangealjoint. The patient also had hallux valgus of moderate degree that was partially correctable. The affected foot itself demonstrated a satisfactory range of motion at the ankle， subtalar， mid foot and forefoot. The distal neurovascular status was found to be unremarkable.\n\n【9】Based on this examination the initial impression was tendinosis of the flexor hallucis longus. To confirm this diagnosis and rule out any other bony injury an MRI scan was requested of the right foot and ankle. Imaging revealed an avulsion of peroneus longus tendon at base of first metatarsal with a possible non-union as well .\n\n【10】This case was further discussed in the regional foot and ankle meeting. The outcome was to inject the painful nonunion located at the base of the 1st metatarsal on the plantar surface of the foot with a mixture of local anesthetic and steroid injections. Post-procedure there remained no neurovascular deficit. The patient was reviewed at three months and his pain score and functional outcome improved significantly. Moreover following our intervention， the Manchester Oxford Foot Questionnaire (MOXFQ) reduced from 33 to 0. At the one year follow up he remained symptom free and discharged.\n\n【11】Discussion\n\n【12】The peroneus longus tendon has a role in eversion and plantar flexion of foot along with providing stabilization to arches of foot . The pattern of injury to this tendon is based on two factors one is the mechanism of insult， if injured， and second is the variation in the insertion pattern of peroneus longus tendon itself. The common agreed mechanism of injury is forced dorsiflexion and inversion .\n\n【13】Moreover， the shear tensile force on the peroneus longus tendon is also considered as a contributory factor to injury . During cadaveric dissection a variation in tendon insertion has also been identified which includes insertion at the lateral aspect of cuboid and lateral aspect of calcaneum， fifth metatarsal bone and fibular trochlea of calcaneum as well .\n\n【14】Although both operative and conservative methods of treatment have been documented in the literature with a variability of success rates， the choice varies on the type of injury， treating surgeon and most importantly the patient. There are some notable factors which do favor non-operativetreatment compared to surgery. These in volve the size and displacement of fracture. Studies show small fragments or minimally displaced， undisplaced or multi fragmental fracture patterns will do better with non-operative treatment .\n\n【15】Hodor et aldescribes a non-weight bearing strategy of conservative treatment as a choice of regimen for this type of injury however， Zematten et al. findings were not supportive of this therapy as they were of the view that patient will represent with a painful non-union at six months and will require excision of the bony fragment along with arthrodesis following a trial conservative treatment .\n\n【16】Literature regarding the role of physiotherapy in relation to these injuries is limited and at the moment there are no specific guidelines in practice. Some researchers have claimed to treat chronic ankle pain in patients following multiple subtle injuries to their joint by means of physiotherapy to provide an improved functional ability .\n\n【17】Conclusion\n\n【18】To conclude isolated avulsion fracture of peroneus longus tendon insertion are rare injuries and it is important to be aware of such injuries when patients present with pain over the instep. Mixed injections of local anesthesia and steroids was a successful way of managing un-united avulsion fracture ofperoneus longus in this case however it is important to always take patient selection and clinical judgment into account in managing such injuries.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 10:41:28", "endTime": "2024/09/24 10:41:39", "cost": 10.593}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:30", "update_time": "2024-09-23 18:41:39", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 18:41:27"}

Histologically they appear as small round blue cells， but this is nonspecific with broad differentials. The ESWR1 break-apart rearrangement using fluorescence in-situ hybridization is pathognomonic for Ewing’s sarcoma. Patients with extra skeletal Ewing sarcoma family have a poor prognosis， with median survival ranging between 8 to 15 months in two different case series. Among patients with cancer，approximately 5% develop a critical illness requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission. We report a case of a young female who developed acute respiratory failure secondary to this rare malignancy that required intensive care treatment. Unlike other reported cases， our patient had a large lung and mediastinal mass with pleura but no bony involvement， associated massive pleural effusion necessitating chest tube insertion， subsequent intensive care admission with invasive ventilatory support. This case highlights the importance of supportive intensive care needed to treat this aggressive disease mainly affecting children and young adults.\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Cancer patients who require treatment in the intensive care unit (ICU) is growing. In a large retrospective observational study using cancer registry data in the United Kingdom， 5% of cancer patients developed a critical illness and were admitted to an ICU within 2 years of cancer diagnosis. A multicenter study in Brazil found that sepsis and respiratory failure accounted for 15% and10% respectively of ICU admissions in cancer patients .\n\n【4】Sarcomas are a rare group of malignant connective tissue tumors that make up approximately1% of all adult malignancies .In a retrospective study involving 212 patients over 8 years，the most common sarcoma subgroups admitted to the ICU were unclassified high-grade sarcoma (25%)， bone sarcoma (Ewing sarcoma， osteosarcoma， and chondrosarcoma； 17.4%)， vascular sarcoma(angiosarcoma and epithelioid hemangioendothelioma； 9.9%)，and leiomyosarcoma (7.6%).\n\n【5】Extra skeletal Ewing Sarcoma presenting as a large left sided lung/mediastinal mass requiring intensive care had not been described. We report a unique case of a young female who developed acute respiratory failure secondary to this rare malignancy that required intensive care treatment.\n\n【6】Case Presentation\n\n【7】This was a 30-year-old Indonesian female who was admitted in our hospital， a large tertiary hospital in Singapore. She was a non-smoker/non-drinker with no known past medical history and had no family history of malignancy， tuberculosis， or autoimmune disorder. She presented with dry cough for a month， associated with worsening shortness of breath and left sided pleuritic chest pain. This was accompanied by a loss of appetite and weight over the past 3 weeks.\n\n【8】On examination， she was tachypneic and lethargic， temperature 36.8°C， blood pressure 113/65mmHg， heart rate 97 per minute， pulse oximetry reading 98% on supplemental oxygen at 2 L/min. There were reduced breath sounds in the left lung， and no lymph nodes or breast lumps were palpable.\n\n【9】She had opacification of the left hemithorax with contralateral trachea shift on erect chest radiograph ， with massive pleural effusion found on ultrasound. A chest tube was placed which drained 1350 ml of hemoserous fluid. The pleural fluid was exudative by Light's criteria and lymphocytic (80%) on analysis. Fluid lactate de hydrogenase (LDH) was elevated at 962 U/L and fluid pH was 7.32. Fluid acid fast bacilli smear was negative and no growth was obtained from fluid bacterial cultures.\n\n【10】Computed tomography of the thorax， abdomen and pelvis showed a large heterogeneous mass in the left hemithorax and mediastinum， encasing the left main bronchus causing collapse of the left lung. There was a filling defect in the left main pulmonary artery， which was also encased by tumor. Extensive nodular pleural thickening in the left hemithorax was present， inseparable from the mass. There was also a moderate sized pericardial effusion. No bony erosions were identified. Enlarged upper left para-aortic nodes were noted with a short axis diameter of 1.6 cm. An ill-defined hypodense lesion was noted in the segment IVB of the liver measuring 1.8 cm x 1.4 cm. No enhancing cerebral masses were noted on subsequent contrasted computed tomography of the brain.\n\n【11】She underwent a radiological-guided lung biopsy. The specimen was fixed in 10% neutral formalin and embedded in paraffin. Sections(4-micron thick) were cut and stained with hematoxylin-eosin and periodic acid-schiff (PAS).\n\n【12】The core biopsy showed sheets of small， round， and blue cells， divided into irregular lobules by fibrous stroma. The tumor cells possessed scant cytoplasm and small nucleoli. At least two rosette-like formations were identified. Some rounded globule material in the cytoplasm was highlighted by the PAS stain.\n\n【13】Immunohistochemical studies using commercial antibodies listed in Table 1 was performed. Protocols recommended by the manufacturers were used. Appropriate positive and negative controls were included. The tumor appeared to be diffusely positive with CD99 ， and was positive for CD56. The tumor cells were negative for AE1/3， CAM5.2， EMA， (CD45)LCA， CD79A， CD3， CD20， TdT， TTF-1， S100， Desmin， Synaptophysin， Chromogranin and ALK-1， which negate the differential diagnosis of an epithelial/ neuroendocrine carcinoma， lymphoma， and other ‘small round blue cell tumors'such as synovial sarcoma， desmoplastic small round cell tumors and rhabdomyosarcoma. The ki-67 proliferation index was high (around 10% to 15%).\n\n【14】A fluorescence in situ (FISH) study for EWSR1 (EWS RNA-binding protein 1) gene rearrangement with a break-apart 22q12probe (test developed by the Cytogenetics Laboratory， Department of Pathology， Singapore General Hospital) was performed. These dual-color fluorescent labeled probes hybridize the telomeric and centromeric flanking regions of EWSR1. Where fusion signals exist， no break apart is present. Cells with split signals are considered positive for the ESWR1 break-apart rearrangement， which is present in this case . These findings were pathognomonic for Ewing's sarcoma in this context.\n\n【15】During her admission， she was later noted to be drowsy and found to be hypercapnic. She was intubated for type 2 respiratory failure and mechanically ventilated in the intensive care unit. Repeat chest radiograph showed a new right lower zone consolidation， so she was started on intravenous meropenem for hospital acquired pneumonia.\n\n【16】She was consequentlyinitiated on chemotherapywith Vincristine， Doxorubicin， Cyclophosphamide， and received granulocyte-colony stimulating factor post-chemotherapy. Her hospital course was complicated by diarrhea secondary to Clostridiumn difficile infection. This eventually resolved， and she was transferred back to her home country to continue further chemotherapy. Unfortunately， she was lost to follow up since then.\n\n【17】Discussion\n\n【18】This case report highlights the challenges managing a rare aggressive tumor in a young female patient.\n\n【19】Table 1： Antibodies used for the characterisation of the small round blue cell tumour.\n\n| Antigen  | Source  | Product Code  | Clone  | Antigen Retrieval Method  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| AE1/3  | DAKO  | M3515  | AE1 and AE3  | Enzyme  |\n| CD3  | NOVOCASTRA  | NCL-L-CD3-565  | LN10  | HIFR  |\n| CD5  | NOVOCASTRA  | NCL-L-CD5-4C7  | 4C7  | HIFR  |\n| CD20  | DAKO  | M0755  | L26  | HIFR  |\n| CD45  | DAKO  | M0701  | 2B11+PD7/26  | HIFR  |\n| CD56  | NOVOCASTRA  | PA0191  | CD564  | HIFR  |\n| CD79a  | DAKO  | M7050  | JCB117  | HIFR  |\n| CK19  | DAKO  | M0888  | RCK108  | HIFR  |\n| Chromogranin A  | DAKO  | M0869  | DAK-A3  | HIFR  |\n| Desmin  | DAKO  | M0760  | D33  | HIFR  |\n| EMA  | DAKO  | M0613  | E29  | HIFR  |\n| Ki67  | DAKO  | M7240  | MIB1  | HIFR  |\n| P16  | Ventana  | 705-4713  | E6H4  | HIFR  |\n| S100  | DAKO  | Z0311  | Polyclonal  | Enzyme  |\n| Synaptophysin  | NOVOCASTRA  | NCL-L-SYNAP-299  | 27G12  | HIFR  |\n| TdT  | NOVOCASTRA  | NCL-L-TdT-339  | SEN28  | HIFR  |\n| TTF-1  | NOVOCASTRA  | NCL-L-TTF-1  | SPT24  | HIFR  |\n| EBER-ISH  | NOVOCASTRA  | AR0833  | N.A  | Enzyme  |\n| CD99  | NOVOCASTRA  | NCL-CD99  | H.1  | HIER  |\n| ALK  | Ventana  | 790-4794  | D5F3  | HIFR  |\n\n【21】EMA： Epithelial Membrane Antigen， TDT： Terminal Deoxynucleatidyl Transferase； TTF-1： Thyroid Transcription Factor-1； EBER-ISH： Epstein-Barr Virus-Encoded Small RNAs-Insitu Hybridisation； ALK： Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase， HIER： Heat-Induced Epitope Retrieval. \"Sources were as follows： Dako： Dako Denmark A/S， Glostrup， Denmark； Novocastra： Novocastra， Leica Biosystems Newcastle Ltd， Newcastle， United Kingdom； Ventana： Ventana Medical Systems Inc， Arizona， USA.\n\n【22】Small blue round cell tumors have a typical clear cytoplasm on hematoxylin and eosin staining， due to the presence of glycogen. The differentials of small round blue cell tumors are broad， including Ewingsarcoma1family，lymphoma，small-cellosteosarcoma， mesenchymal chondrosarcoma， dedifferentiated synovial sarcoma， desmoplastic small round cell tumors and rhabdomyosarcoma .\n\n【23】In 1979， Askin et al.  described an aggressive primitive neuro ectodermal tumor (PNET) of the thoracopulmonary region primarily involving children and young adults. The most common radiographic manifestation is a chest wall soft-tissue density mass， sometimes associated with rib erosion with or without pleural effusion . Over the past decades， the Ewing sarcoma family of tumors is classified according to their histologic appearance from undifferentiated Ewing sarcoma (ES)， to atypical poorly differentiated ES and differentiated PNET.\n\n【24】In the 2013 World Health Organization classification of tumors of soft tissue and bone ， the term PNET was removed to minimize confusion with the histologically and genetically different PNET of the central nervous system and female genital tract.\n\n【25】The Ewing sarcoma family of tumors (ESFT) share similar immunohistochemistry， and is positive for MIC2 surface antigen(CD99 gene). Cytogenetically， the translocation t  (q24； q12) is pathognomonic， occurs in 85% of cases and gives rise to the formation of the EWS-FLI 1 fusion gene which is detected by FISH.\n\n【26】A Korean case series of 70 patients studied over 17 years reported the characteristics of extra skeletal Ewing sarcoma. Most primary tumors manifested as large and bulky soft-tissue masses (mean size，9.0 cm； range， 1.3 cm to 23.0 cm)， frequently invading adjacent organs (45.6%) and showed heterogeneous enhancement (73.7%)， a well-defined (66.7%) margin， and partial necrosis or cystic degeneration(81.9%). Metastasis was most frequent to lymph nodes (75.9%)， followed by bone (31.0%)， lung (20.7%)， abdominal solid organs(13.8%)， peritoneum (13.8%)，pleura (6.9%)， and brain (3.4%).\n\n【27】Ewing sarcoma family of tumors is highly aggressive， with common local recurrence and distant metastases. The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) tumor， node and metastases (TMN) staging systems  for primary tumors of bone and soft tissue sarcoma are not widely used for Ewing family of tumors， but are sometimes used for staging of Askin's tumors. Using the AJCC TNM staging system for soft tissue sarcoma ， our patient would be classified to have T2b (deep tumor/mediastinal involvement)， likely N1 (involvement of para-aortic and axillary regional nodes)， and M1with possible liver metastasis， consistent with stage III disease， stage IV ifhistologicallyconfirmed distant spread. tumors that arise outside skin or subcutaneous sites have a worse prognosis . Standard guidelines are absent for the treatment of Askin's tumors. However the main stay of treatment based on case series includes neo adjuvant chemotherapy， surgical resection  and adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy .\n\n【28】The median survival in Askin’s first case series  was 8 months. A Chinese case series of 11 patients (mean age 14.5 years old， range8-22 years old) with Askin tumor found that the median survival for combined (chemotherapy-surgery-radiotherapy) treatment was 15months. Poor prognosis was associated with tumor diameter >5 cm， LDH levels >240 U/l and late stage (stage III or IV) tumors .\n\n【29】The overall survival in sarcoma in the ICU is comparable with other critically ill patients with other solid tumors . However， among patients with multiple organ failures， cancer patients had higher mortality rates than non-cancer patients . In a retrospective study performed in a large cancer hospital in the United States， the mortality rate for sarcoma in the ICU was 23% (95%CI， 16.9% to29.6%)， which rose to 59% at six months . Acute respiratory failure is the most common cause of ICU admission in cancer patients， and often leads to mechanical ventilation， however，survival remains poor.\n\n【30】Unlike other reported cases， our patient had a large lung and mediastinal mass with pleura but no bony involvement， associated massive pleural effusion necessitating chest tube insertion， intensive care admission with in vasive ventilatory support. This case highlights the importance of supportive intensive care needed to treat this aggressive disease mainly affecting children and young adults. In youngpatients with expected good lung reserve， respiratory symptoms may manifest late in the natural progression of Askin tumors without external chest wall signs. Careful respiratory examination followed by an initial chest radiograph can possibly detect this devastating tumor at an earlier stage.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 10:26:20", "endTime": "2024/09/24 10:26:33", "cost": 12.615}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:30", "update_time": "2024-09-23 18:26:32", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 18:26:19"}

However，its effectiveness is obtained only in 30% to 50% of cases. In the literature， few studies have established therapeutic strategies in these ultra resistant schizophrenic patients.\n\n【2】In this clinical case report， we discuss effectiveness of the addition of Aripiprazole to Clozapine as a therapeutic alternative in the treatment of ultra resistant schizophrenia. The effectiveness of this association could be explained by a complementarity of the two molecules in the dopaminergic and serotonergic pathways .\n\n【3】Clinical Description\n\n【4】We report the case of Mr. A.T， 44 years old， married since one year， having academic grade level， without any somatic illness and no alcohol or psychoactive substance behavior. He suffers from paranoid schizophrenia since the age of 30 years and he was followed since 2005 in psychiatric department of Sousse. He was admitted in 2005 in psychiatric unity during four months for resistant auditory hallucination. The diagnosis of resistant schizophrenia was retained and the patient was treated with 900 mg/day Clozapine without side effects.\n\n【5】Mr. A.T had a good adherence treatment. Compliance has been verified using questionnaire administrated to the patient and a member of his family and using compliance items (items 9，Aand B) of the Schedule for the Assessment of Insight -Expanded version (SAI-E).\n\n【6】To evaluate efficacy of treatment， we used the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS)， the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptom (SANS) and the Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms (SAPS).\n\n【7】Plasma concentrations of Clozapine and the main metabolite Norclozapine were evaluated by High-Performance Liquid Chromatography method (HPLC).\n\n【8】Despite the administration of high doses of Clozapine (900 mg/day)， correct plasma Clozapine concentration and correct plasma Norclozapine concentration (respectively 824 ng/ml and 72 ng/ml)， we have achieved only 22% improvement in the BPRS.\n\n【9】Initially， we associate Amisulpride at a dose of 400 mg/day and diazepam at a dose of 15 mg/day to Clozapine without improving productive symptoms after 4 weeks of treatment.\n\n【10】The second alternative was to combine 4 mg/day Risperidone and 15 mg/day Diazepam at the same dose of Clozapine during 20 weeks. No significant clinical improvement was seen. Clozapine and Haloperidol 10 mg/day was also associated but quickly stopped after development of extrapyramidal syndrome.\n\n【11】Finally， when we choose to associate Clozapine 900 mg/day to Aripiprazole at a dose of 10 mg/day， we noted better improvement in positive symptoms with a marked decrease of anxiety and psychotic symptoms. In this association we found improvement of 48% in the SAPS，42% in SANS and 40% in BPRS.\n\n【12】Conclusion\n\n【13】The results of this clinical case suggest that the addition of Aripiprazole to Clozapine in treatment ultra resistant schizophrenia could be an effective therapeutic alternative.

This is a particularly prevalent problem when it comes to the management of medical supplies in the demanding andhigh-pressure environments of emergency care departments.\n\n【4】In the backdrop of the recent years， the world has seen an unprecedented global health crisis due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This unforeseen event has led to the temporary suspension of traditional， in-person training sessions in numerous hospitals. This is particularly the case during the periods of surging demand， putting additional strain on the already stretched healthcare resources. In light of these challenges， this study has taken an innovative approach by developing an interactive digital learning game. This resource is available anytime， anywhere， providing users with the flexibility to engage in learning at a pace and timing that suits their individual schedules and commitments.\n\n【5】The primary objective of this study is to tackle the problem of inventory accounting oversights in the management of medical supplies. To measure the efficacy of the proposed intervention， the researchers established a benchmark based on the number of missed accounts in the two months before and after the implementation of the digital learning tool. Moreover， the study seeks to evaluate the impact of this digital game-based learning approach as compared to traditional teaching methods. It examines their respective effects on the self-directed learning and overall learning outcomes of nursing staff. This includes a comparative analysis of changes in test results between the experimental group， who used the digital learning tool， and the control group， who relied on conventional instruction methods.\n\n【6】As we navigate the rapidly evolving landscape of the medical field， with advancements in healthcare technologies and an ever-growing range of medical supplies， there is a critical need for effective inventory management. All medical institutions are recognizing the necessity to minimize the wastage of valuable medical resources and to explore strategies for reducing healthcare costs. Such initiatives can lead to an increase in the overall revenue generated by the hospitals.

Here we describe a case of cervical heterotopic gestation treated by ultrasound-guided aspiration， curettage of embryonic tissue remains and cervical pessary placement for prevention of preterm labor. The cervical pregnancy was successfully interrupted and the intrauterine gestation progressed to term with the birth of a healthy baby girl.\n\n【2】Keywords： Cervical heterotopic gestation； Aspiration； Curettage； Pessary\n\n【3】Abbreviations\n\n【4】Introduction\n\n【5】Heterotopic pregnancy relates to the simultaneous presence of intrauterine and extra uterine gestational sacs. Cervical Heterotopic Gestation (CHG) is the concomitant presence of cervical and intrauterine pregnancy. Heterotopic gestation is estimated to occur between 0.04 and 0.008%of natural conceptions . However， its occurrence seems to be significantly increased to 1%， after Assisted Reproduction Technologies (ART) . The etiology of heterotopic pregnancy in ART is still unknown. Among the risk factors， multiple embryo transfer， high incidence of pelvic inflammatory disease and uterine curettage are prevalent.\n\n【6】The CHG is considered the rarest type of heterotopic gestations and it is particularly challenging due to the lack of a standard treatment and the possible risks associated with them， such as bleeding， chance of hysterectomy and loss of the intrauterine gestation. Different approaches of medical or surgical treatments are proposed in literature， ranging from the conservative management ， local vasopressin injection followed by curettage or curettage and local methotrexate injection， transvaginal Ultrasound (US)-guided selective reduction ， uterine artery embolization and hysteroscopic removal of both gestational products ， microwave ablation of the cervical pregnancy ring forceps ， as well as an ultrasound-guided intracervical Foley balloon placement and cerclage ， complete cervical evacuation and expectant management . In nearly a quarter of the reports on CHGs there is no live birth of the intrauterine gestation， due to the medical intervention used to terminate the ectopic pregnancy . This represents a distressing rate ofpregnancy loss， particularly after ART treatment. Thus， it is foremost to detail situations and treatment procedures that reached a fortunate ending in terms of fertility preservation， gestation and delivery， more specifically after IVF.\n\n【7】Case Presentation\n\n【8】A 41-year-old nulliparous， Caucasian woman presented at our Assisted Reproduction Center with a history of infertility due to diminished ovarian reserve for 4 years. Her medical history included two previous IVF attempts with autologous oocytes at another clinic. At that time her AMH was 0.7 ngml and both treatment cycles were unsuccessful. In her first IVF attempt using donor oocytes， three high quality blastocysts were created. They were transferred in two consecutive cycles and did not result in gestation. Another donor-oocyte cycle followed， in which she received two grade 1 fresh blastocysts. Ten days after transfer， B-HCG test of 355mUI revealed an early gestation. The first ultrasound 26 days post-transfer showed one intrauterine gestational sac and another in the cervix， with both embryos measuring Crown Rump Length (CRL) of 0.5 cm and with active heartbeat . The patient received extensive information and counseling on her condition. After different treatment possibilities were discussed， we decided for a US-guided aspiration of the cervical gestational sac to best preserve the intrauterine gestation. The procedure was performed in a local hospital， under general anesthesia， on day 28 after embryo transfer. The cervical gestational sac was punctured using a 17 G single lumen oocyte aspiration needle under US-guidance. The treatment approach was successful in aspirating the contents of gestational sac. The patient was discharged home after 24 h observation. The histopathological examination confirmed embryonic remains and products ofconception from the aspirate. There was minimal bleeding during and after the procedure. On the second post-operative day， the patient presented with painless vaginal bleeding and was readmitted to the hospital. Trophoblastic tissues of the cervical ectopic conceptus were gently removed using a curette， under ultrasound guidance. Histopathology analysis confirmed the presence of chorionic villi in the gestational tissues. An ultrasound performed four days after the curettage revealed a viable intrauterine gestation. Some residual trophoblast tissue could still be detected into the cervical canal. Serial obstetric US six days later revealed the persistence of a heterogeneous， hypervascular mass measuring 2.7 mm x2.0 mm in the cervical canal near the internal os， corresponding to remains of the cervical gestation chorionic villi. Two weeks after the curettage， the cervical heterogeneous mass persisted and the intrauterine gestation followed normal development. Fortnightly US surveillance revealed a shortened uterine cervix， at 20weeks gestation. A cervical pessary was inserted at 22 weeks gestation to avoid preterm delivery. The patient was prescribed absolute bed rest until 37 weeks gestation， when labor contractions started. The pessary was removed and the cesarean section was schedule for the next day. The patient delivered a healthy baby girl weighting 2960 g and 46 cm.\n\n【9】Discussion\n\n【10】The present case report describes the successful treatment of a CHG after IVF， using US-guided aspiration of the ectopic gestational sac， followed by curettage， pessary placement due to cervical shortening and absolute rest. The frequency of different forms of heterotopic gestations is much higher after IVF， than after natural conception . The clinical management of a CHG after IVF imposes specific challenges， considering that IVF pregnancies are highly desired and treatment for the termination of an ectopic gestation may also put in danger the viable intrauterine one.\n\n【11】To our best knowledge， this is the first description of a CHG detected at an early gestational age and treated with US-guided aspiration of gestational sac， cervical curettage and pessaryplacement. Although the curettage of the cervical canal was carefully performed， cervical shortening occurred and the placement of a pessary was Iiecessary to avoid preterm delivery.\n\n【12】The patient was 41 years of age and that was her first pregnancy， after four unsuccessful embryo transfers. The early detection of the extra uterine gestational sac at 6 weeks was paramount for the success in the CHG management， without pregnancy loss of the viable intrauterine gestation and fertility preservation. Majority ofthe CHGs are detected after vaginal bleeding， at more advanced gestational age. Thus， particularly after IVF cycles in which more than one embryo is transferred， the first US scan should include a careful evaluation ofthe cervical canal to exclude a heterotopic gestation at the cervix.\n\n【13】Different treatment options are described for the resolution of cervical heterotopic gestations. However， some of the treatments may result in undesired outcomes， such as infertility  and intrauterine gestation loss . Sonographically guided injection of various agents， into the ectopic gestational sac is effective， but it is also associated with persistent trophoblastic tissue . US-guided aspiration of cervical conceptus results in immediate termination of the ectopic gestation and there is a minor risk to cause harm to the intrauterine pregnancy.\n\n【14】In conclusion， considering that there is no consensus on the best treatment for CHG， it is important to report the factors that contributed to the successful resolution of the present case. Early detection and US-guided aspiration performed by an experienced operator， careful follow up of the remaining embryonic tissues， monitoring of cervical canal along the gestation to avoid preterm delivery due to a possible shortening of the cervix after curettage and placement of cervical pessary to ensure a full-term gestation represent a safe and effective management of CHG， with fertility preservation and favorable live birth outcomes for IVF patients.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 10:41:41", "endTime": "2024/09/24 10:41:50", "cost": 8.719}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:30", "update_time": "2024-09-23 18:41:50", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 18:41:41"}

Its incidence is described at 1：10.000 live births. Clinical diagnosis includes fractures from the mildest oftrauma， short stature， bone deformities， blue sclera， dentinogenesis imperfecta and deafness . Clinical severity varies from mild forms with only premature osteoporosis or severe postmenopausal bone mineral loss determining normal life expectancy in OI type I， to perinatal death in OI type II. Almost 90% of cases are caused by mutations in the genes encoding type I collagen . Perioperative management can be challenging due to difficult airway， respiratory failure due to scoliosis or abnormal platelet function with easy bruisability. It is essential to predict these risks and implement a high-quality management for trauma in such patients. Treatment ofOI depends on the severity and age， the main objectives being to maintain autonomy and prevent long term complications . This current case report describes a patient with an unknown genetic disorder and her medical history that led to the diagnosis of osteogenesis imperfecta.\n\n【6】Materials and Methods\n\n【7】In September 2021， a 53 year-old female (body mass 78 kg， height 157 cm， body mass index31.6 kg/m²) was admitted for a minor trauma (same height fall)， which resulted in a complex left acetabular fracture and protrusio acetabuli .\n\n【8】Clinical examination revealed blue sclera ， moderate scoliosis， and mild skeletal deformities of the forearms， dentinogenesis imperfecta and deafness.\n\n【9】Twenty years prior she developed early onset deafness and underwent a stapedectomy for presumably right ear otosclerosis. Her hearing worsen in both ears over the next six years and needed hearing aid. That’s when she was first told she had a genetic disorder， but at the present time she did not possess any medical history， nor remembered any details. Family history revealed the patient’s mother also had blue-gray colored sclera. The patient had multiple rheumatology admissions for osteoporosis， tendinitis and bilateral chronic hip and knee articular pain requiring treatment with analgesics and bisphosphonates (alendronic acid). She also had a history of essential arterial hypertension， gastro esophageal reflux disease and smoking. She required immediate plate osteosynthesis of the posterior column of acetabulum  with normal perioperative evolution， being discharged in good clinical condition.\n\n【10】. Corticosteroids induce fat mobilization and may promote fat emboli occlusion of blood vessels， disrupt calcium metabolism and increase osteoclasts activity and bone resorption . In January 2022， on a follow up visit the patient had recurrence of acute， severe， left hip articular pain. Although all her previous follow-up visits shown progressive healing of the fracture， this time her radiology report showed aseptic necrosis of the left femoral head ， requiring total hip arthroplasty .\n\n【11】During recovery， in November 2021 she develops respiratory signs of SARS-CoV-2 infection (fever， cough， muscle aches and sore throat) and is diagnosed with a positive RT-PCR test through her family doctor. She had a mild to moderate form and received inpatient low-flow supplemental oxygen therapy via nasal cannula and 8 mg daily dexamethasone for 5 days.\n\n【12】The patient received general anesthesia combined with an ultrasound-guided fascia iliaca block to ensure adequate perioperative analgesia， with good outcome. General anesthesia was preferred over neuroaxial anesthetic procedures due to the coagulopathy found in OI patients which includes reduced platelet aggregation， reduced factor VIII activity and an increased capillary fragility. Difficult airway must be anticipated in these patients and video laryngoscopic or fiber optic endotracheal intubation should be readily available. The moderate scoliosis with restrictive lung disease and long-term effects of COVID-19 like lung fibrosis can impede perioperative respiratory function.\n\n【13】The approach to management of COVID-19 evolves rapidly as clinical data emerge， but corticosteroids are almost a constant in treatment protocols for moderate to severe cases . The use of high doses of dexamethasone was lifesaving in many cases，but one adverse effect is corticosteroid induced a vascular necrosis of the femoral head\n\n【14】Results and Discussion\n\n【15】A vascular necrosis of the femoral head can be a consequence of the trauma， it can be corticosteroid-induced， but OI can also associate periarticular bone dysplasia and lesions of ischemic origin. Taking that into account， the differential diagnosis can prove difficult in a patient with history of osteoporosis， chronic hip pain and corticosteroid treatment. Considering all of the above， a clinical diagnosis of osteogenesis imperfecta type I was formulated.\n\n【16】OI is also known as “brittle bone disease\" because of high risk of fractures after mild trauma， or ever from transporting or mobilization of patients. Diagnosis of OI on the basis of clinical and radiological findings is straightforward in most cases， but bone mineral density measurements， bone metabolic markers and morphological bone studies may aid the process. Genetic testing can be useful in differentiating between quantitative and qualitative collagen I defects. Bone fragility， osteoporosis and coagulopathy can complicate or prolong surgical interventions. OI is associated with multiple complications， thus the patients require extensive preoperative evaluation and an individualized orthopedic and anesthetic management.\n\n【17】Conclusion\n\n【18】Currently， only symptomatic therapy is available， such as growth hormone or bisphosphonates and surgical treatment is necessary for decreasing the rate of complication. Most of the literature focuses on diagnosis and management of OI in the pediatric population， but the manifestations are lifelong and some cases can be first diagnosed throughout adulthood. In this case the new onset of aseptic necrosis of the femoral head was pluri factorial， corticotherapy-induced， a complication of bone brittleness and ischemic lesions found in OI， as well as the recent history of acetabular fracture. The approach to such a heterogeneous disease should be multidisciplinary in order to assure adequate long-term quality oflife and decreasing complication rates，", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [{"text": "【10】.

Its incidence is described at 1：10.000 live births. Clinical diagnosis includes fractures from the mildest oftrauma， short stature， bone deformities， blue sclera， dentinogenesis imperfecta and deafness . Clinical severity varies from mild forms with only premature osteoporosis or severe postmenopausal bone mineral loss determining normal life expectancy in OI type I， to perinatal death in OI type II. Almost 90% of cases are caused by mutations in the genes encoding type I collagen . Perioperative management can be challenging due to difficult airway， respiratory failure due to scoliosis or abnormal platelet function with easy bruisability. It is essential to predict these risks and implement a high-quality management for trauma in such patients. Treatment ofOI depends on the severity and age， the main objectives being to maintain autonomy and prevent long term complications . This current case report describes a patient with an unknown genetic disorder and her medical history that led to the diagnosis of osteogenesis imperfecta.\n\n【6】Materials and Methods\n\n【7】In September 2021， a 53 year-old female (body mass 78 kg， height 157 cm， body mass index31.6 kg/m²) was admitted for a minor trauma (same height fall)， which resulted in a complex left acetabular fracture and protrusio acetabuli .\n\n【8】Clinical examination revealed blue sclera ， moderate scoliosis， and mild skeletal deformities of the forearms， dentinogenesis imperfecta and deafness.\n\n【9】Twenty years prior she developed early onset deafness and underwent a stapedectomy for presumably right ear otosclerosis. Her hearing worsen in both ears over the next six years and needed hearing aid. That’s when she was first told she had a genetic disorder， but at the present time she did not possess any medical history， nor remembered any details. Family history revealed the patient’s mother also had blue-gray colored sclera. The patient had multiple rheumatology admissions for osteoporosis， tendinitis and bilateral chronic hip and knee articular pain requiring treatment with analgesics and bisphosphonates (alendronic acid). She also had a history of essential arterial hypertension， gastro esophageal reflux disease and smoking. She required immediate plate osteosynthesis of the posterior column of acetabulum  with normal perioperative evolution， being discharged in good clinical condition.\n\n【10】. Corticosteroids induce fat mobilization and may promote fat emboli occlusion of blood vessels， disrupt calcium metabolism and increase osteoclasts activity and bone resorption . In January 2022， on a follow up visit the patient had recurrence of acute， severe， left hip articular pain. Although all her previous follow-up visits shown progressive healing of the fracture， this time her radiology report showed aseptic necrosis of the left femoral head ， requiring total hip arthroplasty .\n\n【11】During recovery， in November 2021 she develops respiratory signs of SARS-CoV-2 infection (fever， cough， muscle aches and sore throat) and is diagnosed with a positive RT-PCR test through her family doctor. She had a mild to moderate form and received inpatient low-flow supplemental oxygen therapy via nasal cannula and 8 mg daily dexamethasone for 5 days.\n\n【12】The patient received general anesthesia combined with an ultrasound-guided fascia iliaca block to ensure adequate perioperative analgesia， with good outcome. General anesthesia was preferred over neuroaxial anesthetic procedures due to the coagulopathy found in OI patients which includes reduced platelet aggregation， reduced factor VIII activity and an increased capillary fragility. Difficult airway must be anticipated in these patients and video laryngoscopic or fiber optic endotracheal intubation should be readily available. The moderate scoliosis with restrictive lung disease and long-term effects of COVID-19 like lung fibrosis can impede perioperative respiratory function.\n\n【13】The approach to management of COVID-19 evolves rapidly as clinical data emerge， but corticosteroids are almost a constant in treatment protocols for moderate to severe cases . The use of high doses of dexamethasone was lifesaving in many cases，but one adverse effect is corticosteroid induced a vascular necrosis of the femoral head\n\n【14】Results and Discussion\n\n【15】A vascular necrosis of the femoral head can be a consequence of the trauma， it can be corticosteroid-induced， but OI can also associate periarticular bone dysplasia and lesions of ischemic origin. Taking that into account， the differential diagnosis can prove difficult in a patient with history of osteoporosis， chronic hip pain and corticosteroid treatment. Considering all of the above， a clinical diagnosis of osteogenesis imperfecta type I was formulated.\n\n【16】OI is also known as “brittle bone disease\" because of high risk of fractures after mild trauma， or ever from transporting or mobilization of patients. Diagnosis of OI on the basis of clinical and radiological findings is straightforward in most cases， but bone mineral density measurements， bone metabolic markers and morphological bone studies may aid the process. Genetic testing can be useful in differentiating between quantitative and qualitative collagen I defects. Bone fragility， osteoporosis and coagulopathy can complicate or prolong surgical interventions. OI is associated with multiple complications， thus the patients require extensive preoperative evaluation and an individualized orthopedic and anesthetic management.\n\n【17】Conclusion\n\n【18】Currently， only symptomatic therapy is available， such as growth hormone or bisphosphonates and surgical treatment is necessary for decreasing the rate of complication. Most of the literature focuses on diagnosis and management of OI in the pediatric population， but the manifestations are lifelong and some cases can be first diagnosed throughout adulthood. In this case the new onset of aseptic necrosis of the femoral head was pluri factorial， corticotherapy-induced， a complication of bone brittleness and ischemic lesions found in OI， as well as the recent history of acetabular fracture. The approach to such a heterogeneous disease should be multidisciplinary in order to assure adequate long-term quality oflife and decreasing complication rates，", "index": 3659, "show": true, "start": 3659, "end": 3681, "province": ["格式规范性", "多余标点"], "isEdit": false}], "startTime": "2024/09/24 11:43:35", "endTime": "2024/09/24 11:44:15", "cost": 39.908}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:30", "update_time": "2024-09-23 19:44:15", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 19:43:35"}

The cardiovascular risk factors and cardiotoxicity control remains challenging， since drug interactions may result in significant clinical events.\n\n【2】Methods： This study describes a cardiotoxicevent causedby syncope-related sinus pause，exacerbated or resulting from the use of thalidomide in a patient during multiple myeloma treatment.\n\n【3】Results/Discussion： A 63-year-old male submitted to VAD (vincristine， doxorubicin and dexamethasone) chemotherapy for multiple myeloma.

A 24-h Holter showed 2 pause episodes of more than 2 sec， the longest being 18.5 sec，not associated with symptoms. It is known that patients submitted to chemotherapy are at risk of developing cardiotoxicity. Preventive measures should be part of clinical management， in order to prevent ventricular damage and the occurrence of other phenomena.\n\n【4】Conclusion： The use of thalidomide requires monitoring bradyarrhythmia's and syncope. Medication with greater tolerability， such as lenalidomide，should beincreasingly prescribed，thereby avoiding undesirable clinical situations that may directly affect patient morbidity and mortality.\n\n【5】Introduction\n\n【6】The demographic and epidemiological transition process that occurred in Brazil and the world in the last century changed the profile of the most prevalent diseases. Increased life expectancy and improvement in certain aspects of the health-disease process led to a reduction in infectious and parasitic diseases， with a rise in the incidence of neoplastic diseases. Thus， neoplasm's that accounted for around 3% of overall deaths in 1930， increased proportionally to 12% in the mid-1980s .\n\n【7】There have been important advances in the area of medicine， with new drugs and treatments to manage these diseases. On the other hand， new drug interactions may result in a significant clinical event in the follow-up of this population . This can be particularly relevant given the need to control cardiovascular comorbidities prevalent in survivors.\n\n【8】One of the concerns with the use of antineoplastic agents is the potential for cardiotoxicity. This clinical entity is defined by confirmation of new clinical cardiovascular alterations during or after antineoplastic treatment and/or change in biomarkers and/or cardiac imaging tests， provided other etiologies have been excluded .\n\n【9】Multiple myeloma， a malignant disease of the hematopoietic system， was one of the neoplasm's whose natural history was modified. Despite still being incurable， the therapeutic arsenal has been broadened.\n\n【10】The aim of this study was to describe a cardiotoxic event caused by syncope-related sinus pause， exacerbated or caused by the use of thalidomide in a patient being treated for multiple myeloma.\n\n【11】Case Presentation\n\n【12】A 63-year-old male was referred to the cardio-oncology outpatient facility due to hypertension after the onset of VAD (vincristine， doxorubicin and dexamethasone) chemotherapy to treat multiple myeloma. There were no cardiovascular symptoms at that time. The patient was using10 mg/d of amlodipine and 50 mg/d of metoprolol tartrate. Physical examination showed a good overall state， pallor， FC I with BP= 44 mmHg x 86 mmHg， HR= 84 bpm， and RR=22 ipm. CMR at 3T， with 4S， A2 hyperphonesis and mitral regurgitation murmur(+/6+). No systemic or pulmonary congestion or other disorders were detected.\n\n【13】ComplementaryEexaminations atfollow-upshowed an electrocardiogram with siniis rhythm，left-axis deviation， electrically inactive lower wall area， and QTc of 426 msec . Transthoracic echocardiogram revealed grade I diastolic dysfunction， with preserved systolic function (LVEF=69%)， and no change in segmental contraction. Due to the high risk of cardiotoxicity， the anti-hypertensives were replaced by 20 mg/d of enalapril and 6.25mg/d of carvedilol. There was good tolerance to increasing doses of carvedilol up to 50 mg/day.\n\n【14】After six months， the patient was submitted to a Bone Marrow Transplant (BMT)， with thalidomide as part of the BMT hematology protocol， evolving with successive syncopal episodes (Stokes-Adams syndrome)， one associated with traumatic brain injury and a fracture in the left temporoparietal region. At this time， the physical examination was similar to that of the first consultation， with controlled blood pressure， no postural hypotension or other disorders， and CMR with 4S. The electrocardiogram exhibited the same pattern as those previously obtained .\n\n【15】The 24-h Holter showed 2 pause episodes of more than 2 sec， the longest being 18.5 sec， not associated with any symptoms . After joint assessment with an Arrhythmologist， the following diagnostic hypotheses were considered：Thalidomide-induced bradycardia， ventricular arrhythmias caused by cardiotoxicity due to the previous use of doxorubicin or vasovagal syncope resulting from a change in the antihypertensive scheme. The use of 25mcg/d of fludrocortisone was prescribed， associated with non-pharmacological measures， and the beta blocker was discontinued， while complementary diagnosis assessment progressed. Syncopal episodes persisted with similar characteristics to those previously observed.\n\n【16】The electrophysiological study to assess sinus node dysfunction was normal， as was cardiac catheterization， which demonstrated only epicardial coronaries with irregularities. The tilt test was negative.\n\n【17】Thyroidlffunctionandeelectrolyte doses remainednormal throughout follow-up. Due to the persistent syncopal episodes and the impossibility of suspending thalidomide， a definitive atrial-ventricular pacemaker was implanted， with successful episode resolution.\n\n【18】Discussion\n\n【19】Syncope occurred in the patient due to a confluence of factors， including base pathology， since cancer leads to a proinflammatory state that may culminate in fibrosis and altered cardiac physiology， the side effects of his medication. The use ofthalidomide seems to be the main factor for the origin of syncope.\n\n【20】Thalidomide， an antineoplastic drug， is part of the therapeutic scheme for multiple myeloma. Its most important cardiotoxicity-related side effects are thromboembolicphenomena and arrhythmias， mainly bradyarrhythmia’s . Some studies found that thalidomide 05 could induce mild bradycardia in up to 55% ofpatients， irrespective of an association with corticosteroids . The most severe bradycardia symptoms occur in only 1% to 3% of cases . Numerous mechanisms are involved in1 the hemodynamic determination of cardiac arrhythmias， such as hypotension and pulmonaryhypertension .\n\n【21】Fahdi et al.  reported topics that deserve attention. More than 90 patients with multiple mveloma treated with thalidomide were compared with the control group. Their concomitant use with negative chronotropic drugs， such as adrenergic beta calcium channel blockers， and antiarrhythmic drugs showed no statistically significant difference in relation to the occurrence of bradyarrhythmia's in the study patients . However， along with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide， these drugs are part of the group that pose a risk for the occurrence of bradycardia . An important factor that seems to be associated with greater sinus bradycardia occurrence is the existence of concomitant hypothyroidism， which should be closely monitored . In the patient in question， all thyroid hormone contents were normal Electrocardiographically， bradycardia is expressedIwith no change in intracardiac conduction intervals， such as the PR， QRS and QT interval. The physiopathological mechanism remains unknown. Fahdi et al. suggested that the basis for the occurrence of this event is the imbalance caused by thalidomide in the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. Thalidomide inhibits TNF alpha expression and activity， leading to complete inhibition of the dorsal motor neuron in the vagus nerve nucleus， resulting in parasympathetic hyperactivity and culminating in sinus bradycardia and other conduction disorders， such as third-degree atrioventricular block .\n\n【22】It was later suggested that the harmful effect of this chemotherapy drug is dose dependent， as reported by Tamargo et al. ， such that in patients where it could not be reduced or suspended， when severe bradycardia occurs， the typical therapeutic alternative is implanting a definitive pacemaker . This device has increased in patients exhibiting syncopal episodes. Thangaraju et al.  reported the occurrence of sinus bradycardia in young patients being treated for erythema nodosum leprosum， and no association with other drugs. This resulted in regression and return to basal heart rate after the drug was suspended， demonstrating that the effects are associated with higher serum concentration of the drug and suggesting the reversibility of the effects of thalidomide in sinus node function.\n\n【23】In a study of patients diagnosed with stage 1 multiple myeloma， Rajikumar et al.  found that at an average of 400 mg/day of thalidomide (varying from 200 mg/day to 800 mg/day)， around 26%of the patients exhibited bradycardia， showing an association with a lower heart rate. The same phenomenon was observed by Menghuiwhere sinus bradycardia was one of the most important side effects of thalidomide in terms of morbidity in the treatment of Crohn's disease， reinforcing the need to monitor cardiotoxicity.\n\n【24】There are now drugs with a more tolerable cardiovascular toxicity profile， including second-generation immune modulators such as lenalidomide， a thalidomide analog . However， this drug is not available in the Brazilian public health system， since it was not included in the National List of Essential Drugs (RENAME)， last updated in 2022.\n\n【25】It is known that patients submitted to chemotherapy are at risk of developing cardiotoxicity. Preventive measures should be part of clinical management， in order to prevent ventricular dysfunction and other phenomena. Although not statistically significant， according to the latest Brazilian Cardio-Oncology Guidelines， the use of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and prophylactic beta blockers is indicated， irrespective of symptomatic or asymptomatic cardiac injury . In the largest randomized clinical trial conducted to prevent cardiotoxicity using adrenergic beta blockers， specifically carvedilol， Avila et al.  found no difference between the control group and placebo in relation to left ventricular ejection fraction and placebo， since there was a decline in troponin levels and diastolic dysfunction in the carvedilol group. It is important to note that in addition to their side effects， these drugs may interact with the chemotherapy drugs themselves.\n\n【26】Conclusion\n\n【27】The use of thalidomide requires carefulmonitoring of bradyarrhythmia's and syncope， in addition to other cardiotoxicities. Drugs such as lenalidomide exhibit better tolerability and less interaction with therapies to control comorbidities and reduce cardiotoxicity. As such， they should be preferred to lower the risk of undesirable clinical situations and increased morbidity and mortality in this population.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 11:08:55", "endTime": "2024/09/24 11:09:03", "cost": 7.761}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:30", "update_time": "2024-09-23 19:09:01", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 19:08:53"}

Because the floor of barn was not clean due to straw and manure， it was difficult to move a large endoscope image processing device using casters. Recently， inexpensive endoscopes that can use mobile phones as image displays have been commercialized. However， it is hard to use for diagnosis of the estrous cycle from structural changes in blood vessels and tissues， since mobile phones do not have an image processing function. Therefore， we would like TC ice an image process method for intravaginal images obtained by inexpensive endoscope to make clear images of blood vessel of external uterine ostium and vaginal wall.\n\n【2】Keywords： Endoscope； Clinical imaging； Barn；Ostium\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Commercial endoscope uses Narrow Band (NB) imaging for making clear image ofblood vessels of tissue . Briefly NB imaging is introduced here. Hemoglobin absorbs light at 415 nm and 540nm to 560 nm. Collagen also has auto fluorescence at the wavelength from 390 nm to 470 nm. Endoscope is assembled with band pass filters of wavelength of absorption peak ofhemoglobin and collagen in the camera. Obtained images clearly exhibit distribution of hemoglobin and collagen. This method is very useful for diagnosis of illness of tissue.\n\n【5】Image of Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) sensor of digital cameras are composed of RGB light receiving elements. Red (R) element receives light from 570 nm to 680 nm， and the Green element (G) receives light from 460 nm to 600 nm. Blue element (B) receives light from 400 nm to 450 nm. A composite of the electrical signals received by these elements is called an RGB image. Obtained image is saved as JPEG， BMP， and TIFF format images， but the file is composed of RGB signals. Here， we propose that the saved image file could be separated to each RGB signal and then could be superimposing the G and B images， it would be possible to acquire an image specialized for hemoglobin in tissue.\n\n【6】We noticed the technical innovation of fiberscope that can be connected to mobile phones. They are now sold at a low price of approximately $20. Inexpensive fiberscopes are used for check of the condition of hair， scalp of the head， and ears. Technician also can use the inexpensive fiberscope to inspect washbasin drains， air conditioning air ducts， and washing machine pipes. This inexpensive fiberscope can be connected not only to mobile phones via Lightning or USB， but also via Wi-Fi. Thus you can bring the inexpensive fiberscope to the research field even though a large endoscopic diagnostic imaging device cannot be used there. Therefore， we propose here to use an inexpensive fiberscope as an endoscope for cow in the barn.\n\n【7】Experimental\n\n【8】In this study， the inexpensive endoscope developed by NIDAGE was used . This endoscope has two cameras with a pixel count of 1980x1080 installed at the tip and side. Thus images of both the external uterine ostium and vaginal wall can be acquired at the same time. This number of pixels corresponds to a Full-HD image， and an endoscope image can be acquired as a photo and a movie. In addition， it has a total of 7 LEDs on the tip and side， allowing taking bright images of the inside of the vagina. Since this endoscope has a waterproof function equivalent to IP67， it can be safely used even in the vaginal environment.\n\n【9】It is difficult to take single photo during diagnosis using endoscope， because this diagnosis is huge burden on the cow. Therefore， we limited the diagnosis time within 1 min in total. Hence we shot a video and saved as MPEG4 file， and then， Adobe Premiere Pro  was used for taking single photo image (JPEG file). It was possible to acquire single photo image with Windows Media Player as well， but the image quality deteriorated significantly and it was not possible to obtain images of blood vessels.\n\n【10】ImageJ-win64 (free software) was used to decompose the single photo image into RGB signals . As you select Color-Split Channel from Image icon， the JPEG file will be split into R， G and B files. Since hemoglobin strongly absorbs G and B light， blood vessels appear as dark color.\n\n【11】In order to further improve the contrast of the blood vessel image due to the absorption of hemoglobin light， the G and B images were combined using RegiStax V6 (free software) . You select G and B JPEG image files， and then， perform set aligns points， align and limit are automatic process work. The image misalignment will be automatically corrected and the composed image will be displayed. Finally， stacked (composed) image can save the composited image.\n\n【12】Results and Discussion\n\n【13】A stick fixed with an endoscope and a mucus collection tool was inserted into the vagina of an estrus cow in the barn. Figure 1 (White) shows an image of the external uterine ostium. This image was saved from a video file obtained by endoscope. It was clearly seen that the external uterine ostium illuminated by white light. Next， the images obtained by decomposing the white image into RGB are shown as Red， green， and blue images in Figure 1. Red image illustrated the distribution of minor blood vessels that seemed to be capillaries. Green and blue images depicted the distribution of thick blood vessels in the folds of external uterine ostium.\n\n【14】The composed images of green and blue images of the external uterine ostium and the vaginal wall are shown in Figure 2. Thick blood vessels could be clearly observed. Image of the vaginal wall also showed blood vessels and it was different from white image.\n\n【15】In estrus cows， the blood flow increases due to the excitement， and the endometrium looks reddish as a whole. We believe that the blood flow can be seen in the amount of hemoglobin in the blood vessels as a result of the increase in the activity of cow.\n\n【16】Currently， it is attempted the prediction of the estrus period by accurately grasping the estrous cycle from diagnostic imaging and monitoring of pregnancy signal substances. We hope that diagnostic imaging can be used as the primary screening for the diagnosis of pregnancy.\n\n【17】Conclusion\n\n【18】In this study， it is attempted to observe blood vessels in the external uterine ostium and vaginal wall of cow using an inexpensive endoscope. It was possible to obtain an endoscopic image more easily than the method using a conventional large-sized endoscopic image processing device. Since the blood vessel image could be clarified by image processing， it can be expected to be used for the primary screening for the diagnosis of pregnancy in the future.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 11:19:43", "endTime": "2024/09/24 11:19:56", "cost": 13.075}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:30", "update_time": "2024-09-23 19:19:54", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 19:19:40"}

Juvenile localized scleroderma (morphea) is the predominant scleroderma in childhood which affects the skin and may extend to the underlying fascia， muscle， joints and bone， causing the lost of the mobility and， sometimes， development towards systemic sclerosis .\n\n【2】Case Presentation\n\n【3】The authors present a 7 years-old-girl admitted for investigation of an atrophic linear lesion that appeared approximately 4 months prior to the time of the admission onto the left palm and fingers of the left hand. In time， the lesion extended upwards， reaching the left axillary area and the left side of the neck. Furthermore， the child lost the mobility and flexibility of the 5h and 4h left finger.\n\n【4】Personal history doesn’t reveal any specific or suggestive illness until the lesion appeared. However， she was diagnosed with GERD in early childhood， and the symptoms still appear inconstantly.\n\n【5】Family history-her father had a stroke at 34 years， with transient immobility of the upper and lower left limb (no medical records for a specific diagnosis)，and her 33 years old mother is diagnosed with C and S protein deficiency (early after she gave birth to the child). She also has a healthy10 years-old sister. Within her mother’s family tree there is also a high burden of autoimmunity disorders (type 1 diabetes in a cousin， an aunt with autoimmune thyroiditis).\n\n【6】The clinical examination is with a good general status， but with paleness， enlarged tonsils， normal cardiovascular and respiratory auscultation， HR=88/min， RR=20/min，BP=110/50 mmHg， normal stools and urine output， normal neuropsychological development， no signs of neural or ocular impairment .\n\n【7】Biological Findings\n\n【8】Treatment\n\n【9】The patient received immunosuppressive therapy- topic， oral and parenteral corticosteroids， with mild response regarding the extension and the global aspect of the lesions. Topic tacrolimus was recommended for the skin atrophic area， but the parents refused for the moment the therapy， due to fear of possible teratogenic side-effects.\n\n【10】Methotrexatee was the seconddtherapeutic approach， being initialized only two weeks before the current communication， with no complication or side-effect until this time.\n\n【11】Assessing the Severity of the Disease (The LoSCATInstrument)\n\n【12】The LoSCAT assesses 18 cutaneous anatomic sites， capturing both disease activity (mLoSSI) and damage (LoSDI) parameters. Scores for each site are based on the most severe score for eachparameter. Inorder to minimize inter-subject variability， all skin changes are compared with the contralateral or ipsilateral skin area. The mLoSSI includes the sums of 3 separate activity scores as follows：  Erythema (ER)：O： No erythema； 1： Slight erythema/pink； 2： Red/clearly erythema； and 3： Dark red or marked erythema/violaceous.  Skin thickness(ST)： 0： Normal skin thickness and freely mobile； 1： Mild increase of thickness， mobile； 2： Moderate increase of thickness； impaired skin mobility； 3： Marked increase of thickness or no mobility of skin.  New lesion/lesion extension (N/E)： New lesion development and/or enlargement of an existing lesion within the past month (score of 3). Three cutaneous damage domains are summated to obtain the LoSDI， as follows： Dermal atrophy (DAT)： 0： Normal skin； 1： Mild skin atrophy， shiny skin； 2： Moderate atrophy， visible blood vessels or mild ‘cliff-drop’ sign； and 3： Severe skin atrophy， obvious cliff- drop'sign.  Subcutaneous atrophy (SAT)： 0： Normal subcutaneous thickness； 1： Flattening or 1/3 fat loss； 2： Obvious concave surface or1/3-2/3 fat loss； and 3： Severe subcutaneous fat loss (>2/3 loss).  Dyspigmentation (DP)： Assessing both hyper-or hypopigmentation， whichever is most prominent： 0： Normal skin pigment， 1： Mild； 2：Moderate； and 3： Severe depigmentation Patient's disease activity level was 4， and the cutaneous damage level was assessed at 6 for the second time that shepresented for follow-up， having daily corticoid oral therapy and parenteral administration ofhigh-dose corticosteroid during the first hospitalization .\n\n【13】Conclusion\n\n【14】Localized scleroderma typically presents in childhood and it can cause severe physical deformity and corresponding emotional effects. Despite being called a localized'disease， approximately one quarter of the patients have comorbidity， including orthopedic， neurologic， ocular， and other autoimmune conditions.

Biopsies andlaparoscopic biopsies had confirmed the presence of ganglion cells up to 20 cm distal to the stoma. She was diagnosed with Hirschsprung Disease-Total Colonic Aganglionosis. She underwent laparotomy， adhesiolysis and serial transverse enteroplasty STEP procedures for bowel lengthening initiative. She started with 2-in-1 parenteral nutrition via internal jugular vein in 2015 and discharge with home parenteral nutrition in 2017. Prior to discharge， patient mother has demonstrated competence in HPN management. Her family made the necessary adjustment and renovation of their house to provide a dedicated room for PN administration. Discussion and arrangement have been made with related authorities for PN supply， routine home visit， emergency health management， PN transportation and routine medical follow-up. She was 13 kg at the beginning ofHPN program， and currently her weight is 15.8 kg， active and no other medical issues. PN solution and lipid solution were packed in separate bags and infused using infusion pump for 12 h each starting at 6.00 pm daily. The HPN treatment continue during COVID-19 pandemic. She had never been infected by COVID-19and not yet vaccinated. HPN is a strategy to support patient live a normal life and should remain uninterrupted vet flexible， even in the era of pandemic.\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Hirschsprung Disease (HD) is a rare neonatal congenital disorder. The common manifestation of HD is an absence of parasympathetic ganglion cells in the distal colon. Patients with HD will have bowel obstruction due to lack of peristalsis and loss of relaxation of the anal sphincter. This may lead to severe constipation and life-threatening enterocolitis . Patients with HD are usually diagnosed and undergo surgery during the neonatal period . Surgical intervention with resection ofaganglionic bowel is the principal treatment for Hirschsprung disease， and has evolved since 1950. Transanal Endorectal Pull-Through (TERPT) has become one of the most common surgical procedures for HD in recent decades .\n\n【4】Another important aspect in HD management is an adequate nutrition support through oral， enteral or intravenous route . Intravenous Nutrition (IVN) or Parenteral Nutrition (PN) is an artificial nutrition alternative， for nutrition support when gastrointestinal fails to functions as it should . It contains amino acids， dextrose， and lipid emulsions as the main nutrients， and electrolytes， vitamins， and trace elements . As HD has been classified as chronic intestinal failure and require long term PN， Home Parenteral Nutrition (HPN) is the best option for the patient to grow in psycho-familial environment . HPN enables the patients to have a high quality of life in their own environment . HPN involves providing IVN through central intravenous route in a homecare setting， is a life-saving therapy for patients with chronic intestinal failure who cannot meet their nutritional requirements via an oral or enteral route .\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\nA female patient was born at 36 weeks and 5 days of gestational pregnancy age at Hospital Sultan Haji Ahmad Shah Pahang (HoSHAS) in December 2014. Her body weight was 3.04 kg during the Spontaneous Vaginal Delivery (SVD)， had no bowel opening， abdominal distension and | Table 1： Summary of parenteral nutrition regimen delivered to patient from 2017 until 2022.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| PN contents  | May 2017  | Jun-17  | Jun-18  | Jun-19  | Jun-20  | Jun-21  | Jan-22  |\n| Macronutrient  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Amino acids (g/kg/day)  | 3  | 3  | 3.5  | 3.5  | 3.1  | 3  | 3  |\n| Glucose (g/kg/day)  | 11.6  | 12.4  | 15.1  | 13.4  | 11.76  | 6.6  | 6.6  |\n| Fat (g/kg/day)  | 2  | 2  | 2  | 2  | 2.8  | 2.9  | 2.9  |\n| Electrolytes  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Sodium (mmol/kg/day)  | 5  | 5  | 5  | 5.1  | 2.97  | 3.1  | 3  |\n| Potassium (mmol/kg/day)  | 5  | 5  | 6.5  | 5.5  | 2.03  | 2.1  | 2  |\n| Calcium (mmol/kg/day)  | 1  | 1  | 1  | 1  | 1.01  | 1.1  | 1  |\n| Magnesium (mmol/kg/day)  | 0.5  | 0.5  | 0.5  | 0.51  | 1  | 1.03  | 1.01  |\n| Phosphate (mmol/kg/day)  | 0.05  | 0.05  | 0.3  | 0.26  | 0.1  | 0.10  | 0.1  |\n| Acetate (mmol/kg/day)  | 1.75  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  |\n| Micronutrient  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Water soluble vitamins (ml/day)  | 10  | 10  | 10  | 10  | 10  | 10  | 10  |\n| Fat soluble vitamins (ml/day)  | 10  | 10  | 10  | 10  | 10  | 10  | 10  |\n| Trace elements (ml/day)  | 13  | 10  | 10  | 10  | 10  | 10  | 10  |\n| Total volume (ml/kg/day)  | 88  | 81.1  | 100.8  | 92.3  | 47.3  | 67.1  | 67.1  |\n| Total calorie (kcal/kg/day)  | 78.6  | 80.7  | 94.5  | 87.5  | 87.7  | 90.8  | 90.8  |\n| Duration of PN infusion (hour)  | 18  | 20  | 20  | 20  | 12  | 12  | 12  |\n| Duration of lipid infusion (hour)  | 18  | 20  | 20  | 20  | 12  | 12  | 12  |\n\n【7】bilious aspirates. A lower GI contrast study was done and showed a tapering and no contrast beyond ascending colon. She was referred to University Malaya Medical Centre (UMMC) for suspicion of bowel atresia and further medical management on day three of life.\n\n【8】A laparotomy， appendectomy， multiple bowel biopsies and a jejunostomy were performed on January 01， 2015 that is day five of her life. During the operation， there was no evidence of bowel atresia but had microcolon and a flexure at the transitional zone，45 cm from the Duodenojejunal (DJ-flexure). Results of the biopsies revealed the presence of ganglion cells 20 cm from the distal to the stoma， but absence of ganglion cells 40 cm distal to the stoma. She was diagnosed with Hirschsprung Disease-Total Colonic A Aganglionosis.The repeated laparoscopic biopsies on March 2015 had confirmed that ganglion cells present up to 20 cm distal to the stoma. The stoma was re-sited distally； 78 cm distal to DJ-flexure， due to the exteriorized ileostomy was ganglionic as confirmed by the frozen section biopsy of the stoma edge intraoperatively.\n\n【9】In February 2016， at the age of 14 months， she underwent laparotomy， adhesiolysis and serial transverse enteroplasty STEP procedures for bowel lengthening initiative. Prior to the lengthening procedure， the total length of the proximal small bowel to the ileostomy was 130 cm and the enteroplasty process managed to secure another 31 cm length. The proximal bowel was generally dilated but peristalsis was seen. She was started with 2-in-1 total Parenteral Nutrition (PN) in mid-January 2015 through right internal jugular vein. The central venous catheter was re-inserted in June 2015 to the left internal jugular vein. She has been under close monitoring for her nutritional requirements and intake， fluid and electrolyte status， and catheter care during her hospitalization in UMMC.\n\n【10】Finally， in June 2017， the UMMC team has come to agreement that the nutritional requirements and the PN regimen had been stabilized and optimized. She was discharge from UMMC for home parenteral nutrition. Prior to discharge， her mother has demonstrated competence in performing HPN management； line care and management， setting up enteral and parenteral nutrition under strict aseptic technique and also capable of performing ostomy care. Her family also has made all the necessary adiustment and renovation of their house in Kemaman， Terengganu to provide a dedicated room that is safe and clean for PN administration.\n\n【11】Further discussion and arrangement have been made by UMMC with Hospital Sultanah Nur Zahirah， Kuala Terengganu (HSNZ) for PN supply， with Kemasik Health Clinic， Terengganu (KKK) for home visit and emergency health management， and Hospital Kemaman， Terengganu (HKM) for PN transportation from HSNZ to HKM and routine medical follow-up. All of this arrangement is crucial as the patient will stay 250 km away from UMMC， while HKM， the nearest hospital to patient house， didn’t equipped with the facility deemed suitable for compounding PN. HSNZ on the other hand， is about 103km from HKM.\n\n【12】Discussion\n\n【13】Pre-discharge preparation\n\n【14】Patient’s mother underwent home PN training， coordinate byUMMC Surgery Department in 2017. Prior to discharge， an assessment was conducted and she was able to perform and competence in hand washing and gloving techniques， setting up the dressing table， handling PN administration and discontinuation， handling the PN infusion pump and central line care.\n\n【15】A series of discussion were conducted with patient family on the technical aspect of the HPN therapy. Although PN was supplied by the hospital， but some of the consumables were self-purchase by the SpO family. There were also equipment and consumable items， sponsored by Department of Social Welfare Malaysia， Terengganu and Islamic religious and Malay Customs Council， Terengganu such as infusion\n\n【16】Table 2： Summary of nutrient required and delivered to patient via parenteral route.\n\n| Macro & Micronutrients  | Start 2 vears old  |  |  | Current 7 vears old  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Macro & Micronutrients  | Requirement  |  | Delivered  | Requirement  |  | Delivered  |\n| Macro & Micronutrients  | per day  | by weight  | Delivered  | per day  | by weight  | Delivered  |\n| Energy (kcal/kg/day)  | 65-75  | 845-975  | 1049 (107%)  | 65-75  | 962-1110  | 1011(91%)  |\n| Amino acids (g/kg/day)  | 2.5  | 32.5  | 39(120%)  | 2.0  | 29.6  | 43(143%)  |\n| Glucose (g/kg/day)  | 4.6  | 55.8  | 151(135%)  | 4.6  | 63.3  | 95(75%)  |\n| Lipids (g/kg/day)  | 3(max)  | 39  | 36(92%)  | 3  | 44.4  | 44.4(100%)  |\n| #Vitamins and trace elements (daily dose)  | Complete  | Complete  | Complete  | Complete  | Complete  | Complete  |\n| Fluid (ml)  |  | 1150ml  | 1144 (99%)  | ★  | 1240ml  | 960 ml(77%)  |\n\n【18】#Vitamin and trace elements： SoluvitB and VitalipidB\n\n【19】Fluid requirement =(100 mlx 10 kg) +(5 ml x10 kg)+(25 ml x[Weight-20 kg])\n\n【20】Peptamen Junior； 4 scoops + 120 ml x 3-5/day 464 kcal， 13.7 g Protein， 62.8 g CHO and 17.5 g Fat in 500 ml water.\n\n【21】Table 3： Summary of patient body weight from 2017 until 2022.\n\n|  |  | May 2017  | Jun-17  | Jun-18  | Jun-19  | Jun-20  | Jun-21  | Jan-22  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Age  | Year  | 2  | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5  | 6  | 7  |\n| Age  | Month  | 5  | 6  | 0  | 0  | 0  |  |  |\n| Weight-for-age(kg)  |  | 16.3  | 15.8  | 15.3  | 15.3  | 15.3  | 15.5  | 15.8  |\n| Actual body weight (kg)  |  | 13  | 13  | 11.5  | 13  | 14.8  | 14.3  | 15  |\n\n【23】The standard growth chart for Malaysia girl age 2-20 years old adapted from National Center for Health Statistics， USA pump and also syringe pump.\n\n【24】As home PN therapy require a lot of preparation， UMMC had organize teams to help patient family on technical aspects especially for the house preparation. The team visited the house to ensure the room or space for home PN administration， electricity supply， refrigerator， sink， water supply and telephone were in place. All of the aspect is crucial in reducing the risk for contamination and infection to the patient. Pre-discharge home visit was done on Jun 2017 by Kemaman Hospital team， while the post-discharge home visit was conducted by Kemasik Health Clinic team every 3 to 6 months.\n\n【25】The patient was 2 years old and the body weight was 13 kg at the time she was enrolled into the HPN program. Apart from PN， she also taking oral food and received enteral nutrition support. Macronutrient and micronutrient regimen for nutrition support were developed bythe UMMC Surgery team. The team reviewed and make the required adjustment according to patient clinical development， relevant policy and also references.\n\n【26】Post-discharge\n\n【27】Monitoring of the treatmentprogress were scheduled and followed by the medical team and the patient family strictly over the years. Patient current body weight was 15.5 kg to 15.8 kg. Her body weight is on borderline as compared to the Malaysian standard growth chart for girl age 2 to 20 years old . After almost 6 years on PN， not much improvement seen on her body weight. She was physically small compared to other child with similar age， but she is active and had no other medical issue.\n\n【28】As the patient growing up， her PN regimen was re-calculated，re developed and delivered to suit her new nutritional requirement based on age and weight. Patient was required to be ward for every change made to the PN regimen， to monitor the responds. Discussions have been made by health professional regarding her parenteral nutrition treatment including the use of All-In-One (AIO) PN. Even though changing from TIO to AIO is safe and feasible ， TIO PN still the most preferred PN among the medical team.\n\n【29】PN solution and lipid solution were packed in separate bags and infused using infusion pump daily. The duration of infusion is12 h each and normally started around 6.00 pm to 8.00 pm. When first started， the duration of infusion was 18 h and the lipid was in syringes. As the lipid volume increase， there were more syringes to be infuse. The family were required change the syringe four to five time during the infusion time. There is also a need to reduce the duration of infusion as the patient already going to school at age of 6 years old.\n\n【30】The routine of HPN treatment for this patient continue during COVID-19 pandemic. The frequency of attending clinic and blood monitoring were rescheduled and reduced， due to traveling restriction policy in Malaysia. Supply of the PN， lipid and related consumable from HSNZ continue as usual. The family facing challenges in purchasing and supply of other consumable item such as glove， mask and disinfectant solution， as what the whole world facing at that time.\n\n【31】Physical home visit and aseptic technique monitoring was withheld during COVID-19 pandemic 2019 till 2021. The activities continued via phone and video calls . Monitoring aseptic technique is crucial and should be monitored regularly to reduce the contamination risk during PN infusion handling. The physical visit and monitoring activities resume on July 2022 by HKM and HSNZ pharmacists. The patient had never been infected by COVID-19since 2019 and not vet vaccinated. COVID-19 vaccination is still voluntarily in Malaysia since 2021.\n\n【32】There was no standard guidelines for HPN service in Malaysia at the time this patient started HPN. Guidelines developed by ASPEN， ESPGHAN/ESPEN and NICE were the source of information available during those days. It is quite a challenge for medical team to manage HPN patients with very little expertise， experience and information. In 2021， Ministry of Health Malaysia has published the Home Parenteral Nutrition： A Guide for Pharmacist 2021， to help pharmacist and medical team in managing HPN programs.\n\n【33】Conclusion\n\n【34】HPN is an alternative nutrition strategy delivered to support patient live a normal life outside the health institution. All activities related to HPN program should remain uninterrupted and flexible enough to secure health and medical safety even in the era of pandemic.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 11:23:20", "endTime": "2024/09/24 11:24:18", "cost": 58.268}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:30", "update_time": "2024-09-23 19:24:18", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 19:23:19"}

A patient was treated with the simultaneous sinus elevation and dental implant placement for rehabilitation of the maxillary molar， which is adjacent to a natural tooth with intact root canal filling. Four months later，maxillary sinusitis was diagnosed reflected by nasal obstruction and foul-smelling discharge. The mobile implant was removed and replaced by a short implant without sinus elevation surgery. However， repeated symptoms of sinusitis was observed， which immediately healed after the extraction of natural tooth. Then the patient received implant insertion in the region of missing tooth， and no further complications were observed.\n\n【3】Conclusion： We proposed that sinus elevation stimulate the colonization of bacteria from the adjacent endodontically treated tooth， which lead to sinusitis and extraction of both implant and natural tooth.\n\n【4】Keywords： Peri-implantitis； Sinus floor elevation； Tooth extraction\n\n【5】Abbreviations\n\n【6】CBCT： Cone Beam Computer Tomography； RBH： Residual Bone Height\n\n【7】Introduction\n\n【8】Ever since it was first described by Tatum ，and modified later by others， maxillary sinus floor elevation with grafting material has been proven tobea safe and highlypredictabletechnique.Despite its high survival rate achieved with this augmentation technique， complications do occur， such as membrane perforation， postoperative sinusitis， cyst formation， wound dehiscence， sequestration， and loss of bone graft . As a result of contamination of the maxillary sinus with oral flora ， infectious complication during maxillary sinus-floor elevation procedure was observed in 9 out of200 patients (4.5%) . Other studies also demonstrated similar rate of infectious complication， which range from 3.5% to 4.3%. Sinusitis is considered as a major complication because there is risk that the infection could spread throughout the graft and the sinus cavity or the adjacent anatomical structures71.\n\n【9】Dental implant placements and dental extractions could be the iatrogenic causes for the occurrence of sinusitis. As the most common complication that occurs during sinus floor elevation procedures， perforations of the maxillary sinus membrane may results in direct communication between graft materials and sinus cavity， which can lead to infection and iatrogenic sinusitis. In addition，protruding and migration of dental implant into the maxillary sinus， blockage of air flow due to diminished intra sinus volume， ostium obstruction caused by postoperative swelling of the maxillary mucosa， and even the surgical procedures themselves have been reported to be the possible causes of sinusitis .\n\n【10】Odontogenic source is the other cause for cases of maxillary sinusitis， which can happen in people with maxillary teeth caries and maxillary dental trauma . This case report presents an implant failure，persistent sinusitis and extraction of natural tooth that are mainly triggered by sinus elevation and the intact root canal filling of natural tooth itself.\n\n【11】Case Presentation\n\n【12】A 44-vear old woman visited the clinic for reconstruction of the upper left first molar. Cone Beam Computer Tomography (CBCT) examination indicated that the Residual Bone Height (RBH) at the missing tooth region was about 5.13 mm， and no abnormalities of the sinus cavity was observed . The roots of upper left second premolar protrude into sinus cavity. Patients reported that the premolar received endodontic treatment that then received a post-core and porcelain-fused-to-metal crown several years ago.\n\n【13】The minimally-invasive transcrestal sinus augmentation was performed using xenogenic graft (Bio-Oss， Geistlich Pharma)； the vertical distance from sinus membrane to the alveolar crest was about12 mm after the sinus elevation. Simultaneously， the implant (Osstem Implant Co.， Busan， Korea， with 5 mm in diameter and 10 mm in length) was inserted with a good primary stability. However， four months later， the patient complained pain in the implant region， and nasal symptoms including nasal obstruction and discharge. Implant mobility was evident by intraoral observations. Thickening of sinus mucosa and large periapical radio lucency involving both the apical regions of the second premolar and dental implant were observed on CBCT images . Maxillary sinusitis was diagnosed by otorhinolaryngologist. We removed the mobile implant ， performed lavages with sterile saline， and prescribed antibiotics. The symptom of nasal obstruction and discharge relieved along with the healing， with favorable evolution.\n\n【14】Six months later， only occasional nasal obstruction was reported by the patient， and no significant abnormalities were observed in the sinus based on CBCT examination. Progress appears to be satisfactory， so re-implantation treatment phase was initiated. We inserted a new implant with 5 mm in diameter and 8.5 mm in length(9 mm height of RBH at implant region was observed by CBCT measurement) without the surgery of sinus elevation . Then the patient was prescribed antibiotics for 3 days.\n\n【15】There was no pain or symptom of inflammation around the implant region during the healing process. Implant osseointegration was observed through radiographic examination three months postoperatively， and then the implant was restored by a full porcelain crown. Surprisingly， the patient returned complaining aggravated nasal obstruction and foul-smelling nasal discharge in one month. Objectively， thickened maxillary membrane and periapical radio lucency around the second premolar were observed on CBCT images. The patient received antibiotic therapy with amoxicillin and clavulanic acid for 1 week， but the symptom of sinusitis didn't show any improvement. We proposed that the sinusitis might be caused by the apical infection from the second premolar， which was then extracted. As it to be expected，the pain and nasal discharge subsided immediately after the tooth extraction.\n\n【16】The patient was clinically evaluated 1 month and 3 months after tooth extraction， absence of nasal obstruction and discharge was recorded. The post-surgery CBCT at 6 months showed complete resolution of maxillary sinusitis and 1mm thickness of sinus membrane. Then the implant (Bicon， America， 5 mm in diameter， and 8 mm in length) was inserted into the second premolar region. No further complications were observed， and the implant was exposed and restored as planned in 4 months . The patient received a follow-up examination every 3 months， and the implant-supported fixed prosthesis has been functioning well for 18months.\n\n【17】Discussion and Conclusion\n\n【18】Simultaneous sinus elevation and dental implant placement for rehabilitation of the maxillary molar was performed in this case. However， maxillary sinusitis was observed and extraction of both implant and natural tooth was performed several months postoperatively. Although the incidence of sinusitis after sinus elevation is low， infection can have deleterious effects on graft and implant survival . Among the different forms of sinusitis， the odontogenic form is very common， because the roots of premolars and molars are close to the sinus cavity . In this case， the root tips of the natural teeth (the second premolar) with root canal filling protrude into the sinus cavity. It has been reported that approximately50% of endodontically treated teeth exhibited histologic signs of inflammation without any clinical symptoms . And the residual bacteria in the asymptomatic endodontic treated tooth have the ability to colonize areas of significant tissue damage， which could be the situation adjacent to a newly placed implant.\n\n【19】In this case， to achieve the transcrestal sinus elevation， the membrane had to be elevated from the sinus floor mesially and distally over the root tips of the adjacent teeth to become tension-free and thus to avoid any perforation of the membrane. So we proposed that the new environment created by sinus elevation may stimulate the colonization of bacteria from the adjacent asymptomatic endodontic treated tooth， result in the odontogenic infections penetrated into the maxillary sinus. Different from acute sinusitis， chronic sinusitis has always a bacterial etiology . Amoxicill in with clavulanic acid was prescribed to resolve the symptoms， because it has been reported that this treatment reduces the bacterial load and the related mucosal inflammation . But the sinusitis symptoms didn’t get any improvement by the drug therapy with antibiotics. According to previous reports， it is very important to completely remove the cause of odontogenic sinusitis for a suiccessful outcome. As we expected， the patient reported an obvious improvement in nasal obstruction and a decrease in nasal discharge immediately after the extraction of the natural tooth. This further confirms that this natural tooth might be the odontogenic cause for sinusitis and implant failure.\n\n【20】In conclusion， even an asymptomatic endodontically treated tooth may be harboring chronic infection， which can spread to the apical region of implant through sinus. The elevation of sinus membrane involving both of the implant region and adjacent natural tooth received root canal treatment should be avoided if the roots of the tooth protrude into the sinus cavity. Otherwise， a short implant with minimal sinus elevation with a safe distance to the apical region ofendodontic treated root could be an alternative option.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 11:32:20", "endTime": "2024/09/24 11:33:17", "cost": 56.908}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:30", "update_time": "2024-09-23 19:33:16", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 19:32:18"}

Initial neuroimaging studies including CT and MRI showed dural masses bifrontoparietal and a right-sided tentorial mass in the cerebellopontine angle. Biopsy revealed ECD with a BRAF V600E mutation. The patient underwent initial therapy with vemurafenib. However， treatment was terminated due to adverse effects. Accordingly， dabrafenib therapy at a dose of 75 mg twice daily was started， which was well tolerated. Following more than two years of dabrafenib treatment， the patient remains in complete remission regarding the CNS lesions with stable skeletal lesions.\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Current consensus guidelines for managing patients with Erdheim-Chester (ECD) are based on pathogenesis， epidemiological data， laboratory and radiographic analysis as well as mutation analysis， which impacts therapy with BRAFinhibition. Therapies are based on the recommendation， although therapy with dabrafenib has not yet been considered as a therapeutic option .\n\n【4】Case Presentation\n\n【5】In the summer of2016， a 73-year-old female patient presented with fever， weight loss and lymph node swelling. Laboratory studies revealed leukocytosis and mildly increased C-Reactive Protein(CRP). Neuroimaging studies including CT and MRI showed dural masses bifrontoparietal and a tentorial mass in the right cerebellopontine angle . Pathological examination of the biopsy revealed ECD with a BRAF V600E mutation as previously reported . After the pathological diagnosis was rendered， additional systemic lesions were detected by 18 F-FDG Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography (PET/CT) in the humerus， femur， piriform sinus， ilium， clavicles and mandible . Based on the BRAF V600E mutation， the patient underwent treatment with the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib at the dose of 960 milligrams per day. The patient showed clinical improvement of her neurological symptoms as well as general condition within eight weeks with mild to moderate side-effects.\n\n【6】During ongoing treatment， symmetric polyarthritis of the shoulder joint， wrist and ankle developed accompanied by joint effusions. The patient also noted generalized malaise， loss of appetite， mood alterations， which triggered poor compliance. At the request of the patient， therapy was discontinued. Subsequently， the patient’s arthritic symptoms completely resolved. Almost two months after the treatment was discontinued， the patient presented with increasing tiredness， fatigue and increasing respiratory distress. The patient’s symptoms correlated with radiographic evidence of progression of the underlying disease. The condition of the patient continued to deteriorate，leading to hospital re-admission. Consequently， Dabrafenib， 75 mg twice daily was started. The therapy was tolerated without further side effects under inpatient supervision. After three months of therapy at a single dose of 75 mg/day， the patient returned for follow-up evaluation. Although the patient complained of limited physical strength， the cranial MRI showed a significant regression of the supratentorial dural tumor， a reduction in brainstem signal alteration and regression ofthe manifestation in the clivus . After eight months ofcontinuous therapy with dabrafenib doses of 75 mg to150 mg daily，another cranial MRI follow-up imaging was performed， whereupon a further regression of the tumor manifestation in terms of a further size reduction of the dural mass and reduced signal enhancement in the brainstem area were confirmed . In the last follow-up， two years after initial diagnosis， cranial MRI showed complete regression of the residual dural tumor mass as well as complete regression of the signal alterations in the brainstem. In addition， the patient's systemic symptoms had resolved .\n\n【7】Discussion\n\n【8】Contemporary therapeutic strategies for ECD vary according to the anatomic location of lesions and degree of involvement. In the past， corticosteroids and cytotoxic drugs were the mainstay of therapy. Currently， most guidelines favor interferon-alpha as first line therapy. TNFa blockers (infliximab)， tyrosine kinase inhibitors(E.g. imatinib) and recombinant inhibitors of interleukin-1 receptor(Anakinra) have been used successfully in selected cases . More recently， BRAF V600E mutations were detected in approximately50% of all ECD patients. Some patients have responded dramatically to therapy with the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib . To date，there are no reports on other BRAF inhibitors such as dabrafenib. The current case describes the favorable toxicity profile and long-term efficacy of dabrafenib therapy in a patient with ECD， exceeding two years. As is the case with vemurafenib， the optimal dose of BRAF inhibitors in ECD is unknown， but might be lower than doses used in melanoma treatment. Our case underscores the efficacy oflower BRAF inhibitor doses and provides evidence of a durable effect with a daily dose of 75mg to 150 mg dabrafenib.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 11:28:27", "endTime": "2024/09/24 11:29:12", "cost": 44.591}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:30", "update_time": "2024-09-23 19:29:10", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 19:28:25"}

One of the most cutting-edge fields that show these changes is the interdisciplinary science of medical image processing. Approaches in this rapidly evolving field enable the entire data flow in modern medical imaging systems， from raw data collecting to digital image transfer. These systems now offer ever-increasing spatial and intensity resolutions as well as faster collecting times， resulting in a vast volume of high-quality raw image data that must be carefully processed and reviewed for correct diagnostic results.\n\n【3】Imaging in medicine has improved the quality of life for an uncountable number of people， and this trend is only going to continue. It is extremely important to recognize diseases in their early stages. If have reason to feel that something is wrong with the body， must undergo the diagnostic scans to find out whether or not there is cause for concern. It could very well end up saving our life.\n\n【4】Medical imaging techniques are incredibly useful for the diagnosis of many of the cancers such as cervical， brain， breast， leukemia blood cells etc. To increase a patient’s chances of surviving such a dreadful disease， it is crucial that they receive a diagnosis at the earliest feasible time. Medical imaging techniques enable the diagnosis of tumors at progressively earlier stages.\n\n【5】Currently， in the field of medical area nanotechnology has evolved rigorous applications and it is being applied to the development of novel imaging techniques for medical purposes. It is highly probable that the development of nano-scale imaging will advance medicine by enabling the creation of more comprehensive images of the activities of cellular components. The capabilities of currently existing medical imaging equipment are being enhanced so that they can be utilized at the nanoscale more effectively. In addition， contrast agents are being developed to facilitate the monitoring of implanted nanoparticles throughout the body. Especially， nanoparticle implantation helps in cancer like diseases to cure the particular area proliferated in the body instead of affecting other parts through the oral medicines. It can also apply in the process of protein detection， optical coding and cell manipulation etc.\n\n【6】Molecular imaging agents based on nanoparticles are currently being manufactured. These nanoparticles will reveal whether there are mutations in cancer-causing genes or how tumor cell's function. It has been demonstrated that nanoparticles can be emploved therapeutically as anatomical structural contrast agents. This information can be used to suggest a treatment plan or modify an existing one. By altering their properties in response to biological stimuli or processes，bioactivatable nanoparticles serve as dynamic recorders of in vivo conditions， revealing how diseases evolve and the efficacy oftreatments.\n\n【7】In the fight against cancer， early detection is tantamount to gaining a decisive advantage. The development of new molecular contrast agents and materials， made feasible by nanotechnology， offers the path for an earlier and more accurate initial cancer diagnosis as well as continuous monitoring of cancer treatment. There are already a number of nanoparticle-based medical screenings and diagnostics available on the market. The most prevalent usage of nanoparticles， however， is in thetreatment of a wide range of medical conditions， including stomach and intestinal diseases， nerve and intestine obstructions， and many more can be captured by the capsule cameras.\n\n【8】For cancer prevention， nanodevices designed to capture blood-borne biomarkers are being explored. Biomarkers include cancer-associated proteins， spread around the tumor cells， tumor DNA， and exosomes produced by the tumor. Sensors enabled by nanotechnology are capable of readings with high sensitivity， specificity， and multiplexing. The next generation of diagnostic technologies combines sample collection with genetic analysis to improve understanding of a patient's cancer， potential treatments， and disease progression.\n\n【9】In the field of image acquisition，hardware advances that improve the quality of raw data and increase its informational value are favorable. Integrated front-end solutions offer quicker scan times， higher resolutions， and unique structures， such as CT/PET/X-ray， ultrasound/mammography，and PET/MRI combination systems. An accurate automatic prediction based on the image processing faces many challenges like time consumption，efficiencythrough numerous trending technologies such as machine learning algorithms like naive Bayes， KNN， SVM etc. and deep learning algorithms such as CNN， RNN，LSTM，GAN (Generative Adversarial Networks)，RBFN(Radial Basis Function Networks)，SOM (SelfOrganizing Maps) are working in a way. This process involves particular steps like pre-processing， feature extraction， segmentation classification etc. Similarly， visual images face， expressions etc. and other images like EEG plays an imperative role in the fields of cognitive science and neuroscience to predict the behavior of the people. It is an admitted fact that despite giving good results， still we are unable to introduce fully in real-time applications as giving challenges in many aspects.\n\n【10】The most trending technologies like quantum computing and cloud storage can address the challenges which are given by existing systems over the year in terms of time complexity and massive storage. In fact， the results in some cases that take few years will be made in seconds. The imagery which is captured through the edge cutting technologies can be stored in the cloud. Due to these unparalleled services of aforementioned technologies on image processing brings the quality life nearer to the human life with the faster and pure services. Most of the largest countries are making the massive investments in the fields of above to solve the challenges towards the many fields in the society such as health care， finance， security， technology， forecasting etc.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 10:46:52", "endTime": "2024/09/24 10:47:07", "cost": 15.166}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:30", "update_time": "2024-09-23 18:47:07", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 18:46:51"}

Clin Case Rep Int. 2021； 5： 1254. Copyright @ 2021 Tarekegn Bacterial meningitis is a severe infectious disease of the membranes lining the brain and spinal cord caused by P. pneumonae， N meningitides and Influenza resulting in a high mortality and morbidity throughout the world . Meningitis is the most common severe infectious disease in neonates， infants， childhood and adult individuals. Bacterial meningitis is a serious life-threatening disease with severe neurological emergency such as hearing loss， developmental disorders， and neuropsychological impairment， occurring in up to 50% of survivors of the diseases. Even though there were introduction of PCV and HiB vaccine decreases the bacterial meningitis through the world， but the Incidence is 1 to 2 million cases per year worldwide .\n\n【11】Bacterial meningitis causes neurologic related mortality and morbidity globally and elevates the risk of psychological and social problems (psychosocial problems)； which may result in poor antibiotic response. The rate of and associated factors for psychosocial problems among child with meningitis was assessed in this study .\n\n【12】Comparable to other childhood illnesses， the impact of meningitis is not limited to the child experiencing it， but affects all family members. The primary caregiver， caregivers of sick children lost half their daily productivity for an outpatient visit and a full day's productivity for each day a child was hospitalized. According to studies， a caregiver’s daily productivity was assumed to equal the daily minimum wage .\n\n【13】The child meningitis had long-term effects on family members'health， particularly affecting the likelihood of family members reporting anxiety and depression. These effects extended beyond a single close family member. These findings suggest that vaccinating against meningitis will bring significant health benefits not just to those that might have contracted the illness but also to their family networks .\n\n【14】In comparable to other literature，in this case studythe mother was very concerned about her child's current situation and future health. She also very worried about costs of hospitalization，medication costs and her lost income as she spent more of her time with the children.\n\n【15】The family members experience at least one after-effect from meningitis in the survivor. The most commonly reported after-effects were behavioral or emotional problems (28%)， mild/moderate learning disabilities (16%)， scarring or tissue damage (14%)， balance problems (13%)， and speech or language problems (11%) that needs intervention as comprehensive care for caregivers .\n\n【16】In addition， bacterial meningitis often causes hearing loss and is fatal in 5% to 40% of children and 20% to 50% of adults despite treatment with adequate antibiotics. This increases burdens on the caregiver， which mayadversely affect their mental health. In contrast， the family's mental health may affect the development or outcomes of the long-term sequels of meningitis. The main meningeal sequels were hearing loss which accounts about 22% in child after survivors of meningitis .\n\n【17】Some literature recommends rehabilitative care for the child with severe hearing impairment was defined as the absence of an observable response at ≥ 70 dBnHL (decibel above normal adults Hearing Level) and moderate impairment was defined as no response at 50 dBnHL to 60 dBnHL hearing aids throughout their life .\n\n【18】In addition to this hearing loss， Neurological sequela occurs in a substantial amount of patients following bacterial meningitis. Most frequently reported sequela are focal neurological deficits， cognitive impairment and epilepsy which were more associated with pneumococcal and meningococcal meningitis .\n\n【19】Similar to the literature， the child in this case study also has the clinical manifestation of neurological sequels like hemiparesis， deviation of face to the right side and unable to close her eye lids.\n\n【20】According to some literature reveals that children with meningitis caused by P. pneumonae that persist to adolescent also develops or has a greater risk to develop intellectual impairment as compared with normal children .\n\n【21】Similar to other literature in this case study the mother was more feels anxious for her child future and burden encountered. The mother was very concerned about the child's future health， the burden of giving care along of her life and as her child still didn’t walk by herself after 1 month hospitalization.\n\n【22】Nursing Implication\n\n【23】Most of reviewed literatures applaud that， the assessment and care of the children with bacterial meningitis was not only focused on physical aspects but also psychosocial aspects of the child & family as it has positive impact on the child's outcome. Because meningitis after Pneurnococcus preurnonae and HIB bacteria were has enormous after effect. Even though several studies recommend holistic approach of nursing care， the psychosocial aspects of the patient care of a patient with meningitis & other acute illness with chronic sequels was not commonly practiced in this set up. Due to this， many patients with meningitis were suffering from psychosocial problems. As a nurse， it important to understand such problems， I have tried to implement psychosocial interventions such as reassurance， counseling about how the patient lives with disease sequels， for the family and managing acute and chronic complication by regular exercise， adherence to medication， preventing infection， promoting positive self-image， helping child and mother to cope with social anxiety and stigmatization. Finally as recommendation， all staff members and caregivers should incorporate psychosocial aspect of meningitis patients on the assessment and care activities in order to improve the wellbeing of the patient.\n\n【24】Reflection\n\n【25】From this case study I was very notable & get new knowledge. As bacterial meningitis has a significant effect on individual's psychology， social & financially as well. In addition as a nurse we need to know &react on psychosocial influences of meningitis on the patient & his/her family and should intervene as early as possible.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 11:27:18", "endTime": "2024/09/24 11:27:44", "cost": 25.849}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:30", "update_time": "2024-09-23 19:27:42", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 19:27:16"}

Glomus tumors are rare soft tissue tumors that have similar incidence in both genders. Mostly， diagnosis is made in people between 20 to 40 years old and symptoms may precede years before . There are several variants of glomus tumor besides classic histology， including glomangioma， glomangiomyoma and glomangiomatosis. Glomus tumor often occurs in the skin of distal extremities like subungual region of finger， palm， wrist， forearm and foot . Occurrence in the visceral organ is rare， including gastrointestinal tract，lung， mediastinum， pancreas and kidney. There is no definite guideline on treatment ofrenal glomus tumor.\n\n【9】In this report， we describe a 54-year-old woman who presented with a rare primary glomus tumor in the kidney， along with a literature review.\n\n【10】Case Presentation\n\n【11】A 54-year-old female with past history of dyslipidemia and hypothyroidism\n\n【12】A left renal mass around 4 cm in diameter with calcifications and septa in the upper pole was noted under Computed Tomography (CT) accidentally . The tumor was partially enhanced， heterogenous and border was clear. She denied hematuria nor palpable mass except occasionally left flank pain during these days.\n\n【13】After fully discussion with the patient， she decided to receive laparoscopic partiall nephrectomy under the suspect of renal cell carcinoma. The operation course was smooth and no acute complication was noted. Macroscopically， the resected tumor was measured 45 mmx30mm x 30 mm in size and was confined to the renal parenchyma From histopathological examination， immunohistochemical stains of tumor showed immunoreactivity for Smooth Muscle Actin(SMA) and Muscle Actin . No expression within the tumor cells for Desmin， CK， PAX-8，INSM-1，Synaptophysin， CD31， CD34， HMB-45 nor GLUT-1. Glomus tumor was impressed based on immunohistochemical stains features mentioned above. Other part excised along with the tumor showed chronic pyelonephritis microscopically. Discharge was arranged for the patient on the sixth day after the operation.\n\n【14】As of now， no renal function impairment was noted during follow-up after the operation. Computed tomography followed four months after the operation showed no recurrence of tumor. The patient received follow-up with CT annualy and was free of disease at sixteen months after the operation.\n\n【15】Discussion\n\n【16】The normal glomus body is a specialized form of arteriovenous anastomosis that regulates heat. The most distribution site of glomus body is extremities，including digits and palms and it is usuallylocated in the stratum reticularis ofthe dermis. Based on report from Masson， the normal glomus body is composed of afferent arteriole and turns into four preglomic arterioles， which blend with an irregular， thick-walled segment known as the Sucquet-Hoyer canal containing the arteriovenous anastomosis .\n\n【17】Glomus tumors are tumors of mesenchyme that resemble the normal glomus body with smooth muscle and vasculature. Masson firstly proposed the concept of glomus tumor in 1924， according to three cases diagnosed as upper extremity tumor with intermittent sharp pain . Symptoms subsided after tumor excision. He found out the tumor structure was similar to glomus body and suggested that it was related to hyperplasia or overgrowth of glomus body.\n\n【18】According to report from Mayo Clinic， estimated incidence of glomus tumor was 1.6% among 500 consecutive soft tissue tumors. Both genders have equivalent incidence， while patient with subungual lesions are mostly female. Most glomus tumors are diagnosed on people aged between 20 and 40 with symptoms always precede before the diagnosis.\n\n【19】Table 1： Review of previous reported renal glomus tumor.\n\n| Reference  | Age， Sex  | Size (cm)  | Location ofkidney  | Image findings  | Treatment  | Positive immunochemical stain  | Fallow-up  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Benign Glomus Tumor  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Siddiqui et al.  | 55.

Few literatures may also have reported glomus tumor in gastrointestinal tract， the genital organ， oral cavity， trachea， mediastinum， heart and lymph nodes. So far， there are several cases of renal glomus tumor and were summarized in Table 1 . Classically， glomus tumors are solitary， while Okada O et al. and Sawada S et al. ever reported multiple subungual glomus tumors in patients with Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) . Symptoms of glomus tumor often disproportionate with size. Some reported radiating pain away from the lesion and may be induced by changes in temperature， especially to cold， and tactile stimulation of even minor degree.\n\n【22】Mostly， renal glomus tumors behaved as benign tumor， while malignant glomus tumors were also reported in some case reports. There are no specific symptoms among these cases， include flank or abdominal discomfort and microscopic hematuria.Overall， most cases were diagnosed accidentally under image examination.\n\n【23】Radiology image is widely used for differential diagnosis of renal mass. Currently， due to low incidence rate and radiologic characteristics， it is not easy to diagnose glomus tumor of the kidney depends on only image . Many previous reported cases showed enhanced， heterogenous lesion under CT with clear border. In our case， image revealed diffused calcification and malignancy was suspected. During the operation， firm texture of tumor was noted， which was different from common renal tumor.\n\n【24】Glomus tumor usually occurred in middle-aged people. Zhao et al. ever reported one case of a young girl with past history of tuberous sclerosis complex diagnosed as renal glomus tumor at the age of age. The patient received partial nephrectomy and was free of disease at 16 months of follow-up.\n\n【25】Tissue biopsy or pathology from surgery is necessary for confirming the diagnosis of glomus tumor. Immunohistochemical diagnosis is made based on immunoreactivity for both common muscle and smooth muscle actin regardless of different location of tumor . Renal glomus tumor is distinguishable from renal cell carcinoma because it is positive for muscle markers while negative for epithelial markers including cytokeratin and epithelial membrane antigen. Immunoactivity of desmin of tumor was variable， ranging from focal positivity to no expression . It is reported that peripheral/subcutaneous glomus tumor expressed CD34 positivity more frequently than visceral glomus tumor . S-100 protein， various cytokeratin's and other markers induding CD31，HMB-45， CD117， CD20， CD45， C56 and CD57 showed negative result mostly .\n\n【26】Previous study has defined the criteria for possible malignancy， which includes  tumor size larger than two centimeter and deep location inkidney；  display ofatypical mitotic figures；  significant nuclear grade and mitotic activity (5 mitoses/50 HPF) . In our cases， tumor size was larger than two centimeter and located deep in upper pole of left kidney， while pathology report showed no obvious increased mitosis or necrosis. Surgical resection remained mainstay treatment in previous reported cases . Mostly， the prognosis was acceptable， either pathological report showed atypical and malignant or benign glomus tumor. Lamba et al. ， however， firstly reported malignant renal glomus tumor with pelvic bones and spine metastasis. Palliative chemotherapy and radiation therapy was given while poor response was noted. The patient passed away within six months after diagnosis. To our knowledge， there was only one malignant renal glomus tumor ever reported in our living district according to the criteria. The patient received radical nephrectomy and adrenalectomy for the tumor and he was free of disease at six months of follow-up.\n\n【27】In conclusion， renal glomus tumor is an uncommon tumor that encompassed unspecific clinical symptoms. It is challenging to distinguish renal glomus tumor from other renal tumors including renal cell carcinoma bysymptoms，laboratoryandimage data. Definite diagnosis was always made based on histopathological examination. There are still limited data and consensus for treatment of renal glomus tumor due to scarcity. Because of the acceptable outcome and recurrence， surgical resection of the tumor may be considered， either partial or radical nephrectomy. Regular follow-up may be needed after primary treatment due to ever-reported recurrent case even though low recurrence rate was noted .", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 11:26:56", "endTime": "2024/09/24 11:28:19", "cost": 83.202}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:30", "update_time": "2024-09-23 19:28:19", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 19:26:55"}

A variety of new laparoscopic and endoscopic techniques exist to aid in the weight loss process， with some of the newest advances in intra gastric balloons. In this case report， we aim to answer the question of whether the Air-filled Gastric Balloon System can act as a bridge to definitive bariatric surgery， as an off-label use， in patients with a BMI greater than 65 kg/m.\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】The prevalence of obesity is increasing worldwide， and The Center of Disease Control (CDC) data indicates that 39.8% of adults and 18.5% of youth in the United States are obese . Obesity is associated with several comorbidities， including heart disease，stroke， diabetes， and various types of cancer. Additionally， obesity and related co morbid conditions impart an increasing economic burden on health care systems. For example， in 2008， it was estimated that the United States spent$142 billion USD on obesity-related medical costs .\n\n【4】Although lifestyle modifications are first-line treatments for obesity， these approaches are generally ineffective due to several factors， particularly lack of patient compliance. Thus， various surgical interventions have emerged over the last five decades to facilitate obesity management. Since the first jejunoileal bypass was performed in 1954 by Dr. Kremen， bariatric surgical procedures have continued to evolve . With relatively recent advancements in endoscopic and laparoscopic techniques， there are now several procedures with varying degrees of complexity used for obesity management. An emerging treatment option for obesity is the intra gastric balloon.\n\n【5】Intra gastric balloons are currently used as an adjunctive therapy for weight loss in obese individuals. The principle mechanism of action of these balloons is to target the mechanoreceptors of the gastric wall. Once delivered into the stomach， they occupy the gastric cavity， induce an early sensation of satiety， and thereby reduce caloric intake.\n\n【6】Currently there are two types of intra gastric balloons： fluid-filled and air-filled. The Obalon Balloon System was approved for use in 2016 and is the first FDA approved swallow able balloon system designed for weight loss. Currently， the Obalon Balloon System is indicated for temporary use to facilitate weight loss in adults with a BMI of 30 kg/m’ to 40 kg/m’ who have failed to lose weight through diet and exercise. The system is intended to be used as an adjunct to a moderate intensity diet and behavior modification program.\n\n【7】The Obalon Balloon System comes in a set of three balloons that the patient swallows. Occasionally， endoscopy is used to assist in intra gastric placement of the baloon. All balloons must be removed 6 months after the first balloon is placed . Of the air-filled intra gastric balloon options， the Obalon Balloon System has been shown to be the most likely to achieve weight loss. Aside from a rare potential association between fluid-filled intra gastric balloons and acute pancreatitis ， the side effect profile of the Obalon Balloon System is relatively benign. The most common adverse effects reported are nausea and emesis . Small bowel obstruction has also been reported from a migrating Obalon balloon， which was managed endoscopically . Additionally， there is one reported case in Korea of gastric perforation in a patient with noncompliance of PPI therapy after intra gastric balloon insertion， however， it should be noted that the Obalon Balloon System was not used in this case .\n\n【8】Here， we report the first use of air-filled gastric balloon system (Obalon) as a successful adjunctive modality for bariatric surgery in a patient with morbid obesity in extremely high BMI(>65 kg/m²). To our knowledge， there has not been any other documented off-label use of an intra gastric balloon system.\n\n【9】Case Presentation\n\n【10】A 52-year-old male with a history of arthritis， hypertension， hypothyroidism and morbid obesity presented in July 2018， for evaluation for bariatric surgery. His weight was 243 kg (BMI 70.7kg/m)andprevious attempts toloseweight with nutritional modification were unsuccessful. In addition，due to a history of arthritis，the patient was bed-bound and unable to carry out activities of daily living. Immobility and morbid obesity resulted in the development of an acute lower extremity deep vein thrombosis and shortness of breath， likely due to a pulmonary embolism， which was never confirmed because of the weight limit of the CT scanner. Due to his high BMI， and associated co morbid conditions， the patient was considered to be an extremely high risk bariatric surgical candidate. The decision was made， after comprehensive discussion with the patient， to utilize the Air-filled Gastric Balloon System to attempt weight loss and optimize the patient for bariatric surgery. He underwent insertion of a total of three intra gastric balloons from July to September 2018. He presented to Flushing Hospital Medical Center on February 5h， 2019for removal of the balloons.\n\n【11】Our patient lost a total of 73 kg and weighed 170 kg (BMI 49.5kg/m’) at the time of the intra gastric balloon removal. He is currently scheduled to undergo sleeve gastrectomy sometime in the next 3 to4 months.\n\n【12】Risk Profile\n\n【13】Based on the ACS NSQIP Surgical Risk Calculator ， we calculated that with our patient's initial weight (243 kg， BMI 70.7kg/m) and severe co morbid conditions， his risk of serious postoperative complications would have been 5.5%， which is double that of the average population at 2.4%. His calculated overall postoperative complication risk would have been 6.9%， compared to 3% in the average risk patient. By lowering his weight， his calculated risk of serious postoperative complication would decrease to 2.7% (which is similar to those at average risk at 2.4%).\n\n【14】Discussion\n\n【15】Intra gastric balloons have emerged as a safe and practical adjunct for weight loss in obese individuals. Among the air-filled balloon options， the Obalon Balloon System has been demonstrated to be most likely to result in weight loss . Moreover， while the other methods involve at least an endoscopic suite for placement， the Obalon Balloon System is available in pill form and can be administered in an ambulatory setting. Since there is no requirement for anesthesia，the risk of complications is lower.\n\n【16】The safety profile of the Obalon Balloon System is based off of a double blinded，randomized controlled， clinical trialthatincluded 387patients with a BMI between 30 kg/m and 40 kg/m. These patients were randomized to receive either the Obalon Balloon System or a sham device and were assessed for weight loss and safety outcomes after an initial 24-week period . Since this study， the Food and Drug Administration has approved the Obalon Balloon System for a targeted patient BMI between 30 kg/m’ to 40kg/m.\n\n【17】An important consideration in applying the Obalon Balloon\n\n【18】System is the cost. The Obalon Balloon System is not currently covered by insurance， thereby imparting a patient-provided cost of $6，000 to $8，500 USD. Thus， there is a potential socioeconomic burden that may affect endpoints in the future.\n\n【19】Our patient chose to undergo a pioneeringprocedure for a patient of his BMI. Had this not been offered， alternative options to this off-label use include intensive inpatient dietary modification and exercise programs， or direct to surgery. For patients with a BMI greater than65 k/m²， these alternate options， if failed， pose a greater risk and cost.\n\n【20】Prospective studies should be conducted to investigate the feasibility ofusing intra gastric balloons as a bridge to bariatric surgery in extremely obese individuals，that otherwise have a prohibitive risk tor surgical intervention.\n\n【21】Conclusion\n\n【22】Effective and safe weight loss in patients with morbid obesity is essential. In our patient， the air-filled gastric balloon system(specifically Obalon) offered a minimally invasive and compelling method in achieving adequate weight loss prior to bariatric surgery. We demonstrated the successful off-label use of the air-filled gastric balloon system as an adjunctive therapy to facilitate weight loss and serve as a bridge to bariatric surgery in a patient with an initial BMI greater than 65 kg/m.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 10:42:08", "endTime": "2024/09/24 10:42:38", "cost": 30.074}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:30", "update_time": "2024-09-23 18:42:38", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 18:42:07"}

According to the Lancet series on maternal and child undernutrition， 90% of the world’s stunted children are found in 36 countries . UNICEF's West and Central Africa (WCA) region， which brings together 24 countries， includes 8of these 36 countries in which stunting is particularly high .\n\n【10】In the Lancet papers， low investment in nutrition in most developing countries has been identified as a barrier to scaling up high-impact interventions in this area . Several West and Central African countries have strategic plans for nutrition or food and nutrition security. However， very few of these plans are based on the latest science and are budgeted. Each year， nutrition officials， national-level nutrition actors， and their regional and international partners convene the Annual Economic Community of West and Central African States Nutrition Forum， under the technical direction of the West African Health Organization (WAHO). In 2010， the forum would have provided an opportunity to disseminate the latest technical information related to the theme of the forum：“Financing and planning nutrition programs in Africa”.\n\n【11】Every year in Africa， one million children under the age of 5 die from causes related to malnutrition. Malnutrition contributes to35% of all child deaths in the region . In 2009， the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) conducted a nutrition vulnerability analysis that looked at factors such as the prevalence of child undernutrition， access to vitamin A and salt iodized， the level of food insecurity and governance . This analysis has shown， for example， that Burkina Faso， the Central African Republic， Chad， Guinea Bissau， Niger and Sierra Leone have the highest level of nutritional vulnerability in WCA . The regional prevalence of wasting among children is 10%， indicating that the nutritional status of children is a serious concern. Moreover， these average hides significant disparities. Wasting rates among children under 5 are alarmingly high in Sahelian countries such as Burkina Faso， Chad， Mali， Mauritania and Niger and range from 11% to 19%， affecting more than 1 million children (UNICEF，2006). As in the results promulgated by UNICEF， the UNICEF WCA region， which comprises a total of 24 countries， includes 8 of the 36 countries in which stunting is particularly high， for which an estimate of stunting is available. funding needs， and11 of 32 smaller countries with rates of stunting and/or wasting in children >20%， which could be added to previous estimates at an additional cost of 6% .\n\n【12】With regard to accessibility to RUTF (plumpy'nut/fortified biscuits) and its use in households， this depends on the food supplementation program or the social protection and food aid programs based on the level malnourished . As we can see； for SAM with medical complications (P/T<70% of the median or bilateral edema or MUAC <115 mm and at least 1 of the following：Anorexia， ARI， fever >39C， severe dehydration， severe anemia， drowsiness or coma)， management and supply of RUTF are done at the level of URENI/CRENI/CNT/UNT (hospitals) . But SAM without medical complications (<70% of the median P/T， or bilateral edema or PB. <115 mm， appetite preserved and the absence of worrying or warning clinical signs)， the supply here and the taking care is done on an outpatient basis at the level of the URENAS/CRENAS/CNA/ (CS)， only the non-malnourished can be taken care of by the family . Reason why UNICEF wants all of Africa to aspire to achieve food and nutrition security， to say adequate food (quantity， quality， safety， cultural acceptability) is available， accessible and used satisfactorily by all individuals in order to lead a healthy and happy life . Despite the efforts made by many African countries in the fight against malnutrition， care and food supply centers suffer from the unavailability and regularity of RUTF at their breasts， while most African countries are subject to nutritional emergencies. However， these dysfunctions do not prevent the hospital or the center from being frequented.Sohowto deal with these constraints that hinder the proper functioning of places of supply of RUTF and management of SAM? What can a nutritional rehabilitation center supplementation program for children with SAM look like in the African context? In order to answer these different questions，let's see what the rest of our work has in store for us.\n\n【13】In countries with limited resources， one person in five is chronically undernourished， that is to say more than 800 million individuals. Every year 6 million children under the age of 5 die from the consequences ofhunger and malnutrition . On the other hand， more than 2 billion people suffer from various micronutrient deficiencies， of which 2 billion people， including 52% pregnant women and 39% children under five， suffer from anemia due to lack of iron， 740 million of people suffer from iodine deficiency； 120 million children are victims of vitamin A deficiency； 180 million children are stunted due to nutritional deficiencies .\n\n【14】In Africa between 15 and 30% of adults are chronically undernourished and up to 50% of children have low birth weight. To achieve the objective set at the last World Food Summit， which is to halve the number of those who suffer from hunger， the number of undernourished people would have to be reduced by 22 million a year， whereas this figure is currently only 6 million per year . About 11% of children under 5 or 7.8 million suffer from acute malnutrition (wasting) (1.7 million in Nigeria， 1.7 million in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and 1.3 million in the Sahel countries (based on the latest available data from 2005-2010) Chronic malnutrition (stunting) affects 40% of children or 26.5million children in the region (10.1 million in Nigeria and 5.3 million in DRC)； underweight， an indicator used for the first Millennium Development Goal (MDG)， affects 22% of children under 5 - or 15.4million children in the region (5.7 million in Nigeria and 2.9 million in the DRC) .\n\n【15】Access methods\n\n【16】The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the community-based outpatient treatment program as the standard treatment protocol for the management of uncomplicated severe acute malnutrition at the community level.\n\n【17】In 2016 Eva-Charlotte et al.， in Ethiopia in her study on the challenges in the implementation of the integrated community outpatient therapeutic program shows that the availability of RUTF must be ensured by the application of the appropriate supply chain and policy monitoring. Furthermore， nutritional interventions that address household food insecurity have the potential to reduce the sharing and sale of RUTF， thereby improving the effectiveness of SAM management. This might need a political platform that brings together different actors such as local communities， non-governmental organization and international organizations . For the United Nations background the limited availability of inpatient care and a weak referral network between health posts and health facilities further consider barriers to referral of children who have failed to meet recommended program criteria to their exit from the program .\n\n【18】Acute malnutrition is a continuum condition， but severe forms are treated separately， with different treatment protocols and products， managed by separate UN agencies . The Combined Acute Malnutrition Study Protocol aims to simplify and unify the treatment of severe uncomplicated acute malnutrition in children 6to 59 months of age into one protocol for each country in order to improve global coverage， quality， continuity care . In humanitarian settings， current national and international recommendations imply treatment ofSAM is done with RUTF in separate UN programs， using separate protocols and UN agencies in an outpatient therapeutic program . Only patients with SAM and medical complications require hospitalization to be stabilized while those without medical complications can be managed in outpatient therapeutic management with RUTF . The WHO recommends the use of Ready-to-Use Therapeutic Food (RUTF) during the rehabilitation phase in outpatient therapeutic care for patients with SAM.\n\n【19】SAM management at community level\n\n【20】The management of SAM presents a huge challenge， especially in ealth facilities with insufficient resources. The integrated management of MAS includes both inpatient and community services. Children with SAM and complications such as severe oedema， fever or diarrhea are treated as hospitalized patients . Community-based therapeutic care was instituted because admission to hospital had several disadvantages， includingthe risk of nosocomial infections and high expenses for the family. The health of siblings and the consequences of removing the mother from the household must be considered . Children with simple SAM who are clinically well and pass the appetite test are better managed in the community； household provides higher coverage than residential programs (more than 70% vs. 10%). Community therapeutic care was endorsed by WHO and UNICEF in 2009.\n\n【21】Generally， community therapeutic care is based in local health centers. At registration the child receives a course of oral broad-spectrum antibiotics weekly and appropriate distribution of RUTF with families， but weight gain is usually not as rapid as in hospitalized patients . RUTFs are very palatable and there may be a temptation to share rations with other children in the household sometimes in accordance with cultural norms of food sharing， which is why the goal of its care is to promote recovery by providing nutritious food rations preferably from locally available foods and appropriate health education and， above all， preventing the progression of SAM .\n\n【22】In an attempt to improve outcomes， and to address the multiple， co-existing abnormalities that occur in SAM， WHO has produced a standard 10-step protocol consisting of two phases (initial phase and rehabilitation phase)： Treat/prevent hypoglycemia，hypothermia， dehydration， infection； correcteelectrolyte and micronutrient imbalance； start of refeeding achieving catch-up growth； provide sensory stimulation and emotional support and finally follow-up. The objectives of the study were： Describe the organization/functioning of SAM supplyand care centers， Describe the importance of using SAM RUTF at community level， identify approaches for implementing SAM interventions， determine the challenges in the African context of RUTF in the management of SAM.\n\n【23】ConceptualFramework\n\n【24】Based on the analysis of the nutritional situation and the determinants of malnutrition， as evidenced by the literature， to achieve our objectives we have adapted the framework of UNICEF，2008 .\n\n【25】Root causes\n\n【26】Refer to available resources (human， structural， financial) and their use (political， legal and cultural factors) . The degree to which the rights of women and girls are protected by law and custom； the political and economic system that determines the distribution of income and assets； and the ideologies and policies that govern social sectors，\n\n【27】Underlying causes\n\n【28】These are factors grouped into food security， care practices such as appropriate complementary feeding， and hygiene and health seeking behaviors that promote good nutrition . These practices can be severely disrupted during emergencies， which can lead to insufficient food intake and increased infection. Access to safe water and adequate sanitation facilities can be severely limited in an area.\n\n【29】Immediate causes\n\n【30】These are the causes that can directly lead to lower immunity in non-pregnant women of childbearing age and children. This concerns the state of health of women and children： Parasitic infections such as malaria， or viral infections (HIV)， can lead to a drop in the level of hemoglobin， or worsen it if it is already present. The nutritional status of non-pregnant women of childbearing age： The poor nutritional status of women can lead to a deficiency in essential vitamins and micronutrients， including iron， which， in the long term， will impact the hemoglobin level and finally the intake in inadequate food ration.\n\n【31】Methods\n\n【32】Study framework and study period\n\n【33】We are interested in sub-Saharan Africa (West and Central Africa) which is the region of the African continent located south of the Sahara Desert and which has the most nutrition problems. It has48 countries for just over a billion inhabitants. Sub-Saharan Africa is the most dynamic part of the planet in terms of demographic， whose food and nutrition security problems are the most worrying at the global level.\n\n【34】Our study consisted in making an inventory through a review of the literature on the modes of access to RUTF and their uses in households to fight against SAM in sub-Saharan Africa during a period of four months from the month from March to June 2020.\n\n【35】Study approach\n\n【36】We reviewed the literature on RUTF in the fight against SAM in sub-Saharan Africa. The approach consisted of a situational analysis by compiling 20 relevant articles on the question of knowing the place of RUTF in the fight against SAM. And to make a synthesis on the organization， the challenges and prospects of the centers of supply and assumption of responsibility of SAM.\n\n【37】Results\n\n【38】Overview of SAM RUTFs and their indications\n\n【39】We have found some nutritional inputs， but given the diversity of protocols in African countries， we will limit ourselves to citing RUTF and their indications.\n\n【40】F-75 therapeutic milk： Administer in the stabilization phase of severe acute malnutrition. It must be used in therapeutic re-nutrition centers benefiting from medical supervision and must not be distributed directly to families. This stabilization phase consists of ensuring the rehydration of children and the management of their medical complications， while initiating re-nutrition. In addition to skimmed milk powder， F-75 therapeutic milk contains vegetable fat， maltodextrin， sugar， and a complex of minerals and vitamins.\n\n【41】With a caloric density of 75 kcal per 100 ml of reconstituted milk， F-75 is not intended to cause the child to gain weight， its use should therefore be limited to phase 1 (3 days on average). F-75 milk can be given from the age of 6 months. Once reconstituted， F-75 therapeutic milk can be stored for 3 hours at room temperature， up to 16 hours in the refrigerator. Beyond that， it becomes unfit for consumption and must be thrown away.\n\n【42】F-100 therapeutic milk： It must be used in therapeutic re-nutrition centers benefiting from medical supervision and must not be distributed directly to families. It is administered during the stabilization phase of severe acute malnutrition.F-100low osmolarity therapeutic milk has been specially designed for the nutritional rehabilitation of people suffering from severe acute malnutrition， during phase 2 of treatment. Once reconstituted，F-100 therapeutic milk can be stored for 3 h at room temperature， and up to 16 h in the refrigerator. Beyond that， it becomes unfit for consumption and must be thrown away.\n\n【43】Plumpy nut： It is the first RUTFintended for thetreatmentofSAM， with a nutritional value equivalent to that of F-100 therapeutic milk， Plumpynut is specially dedicated to the nutritional rehabilitation of people (children from 6 months and adults) suffering from severe acute malnutrition. This peanut-based paste， sugar， vegetable fats， skimmed milk powder， enriched with vitamins and minerals  comes in 92 g sachets providing 500 kcal. This peanut-based paste， sugar， vegetable fats， skimmed milk powder， enriched with vitamins and minerals comes in 92 g sachets providing 500 kcal (BP-5， BP-100). Ready-to-use food， Plumpy'nut' requires no preparation， no prior dilution in water， no cooking， and can be consumed directly from the sachet. Quantities to plan： 200 kcal/d/kg until the child reaches his target weight， i.e.， an average duration of 6 to 10 weeks. For the treatment of a 7 kg child suffering from severe acute malnutrition： approximately one box of Plumpy'nut， i.e.， 13.8 kg (calculation on the basis of 200kcal/kg/day，i.e.， 2.8 sachets/day for 8 weeks).\n\n【44】ReSoMal： Food intended for the preparation of oral rehydration solution in people with severe acute malnutrition. It must be used in therapeutic re-nutrition centers benefiting from medical supervision and must not be distributed directly to families .\n\n【45】Review of the operation and organization of the centers\n\n【46】The SAM prevention and care program in many African countries is modeled on the health pyramid， with a first level， consisting of villages with health huts run by a health worker or a community health worker supported by relays in charge of prevention，screening and referral activities. At the second level of reference， the integrated health centers， with the main tasks of prevention and integrated outpatient management ofcases without associated medical complications. The third level is essentially made up of hospitals where cases of undernutrition with associated medical complications are cared for .\n\n【47】Use of RUTF at household level\n\n【48】In DRC， the nutritional management of uncomplicated SAM is based on Ready-to-Use Therapeutic Food (RUTF) product which consists of dry rations containing a mixture of pulses and starch foods fortified with micronutrients， oil， vitamin A and sugar. They provide between 1000 and 1200 Kcal/day/person ； and also， cows milk alternated with vegetable oil sugar preparations corn， soy，beans， is an acceptable alternative to conventional formulations of RUTF. This food is locally accessible in households， adequately responds to shortages in conventional supply in places without an adequate health system . In 2002， a study carried out in the DRC and Malawi shows that an amino acid enriched milk-free soya-but-sorghum based RUTF can be used to treat SAM in children 6 to 59 months vears old. This product achieves recovery and treatment rates that when not lower than standard RUTF and is superior in its ability to treat anemia and restore body iron stores . The significantly lower cost of this new RUTF and its reliance on locally grown ingredients would reduce SAM treatment costs， more children will be treated within existing budgets and facilitate the production of RUTF in countries with high SAM burden . RUTF solved SAM problems with low water content and high energy density composition， which allows decentralized management of SAM， called community management of acute malnutrition， right at home . Commercial RUTFs are biphasic oil/powder systems made from peanuts， skimmed milk powder， sugar， rapeseed and palm oil， and a mixture of vitamins and minerals . Nowadays， local production， following the precise specificities of the United Nations (UN)， Food and Agriculture (FAO) and the United Nations for Children (UNICEF)， is possible， but with costs of still high ingredients， especially skimmed milk powder. Therefore， it is important to define new alternative recipes， usinglocal products for a sustainable production ofthe dough .\n\n【49】Main Approaches to lmplementing SAM Interventions\n\n【50】Most African countries use， among other things， the positive deviance approach commonly referred to as \"Home for Learning and Nutritional Rehabilitation\" (FARN) and that of Community-Based Growth Promotion are the most frequently implemented by example in Niger. Home gardening， home visits (VAD) and community screening for malnutrition are most often integrated as activities in both approaches. Social Communication for Behavior Change (SBCC) or Communication for Development is a cross-cutting strategy for transmitting the messages of essential family practices that constitutes the bulk of interventions at the community level.\n\n【51】Challenges in the African context of RUTF in the management of SAM\n\n【52】The most used approaches are community-based， the following are the challenges：\n\n【53】The identification of promising intervention centers，\n\n【54】The scaling up of community interventions in the fight against SAM，\n\n【55】Ownership0o1finteryentions with full community participation，\n\n【56】Intersectoral collaboration for the availability of RUTF，\n\n【57】Good governance/politicalcommitment to siistain investment in nutrition.\n\n【58】Prospects for SAM supply and care centers\n\n【59】Many changes have taken place at the heart of the health system， often in response to contextual changes and health challenges. On the one hand， solutions have emerged， on the other hand， the actors have diversified， creating new challenges in terms of coordination， especially in emergency situations. Development strategies based on economic growth alone are insufficient to reduce SAM， hence the accompaniment by specific investments in nutrition or integrated approaches in nutrition， the strengthening of resilience are created in some African countries to assess the performance and effectiveness of a dietary supplementation program.\n\n【60】Conclusion\n\n【61】In view of the importance of these results from the documentary review，RUTF supplementation programs are of great value in Africa where malnutrition is experienced intergenerationally， ravaging human lives， especially children and adults. here that successful interventions are those designed and implemented in a decentralized way that is community-centered and encourages community participation at every stage of planning and implementation and at all levels of decision-making.

Pregnant women are at greater risk of this complication because of several reasons e.g. lower baseline plasma sodium level in pregnancy， altered secretion of Anti Diuretic Hormone (ADH)， inappropriate fluid management in labor or increased oral intake and the anti-diuretic effect of oxytocin. We present a case which illustrates complications associated with hypervolemic hyponatremia as a result of positive fluid balance in labor. A caesarean section was required for failure to progress in first stage， chorioamnionitis， hyponatremia and acute kidney injury. She developed narrow complex Supra Ventricular Tachycardia (SVT) immediate post-delivery which was terminated with adenosine.\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】In the literature， and national guidance framework， there is a paucity of guidance for the fluid management of laboring women. This group is at a high risk of dehydration， and fluid overload if careful management of fluid intake， both oral and intravenous， is not undertaken. This can lead to risk of acute kidney injury， electrolyte imbalances  and cardiac arrhythmias associated with fluid overload， and well as neonatal risks， including transient neonatal tachypnoea ， jaundice， hyperbilirubinemia， fluid overload and seizures .\n\n【4】Case Presentation\n\n【5】Ms X， a 26 year old primiparous Caucasian woman was low risk with a BMI of 27 kg/m². Her pregnancy was uneventful and she presented to our Midwifery Led Unit (MLU) following spontaneous rupture of membranes at 40+8 weeks. Following a delay in the 15 stage of labor at 5 cm cervical dilatation，she was transferred to the Consultant Led Unit (CLU) for oxytocin augmentation.\n\n【6】In terms of fluid intake and output record in labor； she had 4L of intravenous Hartmann's in labor in consultant led unit， but prior oral intake in labor was unknown. She had required 9 h of oxytocin infusion in labor with titration rates of 8 to 12 ml/hr according to uterine contractions. Her total urine output in 9 h was recorded as 700 ml. She subsequently developed pyrexia in labor. In view of poor urine output and pyrexia in labor， she had septic screen and bloods taken， including FBC， CRP， U&Es and lactate. This showed her sodium level as 120 mmol/l and creatinine 139umol/l. Nine hours prior to deterioration， her creatinine level was 72 umol/l； however sodium was recorded low at 123 mmol/l. There were no preceding sodium levels to compare to.\n\n【7】Following review of blood results， identification of Acute Kidney Injury (AKI)， suspected chorioamnionitis and delay in the 15 stage of labor at 8 cm cervical dilatation，the decision was made to expedite delivery by caesarean section. Blood loss at delivery was 800 ml and fetal weight as 4215g. Neonatal Apgar reported as 7 at 1 min and 5 at 10 min. Cord gases were 7.29 BE -3.7 (arterial) and 7.31 BE -4.6(venous). Baby required neonatal special care input with IV antibiotics and sodium replacement in view of neonatal hyponatremia.\n\n【8】Immediately following delivery， she developed narrowcomplex supra ventricular tachycardia and required cardio version with IV adenosine. She was subsequently transferred to Intensive Therapies Unit (ITU) for cardiac monitoring， and strict fluid monitoring in light of hyponatremia and AKI. She required multidisciplinary care with further input from intensive care team， medical and renalteams for ongoing management.\n\n【9】At time ofSVT，her GCS remained 15 with normal blood pressure and oxygen saturations. Her spot sodium test showed sodium of 117mmol/l and potassium of 3.2 mmol/. She developed second episode of SVT in ITU 6 h later， which required further cardio version with IV adenosine.\n\n【10】She required potassium and magnesium replacement in ITU. Her cortisol and thyroid function tests were reported as normal. Her initial urine creatinine was 2.48 mmol/l with urine sodium as 17.8mmol/l and urine sodium to creatinine ratio as 7.2. She made full recovery and was discharged home with baby on day .\n\n【11】Following cardiology review， she had an EP (Electrophysiology) study which confirmed the suspicion of an accessory pathway which has now been ablated.\n\n【12】Discussion\n\n【13】Hyponatremia ishbroadlycharacterized as euvolemic， hypervolemic or hypovolemic hyponatremia. In pregnancy， the most common manifestation is hypervolemic hyponatremia (also referred to as dilutional hyponatremia or water toxicity). This is caused due to the woman taking on more fluid than she is able to excrete， resulting in a relative drop in serum concentration of sodium. Acute hyponatremia may cause cerebral edema in severe cases， but most cases are asymptomatic. Early signs and symptoms of hyponatremia are often difficult to identify. These indlude lethargy， agitation， headache， confusion and altered mental state.\n\n【14】Accepted values for normal sodium levels in pregnancy are 130mmol/L to 140 mmol/L ， due to the dilutional state induced by pregnancy， particularly in the third trimester . This is due to increased water retention - a result of physiologically increased ADH secretion in pregnancy . Oxytocin， another hypothalamic neuropeptide，has a similar chemical structure to ADH and increases the risk of fluid retention . Compounds with this effect as well as over-judicious administration of fluids， both IV and oral can lead to hypervolemic hyponatremia. In many cases hyponatremia is mild and asymptomatic.\n\n【15】Previously reported cases outline that administration ofhypotonic fluid (e.g. 5% dextrose) significantly increase the risk of dilutional hyponatremia ， so there has since been a shift in trends towards more physiological fluids (e.g.， Hartmann’s solution for fluid resuscitation， and normal saline for oxytocin administration). One Swedish observational study demonstrated that 26% of women who received more than 2500 mL fluid in labor (both oral and intravenous) were hyponatremic in the postpartum period . Interestingly， in this same group there was no statistically significant relationship between oxytocin augmentation and hyponatremia.\n\n【16】Hyponatremia has been reported in cases of pre-eclampsia npregnancy. It's hypothesized that release of vasopressin in hypervolemic state in cases of deranged circulating volume in pre-eclampsia and ascites may be related to this pathology. It’s important to keep this in mind while investigating for causes ofhyponatremia in labor . Our case did not have problem with blood pressure or proteinuria in pregnancy or labor and did not exhibit any signs and symptoms of Pre-eclampsia.\n\n【17】It's important to keep a strict fluid balance while being admitted to maternity wards especially for women undergoing induction of labor and in established labor. We have introduced a local guidance to guide fluid management in labor， recognition of hyponatremia and treatment since this case. We would encourage maternity units to devise their local guidance to increase awareness and management of fluid balance in labor to avoid a potentially serious complication of unrecognized hyponatremia for mothers and neonates.\n\n【18】Maternal Hyponatremia risks the cases of neonatal hyponatremia， which can cause fetal hyperbilirubinemia and jaundice， feeding difficulties， respiratory distress and convulsions. It's important to inform pediatrician about maternal hyponatremia in labor so that a neonatal management plan is devised in a timely manner.\n\n【19】Electrolyte disturbances can cause conduction problems in heart There have been case reports of atrioventricular block with severe hyponatremia which improved following correction of hyponatremia.\n\n【20】Electrolyte disturbances can also cause changes in sino-atrial node and pulmonary vein electrical activity leading to atrial fibrillation. An ECG should be offered to women with severe electrolyte disturbance to rule out consequent cardiac arrhythmias.\n\n【21】Pregnancy itself can predispose to arrhythmiaasSwithout underlying heart disease because of increasing heart rate， circulating plasma volume changes and autonomic and hormonal changes and increased catecholamine.\n\n【22】To our knowledge， this is first case report of occurrence of supra ventricular tachycardia in a woman with concomitant severe hyponatremia. Her subsequent investigations revealed the presence of an accessory pathway which needed further management. This could have triggered her SVT with other biochemical changes in immediate postpartum period.\n\n【23】Treatment of SVT in pregnancy includes vagal maneuvers first and it fails to terminate tachycardia， adenosine is usually used as first line. Metoprolol or verapamil can be used in pregnancy too.\n\n【24】Learning Points\n\n【25】1. Accurate fluid balance is important in labor as women are at high risk of dehydration as well as fluid overload.\n\n【26】2. Hyponatremia is a potentially life-threatening complication for women and their neonates. It's important to recognize， diagnose and treat accordingly.\n\n【27】3. Neonatologist should be informed oft maternal hyponatremiafor timelLyymanagementof potential neonatal hyponatremia.\n\n【28】4 Multidisciplinary management of these cases is important such as medical specialist， anesthetist， ITU specialist， nephrologist and cardiologist.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 10:33:47", "endTime": "2024/09/24 10:36:02", "cost": 134.811}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:30", "update_time": "2024-09-23 18:36:00", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 18:33:45"}

For this reason， a high index of suspicion leading to early diagnosis and institution ofappropriate management is required In the current era， risk factors are changing， with a marked decrease in rheumatic heart disease， as an underlying cardiac risk factor， and a concomitant increase in congenital heart disease and intravenous drug use.\n\n【2】The presence of Ventricular Septum Defect (VSD) is one of the predisposing factors； in fact， VSD， according to several registries， is the most frequent congenital heart disease in pregnant women  . Over time， maternal and fetal outcomes have improved and this is likely related to advances in maternal-fetal monitoring， better surgical techniques， and availability of nontoxic and effective antimicrobial agents.\n\n【3】Staphylococcus， Streptococcus， and Enterococcus species account for between 80% and 90% of all cases of IE worldwide . In particular， S. gordonii is a rare cause of IE that has been sparsely reported in the literature. S. gordonii are Gram-positive， alpha-hemolytic chains of cocci that play an important role in the alkalization of the oral cavity and protective biofilm production . Once in the blood stream， S. gordonii appear to have the virulence factors that are pathogenic in the development of IE. The cell wall of S. gordonii contains a serine-rich glycoprotein， GspB， which mediates binding to human platelets . After adherence to the platelet， the combination has the potential to attach to the fibronectin-rich extracellular matrix of the cardiac valves and subsequently form valvular vegetations.\n\n【4】Case Presentation\n\n【5】One month prior to admission (March 2020) she suffered from pain in the upper right dental arch and fever； she was treated with amoxicillin for 5 days (April 2nd to 7th) with benefit. Four days after stopping the therapy， fever reappeared and inflammatory markers increased； a one-week antibiotic cycle with amoxicillin and ceftriaxone was administered； but again， a recrudescence of fever occurred after the suspension of therapy.\n\n【6】The following examinations were performed：\n\n【7】1.

Mixed-Dust Pneumoconiosis (MDP) is rarely reported， although exposure to a multitude of different inorganic components is common in environmental and occupational settings and it ought to be considered as a differential diagnosis.\n\n【8】Case Presentation\n\n【9】We describe a 52-year-old man， former smoker (5 pack year)， who presented to a pulmonology appointment to evaluate possible COVID-19pneumonia sequela. He had a past medical history of hypertension， dyslipidemia and acute myocardial infarction in 2008. His daily medication included bisoprolol， rosuvastatine， enalapril and hydrochlorothiazide. He lived in an urban area， with no exposure to biomass burning and had no pets. He worked as stonemason， carving marble for 38years and had also worked with wood and upholstery. He reported a 12-month history of dyspnea on exertion， worsened after SARS-CoV-2 infection (3 months earlier). Chest High Resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT) at the time of infection revealed diffuse Ground Grass Opacities(GGOs)， subpleural reticulation and traction bronchiectasis with upper lobe predominance， and also mediastinal lymph nodes with “eggshell” calcification. Four months after the infection chest HRCT was repeated， which showed abnormalities' stability ?\n\n【10】On first examination， he had good peripheral saturations and normal breath sounds at chest auscultation. There was no stigma of autoimmune diseases， but digital clubbing was present.\n\n【11】Blood workup showed no immunological changes. Pulmonary function test revealed moderate restrictive pattern (TLC 3.33 L； 56%， FVC 2.29 L； 58% e FEV1 2.01L；64%) and reduced diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide (3.78； 44%)； transthoracic echocardiogram was normal. Bronchoalveolar Lavage (BAL) showed no lymphocytosis， but lightly birefringent particles were seen under polarized light Given his exposure history， egg-shell calcification of mediastinal lymph nodes and lightly birefringent particles on BAL， differential diagnosis of COVID-19pneumonia sequela was set aside and silicosis was the main differential diagnosis. However， the HRCT pattern was not consistent with silicosis. In face of a reasonable doubt pending on the definitive diagnosis， it was decided in multidisciplinary discussion LOperform transbronchiaalllung cryobiopsy， which histology showed interstitial focal fibrosis with accumulations of dust-laden macrophages and a significant number of lightly birefringent particles seen under polarized light； no silicotic nodules were observed . These morphologic aspects were consistent with silica and other less fibrogenic dust exposure， such as iron and silicates (mixed dust fibrosis). In light with these findings and exposure history， MDP diagnosis was made.\n\n【12】Literature Revie w\n\n【13】MDP is associated with typical occupations such as metal miners， quarry， foundry， pottery and ceramics workers， as well as stonemasons. However，MDP has also been reported in hand grinding maize using large stones  and secondary biomass fuel burning . Some studies have also reported overexposure to respirable quartz in farming ， which can be responsible for MDP and other types of pneumoconiosis in farmers with no other exposure， reinforcing the importance of a thorough anamnesis and exposure history.\n\n【14】Symptoms are nonspecific， such as productive cough and dyspnea， which could be related to pneumoconiosis， smoking or associated emphysema. Pulmonary function tests can be normal or show an obstructive， restrictive or mixed pattern .\n\n【15】Chest radiographs may appear normal， have pure nodular opacities (which tend to have ill-defined contours)， show early reticulation and irregular opacities only or show a pattern with progressive massive fibrosis. Chest HRCT findings include reticular， reticulonodular or nodular opacities in cases with MDP or may be normal in some cases with macular pneumoconiosis (considered an early stage of MDP). It may also show hilar lymphadenopathy and calcification in the late stages .\n\n【16】Histologically， MDP is defined as interstitial accumulations of dust-laden macrophages and Mixed Dust Fibrosis lesions (MDF)， with or without silicotic nodules or massive fibrosis. If silicotic nodules are present，then MDFlesions should outnumber the former. In the absence of exposure history， mineralogic analyses showing a mixture of crystalline silica and silicates would support the diagnosis.\n\n【17】Although uncomplicated MDP is typically a benign disease， cases with fatal extensive diffuse interstitial fibrosis causing honeycombing may be encountered. It should be noted that some patients with typical MDF lesions have superimposed diffuse interstitial fibrosis indistinguishable from UIP . It is of utmost importance that causative respirable dust exposure be identified，as the most important step is to remove the patient from further exposure .\n\n【18】Conclusion\n\n【19】Clinical diagnosis of MDP requires the exclusion of other well defined pneumoconiosis as well as non-exposure-related interstitial pulmonary disorders such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis or sarcoidosis. However， the diagnosis of MDP may well present as a challenge， and misdiagnosis is frequent because details of causative previous exposures may not be available and the clinical findings may vary considerably. Presently， as we are faced with several COVID-19pneumonia patients’ revaluations， it should be kept in mind that environmental and occupational diseases cannot be overlooked.

The spectrum of symptoms and organ involvements - in the acute， subacute phase and in post-COVID-19 syndrome-are still evolving and not fully known. Infected patients may be asymptomatic or they may present mild to severe multi-organ complications . Among neurological manifestations of COVID-19 infection， an altered sense of smell or taste was early recognized as one of the most characteristic symptoms. Data from a multicenter European study reported olfactory and gustatory dysfunction among 85.6% and 88.0% of patients， respectively. Recently， there has been a growing evidence of otoneurological symptoms such as tinnitus， hearing loss and balance disorders . Several authors， however， remarked on the need of studies with follow-up assessments using standard objective tests .\n\n【8】Herein we reviewed the international literature of COVID-19-related vestibular disorders including only detailed cases with clinical confirmed diagnosis. Additionally， we reported two cases ofobjective vertigo with nausea and vomiting， experienced during COVID-19 infection and in post-COVID-19 period， referred to our hospital.\n\n【9】A structured search of the English literature published on PubMed， from December 01，2019 to January 22nd， 2022， was performed by searching the terms “vestibular neuritis” and“COVID-19”.Only inherent reports with SARS-CoV-2-positive patients， as confirmed by molecular nasopharyngeal swab and with detailed clinical and diagnostic data were considered. Survey-based studies and papers clearly not related to the object were excluded.\n\n【10】A description of two consecutive cases of COVID-19-induced vestibular impairment evaluated at the Audiology and Phoniatrics Unit of Treviso Hospital between January 01， 2021 and January22m，2022 is reported. The study was conducted in accordance with the principles of the Helsinki Declaration. Patients gave their written consent for clinical case publication. Data were examined in accordance with Italian privacy and sensitive data laws， and the in-house regulations of our Institution.\n\n【11】Results\n\n【12】Literature review\n\n【13】The review process is shown in Figure 1. After applying the above mentioned criteria， 15 papers were retrieved and 6 were included： 1retrospective study and 5 case reports 6-10J.\n\n【14】Four patients were excluded from the article by Malayala et al. due to repetition of previously published cases ， and to the presence of unconfirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We found5 case reports which overall described 6 patients who were given the diagnosis of VN related to COVID-19. Five patients were female and one patient was a young male (age ranging from 13 to 63). They all were given the diagnosis of mild or moderate COVID-19 according to the international guidelines . Table 1 summarizes characteristics of included patients.\n\n【15】All the patients experienced typical symptoms of VN： Rotatory vertigo and unsteadygait with associated nausea and vomit. Diagnosis was obtained through physical examination， instrumental tests and exclusion ofother possible disorders .\n\n【16】In three cases  the VN symptoms emerged at onset of COVID-19. In the other three patients the vestibular symptoms occurred after 13 days of COVID-19， after 32 days  and after2 months  from the beginning of infection. Notably two cases described by Vanaparthyet al.  and Aasfara et al. alsopresented unilateral facial palsy. All patients were treated with corticosteroids and/or vestibular rehabilitation. In the cases who performed a follow-up ， a resolution of symptoms was noticed after one month.\n\n【17】Case report 1\n\n【18】A 31-year-old woman referred to our department. According to her history， in August 2020 she complained of cough， fever， rhinitis， headache， fatigue， muscular pain， and loss of smell and taste. The patient underwent nasopharyngeal swab and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection， as confirmed with Real-Time PCR test.\n\n【19】After three days since symptoms onset， she had sudden objective24-h-lasting vertigo， with nausea and vomiting. She did not have any associated cochlear symptoms (e.g.， tinnitus， hearing loss or ear fullness) or central nervous system symptoms (e.g.， diplopia or loss of consciousness). Accordingtohergeneralpractitioner'sadvice，shetook symptom-relief medications and rested. During the following days her vertigo and dizziness progressively improved. One month later， she tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 infection (PCR test on repeated nasopharyngeal swab). During the following months she complained of recurrent episodes of dizziness， therefore she underwent clinical evaluations in our department. At physical examination no relevant clinical signs were present： No postural sway， external auditory canals and tympanic membranes were normal， spontaneous nystagmus was absent， and bed-side examination (Rose position， Dix-Hallpike and Pagnini-McClure maneuvers) were negative. Bithermal caloric test was performed at 50°C for warm air and 24C for cold air， 60sec of stimulation per year under direct visualization of tympanic membrane. It showed a left side hyporeflexia (40% left hypofunction with 15% right side directional preponderance). Dizziness handicap inventory resulted in 30/100 (mild handicap). All other instrumental tests were negative： ocular motility tests were normal， pure-tone audiometryand ABR revealed bilateral normal hearing，and Distorted Product Otoacoustic Emissions (DPOAE) were present.\n\n【20】The patient had not suffered from any pre-existent audiovestibular disorder before infection. According to the symptoms described during SARS-CoV-2 infection and reported findings， a diagnosis of COVID-19-related Vestibular Neuritis (VN) in compensatory phase at the moment of our evaluation was hypothesized， therefore vestibular rehabilitation exercises were prescribed. One month later， on a telephone follow-up interview， the patient stated that her dizziness episodes had resolved.\n\n【21】Case report 2\n\n【22】A 44-year-old man was evaluated at our unit complaining of sudden onset， 4 h before， of objective rotatory vertigo， nausea and vomiting. No headache， diplopia， paresthesia， loss of consciousness were reported.

Recent medical history was relevant for mild COVID-19disease one month before. The infection that was confirmed by a positive PCR nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 lasted 2 weeks and was characterized by anosmia and dysgeusia.\n\n【29】A right side VN of probable viral origin was then diagnosed. At discharge a counseling， including reassurance on benignity of symptoms， was performed， oral steroid therapy was prescribed (50 mg prednisolone daily for 5 days and subsequent tapering of the drug for 5 days) followed by vestibular rehabilitation exercises after therapy.\n\n【30】A follow-up appointment was set for one month after. At the second evaluation， the patient denied any rotatory vertigo. Romberg's and Unterberger's tests were normal， spontaneous and positional nystagmuses were absent. Bithermal caloric test was performed， as previously described， and the exams showed right side hyporeflexia (29% right hypofunction with 21% left side directional preponderance). Ocular motility was within normal limits， pure tone-audiometry， tympanometry DPOAE and ABR revealed normal hearing functions， dizziness handicap inventory resulted in 6/100 (no handicap).\n\n【31】Discussion\n\n【32】VN is an inflammatory inner ear disorder that involves the vestibular portion of the 84h cranial nerve . Current findings about etiology mainly support the role of viruses (first infection and viral reactivation) and dysregulated immunological responses. VN is usually a benign and self-limiting condition， but in some cases can lead to residual imbalance. Diagnosis is typically based on clinical history and symptoms， ear nose and throat evaluation including vestibular test， videonystagmography with caloric test， and audiometry . Application of the HINTS protocol (Head Impulse， Nystagmus， test of Skew) in the emergency room is essential to rule out a cerebellar stroke， with a sensitivity of 96.7% and a specificity of94.8%. The presence ofunidirectional nystagmus， a positive head impulse test in the opposite side than the fast phase of nystagmus and the absence of vertical eye misalignment and other neurologic symptoms can be highly diagnosed of acute peripheral vestibulopathy. In doubtful cases， a neurological evaluation - eventually including neuro-radiological images - is required in order to exclude any central causes of vertigo. In recent years， a growing interest was put in cervical and ocular Vestibular Evoked Myogenic Potentials(cVEMPS and oVEMPS) and in the video Head Impulse Test (vHIT) as useful tools for the diagnostic work-up of VN. In particular vHIT， by analyzing the distribution of semicircular canals involvement， allows identification of selective vestibular structures alterations . Definition of the site of vestibular damage and distinction between upper and/or lower branch of vestibular nerve involvement may correlate with the underlying cause of acute peripheral vestibular deficit， but does not change the initial treatment. The management of VN typically includes symptomatic relief medications， such as antiemetic drugs. Corticosteroids are prescribed with the aim of reducing vestibular inflammation. Vestibular rehabilitation has the role of enhancing the mechanism of central balance compensation that usually occurs within 2 to 8 months .\n\n【33】The incidence of vestibular disorders in COVID-19 patients is still unknown and varies across different studies. Data based upon an Italian multicenter study questionnaire administration  showed that 18.4% ofpatients reported equilibrium disorders after COVID-19diagnosis (dizziness in 94.1% and acute vertigo episodes in 5.9%). A recent investigation about possible residual vestibular impairment in48 recovered patients found dizziness in 8.3% of subjects， spinning vertigo in 2%， dynamic and static imbalance in 2% and 6.3%respectively . These symptoms were mostly transitory and there was no evidence of clinically relevant persistent vestibular damage. Preliminary meta-analysis showed a pooled prevalence of 7.2% for rotatory vertigo， but the authors reported a possible overestimation because it was not always clear whether the included studies report a new onset vertigo or change in preexisting symptom .\n\n【34】The retrospective study by Charpiot et al.  is a quantification of the numberofhospitaladmissions forAcute PeripheralVestibulopathy(APV) in 5 French Hospitals over the period February-May 2020 . A comparison with 2018 and 2019 showed no significant increase in admission for APV， no significant difference among hospitals located in COVID-19high-and low-risk zones and no significant increase in the severity ofthe APV cases . In accordance， a retrospective review of acute cochleo-vestibular disorders after and before pandemic conducted at our department found no significant changes regarding incidence of APV.\n\n【35】Our review retrieved only 5 case reports， in which overall6different ppatients with COVID-19 related acute vestibular impairment were included. Moreover we reported clinical and instrumental findings of two cases of vestibular impairment possibly associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Other main differential diagnoses of acute peripheral vestibulopathy have to be considered. A first episode of Meniere’s disease  or vestibular migraine attack18could have occurred . Nevertheless， the literature review we have presented may support our clinical hypothesis. According to our review， in three cases VN was present at the onset of COVID-19. The mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 can cause VN is unclear and speculative. Given its neurotrophic potential， a direct effect on the cochleo-vestibular nerve can be postulated， similarly to its pathogenesis in hypo/anosmia and optic neuritis. In this respect， the cellular receptor Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2(ACE2)， that mediates the intracellular entry of SARS-CoV-2， has been found in nasal tissues in murine and human model and in Eustachian tube， middle ear and cochlear tissues in murine model . A relationship with vasculitis or vasculopathy has also been suggested . Another possibility is that the physical and emotional stress that people with SARS-CoV-2 infection experienced could have played a role in the expression ofvestibular symptoms-as occurred for headache patients-or could have triggered the reactivation ofpossiblelatent viruses(e.g.， HSV-1) . This latter mechanism could be hypothesized especially in patients in which VN was not present at COVID-19symptoms onset but later during the course of the disease . Our second case， as well as the cases of Vanaparthy et al. ， due to the temporal delay between PCR negativity and onset of vertigo， suggests the possibility of VN occurrence in the subacute phase of infection. To date， the post-COVID-19 syndrome is characterized by neurological symptoms such as headache， anxiety/depression， sleep and cognitive disturbances . Finally， a SARS-CoV-2 neuro-invasive disease，leading to a COVID-19-related meningoencephalitis， may be implicated， as described for audiovestibular impairment in other neurotrophic viruses . The latter situation does not certainly regard our patients， as oculomotor testing was accurate and ruled out any functional change in the central vestibular pathways.\n\n【36】The data we found in literature could be underestimated because many patients may not have undergone medical evaluation . Therefore， many diagnoses of possible COVID-19-related VNs may have been missed and only disclosed in later assessments， as occurred in our first described case. In general， a decrease in the number of vertigo/dizziness outpatients during the pandemic outbreak has been observed， due to visit cancellations and government restrictive measures . Therefore， to give support to patients in diagnosis and therapy，the role oftelemedicine was enhanced and a specific guideline of virtual management of vestibular disorders was recently published . Preliminary data have shown the role and utility， during the pandemic， of telemedicine in the management of dizziness patients， but further studies are necessary to better define possibilities and limits of these methods.\n\n【37】Conclusion\n\n【38】According to the present review，only a few cases ofinstrumentally diagnosed COVID-19-related VN have been reported so far. Since hearing and balance disorders are rarely reported among patients with COVID-19， it would be appropriate to routinely test for SARS-CoV-2 infection patients with diagnosed VN. Moreover，prospective studies on a large series of COVID-19 patients should try to better define the epidemiology of cochlear-vestibular involvement and elucidate the SARS-CoV-2-related prognosis on peripheral and central audiovestibular functions. Among patients that can’t be easily visited due to quarantine regimen， a telemedicine evaluation could be helpful， as performed in accordance with standards of recent guidelines. In cases with cochlear-vestibular involvement， a long-term follow-up of more than 6 months should be preferred.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 10:35:25", "endTime": "2024/09/24 10:38:19", "cost": 173.727}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:30", "update_time": "2024-09-23 18:38:19", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 18:35:24"}

This clinical case comes to corroborate the most recent evidence.\n\n【6】Keywords： Arachnoid cysts； Subdural hygroma； Middle temporal fossa； Cerebrospinal fluid； Neuroimaging studies； Conservative/surgical treatment\n\n【7】Introduction\n\n【8】Primary Arachnoid Cysts (AC) are benign congenitalwell-circumscribed extra-axial malformations， filled with Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) and delimited by arachnoid membrane， which usually do not communicate with the ventricular system . Despite being the most common intracranial cysts， they are relatively rare，representing 1% ofintracranial space-occupying lesions， with a prevalence of 1% to 3% in pediatric age . There seems to be a male-to-female preponderance of 2-5：1 and the left hemisphere is more often affected， both with no acceptable scientific explanation so far .\n\n【9】AC are nearly always single and sporadic， mostly detected in the first two decades oflife . Most of these simple cystic lesions of unknown etiology represent incidental findings on neuroimaging studies . Although these lesions can occur throughout the neuroaxis， more than half are found in the Middle Temporal Fossa (MTF)/Sylvian fissure . Other possible locations include the posterior fossa， suprasellar region and intra ventricularly .\n\n【10】Interestingly， many AC are detected during perinatal surveillance and long-term follow-up has revealed that some are quiescent throughout life； some may remain asymptomatic for many years before demonstrating signs and others may even disappear . With the greater worldwide availability of neuroimaging， more intracranial AC are being found in all age groups， but mostly in children (75%).\n\n【11】The vast majority of AC are asymptomatic (93.2%)， but occasionally AC may produce symptoms (6.8%) due to expansion or rupture， originating Subdural Hygroma (SH) or bleeding. Manifestations also depend on AC’s size and location， being headache the most common presenting symptom . Other possible symptoms are due to increased intracranial pressure， hydrocephalus or local mass effect . Hemorrhage is rare in the pediatric population (0.3% to 6%)， being trauma and larger cyst size the main underlying risk factors .\n\n【12】The overwhelming majority of lesions do not change in size relatively to the initial diagnosis and only rarely expand in the pediatric population， being expansion primarily found under four years of age .\n\n【13】Case Presentation\n\n【14】A two-year-old boy， with no personal/family history of note， brought to the emergency room due to headache that arose after falling from his own height the day before. The headache was intermittent， limited to the frontal region， with phonophobia and photophobia and was triggered by exertion (running) and defecation. A single postprandial vomiting was recorded. There were no visual complaints.\n\n【15】On physical examination there were no traumatic injuries， the patient was conscious， with normal vital signs and there were no focal deficits in the neurological examination.\n\n【16】Due to the headache's persistence， he underwent on Computed Tomography (CT) head scan， which revealed a left frontotemporal cystic lesion with 27 mm x54 mm， with slight right deviation from the midline structures. Brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) confirmed a left temporal AC 82 mm x52 mm x 77 mm filling the temporal fossa and compressing insula and adjacent structures， with subfalcine herniation of 5 mm. It was also visualized a bilateral frontal SH of greater thickness on the left (4 mm) of probable posttraumatic etiology， extending to the inter hemispheric cleft.\n\n【17】Duringthe in-hospital surveillancehe remained hemodynamically stable with progressive headache's improvement. He was discharged with a recommendation for avoidance of high-impact physical activity. He is still regularly followed in Neurosurgery Consultation for clinical and imagiological evaluation.\n\n【18】Duringfollow-up， thepatient's familyIreported some paroxysmal episodes of eye blinking usually lasting only a couple of seconds. A consultation of Neuropediatrics was requested which confirmed a neurological examination without alterations. A video-electroencephalogram was also performed and showed no abnormalities. There were no other complications and these paroxysms disappeared with time， as well as the headache.\n\n【19】Subsequent brain-MRI revealed a progressive decrease in AC dimensions. On Figure 1， we can see the 7 months' neuroimage follow-up with almost total resorption of the left hemispheric collection.\n\n【20】Currently， he is 4 years old and is asymptomatic， without any restriction of physical activity， and there are no concerns about his neurodevelopment.\n\n【21】Discussion\n\n【22】Most AC are usually asymptomatic， constituting an incidental finding in neuroimaging studies， although rare symptomatic cases are described， usually after minor traumatic brain injury .\n\n【23】This clinical case deals with a large AC that became symptomatic after a minor head injury that probably lead to AC rupture with subsequent SH formation. SH causes an elevation in the intracranial pressure， which may lead to the appearance of symptoms such as headache， nausea， vomiting and rarely diplopia， secondary to VI cranial nerve palsy . Symptoms usually become severe for days or weeks after onset， but they eventually resolve . Physical findings are usually limited to papilledema， which was absent in this clinical case. Furthermore， history of minor trauma without loss of consciousness， verified in this clinical case， is described as a relatively common finding in the literature .\n\n【24】The treatment approach of an AC with SH remains controversial and neurosurgical treatment was traditionally recommended， but newer reports have been questioning this strategy . There is no Class I evidence regarding the role and type of surgery for the treatment of these lesions . Conservative management has been proposed for patients who do not demonstrate signs of increased intracranial pressure or focal neurological signs， because of the surgery's morbidity .\n\n【25】Some authors suggest that AC should be treated if there is evidence of local mass effect on neuroimaging . However this can be potentially problematic in the context of SH， since any moderately sized SH and even many of the asymptomatic AC can produce the appearance oflocal mass effect on adjacent tissues .\n\n【26】Recent articles have been highlighting the natural course of cyst-associated SH， even when symptomatic， that is usually benign and symptom resolution can be expected in most cases. Therefore， symptomatic SH is not considered an absolute indication for surgical treatment anymore and expectant management can result in good outcomes in many cases， even in the presence of intracranial hypertension symptoms .\n\n【27】We must， therefore， weigh the risks and benefits of conservative versuis surgical treatment in symptomatic patients on an empirical individual patient basis . There are still other important variables to consider in this equation： AC location， impact on CSF flow dynamics， symptomatic progression， risk of disfigurement due to bone remodeling (for large cysts)， as well as presence of focal neurological deficits or focal seizures .\n\n【28】Finally， this clinical case corroborates the most recent evidence， by illustrating the success of the conservative approach.\n\n【29】Conclusion\n\n【30】Most arachnoid cysts are usually asymptomatic， constituting an incidental finding in neuroimaging studies. Symptomatic cases are described after minor traumatic brain injury， possibly leading to rupture， with subsequent subdural hygroma formation.\n\n【31】The approach of an arachnoid cyst with subdural hygroma remains controversial and neurosurgical treatment was traditionally recommended，but newer reports have been questioning this strategy.\n\n【32】Conservative treatment seems to be promising， even if AC's large dimensions and presence of intracranial hypertension symptoms. This clinical case illustrates the success of the conservative approach， corroborating the most recent evidence.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 10:42:46", "endTime": "2024/09/24 10:43:04", "cost": 18.311}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:30", "update_time": "2024-09-23 18:43:04", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 18:42:46"}

The incidence of stent loss ranges widely from0.32% to 8.3%， while the success rate of retrieval varies between 45% and 100%. Advances in stent technology， with enhanced flexibility and deliverability， combined with increased experience in stent utilization， have contributed to a decreased occurrence of stent loss .\n\n【8】Various types of equipment， including stents， guidewires， and catheters， can be inadvertently misplaced or trapped within or outside the coronary artery. Device entrapment poses a more severe complication than device loss. Retrieval of a dislodged stent can be achieved surgically or percutaneously， utilizing different devices and techniques such as a small balloon catheter， a snare loop， the two-wire technique， grasping forceps， or basket retrieval devices .\n\n【9】In the present case， we describe a complex scenario involving a patient with significant left main disease who underwent Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) with stent placement. Unfortunately， during the procedure， the stent became entrapped within the Left Main artery (LM)， resulting in longitudinal deformation (elongation) and protrusion into the aorta all the way to brachiocephalic trunk during the stent extraction process. To optimize the chances of a successful and safe stent extraction while minimizing potential complications， a comprehensive assessment was conducted using multiple imaging techniques.\n\n【10】Case Presentation\n\n【11】A 72-year-old patient with a history of myocardial infarction and a previous primary Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) on the Circumflex artery (Cx) in 2013 was admitted due to lower limb ischemia and significant carotid disease. The patient presented with rest leg pain and had a medical history of diabetes， managed with insulin， hypertension， dyslipidemia， and normal kidney function(estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate， eGFR). Considering the planned major vascular surgery and risk factors， the patient was referred for preoperative coronary angiography which revealed three-vessel disease with LM stenosis .\n\n【12】Due to the severe calcification of the aorta ， surgical intervention was deemed unsuitable， leading to the recommendation of a staged procedure. The initial approach involved PCI of the LM， followed by vascular surgery， and concluding with PCI of the Right Coronary Artery (RCA).\n\n【13】The procedure was performed using right radial access and a 6F extra backup Guiding Catheter (GC). The chosen strategy employed provisional stenting towards the Left Anterior Descending artery(LAD). After a predilation with a Non-Compliant (NC) 2.5 mm×15 mm balloon， a second-generation drug-eluting stent 3.5 mmx18 mm was implanted from the LM towards the LAD . To optimize the proximal area， a NC 4.0 mm x 6 mm balloon was employed， followed by a \"kissing\" inflation technique involving a NC3.5 mm x 15 mm balloon in the LAD and a NC 2.5 mm x 15 mm balloon in the Circumflex artery (Cx).\n\n【14】After obtaining an unsatisfactory result in Cx ， we attempted to implant a DES 3.0 mm × 18 mm， but encountered difficulties in crossing it to Cx. Unfortunately， the stent became dislodged from the balloon and got trapped in the LM while the distal third of the stent was in the guiding catheter. To address this issue， we confined the dislodged stent by using a 2.5 mm ×15 mm balloon at the tip of GC， and then removed the entire system along with the wires . During the removal of the system， the stent fracture occurred， so we were able to extract only a small part of the stent that was inside the catheter trapped by the balloon， while with full body fluoroscopy we were unable to find the larger part of the stent. The patient remained stable without any signs or symptoms of embolization， which led us to make the decision to proceed with the PCI procedure. We performed rewiring and modified our approach to a \"culotte\" stenting technique. Following pre-dilatation with an NC2.5 mm × 15 mm balloon， we successfully implanted a DES 3.0 mm x16 mm from the LM to Cx . Although we encountered difficulties in advancing the wire towards LAD， we managed to overcome the issue by using a hydrophilic wire. Subsequently， we performed angioplasty using an NC 3.0 mm×15 mm balloon， followed by post-dilatation using an NC 4.0 mm x 8 mm balloon.\n\n【15】Two days after the initial procedure on routine echocardiography， a hyperechogenic formation was observed in the aorta. A CT scan revealed a linear formation (possibly metal or calcium) extending from the Left Main (LM) in the ascending aorta towards the brachiocephalic trunk， without any signs of dissection . It was concluded that this could be the larger fragment of an un-implanted stent， and a decision was made to extract it percutaneously.\n\n【16】Dual access was obtained from the left radial and right brachial artery to place a 6F GC in the LM and wire the LAD and Cx arteries to prevent abrupt vessel closure. Optical Coherence Tomography(OCT) revealed a dissection at the proximal LAD without a previously implanted stent and only one stent layer in the LM， confirming that the initially implanted stent from the LM to the LAD was pulled out by the entrapped stent .\n\n【17】Using snare device distorted stent was caught in ascending aorta and brought to the right brachial artery ， this maneuver completely extracted all previously implanted stents from left coronary artery. The stent from LCx ended in right carotid artery and were further extracted using snare from left radial artery after repeated PCI . The “inverted T”stenting was employed with 3.5mmx12 mm stent implanted in Cx， followed by3.5 mm×28mm stent from LM to LAD. POT was done using 4.5 mm x8 mm NC balloon and after rewiring and angioplasty of Cx ostium with NC 3.0mm x 12 mm，“kissing\"inflation was done with 3.5 mm ×12 mm NC balloons in both arteries. The final result was good，  and patient was discharged three days after the procedure.\n\n【18】Discussion\n\n【19】The dislodgement of a stent can occur due to various factors， such as extreme coronary angulation， highly calcified coronary arteries， inadequate coronary artery predilation， and direct stenting. Despite the limited number of reports in the literature on the simultaneous removal of a dislodged stent and a previously implanted stent using a snare device， the extraction procedures predominantly targeted stents that were either recently deployed or in the process of being deployed. Conventional balloon expansion tightly secures coronary stents to the vessel wall， making unintentional removal very uncommon . Dislodgement from the delivery system typically happens when the stent-balloon assembly is pulled back into the Guiding Catheter (GC) or when it cannot reach the target lesion due to complex anatomy . Percutaneous stent retrieval can be successfully achieved using various techniques， including the small-balloon technique， double-wire technique， or loop snare . The snare technique has demonstrated its effectiveness for this purpose， although its successful implementation relies on technical proficiency and is influenced by factors such as the size， flexibility， rigidity， and compressibility of the stent . In our particular scenario， we encountered a situation where the stent became entrapped while attempting to navigate through the layer of the previously inserted stent. Now， the pivotal question arises： What measures could we have taken to prevent such an occurrence? We should have initially used imaging techniques to assess the amount of calcium and the true diameters of the Left Main (LM) and its branches. Although we obtained optimal angiographic results by using a 2.5 mm balloon at12 atm (2.7 mm)and implanting a stent measuring 3.5 mm x18 mm from LM to the LAD artery， we should have also utilized Intravascular Ultrasound (IVUS) to evaluate stent expansion in the LM， specifically checking for under-deployment or possible strut intraluminal protrusion. When dealing with vessels adjacent to previously stented arteries， operators must exercise utmost caution. In the event of stent advancement difficulties， this issue should raise a red flag， indicating the need to address the problem promptly. Under such circumstances， it is advisable to consider under-expanding the previously implanted stent and， if possible， performing additional balloon dilation. Furthermore， maintaining proper coaxial alignment of the guiding catheter plays a vital role in successfully retrieving a stent that cannot be crossed . Stent extraction carries risks of the stent struts catching onto the endothelial layer， leading to tearing or disruption. Endothelial tearing can result in various adverse outcomes，including acute thrombosis， vessel dissection， or even perforation. Ragosta et al. meticulously documented complications in a comprehensive analysis of seventeen cases involving stent extraction. Among these cases， a total of seven reported complications， with three instances resulting in acute vessel closure and an additional four cases resulting in vessel dissection . To minimize the risk of endothelial tearing during stent extraction， several precautions should be taken. Firstly， a thorough evaluation of the stent's positioning and adherence to the vessel wall should be performed prior to the extraction attempt. This evaluation helps determine the optimal technique and tools required for safe removal. The application of OCT in the extraction of a previously implanted stent provides physicians with detailed information about the stent， the condition of the surrounding tissue， and any potential complications. This allows for precise planning and execution of the extraction procedure， reducing the risk of complications and improving outcomes for the patient. In our case， OCT demonstrated dissection in the LAD prior to stent extraction， but there was no sign of thrombosis or impaired flow. To prevent or quickly resolve unwanted abrupt vessel closure that can occur after endothelial injury， it is important not to lose the position of the distal wire.\n\n【20】Conclusion\n\n【21】The extraction of previously implanted stents represents a rare complication in Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI). To mitigate the risk of such events， a crucial preoperative strategy entails meticulous lesion preparation. In our specific case， we showcased the successful implementation of intricate bailout procedures， such as snare extraction of intravascular objects. Nevertheless， it is of paramount importance to exercise extreme caution when executing these procedures in proximity to， or within， previously implanted stents.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 10:44:06", "endTime": "2024/09/24 10:44:22", "cost": 16.684}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:30", "update_time": "2024-09-23 18:44:22", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 18:44:05"}

An improved level of awareness as well as understanding of refeeding syndrome， with effectively managed strategy is important for nutritional rehabilitation of the individual. In this scenario， a gradual and deliberate surge in nutritional intake with proper nutritional counseling， and psychotherapy are recommended by the experts. Our case study took a young 22 year-old girl suffering from anorexia with a BMI of 11.9. She had been misdiagnosed by the medical practitioner and got a severe electrolyte imbalance in blood levels. This occurred only because of the lack of cognizance regarding refeeding syndrome. After the cautious clinical and nutritional assessment， empirical and scientific evaluation， different protocols can be suggested to prevent and manage this syndrome. Equally important is to instill awareness in the patient about refeeding slowly and building-up micronutrient gradually for several days in nutritional therapy.\n\n【2】Keywords： Refeedingsyndrome； Malnourishment； Anorexia nervosa； Nutritional rehabilitation\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Refeeding Syndrome (RS) is possibly a serious condition， that is defined by severe fluid and electrolyte imbalances cause by damaging nutritional rehabilitation in patients who are conditioned to malnourishment . The patients who are enduring protein energy malnutrition and severe weight loss are at a potential risk of developing RS in them. Those having condition such as anorexia nervosa and obesity are at high end risk . Even though there are studies but the actual incidence of refeeding syndrome is still unknown to us. However a study on the topic of RS has demonstrated a prevalence rate of 0.45% in all of the hospitalized patients， whereas malnutrition is one of the major risk factor . The principal features of refeeding syndrome comprise severe hypophosphatemia， hypo-magnesia， and hypokalemia with other fluid imbalances and electrolyte abnormalities that could develop life-threatening irregularities in the central nervous system， cardiovascular system， including different pulmonary and hematologic complications . Refeeding malnourished patients can emerge from\"oral， enteral and parenteral nutrition”which in several cases could belife threatening for the patient if it goes undiagnosed and ill-treated.\n\n【5】The incident of a 22-year old girl who had previously been suffering from the condition of anorexia nervosa is well known. She developed refeeding syndrome due an aggressive nutrition intake and was managed in a hospital with “Total Parenteral Nutrition\"(TPN).\n\n【6】Case Presentation\n\n【7】The 22-year-old girl living in Lahore hadbeen admitted in the emergency care unit on September，2021. She had a 2 days history of severe abdominal cramps， nausea and continuous vomiting. She endured the condition of secondary amenorrhea， and chronic constipation for two and half years before admission to the hospital. Notwithstanding， she had a psychiatric history of having anorexia nervosa， which is the fear of growing overweight and was on strict dieting schedule. The patient was asked to consume a large serving of meat just a day before her admission to hospital. She instantly developed afore-mentioned symptoms after eating the meal. Over the course fourteen weeks she lost eighteen kg of her weight. Upon examination，her weight was only twenty seven kilo grams and was 152 cm tall. As her Body Mass Index (BMI) stood at 11.9 which is extremely low. In addition to this her physical appearance was pale and weak. Her resting pulse rate was rapid (110 beats/minute)， with a low blood pressure measuring just 90/40 mm/Hg. Upon her Chest and CVS examination nothing abnormal was found. However， the abdominal examination of the patient showed recessed abdomen with a moderate tenderness in her right iliac fossa and the visceral organs were not palpable. The laboratory tests ofthe girl revealed low albumin， hypophosphatemia， hypochloremic metabolic acidosis， hypokalemia. Her liver function tests showed a disturbed liver function . She had turn to several gynecologists during the last 2 years to consult secondary amenorrhea. She was recommended some medicines to regulate her monthly cycles， but her prolactin levels elevated later on. She was pre-occupied with the feelings of being overweight， despite the fact that her weight was only 42 kg with BMI of 18.6. The fear lead her to stop taking her medicines and she started dieting and vigor exercise. Afterwards she was taken for a psychiatrist consultation and there she was diagnosed with the condition ofanorexia nervosa and was advised to take anti-depressants. In her case， no family psychiatric history was found and there was no major childhood illness. She was again presented to hospital 3 days later with stark phosphatemia， abdominal distension， feet swelling. There she was diagnosed with refeeding syndrome as her reports were claiming severe electrolyte imbalances. Then she was recommended for nutritional consultation was given TPN 1 (for precise intake). Later on her schedule was changed to TPN2 as she was unable tolerate the oral intake. She had been prescribed a1，500 kcal/day diet plan and antiemetics before meals to stop nausea and vomit. She was also tied up into psychotherapy and motivational therapy. There was steady improvement in her condition and she was gradually substituted to a total oral consumption. In her 5th week of therapy， she added 6 kg in her total weight. She was discharged from hospital with a prescription of esomeprazole， some antidepressants and other vitamin supplements.\n\n| Biochemical values  | Admission values  | Reference values  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Hb(g/d)  | 12.4  | 13.3  |\n| Platelets(x10/  | 145  | 150-400  |\n| Albumin (g/dl)  | 2.1  | 3.8  |\n| Phosphate (mmol/l)  | 1.5  | 2.8  |\n| Potassium (mmol/l)  | 2.4  | 3.6-5  |\n| Magnesium (mmol/l)  | 1.6  | 1.5  |\n| Calcium (mmol/l)  | 6.6  | 8-11  |\n| Chloride (mmol/l)  | 72  | 104-114  |\n| Sodium (mmol/l)  | 122  | 136-138  |\n| BUN (mg/dl)  | 11  | 6-16  |\n| Creatinine (mg/dl)  | 0.7  | 0.35  |\n| Bicarbonate (mEq/l)  | 34.6  | 17.5  |\n| Total bilirubin (mg/dl)  | 5.5  | 0.25-1  |\n| SGPT(IU/L)  | 146  | 03-33  |\n| SGOT(IU/L)  | 172  | 18-32  |\n\n【9】Discussion\n\n【10】A forceful nutrient intake of carbs can evoke a release of insulin and increase levels of glucose，phosphate， magnesium etc in the blood. The severe electrolyte imbalances can end in severe complications including sudden death of the patients. Here， the natriuretic effect of insulin can cause sodium retention and edema. Severe phosphatemia is the most prevailing feature of refeeding syndrome and can cause“dyspnea， respiratory failure， hypotension， shock， arrhythmias and cardiac failure\". The increase in the utilization of thiamine in such conditions can be resulted into thiamine deficiency in some of the patients， as indicated by the study of Wernicke’s encephalopathy. Other clinical symptoms are described in Table 2.\n\n【11】Table 2： Clinical signs and symptoms of refeeding syndrome .\n\n| Hypophosphatemia  | Hypokalemia  | Hypomagnesia  | Thiamine deficiency  | Na retention  | Hyperglycemia  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Dyspnea  | Arrhythmias  | Arrhythmias  | Encephalopathy  | Edema  | Hypotension  |\n| Hypotension，  | Muscle necrosis  | Tremors  | Lactic acidosis  | Fluid overload  | Respiratory failure  |\n| Respiratory failure  | Severe Constipation  | Seizures  |  |  | Metabolic ketoacidosis  |\n| Shock  | Rhabdomyolysis  | Coma  |  |  | Dehydration  |\n| Arrhythmias  |  | Diarrhea  |  |  |  |\n| Cardiac failure  |  |  |  |  |  |\n\n【13】Table 3： Guidelines for replacement therapy .\n\n| Phosphate  | Intravenous replacement dose (administer over 6-12 hours)  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Phosphate  | Children： 0.07-0.23 mmol/kg  |\n| Phosphate  | Maximum daily dose： 1.5 mmol/kg  |\n| Phosphate  | Adults： Initially 0.08-0.09 mmol/kg for mild and 0.17 mmol/kg for severe hypophosphatemia  |\n| Phosphate  | Maximum dose： 0.23-0.24 mmol/kg per dose  |\n| Magnesium  | Intravenous replacement dose (administer over 4-5 hours)  |\n| Magnesium  | Children： 25-50mg/kg per dose(0.2-0.5mEq/kg per dose)  |\n| Magnesium  | Maximum single dose： 2000 mg (16mEq)  |\n| Magnesium  | Adults： 1 g every 6 hours for 4 doses for moderate and 8-12 g/d in divided doses for severe  |\n| Potassium  | Intravenous replacement dose (administer over 1 hr)  |\n| Potassium  | Children：0.3 -0.5 mEq/kg per dose  |\n| Potassium  | Max Dose： 30 mEq per dose  |\n| Potassium  | Adults： same  |\n| Thiamine  | Children： 10-25 mg/d administered PO everyday for 2 weeks and then 5-10 mg/d for 1 month.  |\n| Thiamine  | Adults： 5-31 mg per dose 3 times per day， administered IV and then 5-31 mg/d administered PO for one month  |\n\n【15】A procedure for avoidance and controlling of refeeding syndrome specified the circumstances in which it is probably develop， and stressed the significance of refeeding gradually and compounding the micro nutritional content over few days with constant monitoring. It highlighted that the administration should never be performed in haste and the targeted weight accumulation should never surpass 1kg to 1.5 kg per week. In the adults， studies suggested the starting the intake of 1000 to 1200 kcal per day . The protein intake must not be circumscribed during the nutritional provision . The strategies for electrolyte and thiamine stabilization are given in the Table 3.\n\n【16】In conclusion， the nutritional rehabilitation is always a crucial element of the physical treatment of the disorders such as anorexia nervosa' and other conditions that may cause malnourishment. However， good psychological treatment is also ofparamouiIT importance in order to address the anxiety issues concerning the patient.

This case report highlights the rarity of sporotrichosis affecting the skin and lung simultaneously in an individual with a competent immune response.\n\n【2】Keywords： Disseminated sporotrichosis； Sporothrix schenckii； Immunocompetent\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Systemic sporotrichosis with cutaneous and pulmonary involvement in immunocompetent individual is uncommon. Previous literatures reported that sporotrichosis usually seen as isolated cutaneous form or at a non-pulmonary site such as osteoarticular， neurological or ocular . Systemic presentation typically occurs in individuals with impaired immunity such as in diabetes mellitus， immunosuppressant use， HIV infection， malignancy and connective tissue disease . Sporotrichosis is caused by the fungal Sporothrix， in which the pathogenic taxons in human are S. brasiliensis， S. schenckii， S. globose and S. luriei . It is usually found in contaminated plants or in the mouth， nasal cavity， nails and feces of infected cats . Systemic sporotrichosis is believed to be transmitted either via inhalation of Sporothrix propagules or via hematogenous spread . Cutaneous lesion presents as ulcerated papules or nodules while pulmonary sporotrichosis presents with cough， hemoptysis， anorexia and fever. Clinically， cutaneous sporotrichosis can mimic other diseases such as tuberculosis and non-tuberculous Mycobacterium， nocardiasis， chromomycosis， leishmaniasis， pyoderma gangrenosum and cutaneous tumors . Skin biopsy is warranted in order to rule out these differentials. Typical histopathological findings are diffuse chronic granulomatous dermatitis with a central abscess . Pulmonary involvement can display two different patterns on radiology which are diffuse or bibasal reticulonodular infiltrate pattern， or cavities in the upper lobe . Recommended treatment is amphotericin B， given until a favorable response has been achieved. Thereafter， therapy is changed to oral itraconazole 200 mg BD for at least 1 year .\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 50-year-old man with underlying non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and ischemic heart disease presented with fever and multiple painful nodules on trunk and upper limbs for 1-month duration. He denied loss of appetite， loss of weight， prolonged cough or history of contact with ill animals or tuberculosis patients. Occasionally， he did some gardening and cleaned feces from stray cats in housing compound. On examination， there were hyperpigmented fluctuant subcutaneous nodules with hemorrhagic crusts on the face， trunk， upper and lower extremities . Otherwise， examination of other organ systems and lymph nodes were unremarkable.\n\n【7】Blood investigations revealed raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate at 111 mm/h and C reactive protein at 5.79 mg/ml. Full blood count， renal profile， liver function test and hemoglobin A1C were within normal range. Autoimmune disease and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) screening were also negative. He was initially treated with intravenous piperacillin-tazobactam for multiple skin abscesses. However， he remained febrile with formation of more skin nodules. Thus， a skin biopsy was performed to rule out differential diagnoses of infectious panniculitis such as subcutaneous fungal infection， tuberculous and non-tuberculous mycobacterium infection. Histopathology revealed acute suppurative granulomatous inflammation with panniculitis. Periodic Acid-Schiff (PAS) and Grocott's Methenamine Silver (GMS) stains exhibited budding yeasts of approximately 8 um in size， suggestive of sporotrichosis . Fungal culture of the skin identified Sporothrix schenckii . Culture of bacteria and mycobacterium， as well as Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) of mycobacterium was negative.\n\n【8】Chest X-ray demonstrated multiple centrilobularlung nodules at right upper lung zone . CT scan of thoracic， abdomen and pelvis showed consolidations over peribronchovascular right upper lobe， irregularity of the apical branch of right upper lobe bronchus and right hilar lymphadenopathy . Otherwise， there was no intra-abdominal collection. Bronchoscopy revealed swollen， irregular and inflamed mucosa over segmental bronchus of right upper lobe. Fungal culture from bronchoalveolar lavage also grew Sporothrix schenckii. Hence， diagnosis of systemic sporotrichosis with cutaneous and pulmonary involvement was made.\n\n【9】He was started on intravenous amphotericin B deoxycholate0.7 mg/kg/day. Unfortunately， he developed acute renal failure and transaminitis， which resolved upon cessation of amphotericin B. Thereafter， he was prescribed with oral itraconazole 200 mg twice daily. He responded well to the treatment with regression of cutaneous nodules after a month of treatment and was planned for one year course of oral itrconazole. Unfortunately， he was lost to follow-up.\n\n【10】Discussion\n\n【11】Sporotrichosis can be classified clinically into five forms， namely skin， mucous membrane， and systemic， immunoreactive and spontaneous regression. Systemic sporotrichosis is further classified intopulmonary， cutaneousdisseminated， osteoarticular， and neurological . Systemic sporotrichosis in an immunocompetent individual is rare. It has been reported in literatures， however these cases involved cutaneous disseminated alone， or involved non-pulmonary sites such as osteoarticular， neurological and ocular . To our knowledge， this is the first case reported of systemic sporotrichosis with cutaneous and pulmonary involvement in immunocompetent individual. Such systemic presentation more commonly occurs in the setting of immunosuppressive state such as uncontrolled diabetes mellitus， immunosuppressant use， HIV infection， malignancy and connective tissue disease .\n\n【12】Sporotrichosis is caused by thermodimorphic fungi of the genus Sporothrix. Sporothrix comprises of 51 taxons， in which only four taxons are known to be pathogenic in human， namely S. brasiliensis， S. schenckii， S. globose and S. luriei. S. schenckii， which is the organism identified in our patient， is the most common causative agent for sporotrichosis in Malaysia . It is usually found in contaminated plants or in the mouth， nasal cavity， nails and feces of infected cats. Cutaneous sporotrichosis is usually caused by direct inoculation of organism into the skin by trauma. Unfortunately， only 10% to62% of patients were able to recall this information . Systemic sporotrichosis is believed to be transmitted either via inhalation of Sporothrix propagules or via hematogenous spread and the latter mode of spread typically occurs in immunosuppressed patients . We postulated that our patient may have contracted the infection through a missed trauma during gardening or via inhalation of the fungal propagules during contact with cats’feces.\n\n【13】Cutaneous lesions typically present as papules or nodules which may ulcerate or fistulize draining a purulent discharge. 80%of cutaneous cases present as lymphocutaneous form， in which the lesions were distributed along the lymphatic drainage . However， in disseminated cutaneous sporotrichosis， the lesions may be generalized with no specific distribution as seen in our patient. Pulmonary sporotrichosis typically presents with cough， hemoptysis， anorexia and fever . Nevertheless， 14.1% may not have any respiratory symptoms as demonstrated in our case .\n\n【14】Cutaneous manifestation of sporotrichosis can mimic other infectious diseases namely tuberculosis and non-tuberculous mycobacterium， nocardiasis， chromomycosis and leishmaniasis. It may also imitate non-infectious diseases such as pyoderma gangrenosum， primary cutaneous tumors and even cutaneous metastases . Skin biopsy is warranted to rule out these differential diagnoses. Typical histopathological findings are diffuse chronic granulomatous inflammation with a central abscess. The fungal structures， which are highlighted by PAS and GMS， is seen in 18%to 35.3% of cases . Pulmonary involvement can display two different patterns on radiology， depending on the transmission route. Hematogenous route leads to predominantly diffuse or bibasal reticulonodular infiltrate pattern. On the contrary， inhalation route frequently results in upper lobe involvement. Chronic inflammatory response is then ensued，leading to breakdown of necrotic lung tissue and upper lobe cavity formation. These groups of patients may be asymptomatic initially until large cavities are formed . These findings further supported the hypothesis that our patient might have contracted the fungal agent through inhalation based on the upper lobe radiological findings and relatively free of pulmonary symptoms. Culture and isolation of S. schenckii from biopsy samples remains the gold standard to diagnose sporotrichosis . Depending on the species of Sporothrix， it usually takes 4 to 6 days to isolate Sporothrix spp. for samples collected from skin lesions， and 10 days to 19 days from extracutaneous lesions .\n\n【15】Treatment of sporotrichosis depends on the clinical presentation. Inlymphocutaneous or osteoarticular manifestation，oral itraconazole200 mg per day is the preferred treatment . However， for systemic sporotrichosis， recommended treatment is amphotericin B， given as a lipid formulation at 3 mg/kg to 5 mg/kg daily or amphotericin B deoxycholate， administered at 0.7 mg/kg to 1.0 mg/kg daily. Treatment is continued until a favorable response has been achieved， after which the therapy is changed to oral itraconazole 200 mg BD for at least 1 year . Other than the commonly reported side effects such as nephrotoxicity，amphotericin B can also cause hepatotoxicity. The incidence of increased transaminases and bilirubin due to amphotericin B had been reported at approximately 20% . We hypothesize that our patient's underlying hepatic disease might have predisposed him to develop raised transaminases upon exposure to amphotericin B.\n\n【16】The response of patients to treatment varies. Uncomplicated skin or mucosal manifestation in immunocompetent patients， usually heal with fibrous scar. However， untreated sporotrichosis can disseminate to other organ systems and may be fatal .\n\n【17】Conclusion\n\n【18】This case report highlights the rare presentation of systemic sporotrichosis with disseminated cutaneous andpulmonary involvement. It emphasizes the importance to have a high index of suspicion of the possibility of subcutaneous fungal infection in a patient who presents with suppurative skin nodules unresponsive to antibiotic therapy despite of their immune status.

Oral involvement is the most consistent feature of CP， it presents with painful erosions and desquamative gingivitis resulting in scar formation of oral mucosa. Typical ocular lesions include chronic scarring conjunctivitis with progressive subconjunctival fibrosis， fornix foreshortening and synechia formation between the bulbar and palpebral conjunctiva . Later， patients develop entropion with subsequent trichiasis， ocular surfacekeratinization， and eventually blindness . Mucosal surfaces of pharynx， nasal mucosa， and oesophagus can also be affected . Skin lesions develop in approximately one third of patients with CP. Pruritus at the sites of blisters or generalized pruritus may be present. Blisters heal with scarring or milia. Scalp involvement lead to scarring alopecia. Other complications of CP include airway stenosis， esophageal stricture. Diagnosis is based on clinical and pathological findings and the detection of linear deposits of IgG and/or IgA and/or C3 at the dermal-epidermal junction by direct immunofluorescence microscopy of a perilesional biopsy . Our patient presented with clinicopathological features of CP； however， there were several peculiar findings in this case， including delayed diagnosis for more than 15 years， association with generalized pruritus， esophageal scarring and scaring alopecia in addition to presentation with Periumbilical vesiculobullous lesions which are also typical for patients with classical bullous pemphigoid. Unlike the later condition， association with atrophic scarring was seen in our patient. The classical oral lesions as desquamative gingivitis and multiple oral ulcerations as well as eye findings as fornix shortening， symblepharon， entropion and trichiasis were typically seen in our case. Periumbilical skin biopsy showed a subepidermal blister with many neutrophils and eosinophils with dermal scarring which was consisting with CP. Immunoflorecence was not done as it was not available. Patients with mildlocalized CP may benefit from topical steroids whereas patients with more extensive disease and progressive scarring require systemic steroids. Dapsone， immunosuppressive drugs， such azathioprine have also been used . Our patient responded well to oral steroids. Unfortunately， the patient was diagnosed in the advanced stage when scarring had already occurred.\n\n【10】Conclusion\n\n【11】Cicatricial pemphigoidisa chronic progressive systemic autoimmune disease that has serious consequences.

There is no vaccine or therapeutic proven options to prevent COVID-19 infection. It has been speculated that some immunomodulating drugs may have an effect on the progression of this infection. It is reasonable that colchicine may be tested in the context of COVID-19 to detect its immunomodulatory effects which may prevent acute respiratory distress syndrome. We discussed a case with COVID-19pneumonia using colchicine successfully treated and reviewed the literature.\n\n【2】Keywords： COVID-19； Colchicine； Pneumonia； LDH\n\n【3】Abbreviations\n\n【4】WBC： White Blood Cell； C-RP： C-Reactive Protein； LDH： Lactate Dehydrogenase； BUN：Blood Urea Nitrogen； sCr： serum Creatinine； ALT： Alanine Aminotransferase； AST： Aspartate Aminotransferase\n\n【5】Introduction\n\n【6】Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) or Coronavirus Disease 2019(COVID-19) by named the World Health Organization is a newly emerged disease that has become a global public health challenge. The search for drugs against COVID-19 is continuing. This new viral infection characterized by dry cough， fever， dyspnea， fatigue， and lymphopenia， which can be complicated by interstitial pneumonia leading to severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome(ARDS) which results from an unmodulated inflammatory response and leads to death .\n\n【7】Because specific drugs to treat SARS-CoV-2 have not yet been revealed. Currently several potential drugs are used for COVID-19 patients； however， none of the therapies have been proven to be completely effective. Antiviral therapy for SARS-CoV-2 and immunosuppressive treatment have to continue concomitantly for preserve vital organ functions. Immunomodulating drugs such as hydroxychloroquine， chloroquine， tocilizumab (an anti-interleukin-6 receptor antibody)， are widely used in different stages of the disease since high uncontrolled inflammation is responsible for deaths .\n\n【8】Colchicine is utilized for the treatment of gout， Behcet’s Disease， and also for prevention of pericarditis and Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF). Colchicine disrupts the microtubule formation and reduces chemotaxis， phagocytosis， and migration of neutrophils . Therefore， it is reasonable that colchicine may be tested in the context of COVID-19 to detect its immunomodulatory effects which may prevent Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS).\n\n【9】At the present time， several randomized studies regarding colchicine in COVID-19 patients have been announced. Nevertheless there are opposite opinions claim that colchicine doesn't prevent ARDS moreover may be harmful for patients with COVID-19. In this case， we report a patient who has been under colchicine treatment for three years and diagnosed COVID-19pneumonia and recovered without any complications associated with COVID-19 infection.\n\n【10】Case Presentation\n\n【11】A 38 years， Caucasian， old female patient admitted to emergency unit complaining of cough and fever for 2 days. The patient is a nurse and she has been active working in hospital. She had been diagnosed rheumatoid arthritis and been using colchicine 1 mg/day for three years.\n\n【12】On admission， the patient had cough， and her vital signs were as follows： Arterial blood pressure， 100/70 mmHg， heart rate， 73 beats/min； body temperature，37.3°C； respiratory rate， 20 breaths/min and oxygen saturations of99% on room air. Physical examination was unremarkable. Chest CT(Computer Tomography) scan revealed ground-glass opacification at lower lobes oflungs. COVID-19 was confirmed by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). Laboratory findings revealed white blood cell count7.13×10/uL，lymphocyte 1.5×10°u/L，c-reactive protein (C-RP) 0.2mg/dL and procalcitonine<0.05 ng/mL. D-dimerlevel was 388.71 ng/mL， and ferritin was detected 39.29 ng/mL， Fibrinogen was 348 mg/dL， while lactate dehydrogenase level was 135 U/L on admission. The laboratory findings are given in Table 1 during the patients follow-up in the hospital. Hydroxychloroquine 400 mg/day， azithromycin 250mg/day， enoxaparin 4000 units per day were started for COVID-19pneumonia. Colchicine therapy was maintained unchanged. On the4 day of her hospitalization CT scan showed progression， although her vital parameters were stable. Favipiravir treatment 1200 mg per day was started. Hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin ended up in 5 days. Enoxaparin dosage was raised up to 8000 units per day.

Colchicine reaches much higher concentrations within leukocytes than in plasma and persists there for several days after ingestion. In recent years， colchicine has attracted attention in the management of cardiovascular diseases by suppressing their inflammatory component . Its mechanism of action is thought to be the potent inhibitor of tubulin polymerization and microtubule generation and，possibly， effects on cellular adhesion molecules， inflammatory chemokines， and the inflammasome. Colchicine may inhibit activation of NLRP3 inflammasome and additionally may inhibit directly the synthesis of TNF-a，IL-1B，and IL-6 . Colchicine is an antimitotic substance that blocks cell division during metaphase . Also， COVID-19 enters the cell using the Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme2(ACE2) as a host receptor and causes infection. Especially， in low cytosolic pH the virus increases its entry into the cell by penetrating to ACE2 . Although colchicine is known to play an important role in intracellular protein traffic and has poor binding to microtubules at alkaline pH， its effect on the penetration of the virus into the ACE2 receptor is controversial. All these compounds enhance the inflammatory process and are responsible for alveolar damage， interstitial infiltration， and ARDS. Therefore some authors suggest that colchicine may decrease the tissue damage in COVID-19 pneumonia by these pathways and can be used in patients with increased risk of ARDS .\n\n【17】However， it has been suggested that colchicine may be effective in COVID-19 infection and reduce cytokine storm seen during the COVID-19 infection. Cumhur et al.  disagree with this suggestion and claim that since colchicine does not decrease intracellular pH enough， there will be a high viral load leads to more severe cytokine storms . In addition toxic doses of colchicine affect alveolar type II pneumocytes， inhibiting the release of surfactants and causing ARDS and also toxic doses leads to DIC and multiorgan failure . So that the colchicine treatment in COVID-19 pneumonia may increase the risk of ARDS and DIC .\n\n【18】A trial has been done in Israel with patients under treatment of hydroxychloroquine or colchicine and COVID-19 test was performed. There was no significant difference between the groups found positive and negative . Also there are several trials investigating the efficacy of conventional therapeutic doses of colchicine have been registered for the treatment of COVID-19 (NCT04322682，NCT04328480， NCT043267901.\n\n【19】In this case we report a patient under treatment of colchicine because of rheumatoid arthritis for three years and diagnosed COVID-19 pneumonia. In our case， severe complication of pneumonia like ARDS was not observed. We think that this result may be related to early detection of pneumonia and early antiviral therapy. It is interesting in that it has been shown that colchicine does not prevent the development of COVID-19 pneumonia， even if this specific case. Patient was a nurse and she was in the high-risk group for the infection so just by this case we cannot reach a definite conclusion for general population. More data's and results of the ongoing trials are awaited to decide whether colchicine will take place in therapeutic protocols for COVID-19 infection.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 11:27:46", "endTime": "2024/09/24 11:28:25", "cost": 39.353}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:29", "update_time": "2024-09-23 19:28:23", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 19:27:44"}

It is characterized by congenital vaginal agenesis， with a prevalence of 1/4000 to 1/5000 . Patients with MRKH typically either have no uterus or only rudimentary uterus. Some of them may also show urologic anomalies and， in rare cases， spinal malformations. They all have a normal female karyotype of 46 XX with normal ovarian functions. Ovarian cyst pedicle torsion is a common gynecological acute abdomen with pedicle torsion occurring in approximately 10 percent of ovarian cysts.\n\n【2】However， MRKH syndrome with ovarian cyst torsion is rare. This paper summarizes the clinical data of a MRKH syndrome case complicated with pedicle torsion and necrosis of a giant ovarian serous cystadenoma.\n\n【3】Case Presentation\n\n【4】The patient is a 23-year-old female， who presented with 2-week history of irregular abdominal pain on the right lower quadrant， but no nausea， vomiting， fever， or urinary symptoms. This recurrent symptom initially started over a year ago and had been treated as “pelvic inflammation”with antibiotic in another hospital for multiple episodes. During that period， no ultrasonography was performed. The patient has a known history of MRKH syndrome and underwent vaginoplasty and ultrasonography two years prior. A postoperative follow-up ultrasound scan showed a right ovarian cyst of 4 cm.\n\n【5】Gynecological examination： normal development of vulva， narrow vagina， smooth mucosa， difficulty in accommodating 2 fingers， depth of about 7 cm； absence of cervix and uterine body； a cystic mass of 10 cm ×9 cm× 6 cm next to the right adnexal area with mild tenderness， unclear boundary and not easy to move； no abnormal observations on left adnexa.\n\n【6】Laboratory data： White blood cell count： 8.5×10/L. Neutrophil percentage： 66.9%. Serum amyloid A： 11.5 mg/L. High-sensitivity C-reactive protein： 5.1 mg/L. Fibrinogen： 4.04 g/L. D-dimer：1.15 mg/L FEU. Anti-Mullerian tube hormone： 0.8 ng/mL (normal range 1.95). Sex hormones and thyroid function were normal. Karyotype was reported as 46 XX.\n\n【7】MRI showed a triangular soft tissue between the giant cyst and the bladder. The structure of vagina was visible， while the boundary was not clear. Multiple cysts were found in the bilateral ovarian areas. The cross section of the right ovarian lesion was about 5.3 cm x2.9 cm， posterior to this lesion there was a nodular signal of obvious enhancement at the size of 2.3 cm ×1.3 cm . The diameter of the largest left ovarian cyst was 1.9 cm. Next to it， there was nodular soft tissue of obvious inhomogeneous enhancement， with the size of 3.1 cm x 1.9 cm . MRI also demonstrated a large irregular tube-shaped cystic in the pelvis， at the size of9.8 cm x4.6 cm×10.1cm， with clear boundary， inhomogeneous wall and no obvious enhancement on contrast-enhanced scan . The kidneys， bladder， intestine， liver， all-bladder and lymph nodes were reported normal.\n\n【8】Given her medical history of MRKH， the triangular soft tissue above the bladder with bilateral nodules was consistent to an undeveloped primordial uterus. Bilateral ovarian structures were not clearly shown. There were multiple cystic foci in the ovarian region and the right cystic focus showed signs of hemorrhage. The preliminary diagnosis was ovarian cyst. However， because the giant cystic focus of the pelvis extended to the right ovarian region the possibility of it being the pedicle torsion of the right ovarian cyst couldn't be eliminated.\n\n【9】The operation began with a diagnostic laparoscopy， which revealed a dysplasia-uterine-like muscular tissue of about 3 cm x4 cm x3 cm in the left pelvic cavity near the iliac fossa . Adjacent to it was an oviduct-like tubal structure with part mucosal structure at the umbrella end. Below it was the ovary of about 3 cm x 4 cm x2.5 cm， with no obvious abnormality in appearance nor obvious vegetative growth on the surface. The uterine-like muscular tissue and the left adnexa were stuck together with the left pelvic wall. There was a cystic mass in the right pelvic cavity， partially dark purple and covered with omentum， densely adhered to the right pelvic and anterior abdominal wall. After the separation of the covered omentum and membranous adhesins， a dumbbell-shaped cystic-solid mass emerged. The larger part was about 11 cmx6cm x 8 cm， the other part was about 6 cmx7cm×6 cm . There was no obvious normal ovarian tissue and no obvious fallopian tube-like structure. No abnormal lesions were found in the omentum， stomach， liver， spleen and diaphragmatic roof. A partial resection of the right mass was sent for intraoperative frozen biopsy and was reported as right ovarian serous cystadenoma. Intraoperative diagnosis was pedicle torsion and necrosis of right ovarian serous cystadenoma with bilateral dysplasia uterine. Therefore，laparoscopic right ovariectomy and pelvic adhesion lysis were performed. The surgery went smoothly， and the patient recovered well. Postoperative pathological report was the same as the intraoperative frozen biopsy. On the follow-up， 2 months after operation， the AMH was 1.13 ng/mL， and the sex hormones were still in normal range.\n\n【10】Discussion\n\n【11】MRKH syndrome is characterized by congenital absence of the vagina and uterus， which is generally divided into 2 types： Type I， more common， only vagina and uterus are affected； typeII： In addition to no uterus nor vagina， patients also suffer from malformations of renal and skeletal systems. It should be distinguished from hymen atresia ， vaginal atresia  and Complete Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (CAIS) . Studies suggest vaginal dilatation as the first-line treatment for MRKH syndrome ， while surgery is also an option. The surgery is called vaginoplasty， including biological patch and peritoneal method. Improved surgical methods are reported constantly to benefit patients . The mental health of postoperative patients is also critical and shouldn't be overlooked. For patients with MRKH syndrome， the risk of pelvic complications should not be ignored in clinical practice， and routine gynecological physical examination should also be performed. There are reported cases of MRKH syndrome complicated with uterine leiomyoma， adenomyosis  and so on， which could have resulted in misdiagnosis.\n\n【12】MRI is an important imaging examination method for diagnosis of MRKH syndrome ， which helps to determine the presence ofuterus or primordial uterus. A recent retrospective analysis showed that MRI results in determining the degree of reproductive system involvement and multi-system related malformations are highly consistent with the final clinical diagnosis，proving the potential value of MRI in shortening preoperative diagnosis time . Clinically， ultrasound and MRI can be collaboratively used to reach the diagnosis of pelvic complications in patients with MRKH syndrome.\n\n【13】In regards to the choice of surgical methods ， considering this patient's clinical history， and the fact that the right ovarian cyst had been twisted for too long， resulting in extensive hemorrhage and necrosis which led to the right ovarian functionloss，right ovariectomy was suggested and performed. As for whether the uterus should be retained， given 1) the patient did not have periodic abdominal pain， 2) her uterus was considered as the primordial uterus， and 3) resection might affect the blood supply to the other healthy ovary and eventually lead to the decrease of ovarian reserve function， resection was not recommended for the contralateral (left) uterus. As for the affected side (right) uterus， since it may be complicated with uterine fibroids， adenomyosis and other related complications， we had suggested resection to her family members but the suggestion was rejected. After the surgery we reiterated the relevant risks to the patient and suggested routine follow-up visits.\n\n【14】For this case， due to congenital dysplasia， the distance between the ovarian suspensory ligament and the ovarian proper ligament was relatively short， so the pedicle torsion was more likely to happen anatomically. Given her MRKH history and repeated abdominal pain symptoms， if the imaging examination was performed sooner， a timelier surgery could have been performed to avoid adverse consequences such as cyst necrosis and extensive hemorrhage.\n\n【15】To sum up， MRKH syndrome is rare in clinical practice， yet， there is still a probability of complication of ovarian torsion due to the malformation of the ovarian ligaments. For such cases， physicians should be aware of this syndrome and pay more attention to the timely diagnosis and treatments.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 10:38:20", "endTime": "2024/09/24 10:40:31", "cost": 131.308}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:29", "update_time": "2024-09-23 18:40:29", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 18:38:17"}

Furthermore， TB is one of the major public health problems in Pakistan as every year 48，000Pakistani dies due to this infection. Pakistan ranks fifth among high burden countries worldwide. The convergence of Tuberculosis (TB)， Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)， COVID-19， and Multi-Drug Resistance (MDR) strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb) has created an unprecedented and threatening global scenario. The objective of this study was to elucidate the genetic mechanism underlying drug resistance in local TB isolates.\n\n【2】Methodology： PCR Amplification： The hotspot region of the KatG gene， responsible for Isoniazid(INH) resistance which encodes catalase peroxidase， is amplified using PCR. The amplified DNA is subiected to RFLP， where specific restriction enzymes were used to cleave the DNA at known restriction sites. The amplified DNA is further analyzed through Sanger sequencing， which determines the precise nucleotide sequence of the region.\n\n【3】Results： PCR-RFLP revealed forty-five out of eighty INH resistant M. tb strains had mutations in KatG (codon 315) which is 56.2% of all cases. Sequencing results revealed that this is substitution mutation； AGC to ACC (Ser315Thr).\n\n【4】Conclusion： It may be concluded that majority of INH resistance is due to the mutation in the codon 315 of KatG in local isolates. Furthermore， PCR-RFLP technique could be considered as a reliable method for the early detection of KatG mutations in MDR-TB.\n\n【5】Keywords： Tuberculosis； Multi-Drug Resistance (MDR)； Isoniazid； PCR-RFLP\n\n【6】Introduction\n\n【7】Tuberculosis (TB) is a communicable disease caused by bacillus M. tb. This disease has latently infected 33% of the world's population，accounts for 9 million new cases each year and caused more deaths than any other single infectious disease . It is transmitted through airborne droplets from patients with pulmonary TB， who expel bacteria through coughing. Natural history of TB shows that only 5% of the infected individuals progress into active TB disease . However， the people infected with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) are more susceptible to TB infection. The incidences recorded in Pakistan were 0.5 million in 2020 . The individuals most susceptible to Tuberculosis (TB) include those who reside with active TB patients， as well as individuals who are economically disadvantaged，homeless， or incarcerated in prisons .\n\n【8】Multidrug resistance arises from improper use of antituberculosis drugs and the use of substandard drugs for the treatment of TB in certain setting . The sequential acquisition of mutations in target genes results in drug resistant M. tb . MDR-TB is those which are resistant to two or more first line antituberculosis drugs， like Rifampicin (RIF) and Isoniazid (INH) .INH has been one of the most potent drugs in tuberculosis chemotherapy for almost halfa century. It is a prodrug and converted to active drug for its antituberculosis activity by KatG， an enzyme with dual activities of catalase and peroxidase .\n\n【9】Active INH drug leads to the inhibition of mycolic acid synthesis， which is an integral part of the mycobacterial cell wall. It is believed that INH inhibits two enzymes namely an enoyl acyl protein reductase (InhA) and B ketoacyl acyl protein synthase， which elongate the fatty acid in biosynthesis process . In addition， the research article highlights the role of KatG in the oxidative protection mechanism of M. tb specially； KatG functions as a catalase enzyme， facilitating the elimination of hydrogen peroxide. The catalytic activity of KatG is regarded as a significant virulence factor， as it enhances the bacteria's ability to survive within macrophages . Keeping in view the importance of KatG gene， the present study aimed to detect mutation(s) in this gene within local Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis (MDR-TB) isolates.\n\n【10】Materials and Methods\n\n【11】Sample collection and processing\n\n【12】A total of 169 Sputum samples were processed at the National Reference Laboratory， National TB Control Program in Islamabad for the isolation of M. tb. All samples were collected and processed aseptically following the recommended protocol.\n\n【13】Sample inoculation and identification\n\n【14】The sputum samples were decontaminated with 4% Sodium hydroxidetO0prevent thegrowth ooffunwanted1organisms. Subsequently， the samples were treated with N-acetyl-L-Cysteine to enhance mucolytic activity. These procedures were carried out in a Biosafety Level3 (BSL-3) Laboratory. Following decontamination and mucolytic treatment， the samples were inoculated onto Lowenstein-Jensen (LJ) media and were incubated aerobically for 4 to 8 weeks.\n\n【15】For final identification， the colonies were characterized based on their physical appearance. Additionally， the Zeihl-Neelsen stain was employed to visualize acid-fast bacilli， aiding in the identification process. Furthermore， biochemical tests were conducted to confirm the identification of the M. tb.\n\n【16】Overall， these stringent procedures and tests were performed in a controlled environment to ensure accuracy and prevent contamination， ultimately leading to reliable identification of the M. tb. present in the samples.\n\n【17】Antimicrobial susceptibility test\n\n【18】An antimicrobial susceptibility test was performed to identify the MDR strains of M. tb. The susceptibility test utilized Isoniazid(INH)， Rifampin (RIF)， Streptomycin (STR)， and Ethambutol(EMB)， following the established protocol . The method described by120waler et al. 2022 was employed for susceptibility testing with slight modifications .\n\n【19】DNA extraction and quantification\n\n【20】DNA of M. tb isolates was extracted using CTAB method initially described by  with few modifications done by . Extracted DNA was quantified spectrophotometrically at 260 nm and 280nm wavelength. The ratio of 260 nm/280 nm was used to assess the quality of DNA.\n\n【21】PCR-RFLP\n\n【22】The onlinebioinformatics tool Primer 3 was used to design primers fortheamplification ofspecificregion of KatG. The sequence offorward and reverse primers was 5AGCTCGTATGGCACCGGAAC3and5ACGGGTCCGGGATGGTG3'respectively.\n\n【23】The Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) was performed using master mix after optimizing the conditions. An estimated fragment of 200 bp was amplified which contained KatG codon 315 from 904to 1103 nucleotide using a master cycler gradient (Eppendorf， USA). The reaction mixture contains 15 p moles of primers in 30 ul of PCR mixture， 1.5 mM of MgCl。 1U recombinant Taq DNA polymerase (Fermentas， USA) and 200 uM of each deoxyribonucleotides triphosphate (Fermentas，USA). The reaction was performed by initial denaturation at 95°C for 4 min， 30 PCR cvcles with denaturation at95°C for 20 sec， annealing at 54C for 33 sec and extension at 72°C for1 min in each cycle and a final elongation at 72°C for 8 min.\n\n【24】Agarosegel of 1.5% was prepared in 1X Tris-Acetate-EDTA(TAE) buffer for the confirmation of PCR results. After electrophoresis， the gel containing PCR products was stained in 1% ethidium bromide staining solution for 1 minute， visualized and recorded using gel documentation system (Kodak， USA). The PCR-RFLP assay was carried to detect mutation， if any. The restriction digestion was carried out for 2 h in a mixture containing 18 ul DNAse and RNAse free water， 10 ul of PCR products， 2 ul of HapII and 2 ul of Tango buffer. The restriction digested and undigested products as control were electrophoresed using 3% agarose gel for 30 min at 100 voltages. The largest restriction product obtained after restriction digestion for Isoniazid Resistant Strains (INHr) was 132 bp and for wild type the KatG codon 315 digested products were 153 bp.\n\n【25】DNA sequencing\n\n【26】The desired KatG region of 200 bp was amplified via PCR for sequencing. The amplified PCR products were first analyzed by gel electrophoresis， and then purified by mixing 40 pl PCR products with5 pl of 10 M ammonium acetate and 80 uL ofice-cold absolute ethanol in 0.2 ml Eppendorf tube. The products obtained were centrifuged at 14，000 rpm and 40°C for about 12 min. The supernatant was removed， and the pellet washed with 70% ethanol. The pellet was reconstituted in 21 uL distilled water after being air dried thoroughly. Thereafter， sequencing reaction was prepared. For which a mixture of dye terminator cycle sequencing 8 pl using big dye， forward primer1 pl， distilled water 8 pl， 2 pl of already purified PCR products were added to a 0.2 ml sterilized microcentrifuge tube. All the ingredients were mixed properly and were amplified on Master Cycler Gradient(Eppendorf， USA) using optimized cycling parameters as described earlier. The 10 pl amplified product was then purified by mixing2.5 pl of 125 mM sodium-EDTA in addition with 30 pl of absolute ethanol. Then centrifugation was done at 14，000 rpm for about 10min， the supernatant was discarded，and pellet was washed with 70%ethanol. Then ethanol was removed， and pellet was， fully air dried and heated at 96C for 1 min， and then cooled on ice and loaded to the sample plate wells. The plate of samples was placed in the 3130Genetic Analyzer， Hitachi (Japan). The data obtained was subjected for comparison with database using Basic Local Alignment Research Tool (BLAST) program.\n\n【27】Results\n\n【28】Growth on LJ media\n\n【29】Among the 169 samples， 118 tested positive for the growth of M. tb， exhibiting colony characteristics typical of M. tb on LJ medium. M. tb colonies appear rose， rough， and dry. They often have a buff-colored or pale yellowish tint. These colonies are non-pigmented or lightly pigmented， presenting as whitish， cream， or pale yellow in color. The lack of pigmentation is a distinguishing feature that sets them apart from other mycobacterial species. Furthermore， upon Zeihl-Neelsen staining， M. tb colonies exhibited red-colored rods. Biochemically M. tb. tested positive for Niacin， citrate， and Tween 80. Additionally， it displayed nitrate-reducing activity.\n\n【30】Antimicrobial susceptibility test\n\n【31】Out of the 118 samples collected， 80 samples were multidrug resistant. This means that these samples displayed resistance to two or more first-line drugs， which are typically the first line medications used for treating TB.\n\n【32】Collection and quantification of genomic DNA of MDR M. tb strains\n\n【33】Eighty isolates of MDR-M. tb were collected from National Reference Laboratory， National TB Control Program， Islamabad. DNA concentration was analyzed spectrophotometrically at 260 nm and 280 nm and run on 1% agarose gel. A representative result is shown in Figure 1.\n\n【34】Amplification of KatG specific region through PCR\n\n【35】The genomic DNA was subjected to PCR amplification of the specific region of KatG using forward and reverse primers.\n\n【36】Two hundred base pairs region of KatG spanning codon 315 was successfully amplified through PCR and analyzed on 1% agarose gel.\n\n【37】RFLP analysis of the am plified PCR products\n\n【38】Thereafter， the PCR products of KatG specific region were subjected to HapII digestion for two hours. The RFLP products were examined on 2% agarose gel. The largest product obtained after the RFLP digestion was 153 bp for wild type and 132 bp for mutant type. Digested PCR products were compared with 50 bp ladder and a negative control i.e.， the undigested PCR products .\n\n【39】Sanger sequencing of PCR-RFLP products\n\n【40】After confirmation of band shifts by RFLP the apparently mutant strains were analyzed by DNA sequencing technique to get more information. The results of DNA sequencing revealed that there is no mutation other than Ser/Thr at position 315 in these isolates which is shown by one of the representative results in Figure 4. Out of the eighty INH-resistant strains analyzed， 45 (56.2%) exhibited a substitution mutation from AGC to ACC at codon 315 of the KatG gene， whereas 35 (43.75%) isolates did not show any mutation in this region.\n\n【41】Discussion\n\n【42】Tuberculosis ranks among the deadliest human infections and remains a leading cause of mortality among infectious diseases. Although the use of a live attenuated vaccine and antibiotics can limit the infection. But the progress of drug resistance in the population has augmented concern that TB again can become an incurable disease . In the current study we identified 45 resistant strains of M. tb out of 80 isolates i.e.， 56.2% based on RFLP and sequencing. Our results for KatG Ser315 mutation was similar to the earlier reported rate of patients diagnosed with MDR-TB in Netherland55% and Kuwait 65%. However， the frequency in Pakistan is less in comparison to Russia which has 95% frequency . The recent data also support the fact that INH resistance is most common due to mutation in KatGgene at codon 315 . DNA sequencing was also carried out to confirm the KatG gene mutation in INH resistant isolates.DNA sequencing revealed that there was no mutation other than Ser/Thr315 in these isolates. These results were similar with already reported results by . Although PCR-RFLP is a robust， economic， and specific method， but requires a site for mutant allele detected by the enzyme especially in instances when more than one allele is associated with the mutation. Although， at present sequencing is considered as gold standard with its advantages as rapidity and precise determination of the location and nature of the mutations.\n\n【43】Conclusion\n\n【44】Among eighty INH resistant strains 45 (56.2%) had substitution mutation of AGC to ACC in KatG codon 315 while 35(43.75) isolates had no mutation in this region， which was further confirmed by DNA sequencing， which confirm that most of the drug resistance is due to KatGSer315Thr in the local isolates.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 10:16:36", "endTime": "2024/09/24 10:17:01", "cost": 24.731}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:29", "update_time": "2024-09-23 18:17:01", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 18:16:36"}

Our experience on 7 patients with grade ≥3 thrombocytopenia， over a cohort of 21 patients who undergone CAR-T therapy between January 2021 and December 2022， confirms that management with Romiplostim is efficient and feasible.\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】CAR-T cell therapy represents the new resource for treatment of refractory/recurring Non-Hodgkin B Cell Lymphoma (R/R NHL).\n\n【4】As demonstrated by data of SCHOLAR-1 study， R/R NHL have a very poor survival and CAR-T cell therapy offers chance to achieve， in 40% of the cases， Overall Survival (OS) of 2 years .\n\n【5】CAR-T cell therapy uses patient- ex vivo-derived T-cells that， thanks to a bio-engineering process， are able to recognize and amplify an immune reaction against patient-own-disease.\n\n【6】The extracellular domain of chimeric receptor， through the antigen-specific single chain variable Fragment (scFv)， is able to recognize the CD19 antigen， meanwhile the costimulatory domain， with molecules like CD28 and 41BB， is able to boosts the immune attack .\n\n【7】Adaptive immunotherapy is， otherwise， hampered by a unique toxicity profile.\n\n【8】Initially， early onset toxicity like the Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) and the Immune Cell Effector Neurotoxicity Syndrome (ICANS)， have almost monopolize practitioner’s attention Thanks to increasing experience，late adverse effects areemergingas substantial clinical obstacles.\n\n【9】Cytopenia was a common adverse effect in pivotal trials of available CAR-T cell therapies， with any grade cytopenia occurring in 44%， 84% and 60% of patients treated with Tisa-cel， Axi-cel and Brexu-cel respectively .\n\n【10】CAR-T-related cytopenia has a typical biphasic pattern with brief-term cytopenia， dues to lymphodepleting treatment， and long-term cytopenia， dues to direct cellular immunotherapy effect and following cytokines-related perturbations of inflammation network\n\n【11】“Real word”retrospective studies confirm that long-term hematological toxicity is a remarkable physician's concern.\n\n【12】Recent systematic review and meta-analysis through studies including 2004 patients demonstrated an incidence of any grade neutropenia， thrombocytopenia and anemia of 80%， 61%and 68% respectively，higher incidence in younger patients， ones with 24 median previous lines and patients treated with CD28-costimulatory-domain product .\n\n【13】Incidence of grade ≥3 cytopenia was 60% for neutropenia， 33% for thrombocytopenia and 32%tor anemia.\n\n【14】Neutropenia's management has already focused the attention of practitioners，leading the use of G-CSFs as therapy and/or prophylaxis Anemia and thrombocytopenia are managed through transfusions of irradiated components and using growth factors as EPO-similar and TPO-mimetics (TPOm).\n\n【15】Unfortunately， management oftthrombocytopeni1aaiIsSoften challenging due to the paucity of platelet components.\n\n【16】Herein our experience with CAR-T related thrombocytopenia and how we managed it.\n\n【17】Methods\n\n【18】We undertook a retrospective analysis of all patients who received Tisa-cel， Axi-cel and Brexu-cel for treatment of R/R PMBL，DLBCL， transformed Follicular Lymphoma (tFL) and Mantle Cell Lymphoma(MCL) between January 2021 and December 2022.\n\n【19】Whole patients' characteristics are listed in Table 1 and Table2， while in Table 3 are showed the main features per diagnosis and CAR-T product.\n\n【20】All procedures followed are in accordance with the standard of local ethics and with Helsinki declaration of 1975 (in its most recently amended version). Informed consent was obtained from all patient.\n\n【21】Data collection was daily-made during the inpatients staying(regularly until the 15h days post-CAR T infusion)， otherwise， in absence of complications， weekly the first month， every two weeks the subsequent two months and monthly until the sixth month. Then every three months whole first year and twice a year successively.\n\n【22】Twenty-one patients received CAR-T cell therapy and median follow up of 238 days (range 22-704 days)；nine patients received Axi-cel， seven patients received Tisa-cel and five patients received Brexu-cel. 66% were males.\n\n【23】Fifty-seven percent had DLBCL or tFL， 19% had PMBCL and24% had MCL. Twenty-nine percent were treated on second relapse and seventy-one percent on third or more relapse (range 3-7 previous lines). Median previous lines for DLBCL， PMBL and MCL cohorts were 3.5， 2 and 4 respectively，3 for Tisa-cel and Axi-cel cohorts both.\n\n【24】Sixty-six percent undergone High Dose Therapy and Autologous Stem Cell Transplant (HDT-ASCT).\n\n【25】Median age was 62 years (range 22-76) with an older median age in Tisa-cel (64 years) and Brexu-cel (62 years) cohorts than in Axi-cel ones (43 years).\n\n【26】Median age in DLBCL and PMBL cohort was 64 and 26.5 years respectively.\n\n【27】CAR-T were administered two days after the end of proper Lymphodepleting therapy (LD)lasting three days .\n\n【28】Median number of CAR-T cells infused was 1.82 × 10 in whole study population； 2.2×.27×.28×.7×10 and 1.4x10\" for DLBCL， PMBL， Brexu-cel， Tisa-cel and Axi-cel subgroups respectively， although Brexu and Axi-cel company (Gilead`) provides just an estimate of CAR-T cells with a standard value of 2×10° cells/kg·\n\n【29】CRS and ICANS were evaluated according to American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (ASTCT) scale .\n\n【30】CRS of any grade occurred in 90% of patients， 28% of grade 3.\n\n【31】No grade 4 CRS was observed. ICANS occurred in 2 patients (9%)， respectively of grade 3 and grade 1， both resolved with appropriate steroid treatment and Brexu-cel-related.\n\n【32】Weevaluated Platelet Counts (PC) from day 1ofLD chemotherapy to last known follow-up.\n\n【33】Median PC at the start of LD was 159.000/mmc (range 66.000/mmc).\n\n【34】Thrombocytopenia was defined according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grading.\n\n【35】Three patients were already thrombocytopenic before LD therapy， respectively two patients (9%) and 1 patient (5%) with grade l and 2thrombocytopenia.\n\n【36】We focused on hematotoxicity of grade 3， or rather PC<50.000/mmc， and grade 4， or rather PC<25.000/mmc.\n\n【37】Grade ≥ 3 thrombocytopenia occurred in 33% of patients， specifically three patients had grade 3 and five patients grade 4. Three patients were treated with tisa-cel， three patients with axi-cel (2 of the latter because of PMBL histology) and two patients with brexul-cel.\n\n【38】Grade 3 and 4 thrombocytopenia showed a median onset of14 days (range 2-60) and 21 days  from CAR-T infusion， respectively.\n\n【39】CMV-serotypeImatchedplatelets'apheresis units were administered，when available， in case of PC<20.000/mmc， regardless of hemorrhagic symptoms.\n\n【40】Romiplostim (Nplate) was given to more than 1-week lasting grade ≥3 thrombocytopenic patients.\n\n【41】TPOm-treatment ended after second detection of PC>50.000/mmc on weekly sampling. No tapering was planned.\n\n【42】One case of thrombocytopenia lasted less than one week， so， seven patients were treated with weekly TPO-mimetic Romiplostim at the initial dose of 1 mcg/kg and progressive dosage increase by 1mcg/kg/weekly in case oflacking of response.\n\n【43】Results\n\n【44】TPOm-treated cohort had a median of 5 previous lines of treatment and median age of 62 years.\n\n【45】TPOm-not-treated cohort (Control cohort) shows a median of 3previous lines and same median age.\n\n【46】A median of 6 doses of romiplostim were administered (range3-17) with median posology of 4 meg/kg (range 1-8 mcg/kg).\n\n【47】Tisa-cel's subgroup reveals a median of 13 administrations， 4.5administrations in Axi-cel and 4 administrations in Brexu-cel ones.\n\n【48】DLBCL's subgroup were treated with a median of 9.5administrations while PMBL's 3 administrations.\n\n【49】Median posology of romiplostim was 8 mcg/kg in Tisa-cel’s subgroup， 3.5 mcg/kg in Axi-cel and Brexu-cel ones both， 6 mcg/kg in DLBCL’s and 3 mcg/kg in PMBL’s subgroups.\n\n【50】Median PC， at the beginning ofromiplostim'stherapy was 26.000/mmc in the entire cohort while； 16.000/mmc in Tisa-cel's group，27.500/mmc in Axi-cel’s group， 26.500/mmc in Brexu-cels ones.

Median PC at first and last day of administration is 26.000/mmc and 70.000/mmc，respectively.\n\n【81】Romiplostim doesn't show an immediate action， as pointed by latency of 4 days between drug's first administration and PC nadir in70% of cases.\n\n【82】Although the paucity of our data， posology and latency of action is almost doubled in Tisa-cel-treated patients than others subgroups.\n\n【83】Median age of TPOm-treated cohort is 62 years， same as in Control cohort， DLBCLs， Tisa-cel's and Brexu-cel's subgroups， while it’s lower in PMBL's and Axi-cel ones with 26.5 and 43 years respectively.\n\n【84】Although the paucity of our data， different response to TPO-treatment could not be influenced by age while disease’s histology and 4-1BB-costimulatory domain-products could play a role.\n\n【85】Furthermore， cellularity of CAR-T products， together with their different co-stimulatory domains， could influence the medullary microenvironment and platelets' toxicity.\n\n【86】According to Luo’s metanalysis， our casuistry shows more previous treatment's lines before CAR-T in severe thrombocytopenic cohort than in the control ones.\n\n【87】Late-onset effect， along with high overall response， offers the possibility to move up the TPOm-support’s timing on PC between50.000/mmc vet.\n\n【88】An early use of TPOm could increase the availability of drug receptor thanks to， probably， a higher amount of megakaryopoiesis precursors in the mild-thrombocytopenic phase than in the severe-ones. This timing could be suitable especially on high-risk patients according to emergent score as CAR-HEMATOTOX.\n\n【89】Only two patients needed transfusion support and one of them needed a considerable amount ofirradiated apheresis'units.\n\n【90】Recently， both in the setting of DLBCL and multiple myeloma， case reports experienced re-infusion of cryopreserved Autologous Stem Cells (ASC)， left from a previous collection， on management of CAR-T pancytopenia .\n\n【91】This approach showed interesting results， achieving resolution of grade 4 pancytopenia in less than 15 days after ASC infusion； surely more data needing but not every patient can rely on this resource.\n\n【92】Therapy related cytopenia will occur more often in the future thanks to the emergence of cellular therapy and further studies， as randomized trials， can clarify the role of TPOm on CAR-T-related thrombocytopenia.\n\n【93】Moreover， thrombocytopenia can relapse over time， as showed on our casuistry.\n\n【94】Taken together， our clinical records show that thrombocytopenia management with Romiplostim could be feasible， efficient and， probably， improvable.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 11:42:45", "endTime": "2024/09/24 11:43:05", "cost": 20.266}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:29", "update_time": "2024-09-23 19:43:04", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 19:42:44"}

It is postulated to be a reactivation of JC virus in a severely immunocompromised state， to manifest as a multifocal inflammatory white matter disease of the brain， commonest in supratentorial region. We present a case of subacute ataxia and bulbar weakness in an undiagnosed HIV patient， mimicking a lateral medullary infarct.\n\n【2】Case Details： A 57 year old patient， not previously undiagnosed to have HIV infection， presented with slurring of speech and imbalance， 3 weeks after COVID-19 pneumonitis. MRI brain showed diffusion restriction with corresponding FLAIR hyperintensities in right lateral medulla. However， patient had progressive worsening of dysarthria and sensorium， warranting us to dig deeper and unmask HIV disease and a low CD4 cell count， thus helping us clinching the diagnosis of infratentorial presentation of PML.\n\n【3】Conclusion： Isolated medullary involvement in PML is an even rarer presentation of this rare disease seen in immunocompromised individuals.\n\n【4】Introduction\n\n【5】PML is alytic infection of oligodendrocytes and astrocytes seen in an immunocompromised host， caused by reactivation of JC virus . The neurological deficits correspond to areas of demyelination in the brain. The most frequently affected regions are the cerebral hemispheres at the periventricular and/or subcortical white matter . Infratentorial presentation is rare and when occurs， is seen typically in the middle cerebellar peduncles and pons. Isolated medullary involvement is even rarer (5% to 7%) . We present a rare case of infratentorial PML mimicking a lateral medullary syndrome in an undiagnosed HIV patient.\n\n【6】Case Presentation\n\n【7】57 year old male， no known comorbidities， presented with dysarthria， dysphagia and imbalance for 5 days. Patient had a past history of COVID pneumonia 3 weeks ago and was treated with oxygen with mask and remdesivir.\n\n【8】Patient had scanning speech and dysphagia， more to liquids. Examination revealed right gaze evoked nystagmus with right limb ataxia， with impaired tandem gait and swaying towards right side. MRI brain revealed multifocal areas of diffusion restriction and FLAIR hyperintensity involving the right half of thelateral medulla，left frontal and parietal lobes and right parietal lobe.MRI angiogram was normal .\n\n【9】After 3 weeks， patient presented with worsening of dysphagia and imbalance with visible tachypnea， pooling of oropharyngeal secretions and hypoxia. Patient needed elective intubation for airway protection. Repeat MRI showed expansion of right medullary lesion with FLAIR hyperintensity with peripheral diffusion restriction and a new frontal hyperintensity， involving subcortical U fibers with a sharply demarcated peripheral border and an ill-defined inner border， without contrast enhancement .\n\n【10】HIV by ELISA was detected to be positive with CD4 count 155 cells/ml. Serum toxoplasma IgM was negative. CSF showed protein 94 mg/dl， sugar 53 mg/dl with parallel blood sugar 98 mg/dl with2 cells， no atypical cells were noted.\n\n【11】The characteristic MRI picture and HIV positive status with low CD4 cell count pointed towards possibility of PML. Hence CSF John Cunningham Virus PCR was ordered and it turned out positive. Unfortunately， patient succumbed due to progressive brainstem involvement.\n\n【12】Discussion\n\n【13】PML is a white matter disease of immunocompromised host with predominant fronto-parietal involvement. It has been observed in a variety of immunocompromised states like HIV， SLE； post-chemotherapy， chronic kidney disease etc .\n\n【14】In a case report by Finelli et al. ， misdiagnosis of PML as a stroke mimic was discussed， with case details of two patients who turned out to be HIV positive at a later date. One of these patients had a transient ischemic attack with retrospective evaluation of MRI showing subcortical white matter changes. The other patient had a left thalamic and left parietal lesion that was treated as a chronic infarct， with a diagnosis of a cryptogenic stroke. Both patients were reevaluated at a later date in view of progressive worsening of clinical deficit and had a poor outcome.\n\n【15】Infant et al.  have reported a single case of infratentorial PML mimicking an acute ischemic stroke in a patient of chronic lymphocytic leukemia.\n\n【16】Initial presentation of PML as predominanttmedullary involvement mimicking lateral medullary syndrome was also observed in another case report by Durafort et al.  in a patient undergoing hemodialysis. This report highlighted the possibility of PML in an unconventional immunocompromised state such as chronic kidney disease.\n\n【17】Similar to this scenario， our patient did not have a known immunocompromised condition atpresentation， delaying the diagnosis of HIV and initiation of ART. The clinical presentation of bulbar weakness and ataxia with gaze evoked nystagmus coupled with a history of COVID pneumonitis in recent past prompted the consideration of a lateral medullary infarct. This clinical suspicion was further strengthened by the diffusion restriction in right lateral medullary lesion. As with other cases described in the literature， progressive worsening of bulbar weakness and sensorium prompted a repeat imaging and search for other etiologies.\n\n【18】In 2012， Liu et al.  have published an article from a neuroradiologists’ perspective of stroke mimics. They mention.1Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease CJD， PML and Herpes encephalitis as infections mimicking stroke clinically and radiologically. They noticed that an ADC bright signal in the diffusion restricted lesions should alert the clinician against the diagnosis of infarct.\n\n【19】MRI hasa superior sensitivity in the detection2and characterization of PML lesions though the diagnosis may be suspected by CT scan . However the diffusion restriction observed in PML lesions can mimic an infarct. On TiW sequence， the lesions are hypointense， due to apoptosis of virus infected oligodendorcytes. There may be an incomplete hyperintense rim on pre-contrast T1W images， representing lipid laden macrophages at the advancing edge of the lesion. T2 W images the lesions appear hyperintense due to demyelination， and typically involve the periventricular and subcortical white matter， having scalloped lateral margin when they involve the subcortical white matter predominantly in the parieto-occipital lobes. Lesions are more conspicuously visualized in the T2FLAIR sequences， appearing hyperintense against a background of suppressed CSF signal intensity. Mass effect is infrequently described and usually minimal and correlation with shorter survival when seen on initial studies. The pattern may be unilateral， but more often bilateral and asymmetrical with involvement of posterior fossa. PML may also involve the basal ganglia and deep white nuclei as there are white matter fibers in these regions. The lesions typically do not enhance as the blood brain barrier is intact. There have been some reports ofperipheral mild or diffuse enhancement suggestive of good immune response and hence improve prognosis. There have been reports with lesions having cystic component suggesting tumors or abscess4.\n\n【20】The CSF biochemistry and cytology is normal. Our patient showed raised proteins with normal sugar and no cellularity. In CSF， detection of JC virus by PCR is diagnostic. The sensitivity is 70% and specificity is 90% to 100%. If the PCR for JC virus is negative in a scenario with high degree of suspicion， a repeat CSF examination or brain biopsy is advocated which confirms the diagnosis .\n\n【21】Infratentorial involvement in PML is rare， till now 5 to 6 cases have been documented with brainstem/cerebellar involvement as a presenting feature of PML . Typically， middle cerebellar peduncle， pons and cerebellum is involved clinically and radiologically. Pontine lesions may extend to the midbrain and medulla. Isolated medullary lesions are uncommon (5% to 7%). There is a single case report with bilateral medullary lesion by Matthew et al. Our patient had a unilateral lateral medullary involvement， which gradually progressed to involve medial structures engulfing the cardiac and respiratory centers.\n\n【22】The delay in diagnosis of PML due to its presentation like a stroke mimic has been discussed by Finelli et al. ， advising screening of all suspected stroke patients to be screened for HIV.\n\n【23】Conclusion\n\n【24】PML is an important differential for a stroke mimic， both clinically and radiologically. Characteristic MRI features help distinguish between these two clinical entities with separate treatment approaches. Infratentorial involvement in PML is a rare entity with rapidly progressive fatal course.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 11:03:41", "endTime": "2024/09/24 11:04:46", "cost": 64.658}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:29", "update_time": "2024-09-23 19:04:45", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 19:03:40"}

In the clinical picture one could find pronounced muscle contractures of upper arm and especially of leg muscles with sharp limitation of movement's range in large joints， together with “woody”firmness of the limb muscles with painless tumor-like swellings within the muscles of upper arms and thighs. EMG showed abnormal spontaneous electrical activity， very short motor unit potentials and increased incidence of polyphasic potentials. Muscle biopsy showed pronounced increase of the fibrous tissue around muscle fascicles in perimysium exclusively， this was combined with massive inflammatory cell infiltrates， and diffuse inflammatory cell infiltration with small foci inside endomysium. Increased variability in the fiber's size， as well as atrophy， focal degenerative changes and necrosis of some muscle fibres was also evident. Treatment with prednisolone in combination with cyclophosphane caused decrease of both nodule's size and firmness of muscles， accompanied by some increase of joint movement's range.\n\n【2】Keywords： Fibrosing myositis； Localized nodular myositis； Muscle and joints contractures； Inflammation； Polymyositis\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Localized nodular myositis is a very rare disorder， and its nosological place remains unclear. Some authors consider it to be a nosological entity ； others think that it is a clinical and pathological variant of polymyositis . However some authors suppose that separating of localized nodular myositis from polymyositis and dermatomyositis syndromes will be possible only after careful clinical and pathological analysis of many more cases . We examined a patient in whom localized nodular myositis was one of the clinical signs of subacute fibrosing polymyositis.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】Patient F. (n2380) aged 64 was admitted to the clinic in January 1990. He complained of sharp difficulties in walking and the limitation of movements range in large joints of extremities because of severe muscle stiffness， and presence of the extremely firm painless masses within upper arm and thigh muscles with slight weakness of the arm muscles.\n\n【7】The disease has been developing since November， 1966 when the right ankle joint and the lower leg oedema developed. Severe pain in the region of talocrural joints and in gastrocnemius muscle during walking as well as hyperemia of the right lower leg soon followed. In December， 1988 the oedema widely spread to his right leg totally， and the lower leg and thigh muscles became large， firm and painful. In 3 months the same changes appeared in his left leg. In March， 1989 the patient walked with difficulties because of sharp stiffness of the leg muscles and pain in gastrocnemius muscles. There was no pain in leg joints.\n\n【8】At that time the diagnosis of thrombophlebitis of lower limb’s veins was established. However the special treatment was ineffective and the diagnosis of thrombophlebitis was not confirmed. In May， 1989 despite of the decrease ofleg's oedema the muscles of the legs and pelvic girdle remained extremelyhard and stiff. The patient could walk on his toes only and with the help of a stick because of sharp limitation of range of movement in knee and ankle joints. In September， 1989 the volume of muscles of the upper arms enlarged， they became very firm and slightly painful， and limitation of range of movement in left elbow joint developed. Large， firm and slightly tender nodules appeared simultaneously in the upper arm and thigh muscles， and later such developed at the outer surface of right lower leg (this nodes disappeared themselves after some months). There was no muscle weakness and pain in the leg muscles and in joints. However the patient could walk using crutches only，because “his legs were hard and straight like sticks\". In December， 1989 the patient was hospitalized in the surgical department with the diagnosis of the femur sarcoma. We could not perform MRI of nodules. However the signs of neoplasia were excluded by punctured biopsy of the nodules with thorough muscle histology， gastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy， X-ray pictures of chest， femur and joints. Blood and ESR were normal. Diagnosis of sarcoma was not confirmed. The granulomatous myositis (may be sarcoid nodular myositis) was suspected by neurologist (V. Kazakov).\n\n【9】Status\n\n【10】General condition was well. Body temperature was normal；pulse rate was 76， and the respiration rate 16. Blood pressure was 130/80mmHg. Hepar， spleen and peripheral lymphonodules were not enlarged. Slight oedema and hyper pigmentation of the distal parts of lower legs and ankles were present.\n\n【11】Slight periorbital oedema was present also. Slight weakness of the orbital part of orbicular is oculimuscles was revealed. Swallowing and phonation were not disturbed. No atrophy of the tongue. Moderate atrophy of left trapezius， supra-and infraspinatus， deltoid us and triceps brachii muscles， as well as the muscles of the forearms and dorsal interosseous hand muscles bilaterally were evident. The interscapular space is deepened， the inner edge ofleft scapula slightly recede from the thorax. The muscles， especially biceps brachii， muscles ofpelvic girdle， thighs and lower legspalpatory had “woody”consistency. Painless swellings， without clear borders or connection to skin with “woody”firmness were palpated within biceps brachii(10 cm x6 cm on the right and 15 cm x10 cm on the left) and vastus lateralis (6 cm × 4 cm bilaterally) muscles .\n\n【12】One could see severe contractures of biceps brachii muscles， more prominent at left， as well as gluteus maximus， quadriceps， posterior groups of the thighs and lower leg muscles. Both active and passive movements were limited in shoulder and elbow joints and were almost impossible in hip joint， knee and ankle joints. The patient couldn't abduct his arms to vertical position and to extent his forearms fully . He walked with difficulties on the straight legs using crutches only  and he could “sit only with his legs straightened and his trunk being thrown back\" . He couldn't stand up.\n\n【13】Muscle strength according to Daniels et al.  was as follows：Neck flexors， 3+； neck extensors， 5； sternocleidomastoide us， 3+； deltoid us， 4 at right and 3+ at left； biceps brachii， 4 at right and 3-at left； triceps brachii， 5 at right and 4 at left； extensors and flexors of the wrists and fingers， 4； dorsal and volar interossei， 3； gluteus maximus and gluteus medius， 4； iliopsoas， 4； quadriceps， 5； tibialis anterior， gastrocnemius， tibialis posterior， 5 (severe contractures of posterior group of leg muscles).\n\n【14】The palpation of muscles， intramuscular swellings， nerves and joints was painless. Deep tendon reflexes at arms and legs were absent. Fasciculation's and percussion myoedema were also absent. There were no pyramidal signs. The sensibility and the coordination of movements were not disturbed.\n\n【15】Routine hematology and biochemistry including CPK， LDH， SGOT，SGPTandTSHwerenormal.LE-cells were absent.Rheumatoid factor； serological reactions on brucellosis and toxoplasmosis were negative. X-rays pictures of the chest， bones (cranium， pelvis， and extremities)， large joints and limb muscles were normal. ECG showed consistent left His bundle block. Abdominal ultrasonography revealed diffuse changes of hepatic parenchyma and the signs of right chronic pyelonephritis. Biceps brachii and vastus lateralis muscle's needle EMG showed fibrillation potentials， positive sharp waves， increased insertion activity and pseudomyotonic discharges at rest. The mean duration of 20 motor unit action potentials (MUAPs) in m. biceps brachii was 3 msec-3.5 msec (normal 7.3 msec-8 msec) and mean amplitude was 250 uv -350 uv (normal 500 uv). The mean duration of the 20 MUAPs in the vastus lateral is was 3.5 msec(normal 7.4 msec-10 msec) and mean amplitude was 350 uv-400 uv(normal 900 uv). At maximum voluntary muscle contraction a low-amplitude interference pattern was evident in both muscles. 80% of action potentials were polyphasic and pseudopolyphasic.\n\n【16】Maximum conduction velocities of motor fibers of both ulnar and tibialis posterior nerves from elbow to wrist and from knee to the ankle were normal bilaterally.\n\n【17】Biopsy of m. peroneus longus from the region of a prior swelling， which disappeared itself some months ago， showed increase of connective tissue， inflammation and apparently spared muscle fascicles. Extreme increase of the fibrous tissue particularly in perimysial space which seemed to wrap and compress the muscle fascicle was the most prominent histologic feature . Increase of the interstitial connective tissue was evident inside endomysial space as well， but to alesser extent. Massive inflammatory cell infiltrates were concentrated predominantly in the perimysium fibrous tissue between muscle fascicles as well as near and around perimysial blood vessels . Diffuse inflammatory cell infiltration was present in both perimysial and endomysial spaces with rare foci enclosing some muscle fibers， as well as in the region of damaged muscle fibers. Inflammatory cell infiltrates consisted of lymphocytes， histiocytes， and rarely plasma cells. Cross section of the diameter of the adjacent muscle fibres showed its increased variation with atrophy， segmental necrosis， degeneration， vesicular and internal nuclei， and decrease in longitudinal and transverse striation， increase in the number of sarcolemmal nuclei of some muscle fibers， and a small number of regenerating muscle fibers with prominent dark nucleoli . Productive inflammation with endothelial hyperplasia in perimysial blood vessels was not found.\n\n【18】Right lower leg skin biopsy performed at the site of muscle biopsy， showed the areas of some atrophy and oedema of epidermis together with collagenous fibresoedema with slight lymphocytic cell infiltration near and around blood vessels .\n\n【19】The patient was treated by oral prednisolone in the dose 1 mg/kg/day (80 mg/day) together with intramuscular cyclophosphane in the dose 2.5 mg/kg/day (200 mg/day). The size and firmness of nodules as well as firmness of muscles decreased after 1.5 months of treatment； muscle strength increased and the range of movements in joints increased a little too.\n\n【20】Discussion and Conclusion\n\n【21】Manyinvestigations distinguish a special rare variant of\"localized nodular myositis\"as a well-known form of inflammatory myopathies. Some authors described this form under the name“focal myositis”as a new clinical and pathological entity representing benign pseudotumour of skeletal muscle . The disease manifested with rapidly growing painful swellings resembling muscle tumor or venous thrombophlebitis of lower legs in some cases . Authors considered that “focal myositis\"differed from polymyositis. Although this disease is characterized by myalgia and inflammation in a muscle， the pathological process always remains limited to one zone of a single muscle only， and the signs of systemic disease are not observed .Similar cases were describedbyotherauthors later . In some works  it was shown that focal myositis differs from polymyositis greatly by immunological and clinical changes despite of similar morphological changes in muscles. The same opinion had some other authors . However some authors opposed then osological entity of \"localized nodular myositis”among inflammatory myopathies . These authors suggest that the clinical and pathological evidence indicates a close relationship between localized nodular myositis and polymyositis， as the former clinical picture often precedes and evolves into the latter. It is necessary to remark that such forms of polymyositis starting as focal processes were rarely described .\n\n【22】The clinical picture in our patient differs from that was reported earlier . In these cases the polymyositis began with the development of painful nodules within limb muscles. Progressive muscle contractures were not found. In the early stage of the disease the restriction of movements was connected with pain full nodules， but in the later stage with severe weakness and atrophy of muscles. Thus in these cases localized nodular myositis was a prelude of polymyositis.\n\n【23】In our patient the disease started with oedema， painfulness，“woody\"firmness and stiffness of lower leg and pelvic girdle muscles with rather fast， almost simultaneous， development of contractures of these muscles. Just pronounced contractures of muscles themselves， but not muscle weakness became the cause of sharp limitation of range of movements in our patient.\n\n【24】The clinical picture in our patient differs from the clinical picture in patients with “Stiff Person Syndrome”(SPS). In SPS patient the muscles of the arms and legs don't have “woody\"consistency during palpation， as well as painless nodules of “woody”firmness within some muscles of arms and legs， and pronounced contractures of muscles， which sharply limit patient's movements. Our patient as well had no fluctuating muscular rigidity with repeated episodes of painful muscle spasms which are characteristic for SPS. In SPS patients at initial stage of the disease as a rule there are no signs resembling thrombophlebitis with lower leg oedema and skin hyperemia that we observed in our patient. Unfortunately， in that period we could not determine anti-GAD antibodies that are characteristic of the SPS.\n\n【25】Bradley et al.  described three patients aged 23， 4 and 6 with extreme perimysial and less endomysial fibrosis that was a result of contractures of muscles which caused the limitation of movements more than muscle weakness. However in these patients the disease began in early childhood and they had no“woodynodules within the muscles， although muscles in Case 1 and Case 3 were extremely firm with “woody\"consistency during palpation.\n\n【26】Earlier Walton and Adams named such cases as \"chronic myositis fibrosa\" and suggested them to represent simply a chronic phase of polymyositis . However in our patient the contractures of muscles of “woody\"firmness developed at the beginning of the disease， and proceeded during 4-6 months， so according to Hudgson our case can be attributed to subacute polymyositis， and not chronic one .\n\n【27】In our patient the picture of morphological changes in the muscle somehow resembled the changes which were observed by some authors . However coarse degenerative changes of muscle fibers with their replacement by fibrous connective tissue and fat， as it was reported in the cases of the authors cited were not found in our case. The most prominent feature in our case was the extreme increase of connective tissue with massive lympho-histiocytic infiltrates predominantly in perimysial space， and scattered atrophy and degenerative changes of some muscle fibers. All slides of this muscle biopsy specimen were discussed in 1990 at the Round table consultation service of selected cases (Head Prof. Dr. Schroder J.M.) at the VII International Congress on Neuromuscular Diseases in Munchen， Germany.\n\n【28】Histological diagnosis was polymyositis. Activity of the serum enzymes was normal in our patient. It was possibly connected with the absence of rough damage of muscle fibers as well as by extreme increase of connective tissue and a long standing disease . At EMG one could see changes resembling polymyositis .\n\n【29】However， the clinical picture of the disease in our patient differs greatly from “pure”polymyositis. He had painless muscles of“woody”firmness and intramuscular “woody”swellings resembling sarcoma， which developed after the pronounced muscle contractures The latter caused sharp limitation of movements in large joints of extremities practically through the whole duration of the disease. Extreme perimysial fibrosis without coarse damage of muscle fibres， which usually cause severe muscle contractures， and without visible muscle weakness and atrophy characterized our case.\n\n【30】Thus in our case at the basis of peculiarities of clinical picture， histological muscle changes， EMG results， and some improvement from prednisolone and cyclophosphane treatment we suppose that the localized nodular myositis was one of clinical signs of subacute fibrosing polymyositis.\n\n【31】Sarcoid nodular myositis was excluded because at muscle biopsy no typical sarcoid histological changes including necrotic zones and interstitial granulomas with multinucleated giant cells and epithelioid cells were found . Also chest X-ray picture showed no enlarged lymph nodules. Absence of the calcifications， osteoid and cartilage formations on radiographs of the arm and leg muscles allowed to exclude myositis ossificans progressive . It is quite possible that localized nodular myositis in some cases is a clinical and pathological and even immunological entity ，but in other rare cases it may be the first manifestation of polymyositis or one of the clinical signs of subacute fibrosing polymyositis as we observed in our case.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 11:46:21", "endTime": "2024/09/24 11:46:37", "cost": 15.438}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:29", "update_time": "2024-09-23 19:46:37", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 19:46:21"}

He was admitted in the general Intensive Care Unit (ICU). On the admission day， his urine output was normal with normal serum creatinine level， but there was no history of defecation in the last 48 hrs before admission. On the second day of ICU-admission， as a prokinetic agent， a single dose of injection azithromycin (1 g， intravenously) was administered to him. On the following day， his serum creatinine level was raised sharply (2.1mg/dL) and renal output reduced to 27 mL/hr. Azithromycin was suspected for that event and stopped immediately. On the next day， his serum creatinine level was reduced remarkable (1.2 mg/dL) and urine output was normalized (45 mL/hr).\n\n【3】Conclusion： Nephrotoxic drugs generally contribute in developing AKI but to date， azithromycin is considered as a safe drug. However， azithromycin-induced AKI is an unusual event and caution should be taken in use.\n\n【4】Keywords： Acute kidney injury； Azithromycin； Nephrotoxic drugs\n\n【5】Introduction\n\n【6】Acute Kidney Injury (AKI)， also termed as acute renal failure or acute renal insufficiency， is a condition of abrupt renal function deterioration based on depletion of renal creatinine clearance with reduced renal output. AKI is associated with increased rate of mortality and complications in patients' disease states and associated therapeutics . In hospital settings， 20% AKI episodes are occurred by drugs and in adult patients，66% drug-induced AKI incidences were recorded .\n\n【7】Azithromycin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic of macrolide class and indicated in common bacterial infections mostly in upper and lower respiratory tracts， and also in sexually transmitted diseases . Worldwide， azithromycin as a well-tolerated drug， prescribed for both children and adults. Acute nephrotoxicity due to azithromycin in different age groups is a very unusual context and this is a rare Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR) criterion of azithromycin . In this case， we found an azithromycin-induced AKI event in an elderly patient.\n\n【8】Case Presentation\n\n【9】A 76-year elderly patient came to our hospital because of his history of breathing difficulty with wheezing， tightness of the chest and low grade fever. He had previous history of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Diseases (COPD)， diabetes mellitus， hypothyroidism and systemic hypertension. He was admitted at general intensive care unit (ICU)，immediately. His SpO2 was 88% in room air and was undertaken mechanical ventilation support， immediately. At the time of admission， his body temperature was 101.3°F， blood pressure was 160/90 mmHg， pulse rate was 105 beats/min， heart rate was 115 beats/min，respiration rate was 24 breaths/min，random blood sugar was 7.4 mmol/L， serum creatinine level was 0.8 mg/dL， urea was 66 mg/dL， Serum albumin was 2.5 mg/dL， TCO2was 24 and normal serum electrolyte levels. His leukocytes count was 12.6 K/uL of blood. After intubation，his Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) was recorded as E ，V(T)and M . His bowel sound was very sluggish and defecation was absent for the last 48 hrs before admission. His urine output was 60 mL/hr.\n\n【10】For this hyperthermia management， he was treated with injection acetaminophen(1 g，intravenously，8-hourly). He also received human albumin (25%/100 mL， intravenously， 12-hourly)， Levosulbutamol/Ipratropium nebulization， Levothyroxin (50 ug， orally， 24-hourly) and amlodipine/atenolol (50 mg+5 mg， orally， 24-hourly). On his second day of admission， there was no significant change in his biochemical test reports. On that day， as a prokinetic agent， he was administered with a single dose of injection azithromycin (1g， intravenously). On the next day， there was no significant change observed in his biochemical test reports but the serum creatinine level was abruptly raised to 2.1 mg/dL. Urine output was reduced to 27mL/hr and AKI was determined. The only newly added azithromycin was suspected for this adverse event and stopped. On the next day， his serum creatinine level was reduced to 1.2 mg/dL and urine output again increased to 45 mL/hr. During the rest of his ICU stay time，he was not experienced with AKI again. No other drug's involvement was observed to that AKI event except azithromycin .\n\n【11】Description\n\n【12】ADR is an unpleasant medication-associated injury that can be developed with the regular dose of a prescribed medication and AKI is one of the most common consequences of ADR .AKI is associated with increased mortality rates range between 25-80 percent and anomalous treatment outcomes . Multifactorial causes are the basis of developing AKI events and additionally， several known and unknown patient-specific factors contribute in developing AKI. Drug-induced AKI is a common phenomenon for some drugs such as， Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAID)， several antimicrobials and different chemotherapeutic agents . Multiple studies found that a drug becomes nephrotoxic with its one or more pathogenic mechanisms and these mayinclude inflammation，tubular cell toxicity， altered intraglomerular hemodynamics， thrombotic microangiopathy and crystal nephropathy. However， the drug-specific mechanisms are very crucial to recognize and to identify the real facts behind an event . Patient-oriented risk factors sometimes enhance the possibility of developing AKI and these may include age over 60 years； diseases such as， diabetes， heart failure， septic shock， volume depletion and underlying renal insufficiency . In case of admitted patients， a sudden raise in serum creatinine level within 48hours indicates a predisposition to AKI which is completely justified by its definition. To identify an AKI event， the most popular method is to compare the previous serum creatinine level with the current serum creatinine level and this also express the duration as well as the intensity of an AKI event .\n\n【13】Azithromycin is considered as one of the safe antibiotics of the macrolide group and because of having broad spectrum coverage with good patient-safety profile， azithromycin was the best-selling antibiotic in the United States in 2012 according to IMS Institute for Health Informatics market data .\n\n【14】In spite of having efficient therapeutic outcomes of azithromycin worldwide， study found that azithromycin causes interstitial nephritis and this may be resulted in persistent renal injury . In this case， we found that administration of azithromycin resulted in increased serum creatinine level which clearly identified an AKI event， and later on， in a reversible manner， serum creatinine level reduced to the normal level just after discontinuing azithromycin and restored the kidney functions again. In our case， we assume that azithromycin played one or more notorious mechanism(s) in that elderly patient. We believe that some further studies are also required to evaluate the potentiality of azithromycin to develop AKI with or without one or multiple risk factors.\n\n【15】Conclusion\n\n【16】Azithromycin is a well established drug of choice in the treatment of respiratory tract infection. However， in elderly patient as one of the patient-associated risk factors， azithromycin may develop a reversible acute kidney injury. The complete mechanism behind this adverse event is still unclear but some studies justified it as azithromycin-induced interstitial nephritis. So， patient-monitoring should be performed carefully when using azithromycin specially， in elderly patients.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 10:58:38", "endTime": "2024/09/24 10:59:11", "cost": 33.48}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:29", "update_time": "2024-09-23 18:59:09", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 18:58:35"}

According to the World Health Organization， the number of disabilities and deaths caused by PD is higher than any other neurological disorder. That nearlyone million Americans are living with PD. Most evidence suggests that the disease affects nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons in the basal ganglia and produces less dopamine， which causes movement problems associated with PD. The classic PD motor features cardinal symptoms of bradykinesia， cogwheel-like rigidity， tremor at rest， and postural instability. Treatment is symptomatic and there is no treatment to prevent progression of the disease .\n\n【2】Case Presentation\n\n【3】The patient is a 64-year-old female who presents to the emergency department with seizure and consciousness disturbance. She was diagnosed with PD at the age of 51， received regular medication (Madopar， Switane， Bromocriptine， Lexapro， Lexotan)， and got well-controlled. This was accompanied by decreased tendon reflexes and rigidity of four limbs， resting tremor， bradykinesia， and progressive change with wheelchair bound since 2019/02. The Hoehn and Yahr Scale was from stage IV to V. According to her family， she has frequent tremors， sweating and trismus episodes about twice a day after COVID-19 pneumonia in May 2022. On outpatient Examination Electroencephalography (EEG) on September 2022， showed diffuse background slowing，predominantly at 7 Hz to 8 Hz， and frequent sharp waves in the right temporal. In October2022， she has discharged from our hospital for bloodstream infection and urinary tract infection. During admission， intermittent seizure episode without consciousness change was noted， and Valproic acid was prescribed. The EEG was followed and showed excessive beta activity (14 Hz to18 Hz) in the frontal area， but no epileptiform discharge. However， a seizure was noted again and consciousness disturbance (E2 V2 M4) and the patient came to our ER. Desaturation and bilateral pneumonia were noted， intubation was performed， and she was transferred to the intensive care unit for further management.\n\n【4】At admission， intermittent generalized tonic-clonic seizures developed and fluctuated consciousness level， which subside after Lorazepam injection. The lumbar puncture was performed， CSF routine and panel of meningitis pathogens showed no evidence of CNS infection. Bloodstream with Corynebacterium species infection and sputum FilmArray concern of MDR K. pneumonia ESBL， Carbapenem wass prescribed as ID physician recommendation. Bronchoscopy was performed， and the final sputum report Burkholderia cepacia complex (Meropenem MIC 1 mg/L). We kept catheter free due to urinary tract infection with Escherichia coli (only Amikacin MIC 16mg/L). The cEEG was performed showed no epileptiform discharge. Because of the generalized dyskinesia in the cluster and intermittent agitation， we already gave her Lorazepam， charged the AEDs to Briviact with Lacosamide， tapered Madopar， and added Biperiden regularly， but to no avail. Under the impression of time-locked to Levodopa administration， we discontinued Levodopa and titrated Biperiden， but no response was noted. We then titrated a low dose Midazolam infusion， and her consciousness returned to clearness. Yo-yoing or biphasic dyskinesia was suspected，and Amantadine， Neupro patch and low dose Clozapine were administrated. The patient showed no more motor complications in the recent 72 h and we discontinued Briviact. However， an episode of involuntary movement with alert consciousness was detected， it was resolved 10 mins after the infusion of Lorazepam.HLA-B typing revealed that the patient was not a carrier of the warning gene， and we switched Lacosamide to Trileptal. The patient passed the weaning test and was extubated with smooth respiratory pattern.\n\n【5】Discussion\n\n【6】Uncontrollable movement disorders associated with the use of certain medications， especially the side effects of anti-psychiatric drugs， include dyskinesia and akathisia. Parkinsons disease is the best-known movement disorder， causing recurrent involuntary movements without disturbance of consciousness. Dyskinesia is characterized by short， twisting movements ofthe face，mouth，fingers， or extremities. Akathisia as a type of internal agitation， excessive and purposeless movement， probably rocking back and forth， striding， or making a fist repeatedly . Our patient’s clinical manifestations include unusual movements， mouth twisting， writhing movements of the four limbs， tightly closed eyes， and sweating. The movements may resemble tics corresponding to dyskinesia.\n\n【7】Ahlskog and Muenter  reported in a meta-analysis that patients who received levodopa treatment for 4 to 6 vears had about40% motor fluctuations and up to 90% median dyskinesia when treated for 9 years. In advanced disease stages of the disease， the therapeutic window of levodopa becomes narrower and the major of patients develop motor complications， which are especially more common in young onset PD. We need to reduce the levodopa to preserve the levels and avoid treatment complications such as motor and nonmotor fluctuations and Levodopa-Induced Dyskinesia (LID). Long-term motor complications of levodopa therapy were response fluctuations (hypokinetic phenomena) and involuntary movements(hyperkinetic phenomena)， such as yo-yoing or diphasic dyskinesia. In Hoehn and Yahr stage 4 or 5 patients， motor fluctuations were present in 71% and dyskinesias in 60%.\n\n【8】Fluctuations in motor symptoms of different states PD patients alternate between ON with peak-dose dyskinesia to being OFF.“ON\"the satisfactory effect of treatment for the good motor function is described. In contrast，\"OFF\"is the reduced effect oftreatment due to marked parkinsonian symptoms. However， as the disease progresses and gastric empty slowly， it can be observed to switch rapidly and unpredictably change between the “ON- and OFF-status\" of the motor status in PD patients. Sometimes referred to as “yo-yoing， possible explanations include altered pharmacodynamics as well as pharmacokinetics .\n\n【9】In addition to fluctuations， abnormal involuntary movements were also a common complication， called dyskinesia or dystonia. Our patient’s clinical symptoms appeared in the form of twisting movements involving the limbs， face， and trunk， which was closer to the diagnosis of the athetoid. Initially， the dyskinesia improved after a reduction in levodopa dosage. However， as the progress diseases， dyskinesia can occur at peak levels as well as when the effect of an individual dose is waning， causing repeat dyskinesia-improvement-dyskinesia， also called diphasic dyskinesia .\n\n【10】Medication management of motor complications includes non-ergoline dopamine receptor agonists and N-Methyl-D-Aspartate(NMDA) receptor antagonist is an adjunct in fluctuating disease. They caused a significant reduction in daily OFF times and increased ON time without troublesome dyskinesia. The Serotonin 5HT- 2A and dopamine receptor antagonist is an atypical neuroleptic， responsible for less dyskinesia or tremor， and low propensity to cause or exacerbate parkinsonism . Our patient’s previous hospitalization was treated as an epileptic seizure， and the family was also unable to provide complete information COVID-19 period， resulting in repeated hospitalization of the patient due to ineffective treatment . Only by detailed clinical manifestations and history taking will the physician be able to clarify the situation and find a targeted approach for the treatment of advanced PD complicated by motor fluctuations and dyskinesias.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 10:18:45", "endTime": "2024/09/24 10:18:53", "cost": 8.309}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:29", "update_time": "2024-09-23 18:18:53", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 18:18:44"}

The sequential PET/CT evaluation of post-infection COVID-19 in a patient with a pathological history of breast neoplasm has questioned the importance of PET/CT in tracking cancer versus scarring processes in COVID-19. It is not usual in medical practice to follow up a case with COVID-19 post-infection status by PET/CT examination， even less so by two PET/CT examinations performed at two months and three months post-infectious episode respectively， which is why the importance of publishing this article was decided.\n\n【2】Keywords： COVID-19；PET-CT； Cancer； Lung scarring\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography(PET/CT) is routinely performed in cancer patients for staging of neoplasms and assessment of response to treatment. However， FDG uptake is not completely specific for cancer and， in addition to treatment-induced inflammatory changes， a variety of infectious and benign inflammatory processes can lead to focal FDG uptake. Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography(PET/CT) used in the follow-up of a post-COVID-19 case at a short interval may pose the problem of differential diagnosis in the evaluation of the neoplastic patient .\n\n【5】This article is a clinical case report and literature review. We included a 66-year-old patient with known treated neoplastic disease who was a victim of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Ethics committee approval was obtained，and the patient signed consent for his description in this paper. Theliterature review was performed using PubMed database， using keywords such as “PET-CT， lung nodule， malignant node，COVID-19”.\n\n【6】Results\n\n【7】Patient aged 66 years， vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2， former smoker， weaned 15 years ago， with exposure to toxic chemicals for 30 years (laboratory worker).\n\n【8】She is known to have invasive ductal carcinoma G2 in the right breast radically removed in 2007by right mastectomy and axillary lymphadenectomy， chemoradiotherapy and hormone therapy， without recurrence. From the history of the disease， we note that in April 2022， the patient is diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection， and considering the personal pathological history and the potential for worsening of the disease， it is decided to administer monoclonal antibodies in a single dose， with good tolerance and favorable evolution. It is important to mention that the patient has undergone regular imaging evaluations since the time of diagnosis with breast cancer， including PET/CT ， with no lung nodular images .\n\n【9】In June 2022， the patient undergoes a PET/CT scan， for breast cancer follow-up， which does not find images of tumor recurrence in the left mammary gland， but depicts solid pulmonary nodular images， minimally metabolically active， SUV Lean Body Mass maximum 1.92， located in the dorsal segment of the left upper lobe and right lower apical， diameter 9 mm  and metabolically active adenopathy， located left upper pre-vascular ， (SUV LBM 9.80 and maximum diameter 12 mm)， infracarinal  and left pulmonary hilum(SUV LBM 8.29 and maximum diameter 20 mm) .\n\n【10】Abronchoscopy with biopsy/EBUS or mediastinoscopy is recommended at the oncological consultation， considering the high suspicion of bronchopulmonary neoplasm with secondary lymphangioma findings infracarinal (metabolically active， SUVmax 6.74，with dim 12/18 mm) and inferior paratracheal (SUVmax 3.03， dim 26/12 mm)， but with complete disappearance ofleft lesions ， which points to an inflammatory substrate of the present nodules.\n\n【11】For a certain diagnosis of pulmonary nodules， in cooperation with the oncologist， it is decided in favor of surgery with atypical right inferior lobe nodule resection and lymphadenectomy of right IV and VII nodes by right thoracoscopy， with good postoperative evolution， without complications .\n\n【12】Histopathological examination resulted as Right Lower Lobe pulmonary carcinomatous metastasis and station VII lymph node， most likely of infiltrative ductal carcinoma with mammary starting point， and station IV lymph node is described with numerous isolated and confluent minimally necrotizing granulomatous， epithelioid and giganto-epithelioid nodules (minimally necrotizing granulomatous lymphadenitis). parenchymal fragment from RLL is performed， which supports the final diagnosis of lung metastasis of ER positive， PGR positive and HER2neu negative breast carcinoma.\n\n【13】In July 2022， the patient requests， without medical indication， another PET/CT scan， which further describes the two pulmonary nodules with minimal metabolic activity ， located at the apical segment - Right Inferior Lobe (SUVmax 2.31， axial diameter max 10 mm) and superior lingular segment (SUVmax 2.05， axial diam max 9 mm) and mediastinal adenopathy  located Thepatient initiatesStreatment with IBRANCE protocol(Palbociclib-inhibitor CDK4/6) and Fulvestrant (estrogen blocker)， with favorable response.\n\n【14】Reassessment of native chest CT imaging with contrast medium at 3 months post-surgery describes nodular formations located in the left lung area with reduced size compared to previous examinations and post-lung resection status with visible fibrosis lines in the right lower lobe .\n\n【15】Discussion\n\n【16】The main clinical challenge remains to clearly differentiate infectiousandinflammatory FDG uptake from malignancy. Currently， there is no such quantifiable measurement to guide towards a diagnosis. Unfortunately， although it is an easy parameter to obtain， no absolutely reliable Standard Uptake Value (SUV) threshold has been found that can be used to clinically differentiate benign from malignant uptake due to the similar mechanism of FDG accumulation between tumor cells and white blood cells .\n\n【17】Unexpected and incidental uptake foci in oncology PET/CT are relatively common.Given the increased uptake of 18F-FDG，infectious and inflammatory responses have the potential to be misinterpreted as metastatic disease. Following analysis of more than 1，000 patients undergoing 18F-FDG PET/CT， it has been reported in the literature that more than a quarter of these scans contained foci of FDG uptake of benign origin attributed to infectious and non-infectious inflammation. Respiratory tract infections and brain infections were among the most common etiologies incidentally identified by PET/CT performed for oncological indications. The body responds to inflammatory stimuli with a cascade of events， including local hyperemia， release of proteins such as fibrin and immunoglobulins， andinfiltration of inflammatory cells.Inflammation exhibits18F-FDG uptake due to the recruitment of activated white blood cells(neutrophils and lymphocytes)， which have a high affinity for glucose transporters， particularly GLUT 1 and GLUT 3.\n\n【18】COVID-19 infection can lead to various imaging findings， as it is the great radiological mimic， as reported by Duzgun et al. It is well known that the most common imaging finding of COVID-19pneumonia is bilateral matted glass opacities accompanied by consolidation with thickening of interlobular or intralobular septa(crazy pavement pattern). Atypical findings are isolated lobar or segmental consolidation， interlobular septal thickening accompanied by pleural effusion， cavitations and solitary pulmonary nodules. Nodules represent one of the many facets of COVID-19 infection， with an incidence on CT scans of 3% to 12% in the literature .\n\n【19】Spontaneous regression of the solitary pulmonary nodule may be associated with the organization of pneumonia thathas been shown to occur secondary to COVID-19 infection. Recognition of rare imaging cases of COVID-19 infection is essential for proper diagnostic and treatment management.\n\n【20】Similar cases with complete resolution of lung nodules have been reported in the literature and are associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. One of these cases is of a 57-vear-old patient， smoker， diagnosed with COVID-19 infection， imaging evaluation by computed tomography， with the detection of a 20 mm lung nodule， irregular in the left upper lobe (a，b). To rule out a possible primary lung cancer， given the history of chronic smoking， transthoracic percutaneous needle biopsy is planned. Pre-procedural chest CT shows regression of nodule size (c)， so biopsy is postponed and re-evaluation is recommended at three months， when complete resolution of the left lung nodule is described (d)  .\n\n【21】It is unclear whether the pulmonary involvement of COVID-19in cancer patients is different from that in the general population. Therefore， the development of new pulmonary nodules in a patient with a history of malignancy requires further evaluation .\n\n【22】The occurrence of metastases with a mammary starting point at a distance of 15 years is a rare phenomenon described in the literature. Most breast cancers metastasize about two vears after the start of treatment， with another peak at 8 to 9 years. In a meta-analysis described by Dr. Rikke Norgaard， Dr. Buket Ozturk Esen and Dr. Lene Mellemkjaer， in a paper published in November 2021， following 36，924 women with breast cancer， 2，595 cases developed late metastases， 10 to 32 years after diagnosis. Women at risk for late recurrence are those with high lymph node burden， large tumor size， and estrogen receptor positivity， requiring more extensive surveillance or more aggressive treatment .\n\n【23】Approximately 75% of primary breast tumors have already spread by the time of diagnosis， seeding micrometastases at a regional or distant anatomical site. These micrometastases survive in a resting tumor state， whereby cell growth is balanced by apoptosis. Changes in cytokines， immune cells and growth factors in the tumor microenvironment leads to cessation of tumor rest， resulting in complete metastatic growth .\n\n【24】In breast cancer， understanding the mechanisms underlying cancer cell stagnation and retreatment is of crucial importance due to a particularly wide window of tumor recurrence， spanning up to two decades after diagnosis. Hypoxia， which occurs in patients with COVID-19 in the setting of respiratory distress and thrombosis， is a hallmark of micro-medial， poor prognosis of solid tumors. In breast cancer， hypoxia has been shown to be responsible for dormant cell generation by promoting expression of genes involved in cancer quiescence，drug resistance， stemness and EMT.\n\n【25】Throughout the pandemic， questions have been raised about how the SARS-CoV-2 infection， including its long-term effects， acts on cancer patients. Thus， it has been hypothesized that severe COVID-19infection may increase the risk of subsequent cancer recurrence by inducing reactivation Of Latent Cancer Cells (LCCs). In a severe form of SARS-CoV-2， pathophysiological events such as immune-mediated tissue inflammation， impaired T-cell and Natural Killer(NK) cell activity， neutrophil hyperactivation and thrombocytosis occur， which may collectively generate a temporary pro-tumorigenic microenvironment favorable to LCC reactivation. Since the beginning of the pandemic， ACE2 has been identified as the entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2. Although ACE2 has been reported to exert multiple antitumor effects， including inhibition of cancer angiogenesis and metastasis， its downregulation may itselfpromotetumor progression. Up-regulation of ACE2 causes hyperactivation of NF-kB， the most important molecule linking inflammation to cancer. NF-kB activation in cancer cells promotes proliferation， chemoresistance and invasion， while in the Tumor Microenvironment (TME) it stimulates angiogenesis and immune suppression， supporting the metastatic process Patients with the severe form of COVID-19 usually develop acute respiratory distress and Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS)， which can lead to sustained fever， edema， neurological symptoms， organ failure and shock. IL-6 plays a central role in the pathophysiology of CRS， and its high levels have been correlated with increased risk of tumor recurrence in breast cancer and head and neck cancer .\n\n【26】Recent studies have reported that NETs (Neutrophil Extracellular Traps)，activate metastasis formationby severalmechanisms，including the trapping of circulating tumor cells， activation of pro-metastatic fibroblasts and proteolytic destruction of the anti-tumorigenic factor thrombospondin-1. Importantly， NETs (Neutrophil Extracellular Traps)， have been reported to awaken dormant breast cancer cells disseminated to the lungs The association between COVID-19 and increased risk of lung metastasis in patients with prior breast cancer should lead to specific follow-up programs and personalized therapies using anti-inflammatory agents capable of interfering with immune-mediated inflammatory pathways or NETs formation in order to decrease the risk of tumor recurrence .\n\n【27】Conclusions\n\n【28】PET/CT is a very useful tool in cancer diagnosis and follow-up， due to the high sensitivity of this imaging modality. Its specificity， however， may be reduced by the presence of infectious and inflammatory traps， the COVID-19 pandemic bringing new difficulties in tumor vs. inflammatory interpretation.\n\n【29】It is important to always be alert to these false-positive results， as they can influence the diagnosis and course of patient treatment. Patient pathological history is a mandatory step in navigating PET/CT imaging.\n\n【30】Before scheduling patients for 18F-FDG PET/CT scans for various oncological purposes， we must consider sources of possible interferences， such as COVID-19 infection， considering that there is no concise protocol indicating the time required for lesion resorption. Double PET/CT examination at a two-month interval shows the fleeting nature of the inflammatory capturing lesions three months after the COVID-19 infectious episode.\n\n【31】This case presentation is intended to increase awareness of the complications that COVID-19 disease can bring. In addition to many others， the effects of the pandemic can be felt indirectly， hindering the correct diagnosis of patients and decreasing the chances of survival. More similar case reports and other descriptive articles are needed to quantify the impact the pandemic has had on this type of situation.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 11:08:17", "endTime": "2024/09/24 11:08:53", "cost": 36.226}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:29", "update_time": "2024-09-23 19:08:51", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 19:08:15"}

This study aims to classify open-access microRNA data of patients with colorectal cancer liver metastasis and without liver metastases using the XGBoost method， one of the machine learning methods， and reveal important genes that may cause liver metastases.\n\n【2】Methods： This retrospective study considered the open-access microRNA expression data of patients with colorectal cancer liver metastasis and without liver metastases. The dataset consists of miRNA data from 10 CRC tissues from patients with liver metastases and 10 CRC tissues from patients without liver metastases.XGBoost was constructed for the classification via ten-fold cross-validation.

The worldwide incidence of CRC has been rising at a 3.2% yearly rate， starting with 783，000 cases in 1999 and rising to 1.8 million by 2020. This trend is expected to persist . The improvement of diagnostic procedures and treatment modalities， such as surgery，adjuvant chemotherapies， andpalliative medicines， has resulted in a decline in CRC mortality rates in recent decades. After curative treatment， the metastasis of colorectal cancer is still a big problem， and it is the leading cause of mortality due to CRC. Tumor metastasis remains the most significant barrier to CRC treatment and prognosis. The most prevalent site of distant spread is liver metastasis， and around 15% to 25% of CRC patients will have distant metastases at the time of original diagnosis . Liver metastasis of CRC may be related to factors such as the presence of the portal vein system， which directly connects the colorectal and liver and is associated with abundant blood supply， the location of the primary tumor and its histological type .\n\n【8】Curative resection and chemotherapy are standard treatment modalities in patients with Colorectal Cancer Liver Metastasis (CCLM) . However， due to factors such as the location and size of the tumor， the presence of extrahepatic disease， unresectable disease， or comorbidities of the patients， the surgical treatment option can be applied only in 10% to 20% of the cases， and the 5-year survival rate is very low . Those who are unsuitable for surgery also have a worse prognosis. It is， therefore， necessary to find more effective targeted therapies for CCLM. Therefore， understanding the mechanisms underlying CRC and investigating the highly sensitive and specific molecules associated with metastasis， particularly during colorectal liver metastasis， is crucial to improve patient's clinical outcomes and overall survival . In this process， it is very important to understand the molecular mechanisms and to carry out purposeful studies. Although many previous studies have identified various molecules involved in the initiation and development of colorectal liver metastases， the mechanisms still remain unclear .\n\n【9】There is still no holistic understanding of the process of carcinogenesis and metastasis in CRC， and studies for the causes of metastasis have focused on limited molecular markers. Next-generation sequencing， a high-throughput technology， is widely used to detect complex genetic changes to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the molecular pathophysiology of diseases and to identify various biomarkers to determine prognosis and treatment efficacy. Thanks to these genomic technologies used， molecular mechanisms related to diseases can be illuminated， and genes，RNAs， etc.， that may be disease-related biomarkers can be detected .\n\n【10】Aiming to develop computer algorithms that can be developed with experience， machine learning aims to provide descriptive information to researchers in the analysis of large， complex datasets of computers. When exposed to new data， machine learning learns based on previous data and makes predictions about new data. In the past ten years， thanks to the availability of big datasets and increased processing power， machine learning approaches have achieved outstanding performance in a number ofresearch. Therefore， machine learning is perhaps most useful for analyzing and interpreting large genomic datasets and may be used to describe a wide variety of genomic sequence elements.\n\n【11】In this study， in order to identify microRNAs that may be biomarkers for CCLM； by making bioinformatic analyzes from an open-access microRNA dataset belonging to CCLM is aimed to model the data set formed by overexpressed RNAs with XGBoost， which is a machine learning model， and to determine the possible biomarker RNAs with the variable importance values obtained.\n\n【12】Materialand Methods\n\n【13】Data set and variables\n\n【14】This current research was conducted using data from a case-control study published by Qiaoming Zhi et al. The dataset consists of miRNA data from 10 CRC tissues from patients with liver metastases and 10 CRC tissues from patients without liver metastases. In the current study， this dataset was used to identify miRNAs differentially expressed between the two groups by bioinformatic analysis and to identify miRNAs that could be biomarkers using the machine learning method.\n\n【15】Bioinformatics analysis phase\n\n【16】For CCLM， which was examined for miRNA expression profiles， differential expression analyses were performed using the limma package available in the R programming language . Differential expression analysis is known as the statistical analysis of normalized read count data to find the quantitative differences present in expression activities in different group situations. As a result of the analysis， a gene table in order of importance and a volcano plot to visualize differentially expressed genes are obtained. Log2FC>1was used to identify upregulated genes， and log2FC<-1 to identify downregulated genes in the analyzes performed . Up-regulated miRNAs are shown in red， down-regulated miRNAs are shown in blue in the volcano plot used to visualize genes with differential regulation， and miRNAs that do not show any change in expression between the 2 groups are shown in black.\n\n【17】Modelling phase\n\n【18】The modeling phase starts with variable selection. In the bioinformatics analysis， LASSO variable selection method was used in the variable selection stage made from differently expressed miRNAs. The variable selection phase is one of the most important steps in any predictive modeling project. Basically， variable selection is the process of deciding which data/variables to include in the study while developing a statistical model. Variable selection is a feature identification process on a data set that has an effect on the dependent variable. The high dimensionality of the explanatory variables that have an effect on the dependent variable can lead to both long computation times and over-learning of the data. For this reason， before performing statistical modeling， the variables with the most important features， that is， the variables that explain the model the most， should be selected . The datasets obtained by gene expression also have very large volumes. Therefore， variable selection methods are applied before modeling with these datasets. The LASSO variable selection method used in this study imposes a constraint on the sum of the absolute values of the model parameters， and this sum must be less than a fixed value (upper limit). To achieve this， the method uses a throttling (narrowing-regulating) operation that penalizes the coefficients of the regression variables and causes some of them to drop to zero . Modeling was done with the data set obtained by the variable selection. In the modeling phase， XGBoost， which is a tree-based method from machine learning methods， was used. XGBoost is a machine learning method based on gradient boosting and decision tree methods and has found application in many areas. This method， which has a very high predictive power compared to other algorithms， is 10 times faster than other methods and includes a series of regularizations that can improve the overall performance of the model and reduce overfitting and overlearning.\n\n【19】In order to ensure model validity， the n-fold cross-validation method， one of the resampling methods， was used in this study. In this method；\n\n【20】First， the dataset is divided into n pieces， and the model is applied to n pieces.\n\n【21】In the second step， one of the n parts is used for the testing process， while the other n-1 parts are used in the training process.\n\n【22】In the last stage， the average of the values obtained from the models is evaluated for the cross-validation method.\n\n【23】Accuracy， balanced accuracy， sensitivity， specificity， positive predictive value， negative predictive value，and F1-score metrics were used to evaluate the performance obtained as a result of the modeling. Finally， in order to identify miRNAs that could be biomarkers， variable importance values were calculated， giving information about how much the input variables explain the output variable.\n\n【24】Biostatistical analysis phase\n\n【25】Shapiro Wilk test of normality was employed to determine whether the variables had anormal distribution. Data were summarized as mean ± standard deviation. Independent samples t-test was employed to compare data. p-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. IBM SPSS Statistics 25.0 program was used in the analysis.\n\n【26】The process flow diagram\n\n【27】The process flow diagram of the used models is also shown in Figure 1 for a better understanding ofthe system.\n\n【28】Results\n\n【29】There are 9 female and 11 male patients in the current study. The mean age of the patients was 63.4±11.51. While the mean age of patients without liver metastasis is 64.9 ± 5.85， the mean age of patients with metastasis is 61.9±15.50 vears.\n\n【30】When the data obtained as a result of the bioinformatics analysis were examined， 72 microRNAs with down- and 24 up-regulation were found. According to the table in which the microRNAs with the smallest adjacent P. value are listed， 4 of the first 10 microRNAs were downregulated，5 of them were upregulated， while 1 of them did not. The results obtained according to the bioinformatics analysis are tabulated in Table 1.\n\n【31】The volcano plot， where we can see all differentially expressed genes， is as follows .\n\n【32】According to the results of the biostatistical analysis performed with 23 microRNAs selected by the variable selection method， statistically significant differences were obtained between the groups with and without liver metastasis with CRC. Mentioned 23microRNAs show differences for 2 groups. Biostatistical analysis results are given in Table 2.\n\n【33】The values of the performance metrics obtained as a result of modeling with the XGBoost method are as follows .\n\n【34】The graphical presentation of the metrics is as follows .\n\n【35】According to the variable significance values obtained as a result of the modeling， the 3 microRNAs were the most differentiated microRNAs among the 2 groups. The graphic showing of these microRNAs according to the obtained variable importance values is given in Figure 4.\n\n【36】Discussion\n\n【37】CRC is still frequent cancer. Most cancers， including CRC， may have a single clonal origin in the early stages of the disease.

And it aimed to create treatments in this direction. In many studies， KRAS2， p53， p21/WAF/CEP1， CD44， COX-2， cytokeratin-19， proliferating cell nuclear antigen， MMP-9， cyclin D1， VEGF-C， and E-cadherin have been identified as biomarkers for CRC . Although these biomarkers for CRC have been identified， there is still no fully established understanding of the metastasis process. Because studies have focused on limited molecular markers .\n\n【44】Although these biomarkers for CRC have been identified， there is still no fully established understanding of the metastasis process. Because studieshave focusedonlimited molecular markers. Therefore， more comprehensive studies on molecular pathophysiology are needed to gain a more comprehensive understanding ofthe metastasis status and to determine the prognosis and treatment efficacy . Detecting complex genetic changes will be useful for identifying various biomarkers. With these identified markers， it will be possible to search for highly sensitive and specific molecules associated with metastasis， especially during colorectal liver metastasis. In fact， these studies are crucial for improving patients clinical outcomes and even survival rates.\n\n【45】Sd： Standard deviation；： Independent samples t test\n\n【46】The current study aimed to find biomarkers based on microRNAs by using machine learning techniques for CCLM and aimed to support researchers in developing treatment by revealing the genetic mechanism.\n\n【47】Liver metastasis is the leading cause of mortality in CRC patients. The treatment of advanced CCLM remains a significant challenge. Recent advancements in diagnosis and therapy have allowed clinicians to save many patients lives in the early stages of the disease， but the prognosis for patients with advanced disease or systemic metastases remains very dismal . The major obstacle to the effective treatment of CRC is metastasis， with liver metastasis being the most common cause of death. Therefore， many researchers have tried to understand the genetic characteristics of metastatic clones， since clones with metastatic potential are genetically different from Accordingtothebioinformaticanalyzes， it was determined that 72microRNAs showed different regulation in the CCLM state compared to the CCR. Of these， microRNA 4708， microRNA 4306，microRNA142， microRNA 4516， microRNA 345， id=42614， microRNA 2681， id=147834， id=148143， microRNA 33b are the microRNAs with the smallest adj p-value values and the most differentiated. When the log2FC values obtained were examined， microRNA 4708 and microRNA 4516 in CCLM had 2.54- and 2.80-fold higher gene expression than those with CRC， respectively. When the log2FC values obtained were examined， microRNA 4306， microRNA 345， id=42614， microRNA 2681， id=147834， id=148143， microRNA33b microRNAs in CCLM had 2.77， 2.14 and5.09 fold lower gene expression than those with CRC， respectively. microRNA 4306 had the same expression between the two groups.\n\n【48】Statistically significant differences were obtained between the groups with and without CCLM according to the biostatistical analyzes performed with the remaining 23 microRNAs with the choice of the variable. These selected microRNAs are microRNAs that differentiate between the 2 groups and have a distinctive feature between the 2 groups. The performance criteria values obtained by modeling 23 microRNAs with the machine learning method XGBoost were obtained as accuracy 95%， balanced accuracy 95%，\n\n【49】Sensitivity 90%， Specificity 100%， Positive predictive value 100%， Negative predictive value 90.9%， F1 score 94.7%， respectively. Based on the performance criteria， the suggested XGBoost could correctly categorize two groups of patients using an artificial intelligence technique. When the variable significance values obtained as a result ofthe modeling are examined， it can be said that 3 microRNAs are the determining microRNAs between the 2 groups. These microRNAs are microRNAs called microRNA 4306，microRNA 2115，and microRNA4708 and will be associated with the state of metastasis.\n\n【50】One study mentioned that MicroRNA (miR)-4306 is associated with tumor growth and cancer， and its relationship with CRC was investigated. According to the results obtained， it was determined that miR-4306 expression was decreased in tissues with CRC . microRNA 4708 has been investigated for many disease states such as breast cancer， pancreatic cancer and has been found to be associated with cancer .\n\n【51】In this study， the classification of patients with and without CCLM was provided using the machinelearning model. According to the results obtained from the model， microRNAs that may be possible biomarkers for CCLM have been determined. With comprehensive analyses and studies to be conducted， these microRNAs can be associated with metastasis， so patients’ care procedures can be regulated. It can be determined whether metastasis will develop or not.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 11:42:32", "endTime": "2024/09/24 11:43:01", "cost": 29.26}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:29", "update_time": "2024-09-23 19:43:02", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 19:42:32"}

There has been a rapid rise in the incidence of one such entity called Acute Invasive Fungal Rhinosinusitis (AIFRS) or Rhino-Orbital Cerebral Mucormycosis (ROCM) in the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in India， which has led to a significant health crisis， mainly associated with the administration of steroid therapy in a background of concomitant hyperglycemia. Mucormycosis is a rare， acute， life-threatening， rapidly progressive angioinvasive opportunistic infection caused by a ubiquitous group of saprophytic fungi . Rhino-orbital and rhino-cerebral forms are the commonest having a documented global fatality of around 50% with very high mortality and poor prognosis despite early diagnosis and treatment . The recent upsurge in the cases has been ascribed to the immunomodulation and metabolic compromise in post-COVID-19 patients caused by the virus， as well as due to the immunosuppressive medical therapy in the form of parenteral and oral steroids， broad-spectrum antibiotics and immunomodulators .\n\n【9】Pathophysiology\n\n【10】The portal of entry of the fungi is by inhaling the spores， which lodge in the upper airway， nasopharynx， nasal cavity， and paranasal sinuses， and finally， release hypha after sporulation. The initial infection commences in the nasal cavity， presents as acute sinusitis， and then rapidlyprogresses into pan-sinusitis. After the hypha invade the walls of the blood vessels and lymphatic's， the angioinvasive process is initiated. There is the contiguous spread of infection to the paranasal sinuses， palate， orbit， craniofacial soft tissue， the base of the skull， and finally into the brain parenchyma， leading to aggressive necrosis， infarction， and ischemia of the involved tissues， and vascular thrombosis. Extension into the orbit is along the weak medial orbital wall， ethmoid sinus groups， and the nasolacrimal duct. At the same time， involvement of the brain occurs through the superior orbital fissure， the network of vessels， the cribriform plate， and via the perineural spread. The pterygopalatine and infratemporal fossa are critical for spreading an infection to craniofacial soft tissues and at the skull base. Vascular compromise leads to ischemic brain infarcts and other complications like cavernous sinus involvement and contributes to high morbidity and mortality .\n\n【11】Patients and Methods\n\n【12】A prospective study was done during and following SARS-Coronavirus 2 COVID-19 infection in India from April 2021 to February 2022.\n\n【13】Contrast-Enhanced MRI Protocol on 1.5T GE SIGNATM Artist Scanner.

Contrast-enhanced T1W with fat-suppressed sequences through the Paranasal sinus， bilateral orbits， and brain after Intravenous injection of Gadopentetate dimeglumine (0.1 mmol/kg) were acquired. 3D TOF MR Angiography was obtained whenever there was evidence of angioinvasion. Images were evaluated for signal intensity， contrast enhancement characteristics， and extent.\n\n【15】Results\n\n【16】MRI of 32 patients showed mainly involvement of the paranasal sinuses (100% of patients)， nasal cavity (56% of the patients)， orbits(47% ofthe patients)，premaxillary，retroantral& pterygopalatine fossa(56% of the patients)， skull base (34% of the patients) and intracranial spread (25% of the patients).

Contrast MRI is the modality of choice in the early diagnosis， assessment of disease extent， prognosis， planning and guiding surgical resection， and identification of complications. A four-stage system to describe the extent and severity of the disease based on clinical assessment， imaging， and nasal endoscopy has been proposed in recent literature. However， most peer-reviewed iournals describe the condition based on anatomical involvement， viz. sinonasal disease， orbital， skull base， craniofacial soft tissue， and intracranial involvement .\n\n【26】Safder et al.  published two cases， one of a 66-year-old man and another 12-year-old girl with acute fungal rhinosinusitis. They found soft tissue thickening showing heterogeneous T2 hypointense signal and heterogenous peripheral enhancement with central non-enhancing areas and called it the ‘Black turbinate’sign. In our cas we found that 15 out of 32 patients (47 %) showed black turbinate signs making it significant .\n\n【27】Conclusion\n\n【28】Contrast-enhanced MRI plays a crucial role in detecting and diagnosing AIFRS， assessing the extent of involvement， delineating the spread of disease， guiding treatment protocols， and predicting and identifying the complications.

In this way， the clinical case study strategy has been part of the didactics that enables the acquisition of specific functions in a clinical environment， the development of competences and an understanding of the culture and values that affect society.\n\n【2】Keywords： Didactic strategy； Clinical case study； Competences； Social relevance\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Within dentistry we can find various specialties， such as pediatric dentistry， surgery， periodontology， among others. Dentomaxillary pathology is one of them and includes the study of diseases and their symptoms， together with anomalies， variations and syndromes.\n\n【5】There is a developmental anomaly/disorder called hyperdontia， in which there is an increase in the number ofteeth. This anomaly occurs in odontogenesis， specifically in the bud stage， where the physiological process is affected specifically in the initiation phase， generating the aforementioned hyperdontia.\n\n【6】This dental anomaly is prevalent from 0.1% to 3.8% in whites and 76% to 86% of the cases are only 1 supernumerary tooth； 95% in the maxillary anterior sector， generally in non-syndromic hyperdontia， with a ratio H：M=2：1 and associated with macrodontia in males.\n\n【7】The clinical case， from Martinez  also called a case report， is known everywhere as a type of biochemical publication and is relevant in all areas of health， as mentioned by Romani  because it is a contribution to education， within the scientific field. Thus， in different studies，such as Villanueva， the idea is developed that the study and development of clinical cases increase situatedlearning， clinical studies facilitate understanding， logical reasoning and also the management of uncertainty.\n\n【8】This learning strategy allows the evaluation of the student's performance and Vega  highlights the impact of the strategy because it collaborates with the improvement of different social shortcomings， such as realizing some latent needs in society regarding health in the area in which the activity is developed， clinical case strategy.\n\n【9】Ordofiez  mentions that the clinical case study serves as a reliable scientific document to be read and studied by undergraduate students， it is a document that serves as an example for the understanding of content that presents difficulties for comprehension.\n\n【10】Videla CB， Burgos AH. Experience in the Training of Dental Students： Clinical Case Study on Hyperdontia. Clin Case Rep Int. 2023； 7：1467.\n\n【11】In studies on didactic strategies used for university students， the idea of holistic learning is that which incorporates both the competence and ability to perform the task， but also in a relevant， creative and innovative way. The reduction oflearning load through instruction is accurate because it must revalue knowledge based on meaningful experience， where the student develops attitude and skill. Where multiple analyses can be generated with respect to what is presented in the clinical case. In other words， between the teacher and the student， educational action is developed through experience translated into the assimilation of knowledge. The exercise carried out by an undergraduate student through the clinical case brings them closer to reality and prepares them to deal with problems through their competences.\n\n【12】Case Presentation\n\n【13】Male patient aged 21 years， ASA II， with no personal history of morbidities， no surgical history， with a family history of morbid hypertension. A moderate smoker， he came for assessment due to spontaneous consultation， with the reason for consultation \"I have a tooth on the side of my teeth， at the bottom\". Data collected： The last visit to the dentist was in 2019 for extraction of a supernumerary tooth without complications. The patient had poor dental hygiene， with an unspecified brushing technique， no flossing， a diet high in carbohydrates， sugars and soft drinks.\n\n【14】With regard to the dental history， we can highlight the extraction of another supernumerary tooth at tooth level 4.4 on the lingual side， bleeding on brushing and bruxism.\n\n【15】Within the segmental examination， a variation in the trajectory of mandibular movement was observed， with corrected deviation to the right and a unilateral left click noise， without pain on palpation or movement. As for lymph node palpation， only the submandibular nodes were palpable， unilateraly， on the right side， less than 1 cm， with a soft， mobile consistency and the presence of discomfort to the touch. The rest of the nodes were not palpable.\n\n【16】With regard to the dental anomaly of the patient， who presented a rudimentary paramolar supernumerary tooth； of a smaller size， molariform and located in the mandibular region， on the lingual side in the area of the premolar teeth， we can highlight the importance and responsibility we have as dentists to recognize and detect pathologies in our patients. This is one of the many examples of how elementary training is， in order to achieve correct care and good dental practice.\n\n【17】Intraoral examination\n\n【18】Lips unaltered， mucosa of the alveolar ridge， the rudimentary supernumerary tooth is located between teeth 3.4 and 3.5. The gingiva is reddish in color， rounded margino-papillary shape， smooth， shiny and dotted surface， orange peel in some areas. It is mostly positioned on the LAC， with an enlarged， thick biotype and gingival recession from canine to lower canine .\n\n【19】Radiographic interpretation： Coronal slices every 1 mm 100um thick and axial slices every 1 mm 100 um thick at 1：1 scale are observed .\n\n【20】P.21： Erupted， rotated， in a straight position， towards vestibular， with root bifurcation of the middle third of the root towards apical. Normal periapical.\n\n【21】On the lingual side， presence of a supernumerary， rudimentary， erupted tooth under the occlusal plane. With straight root， in intimate relation with the numerary piece without generating rhizolysis， presents a single straight， conoid root.\n\n【22】P.27 and28：Erupted，P.28 slightly rotated，rootstraight，periapical normal. Immediate tooth to vestibular table. Note the presence of a rudimentary supernumerary piece on the lingual side， in intraosseous development， with apical third in formation. Normal pericoronal sac.

A discussion that has been gaining attention is the interaction of COVID-19 infection and non-communicable diseases in populations marked by deep patterns of social inequality， whose social and economic disparity further aggravates the effects of each disease separately， in fact configuring a syndemic . This adverse scenario amplified and highlighted pre-existing failures and themes to the need for innovative initiatives . Building responses from the same approaches and concepts are possibly replicating the same mistakes， strengthening what is already known， and amplifying the inequalities that reside in the absences and gaps in the action. The impact on health systems was devastating， significantly affecting health care for non-communicable diseases. According to WHO， about42% of the countries have had their health services for cancer treatment partially or completely discontinued . Both the discontinuation of treatment and the suspension of screening for new cases of cancer， combined with the economic crisis， will result in an increase in mortality rates， particularly the ones which are preventable cases .\n\n【2】In response to this， the European Cancer Organization prepared the document called 7-Point Plan to Address the Urgency and Build Back Better ，among which some topics will be addressed for an innovative proposal to strengthen CCP：\n\n【3】Urgently Address the Cancer Backlog\n\n【4】It is necessary to analyze that the repressed demand has existed even before COVID-19 and increased its magnitude mainly from situations sensitive to the social determinants of health. Understanding and reformulating the lines of cancer care， from primary health care， a fundamental strategy in the case of cervical cancer， using social technologies such as Health Promotion (HP) with sensitive management arrangements planned for vulnerable groups， can transform this scenario of reconstriction.\n\n【5】Restore the Confidence of European Citizens and Patients in Cancer Health Services\n\n【6】In this case， advocacy is essential， evoking the need for more investments in public health services， which are being and will be essential not only in treatment， but also in health surveillance and research. This trust must be re-established by strengthening citizenship and ethical commitments guided by science and evidence-based policymaking with a focus on research and communication(anti-fake news) and allocating adequate resources on a sustainable basis for maintaining a national capacity for responding to future pandemics.\n\n【7】Tackle Medicines， Products and Equipment Shortages\n\n【8】In addition to measures such as the urgent reformulation of the manufacturing capacity and development of the economic-industrial health care complex in the country， as in Brazil . Important themes need to be emphasized， such as the commercial determinates of health ， wherein cancer， the lobby for new treatments without due scientific evidence fiercely compete for incorporation in national health systems， such as high-cost immunobiological drugs.Strengthening Health Technology Assessment mechanisms is essential to maintain the budgetary integrity of the public health sector.\n\n【9】Address Cancer Workforce GapsAcross the European Continent\n\n【10】There is an urgent need to promote actions to strengthen national and international technical cooperation for the qualification of health professionals， not only in the clinic area of health care but also in the management of health systems. Investing in multidisciplinarystrategies to fortify the capacity and sensitivity of health care from different fields of knowledge is an important action to innovate the ways to reconstruct CCP. In screening strategies， from the perspective of HP， investing in local capacities with field agents， as it is the case in Brazil with community health agents who have a capacity for the dialogue and the generation of bonds between users and health services.\n\n【11】Employ 7 Innovativvee TechnologiesS 8and Solutions to Strengthen Cancer Systems and Provide Optimal Care to Cancer Patients The criticism presented here is the capture of technologies by a concept of commodity and materiality (hard technology). To overcome the obstacles to innovation in the health and cancer agenda， a movement to humanize technologies is needed. Therefore， HP actions that necessarily depend on a soft relational technology are important to recover the construction of comprehensive health that empowers local actors and responds to the real needs of the territory. We highlight here the important movement of technological innovation (hard) in the screening from the HPV-tests that allied with strategies to maximize the opportunity for early detection such as the combined algorithm (traditional + HPV-test) from Turkey and the use of self-collection observed in Argentina  are cost-effective arrangements for public health systems . However， this arrangement of hard technologies will not be effective if soft technologies that act within the management of care lines are not implemented. They are the ones that guarantee a harmonization of communication between the points of the health care network from primary care level， immunization，secondary and diagnostic tests and tertiary carelevel (oncology，complex surgery) ensuring the continuity of the treatment flow. Therefore， the mutual investment among these technologies constituted a differential for the BBB strategy.\n\n【12】Embed Data Collection and the Rapid Deployment of CancerIntelligenceto Enhance Policy Delivery\n\n【13】In the era of hyper-connectivity， it is essential to build integrated care data collection strategies and clinicalprotocols with granular data and specific information for each level of health action. The presence of the private sector needs to be incorporated into monitoring and evaluation projects， especially when it comes to providing services to the public sector. Telemedicine has made great strides in this scenario and must be effectively incorporated into all public health strategies.\n\n【14】In conclusion， BBB needs an epistemological leap in the modes of clinical practice/health systems management and also in the aspects of implementing programs and policies. Strengthening not only technical but also ethical and political aspects will be essential in the implementation of innovative projects that fill the gaps evidenced by the syndemic.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 10:55:27", "endTime": "2024/09/24 10:55:35", "cost": 7.966}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:29", "update_time": "2024-09-23 18:55:33", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 18:55:25"}

One of the most easily quantifiable and consequently high profile issues has been the impact on surgical waiting lists. Efforts to ameliorate the impact on the throughput of the worst prognosis cancer patients were often at the expense of elective cases and the resulting increase in waiting times and numbers is dramatic reaching record levels in many cases. The emergence of Omicron， the latest SARS-CoV-2 variant has again stressed the NHS with further elective surgery cancellations anticipated . We examined the elective HPB surgery cancellations during the 4 “surges’ to identify the underlying causes. A single centre， retrospective analysis of booked cases in Leicester General Hospital was carried out for five， three month intervals， corresponding to the pre-pandemic period， and the 4 surges. There was an 84.6% increase in the number of HPB elective surgery cancellations during the 15' wave (March to May 2020) when compared with the period preceding the COVID outbreak (October to December 2019). There were less cancellations during the 2nd(October to December 2020) and 3rd waves (May to July 2021) with a 21.1% increase and 15.4%decrease compared with the pre-COVID period respectively. Notably however the most recent 44Omicron wave (November to January 2021) again saw a marked increase again to first wave levels of 76.9% . When stratified by the reason for cancellation， the largest contributing factor during the 1 wave was hospital infrastructure related issues (44 of the total 96 cancellations). This is consistent with findings at other centers across the UK during the same period， with hospitals unable to cope with the unprecedented demands . In contrast， during the 4h surge the principal issue was the lack of crucial staff both numerically and of the appropriate skill-mix consistent with large number of NHS staff being infected with the highly transmissible new variant or in self-isolation . Pandemic the 2n and 3 waves of the pandemic saw a return to cancellation rates similar to pre-levels. Possibly due to strategies implemented by the hospital to mitigate COVID infections during elective surgery intending to restore throughput albeit still at a reduced rate compared with the pre-pandemic period . Also evident in the 1and 4 waves were cancellations by patients， possibly reflecting their reluctance to attend hospitals due to strict lockdown measures during the first wave and the highly infective nature of the omicron strain during the 4 wave. This study demonstrates the effect of the COVID pandemic on elective surgery in an HPB surgical unit. It also demonstrates that Omicron， although less severe than previous variants has had a similar impact due to its increased transmissibility and effect on staff as well as patients. The consensus among the scientific community is that we should expect the emergence of further variants， the impact of which will be determined by their virulence and transmissibility . This scenario mandates solutions and policies to prevent waiting lists spiraling out of control and cancer care deteriorating.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 10:53:46", "endTime": "2024/09/24 10:54:34", "cost": 48.092}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:29", "update_time": "2024-09-23 18:54:32", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 18:53:44"}

The patient was treated with antihypertensive drug (nicardipine) and corticosteroid supplementation(Hydrocortisone). ClinicalL6evolution was favorable with the degression ofhydrocortisone doses and cessation of nicardipine. The causality assessment score was I2B3.\n\n【9】Discussion\n\n【10】We presented herein a case of drug misuse where the drug， in this case a topical corticosteroid， was taken for reasons other than why it was prescribed and with an incorrect dose， with major consequences.\n\n【11】In fact， prolonged exogenous corticosteroid administration can lead to several adverse reactions such as CS， cataract， hypertension， dyslipidemia， skin atrophy， failure to thrive， Hypothalamic Pituitary Adrenal (HPA) axis suppression， striae， glaucoma， and infections .\n\n【12】Iatrogenic CS is frequent following prolonged administration of oral or parenteral corticosteroids， but it is rare after topical corticosteroid use.

Histology of the tumor in the lower gastric body was adenocarcinoma with papillary or tubular structures in the mucosal area. However， in the submucosal area， majority of tumor cells was changed to clear cells resembling cytotrophoblasts as seen in trophoblastic neoplasms. Furthermore， solitary growth of the spindle cells resembling Syncytiotrophoblast cells was apparent in the layers of muscularis propria and subserosa. Immunohistochemically， syncytiotrophoblast type cells were positive for beta-subunit of Human Chorionic Gonadotropin(HCG). Three out of 28 regionallymph nodes had metastases of the neoplasm with adenocarcinoma as well as choriocarcinomatous components. The tumor on the posterior wall of pylorus was a tubular adenocarcinoma only recognized in the mucosal layer. The tumor did not contain any trophoblastic components.\n\n【2】Choriocarcinomatous differentiation of the gastric carcinoma was suggested to occur during the down growth of the neoplasm. Present gastric choriocarcinoma supports the concept that gastric choriocarcinoma arises from alternate differentiation pathway of adenocarcinoma. Such synchronous occurrence of double carcinomas in the stomach may also suggest a higher oncogenesis stage of the stomach of this woman.\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Stomach may be a common site oforigin of non-gonadal， non-gestational trophoblastic tumors， although gastric cancers with germ cell tumor components are uncommon. Choriocarcinoma， hepatoid adenocarcinoma， carcinoma with enteroblastic differentiation， and York sac tumor like carcinoma are known as special type of gastric cancer. Choriocarcinoma is a trophoblastic tumor as a rare primary miscellaneous tumor in the stomach. It is known that some of gastric cancers have choriocarcinomatous components . Regarding the pathogenesis of gastric choriocarcinoma， retro-differentiation or dedifferentiation theory has been accepted upon the observation that gastric choriocarcinoma are found with coexistent adenocarcinomas or adenocarcinoma components . In a few tumors， the primary gastric lesion was pure adenocarcinoma and the choriocarcinomatous differentiation only became manifest in the metastasis . Certainly， it is plausible that since all cells contain the entire genetic material for the whole organism， cancers may differentiate in unusual directions， including even the formation of malignant trophoblasts. However， precise mechanisms for the trophoblastic differentiation of gastric cancers are still unknown. Presently， we report a unique case with a carcinoma exerting choriocarcinomatous differentiation and another separated adenocarcinoma in the stomach. Significance of such synchronous gastric carcinomas particularly for the point ofassociation between tumor growth and differentiation is discussed.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】A78-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital for evaluation of epigastralgia. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed existence of a type 3 tumor on the greater curvature of lower gastric body and a type 0-IIa+IIc lesion on the posterior wall in pylorus. By biopsy， both lesions were diagnosed as adenocarcinomas， suggesting that the stomach had double cancers with different stages. The distal gastrectomy with D2 lymph node dissection  was performed. The Papillary or tubular growth of the neoplastic cells are recognized in the surface area. In the submucosal area (lower half)， are growing the tumor cells with clear cytoplasm. A few elongated cells with amphophilic cytoplasm are mixed in these areas (HE-stain). A high-power view of the clear cell population showing coexistence of dark cells with more pleomorphic nuclei(insert). tumor mass on the greater curvature of lower gastric body measured40 mm x 40 mm was a nodular， irregular， gray-pink appearance having central ulceration with a raised rolled margin. The neoplastic mass on the posterior wall in pylorus measured 18 mmx18 mm was a polypoid lesion with surface erosions； type 0-IIa+IIc . On the operation， the tumors looked to be localized in the stomach wall and metastases to lymph nodes and other organs were not confirmed. On microscopy， the surface area of the neoplasm on the greater curvature of lower gastric body exhibited common features of adenocarcinoma with papillary or tubular growth. However， the main neoplastic cells infiltrating laminapropria and occupying submucosal space were changed to those composed of single nucleus， vacuolated or clear cytoplasm. They were relatively uniform population and lacked typical glandular structures. Less number of bizarre cells resembling syncytiotrophoblast cells with more pleomorphic nuclei， deeply eosinophilic to basophilic cytoplasm and less distinct cell membranes was mixed with the clear cell population . The tumor infiltrated through the muscularis propria into the sub serous space. In the layers of muscularis propria and subserosal area， solitary growth of syncytiotrophoblast type cells which were encountered infrequently with clear cells in the submucosal area， was often recognized . Immunoreaction of HCG was localized exclusively to these syncytiotrophoblast type cells . Three out of 28 regional lymph nodes had metastatic lesions of the neoplasm. Interestingly， the metastatic lesions also contained adenocarcinomatous as well as choriocarcinomatous components with immunoreaction of HCG. Immunostaining of Cytokeratin(CK) 7 was strongly positive for all neoplastic cells in the all layers of the stomach. However， CK 20 was negative in any tumor cells. Furthermore， Carcinoembryonic Antigen (CEA) was clearly positive in the cells of adenocarcinomatous features. Production of Alpha-Fetoprotein (AFP) was not recognized in any tumor cells of this tiimor.\n\n【7】Histology ofthetumorlocated on theposterior wall of pylorus was a combined type of well differentiated and moderately differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma . The carcinoma was growing only in the mucosal layer. It is assumed that the tumor in the pylorus had multifocal origin， since the carcinoma was a combined type andsome normal epithelium was remained among the neoplastic epithelium. The tumor did not contain any trophoblastic components. HCG， CEA and AFP were not immunoreactive. CK 7 was partially positive in the tumor tissues， although CK 20 was negative.\n\n【8】Postoperatively， the patient has been stable， and no evidence showing possibility of malignancy in other organs including ovary and uterus was recognized. She had taken S-1 for six months as adjuvant chemotherapy . The recurrence and metastases of the gastric cancer have not been recognized for a year. However， the patient unfortunately died two years after the operation due to the abdominal dissemination of the neoplasm.\n\n【9】Discussion\n\n【10】Presently， HCG positive syncytiotrophoblast type cells came into existence mainly in the layers of muscularis propria and subserosa， not in the mucosal area where was present only the cells with features of adenocarcinoma. Thus， choriocarcinomatous differentiation is suggested to occur during the down growth of the tumor. In this case， typical mix of cytotrophoblast and syncytiotrophoblastic elements as seen in representative choriocarcinomas was not apparent. However， clear cells lacking HCG activity often coexisted with syncytiotrophoblast type cells in the submucosal area. Furthermore， morphology ofthese cells resembles cytotrophoblasts of trophoblastic neoplasms. Accordingly。appearance of such cell population was suggested to be an evidence for the choriocarcinomatous differentiation of the adenocarcinoma.\n\n【11】Cytogenetic study on the gastric choriocarcinoma also supports the theory that gastric choriocarcinoma arises from alternate differentiation pathway of adenocarcinoma . Although， HCG-producing cells were not confirmed in the normal antrum mucosa in this study， some authors reported presence of immunoreactive cells against beta subunit of HCG in the neck region of normal antral mucosa . Such specific feature of the stomach might be related to the choriocarcinomatous differentiation.\n\n【12】In this case， synchronous development of two separated carcinomas was present in the stomach of the woman. Furthermore， the intramucosal carcinoma in the pre-pylorus was suggested to be multifocal. There is evidence that some of larger early gastric carcinomas may result from collision of smaller neoplasms . Thus， existence of multiple cancers in the stomach of this woman implies a higher oncogenesis stage of this organ. The concept of field cancerization is recognized in different human organs. Regarding the mechanism of field cancerization of human stomach， genetic instability in the mucosal cells is suggested to relate . Meanwhile， McDonald et al.  reported from the analysis using mitochondrial DNA mutations that human gastric body units are clonal and contain multiple multipotential stem cells， thereby mutated gastric stem cells spread widely within the stomach. In the present case， the patient developed two separated gastric carcinomas， one of which accompanied choriocarcinomatous differentiation. Similar case with double carcinomas of the stomach is reported by Eom et al. Recently， collision tumor of choriocarcinoma and small cell carcinoma of the stomach was reported by Fukuda et al. In the present case， the carcinoma with choriocarcinomatous differentiation showed the staining pattern of CK 7 positive and CK 20 negative. Similar staining pattern of cytokeratin is also confirmed in a gastric carcinoma with choriocarcinomatous differentiation . CK 7 is evaluated as an accurate intracellular marker to assess the purity of human placental villous trophoblast . Choriocarcinomatous differentiation may be concerned with function of some cytokeratin， although evidence is uncertain.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 10:18:22", "endTime": "2024/09/24 10:18:46", "cost": 24.322}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:29", "update_time": "2024-09-23 18:18:44", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 18:18:19"}

They can reach enormous sizes and cause varied complications. Kasabach-Merritt syndrome is a constellation of a hemangioma inclusive of endothelial abnormalities， which lead to a consumptive coagulopathy and subsequent thrombocytopenia. Although rare， serious complications are present yielding a mortality rate of10% to 37%.80% of cases occur in the first year of life with 0.3% of infants with hemangiomas affected. The treatment aims to control the coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia as well as eradicate the hemangioma. Different treatment approaches are present inclusive of surgical and non-surgical techniques of which systemic corticosteroids， irradiation and immune-suppressors are an option. Surgery is limited to cases of symptomatic and complicated presentations. Although not simple， enucleation is curative usually. Here， we present a 53-year-old man with giant hemangiomas causing KMS.\n\n【2】Keywords： Hemangiomas； Liver； Kasabach-Merritt Syndrome (KMS)\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Being first diagnosed in 1940 by Haig Haigouni Kasabach and Katharine Krom Merritt， who had been taking care of an infant with a giant hemangioma and thrombocytopenia purpura， Kasabach Merritt Syndrome (KMS) is a rare， but serious constellation of a hemangioma within which exist endothelial malformations that cause a consumptive coagulopathy leading to a thrombocytopenia. Such lesions exist typically superficial and solitary in a male infant， which represent 80% of cases while adult KMS exists in 20% of cases where the hemangioma exists in internal organs such as the liver . It is well documented that the most common benign tumors of the liver are cavernous hemangiomas. Those larger than 4 cm are termed giant hemangiomas. With the advantage of reduced blood loss and virtually ability to preserve all viable liver tissue， surgical resection is the typical usually curative treatment approach， which is preserved for complicated and symptomatic cases . Here， we present a 53-year-old man with giant hemangiomas causing KMS.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 53-year-old Iraqi man， previously diagnosed with ITP (Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura) in 1990 treated irregularly by prednisone without sustained response， and DVT (Deep Vein Thrombosis) in 1992 treated by anti-vitamin K， presented in April 2018 for second opinion about his asymptomatic persistent thrombocytopenia. For 5 months before presentation， despite treatment with prednisone (50 mg) and azathioprine (100 mg)， the patient had platelet count ranging between 5000/mm to 20000/mmwith no clinical symptoms.\n\n【7】The patient is a non-smoker， non-alcoholic with negative history of diabetes mellitus， hypertension and coronary artery disease. The clinical exam was normal with no signs of bleeding. The patient was afebrile， conscious， oriented and cooperative.\n\n【8】At presentation， the complete blood count revealed 27，000 platelets/mm’， normal white blood cell count (6700/mm’) and hematocrit of 41%. Bone marrow aspirate showed hyper cellularity and normality in the three cell lineages. The physical examination was normal.\n\n【9】An abdominal US performed at presentation showed a very heterogeneous poorly limited hypo-echoic nodule formation diffuse through the liver . Abdominal MRI  revealed two large liver masses both showing peripheral enhancement after gadolinium injection. The first is a well-defined 13.5 cm mass of right hepatic lobe involving segments VII and VI. The 2n is a sub-capsular mass of segment VIII and IV of 10 cm size with adjacent smaller 2.5 cm nodular lesions of segment IV and III.\n\n【10】As part of complete laboratory workup， anticardiolipin antibodies were quantified and revealed positive suggestive of antiphospholipid syndrome while liver findings are typically suggestive of adult KMS. In addition， PCR was done for CMV nucleic acids that have proved2.96-log copies/ml. No treatment was held as the patient returned back to Iraq with the diagnosis ofKMS and recommendation for CMV treatment (probably secondary the ongoing immunosppressive treatment)， and consideration of surgical approach.\n\n【11】Discussion\n\n【12】Kasabach-Merritt results in a consumptive coagulopathy  secondary to platelet trapping and aggregation within a specific type of hemangioma， and can have a high mortality rate ranging between1% to 37% . In infants， the hemangiomas are typical confined to the skin， yet they can present in retroperitoneal organs such as the mediastinum， the pelvis， visceral organs， or the mesentery. This patient presented with a giant liver hemangioma and asymptomatic thrombocytopenia. Although anticardiolipin antibodies proved positive giving indication of antiphospholipid syndrome， without repeated laboratory testing of anti-b2 glycoprotein-I antibody of IgG and/or IgM isotype and/or IgG or IgM subtype of anticardiolipin antibodies， it is recommended to avoid APLS diagnosis. The positive result of these antibodies does not certify ultimate diagnosis of APLS. In the presence of a giant hemangioma in the liver correlating with laboratory result of thrombocytopenia， and absence of other clinical symptoms including rash， skin patches， repeated episodes of DVT and PE， Kasabach Merritt syndrome is more probable. In addition， treatment with prednisone， anti-vitamin-k and azathioprine has not proved effective which verifies suggestions ofKMS over APLS.\n\n【13】Management of this case of KMS mandates non-surgical approach. First line treatments are vincristine and corticosteroid therapy. The angiogenic character of Kasabach-Merritt syndrome indicates that chemotherapy is a logical treatment which has been proven effective in a multicenter study in the United States . Enjolras et al. have reported that several steroid non responders show dramatic response to vincristine.\n\n【14】Trails with variable results have been made for alternative therapies， includinginterferon a-2a and 2b， radiation therapy and chemotherapeutic agents such as actinomycin. The most promising recent option available for treatment of infantile hemangiomas is oral solutions of propranolol .\n\n【15】Surgical approach remains a mainstay in the treatment of ir：symptomatic and complicated KMS cases . This approach is recommended for single cutaneous lesions or multiple lesions in the spleen (splenectomy) or liver (wedge resection/hepatectomy). It is proved to be the only curative treatment of KMS. In this patient， resection has two major advantages： Minimal blood loss and preservation of virtually all-viable liver tissue .", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 11:44:49", "endTime": "2024/09/24 11:44:54", "cost": 4.897}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:29", "update_time": "2024-09-23 19:44:54", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 19:44:49"}

Vedolizumab， a gut-selective monoclonal antibody to the a437 of integrin， has been used in such patients， but data on its efficacy are limited. Our case suggests the efficacy and safety of vedolizumab as induction therapy in CARP patient without a previous experience with anti-TNF agents. Larger studies with a higher number of patients are required to confirm these findings.\n\n【2】Keywords： Vedolizumab； Chronic antibiotic-refractory puchitits； Ulcerative Colitis\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Ulcerative Colitis (UC) is a chronic disease ofthe colon and rectum. Primarytreatment is medical therapy. Restorative total proctocolectomy with Ileal Pouch-Anal Anastomosis (IPAA) is one of the surgical modalities used to manage patients with refractory UC or develop severe complications such as colonic perforation， hemorrhage， or toxic megacolon. The ileal pouch serves as an internal reservoir of feces in the absence of rectum. Many patients develop long-term complication so called pouchitis with an estimated incidence ranging from 46% to 82%， which includes a range of symptom severity such as abdominal cramping， pelvic pressure， and increased stool frequency with urgency， to more debilitating symptoms including abdominal pain， rectal bleeding， disorder defecation and incontinence . Pouchitis is a nonspecific inflammation in the Ileoanal Pouch Anastomosis (IPAA). The pathophysiology of pouchitis remains poorlyunderstood. Gut microbiota have an important role in fact increased bacterial levels and ileal reservoir dysbiosis appear to be major contributors . Pouchitis may be difficult to treat as well as have a negative impact on the quality of life in these patients. Since dysbiosis is a key factor for pouchitis development， there is evidence for a therapeutic role of probiotics  (i.e.， VSL#3 was able to prevent a relapse during a follow-up period of 9 months) and antibiotics. Antibiotics therapy's， particularly ciprofloxacin and metronidazole， are the mainstay of treatment for acute pouchitis after having excluded other diagnoses (infections， Crohn’s disease of the pouch， ischemia and irritable pouch) . However， about 10% to 15% of patients with acute pouchitis do not respond to these treatments and develop chronic pouchitis， which is defined by symptoms persisting for more than 4 weeks. These patients often require prolonged courses of antibiotics combinates with steroid therapy (budesonide) ， immunomodulators (azathioprine) ， and mesalamines with varying efficacy. CARP is diagnosis when patients do not respond to a 2-week course of ciprofloxacin， metronidazole， or rifaximin for pouchitis . CARP is one of the most common causes of pouch failure.\n\n【5】Patient information\n\n【6】In our patient， a 52-year-old Caucasian male， restorative proctocolectomy had become necessary 28 years ago in severe refractory ulcerative colitis. Ileoanal Pouch Anastomosis (IPAA) was performed in 1999. Pouchitis was first diagnosed in 2020.\n\n【7】Timeline\n\n【8】In August 2021， he developed a chronic diarrhea with up to 30 to 40 liquid (including 6 nightly) stools， accompanied with blood and mucus， associated with diffuse abdominal pain and bloating affecting his quality of life.\n\n【9】Diagnostic assessment\n\n【10】Laboratory work-up revealed Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR)， C-Reactive Protein(CRP) and stool calprotectin with no abnormalities. He denied sudden weight gain or weight loss. Endoscopy showed inflammation， ulcerations， edema and mucous exudates in the pouch and in the afferent ileal limb. In particular，linear ulcerations were present in the pouch， circular ulcerations in the ileal mucosa. Histology confirmed the active phase of ileal ulcerative chronic inflammation combined with signs of regeneration (fibrosis).\n\n【11】Therapeutic intervention\n\n【12】He started probiotic therapy， with VSL#3， but without successful clinical effects. Then he was prescribed metronidazole，from 250 mgto500 mg orally two times daily. After many therapeutic interventions with metronidazole， the patient was unable to tolerate it. He was prescribed ciprofloxacin 500 mg orally two times daily， but without successful clinical effects. In the end he was prescribed ECN Nissle capsule and dipropionate Beclomethasone， from 5 mg to 10 mg orally one time daily， which developed corticosteroid resistant.\n\n【13】Therefore， this severe flare of pouchitis was refractory to metronidazole， Ciprofloxacin，VSL#3， ECN NissleeCapsule， dipropionate beclomethasone and mesalamine. Stool studies for clostridium difficile， viruses， and bacteria were negative. Endoscopy and Histology showed no improvement. For this reason， the patient was switched to anti-integrin therapy and showed sustained clinical and endoscopic response to Vedolizumab 300 mg i.v. at weeks 0， 2， 6， and every 8 weeks.\n\n【14】Follow up and outcomes\n\n【15】After four doses， pouch and ileal ulcerations had healed completely and edema and mucous exudates were no longer present. C-Reactive Protein and stool calprotectin were also negative. Clinically， the patient is now in good condition，reports about 15 daily stools without any abdominal discomfort.\n\n【16】Discussion\n\n【17】Biological therapy such as anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)(infliximab， adalimumab) agents ，vedolizumab or ustekinumab are some ofthe options used to treat chronic pouchitis. Vedolizumab is a monoclonal antibody that selectively blocks gut lymphocyte trafficking by interacting with a4B7 heterodimer . The key to understanding the potential efficacy of vedolizumab is based on the fact that dysbiosis contributes to the attraction of leukocytes that will undergo adhesion by the integrin-MAdCAM interaction . However， the effect of vedolizumab treatment on Chronic Antibiotic Refractory Pouchitis (CARP) is very limited. The largest study was a retrospective multicenter cohort study at five academic centers in the United States including 83 IPAA patients with endoscopically confirmed inflammation of the pouch. Some 87% of patients were previously treated with antibiotics for pouchitis， and 51% previously were treated with anti-TNFs for pouchitis. After at least 3 months follow-up， 71% of patients exhibited a clinical response， and 19.3%achieved clinical remission； 54% had endoscopic improvement while 17.6% achieved endoscopic healing. Patients who developed pouchitis symptoms within 1 year postoperatively were found to be less likely to respond to VDZ . In a recent review Ribaldone DG reported that vedolizumab has significant efficacy in chronic refractory or antibiotic-dependent pouchitis， also in patients who failed to respond to other treatments including those with anti-TNF agents . In literature， only twenty-one patients had a biological treatment with vedolizumab for CARP without a previous experience with anti-TNF agents . Our case is important because it evaluates the efficacy of vedolizumab as a first-choice biological treatment in CARP and represents the first case report which evaluates a histological improvement thanks to the effectiveness of vedolizumab in the treatment of chronic refractory pouchitis. In our single patient refractory to multiple therapies， we found good clinical and endoscopic response encouraging further investigations on clinical response， mucosal healing and histological improvement. In a recent meta-analysis Saurabh Chandan demonstrated that clinical improvement in symptoms was reported by 48.7% patients treated with VDZ， clinical remission was achieved by 45.4% patients treated with VDA and finally， endoscopic improvement and remission was seen in 61.2% patients treated with VDZ. Biologic therapy is safe and effective short-term as well as long-term in the treatment of CARP.\n\n【18】Conclusion\n\n【19】Vedolizumab showed consistent treatment benefits across clinical， endoscopic and histological endpoint， together with safety consistent. Vedolizumab intravenous is effective in chronic refractory or antibiotic-dependent pouchitis so that can be value its use like first line in the biological therapy can be evaluated as confirmed by a recent study where demonstrates that T cell movementing mechanisms are important and vedolizumab antagonism in pouchitis has functional effects. A phase- 4 study aiming to evaluate the efficacy and safety of vedolizumab in the treatment of chronic pouchitis (EARNEST) has just been completed confirms these findings.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 10:19:10", "endTime": "2024/09/24 10:19:20", "cost": 10.163}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:29", "update_time": "2024-09-23 18:19:21", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 18:19:10"}

UK government told that it is highly contagious new variant of the virus. Scientist investigated the genetic materials of the coronavirus and found thousands oftiny modifications which proves it hopscotched across the world. UK is the first to detect the new strain and now it is found in Denmark， Belgium， the Netherland， Australia as per the record of WHO. Coronavirus have genetic material called RNA. When virus infects us， it attaches to cells， get inside and make number of copies of their RNA. If there is a mistake in copying， the RNA becomes changed and called mutation. It happens accidently and by random and a normal process in virus by which they spread and multiply. The new variant B.1.1.7 variant is detected in the UK in the month of December 204 followed by the B.1.351 variant in South Africa， Los Angeles and Ohio. Research proves that B.1.1.7 variant is more deadly and contagious than the previous one. A new variant in the coronavirus is VUI-2020 12/01 or lineage B.1.1.7. 17 different changes have been found in new variant and most of them is due to the alteration in a protein made by the virus . The Centers for Disease Control and prevention (CDC) predict that by the March 21， B.1.1.7 will be the dominant strain in the United States . The genetic changes are seen in large number especially in the spike protein which governs how the virus interacts with a human cell. New variant is 70% more transmissible than the old variant and attack the immune system faster and more severe . The primary symptoms such as cough， fever， chest pains，loss of taste and smell， aches and chills is same as that ofolder. The major concern oftoday's scientist is that the mutation could affecttreatment and prevention. Bollinger said “We deal with mutations every year for flu virus and will keep an eye on this coronavirus and track it\". The new variant spread faster from person to person andleads to more deaths. This new variant infects more number of cases in children and more aggressive new strain needs attention. The biggest problem with the virus is that when it mutates it escape from drugs or the immune system by changing the proteins on its surface. Antibodies are generated by our bodies to fight off infection and it doesn't exist in isolation. In our body， several cells have to work together antibodies， specially neutralizing antibodies， enter the stage. One subset of T cells plays a crucial role in the production of antibodies and another type of T cell kills the viruses infected cells. T cells are a kind of WBC and lymphocytes produced in bone marrow and carry a protein on their cell surface， surveil our bodies for pathogen. Dr. Yewdele， chief of cellular Biological Section explains that there are two paths to alert the immune system of the foreign invader. Once a virus enter into the cell， it goes a series of compartments were enzyme chop and unpack into small peptides and these peptides take away by Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class II molecule. When a virus infects a cell， it makes viral protein by hijacking the cell's machinery. At the same time some peptides diverting to MHC class I molecules， which direct them to the cell surface and present them to other cell . Dr. David Mulligan suggested that m-RNA vaccines activate B cells which can able to produce antibodies over 8 months after vaccination. Our immune system produces antibodies to a protein which sits on the surface of the virus called spike in the presence of vaccines. The spike protein opens a passage inside by latching onto the cells. Vaccine helps in the production of antibodies and stick to the tip ofthespike and virus can’t enter inside. Mutation creates the possibility to the change the shape of spike protein； in turn antibodies gain a tight grip on them. The variant B.1.1.7 includes 8 in the spike gene and the antibodies produce by our immune system may be less likely that virus can easily escape their attack. Currently the scientists think that the variant will be able to evade vaccine but at some point， someday，some where the current vaccine may be ineffective(Kristian Andersen， a virologist at Scripps research Institute). The US chief adviser Dr. Moncef Slaoui said that the possibility of new variant resistance towards vaccines is low but inexistence. The m-RNA vaccine is able to modify to target new variants produced by mutation but definitely new strains could decrease the effectiveness of the virus. The vaccines provide only 21.9% protection against the mild or moderate COVID-19 development and 10.4%against the B.1.1.7 variant. Several scientists explain that vaccines produce wide range of response beyond the spike protein through the immune system so “VARIANTS ARE UNDER INVESTIGATION\". The new virus strain is potentially on a pathway for vaccine escape so Transmissibility and Virulence of the variant requires more research. Various scientist of South America working on a booster shot to guard against the new variant. At last it can be concluded that new variant with speedy spreader properties are a concern to everyone. Prof. Stoye said “Spread will almost inevitably occur because of short separation between different countries\". The above letter is not just for new variant but for the future global health security and to manage the threats with pandemic potential. The variant of concern is very much significant to public health and effectiveness of current vaccine. If there is a chance of vaccine failure or reinfection towards new variants then the case can be considered oh high priority. That why new variants is under radar by various health scientist.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 11:13:57", "endTime": "2024/09/24 11:14:03", "cost": 6.115}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:29", "update_time": "2024-09-23 19:14:04", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 19:13:53"}

The remaining cases (less than10%) are mostly composed of uterine papillary serous carcinoma and clear cell carcinoma， which constitute almost half of all recurrences. In addition to the histologic type of endometrial cancer， the initial stage at diagnosis is an important predictor of relapse because the more advanced the stage， the higher the risk of micro metastasis .\n\n【10】Primary colonic adenocarcinomas account for the majority of malignant tumors identified at colonoscopy. Less commonly， metastasis from other primary cancers， including breast， ovary， prostate， lung， and stomach， and can present as a colonic tumor . Here， we present a case of metastatic endometrial cancer to the bowel in a patient with a history of endometrial cancer. Patients rarely refuse any kind of cancer therapy allowing observation of the natural course of malignant disease.\n\n【11】Case Presentation\n\n【12】A 68-year-old female patient presented to the radiation oncology department at King Hussein Cancer Center (KHCC) in September 2006 with a diagnosis of endometrial endometrioid type of adenocarcinoma， status post total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy without pelvic lymph node dissection at a private hospital. FIGO stage IIA .\n\n【13】According to our policy， every pathology specimen outside KHCC should be reviewed； pathology review showed the followings：endometrial adenocarcinoma grade II， Invade invasion of half of the myometrium and upper cervix， and No Lympho Vascular Invasion(LVI). At KHCC， the metastatic work up was negative locally and distally.\n\n【14】We discussed the case at with the gynecology gynecology-oncology Multi Disciplinary Team (MDT) and the decision was to give post-operative radiotherapy. Moreover， after discussion with the patient about the effect and side effect of radiotherapy treatment she refused， so we referred her back to her primary gynecology physician for further follow up.\n\n【15】Four months later， she was again referred to us again from by her primary physician after she underwent Pelvic Lymph Nodes Dissection (PLND) and Omentectomy， (six months after primary surgery). We reviewed the specimen of pelvic lymph node specimen and it showed that all harvested  lymph nodes dissected negative.\n\n【16】For that she came to us asking for adjuvant brachytherapy， but we did not recommend it because of the length of the period (duration between primary surgery and PLND is about six months)， which exceeds the permissible period for adjuvant treatment. The patient kept on follow up every three to four months for the first two years， then every six months for the next three years.\n\n【17】The patient did well till 2012 when she came to the emergency department at KHCC with abdominal pain and partial intestinal obstruction ， sigmoidoscopy was performed， with and a biopsy was ordered and showed A 6cm x4 cmx3cm ulcerating mass involving the sigmoid colon is identified.\n\n【18】A high-grade tumor with a dlear cytoplasm in most of the areas examined  is consistent with clear cell carcinoma isidentified. Focally， however， an endometrioid morphology comparable to the original tumor still be appreciated can be seen.\n\n【19】Then， she underwent partial colectomy， left iliac lymph nodes and peri-colic lymph nodes’ dissection. Histopathology showed：Metastatic High Grade Carcinoma Consistent with Recurrent Clear Cell Endometrial Carcinoma， (0/22) lymph nodes， RO resection. The.post-operative period was smooth.\n\n【20】Again， we discussed the case at with the gynecology-oncology MDT and the decision was to give adjuvant chemotherapy， but the patient refused， so kept on regular follow up.\n\n【21】Now she is on Follow up with Pap smear every twelve months， the last visit was on 20， January 2019 and she is doing well without complaints. The Last Pap smear taken and appeared normal.\n\n【22】Discussion\n\n【23】Endometrial cancer is the fifth most common cancer in women in Jordan and ranks twelfth in cancer-related deaths among women . Endometrial cancer has many histologic subtypes， with endometrioid adenocarcinoma being the most common. Staging of endometrial cancer is performed surgically and classified according to the FIGO staging classification.\n\n【24】Several risk factors for recurrence in early stage endometrial endometrioid type cancer have been identified； including histologic grade 3， depth of myometrial invasion (>50%)， and age >60 years， along with lympho vascular invasion， and lower uterine A： There is proliferation of the glands lined by the tall columnar cells with cigar-shaped nuclei， which is consistent with endometrioid carcinoma. B：Another focus shows clearing of the cytoplasm but with preserved glandular architecture. C： Clear cells with hob nailing of nuclei， prominent nucleoli and clear cytoplasm， surrounding hyalinized papillary core consistent with a small focus of clear cell carcinoma， was seen in the original specimen (arrow).D：Clear cells with well-defined cytoplasmic membrane， and clear cytoplasm growing in glandular and solid patterns formed the major component in the metastatic carcinoma. All images are H&E X40. involvement. In addition to as well as high histology types such as clear cell. Adjuvant radiation can be considered if two of the above risk factors are present in addition to high histology type regardless the stage， Since our patient had two risk factors (stage IIA by old FIGO staging 1988 and tumor with >50% myometrial invasion)， So we recommended her adjuvant radiation therapy with vaginal brachy therapy.\n\n【25】Typical sites of recurrence are loco regional organs including the vagina and pelvic lymph nodes. A typical site includes lungs， bones， brain， and visceral organs . Our patient developed a distant disease recurrence at an atypical site； the sigmoid colon.\n\n【26】Endometrial cancer metastasis to the bowel has been described but is rare. While rare， it is important for gastroenterologists， along with pathologists and oncologists， to keep metastatic disease in the differential diagnosis of tumors in the intestine.\n\n【27】Our patient had a recurrence more than 6 years from diagnosis of endometrial cancer while most relapses occur within 3 vears after hysterectomy for endometrioid carcinoma. Her presentation was interesting since she presented with symptoms of bowel obstruction， and her colonoscopy showed evidence of an obstructing colonic mass， which was thought to be primary colon cancer versus metastatic endometrial cancer in the colon wall. Colonic obstruction secondary to recurrent gynecologic malignancies is commonly a consequence of external compression.\n\n【28】It seems that the cause of metastatic endometrial cancer to the sigmoid colon is the presence of foci of clear cell component foci in the first specimen after hysterectomy that was missed at the first review and had been found retrospectively when our pathologist found that the new pathology of metastasis is a high clear cell. Which This lead the pathologist to review again the first specimen after hysterectomy again， and found that there was foci of clear cell that were missed at the first review and this may be the cause of metastasis to the sigmoid colon .", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 10:43:12", "endTime": "2024/09/24 10:43:40", "cost": 28.015}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:29", "update_time": "2024-09-23 18:43:38", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 18:43:10"}

In total accordance with current information， we show here that P -in particular- and neuroactive steroids -in general- are promising molecules to delay diverse manifestations of neurotransmitters depletion.\n\n【2】Keywords： Progesterone； Neuroactive steroids； Parkinsonism； Neuroprotection； Male rats\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Parkinson's disease is a threatening health problem in the world. It is the second most common neurodegenerative disease . Besides many advances in the management of the illness， it remains complicated . This is so -at least in part-because what was once the hallmark of the disease， the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra， has since changed to consider the disease as a multi-systemic degenerative process involving several pathways， structures and neurotransmitters. Ongoing research is highly interested in the possibility of using neuroprotective drugs to avoid the damages of the disease or at least delay them long enough to give the patient a better quality of life.\n\n【5】Neuroactive steroids are a well-known set of molecules that comprise steroids from any source that show effects on the Central Nervous System (CNS). Among them， there are a group of neuroactive steroids-collectively named neurosteroids- that are synthesized the novo in the CNS， and that exert autocrine and paracrine effects only . Both groups of molecules have a renowned target as putative molecules regarding neuroprotection. Progesterone (P) is one of the major players among them . Parkinson’s disease remains elusive in terms oftreatment， being one major reason that the disorder， once thought as merely a motor illness， is a complex set of signs and symptoms that involve cognitive， affective and motor expressions . Today， a major goal is to recognize early subtle behavioral (cognitive， affective and motor) signs of malfunctioning to promptly begin with the treatment.\n\n【6】There are several animal models of Parkinsonism that have proved to be very useful in researching several essential aspects of the disease， from behavior to molecules . In this work， we try to study whether or not P. could be eventually neuroprotective when administered just a few days before of injecting our subjects with severallow doses of Reserpine (R) . We selected R as our model since it affects not only dopaminergic neurons but also catecholamines and indoleamine as a whole . What was once a disadvantageous situation， today it has been reverted since the human disease involves a much more complex landscape that the mere loss of dopaminergic neurons. Additionally， the method-comparatively- is a rapid way of establishing the deficits in the subiects and also testing the effects of putative protective molecules.\n\n【7】Methods\n\n【8】Subjects\n\n【9】Male Sprague-Dawley rats， 60 days old， and 450 g average weight were used. Animals were housed in groups of three individuals per cage. Room temperature was maintained at 22℃±2C， on a 12 h artificial light/dark cycle (light from 7：00 am to 7 pm). Commercial rodent food and water were provided ad libitum. All procedures were approvedbythelocal committee for care and use ofanimals in medical research (CICUAL， Facultad de Ciencias Medicas， Universidad Nacional de Cuyo， cicual@fcm.uncu.edu.ar)， and experiments were performed in accord with the National Institutes of Health guide for the care and use of laboratory animals.\n\n【10】Reagents and solutions\n\n【11】Reserpine (R) and Progesterone (P) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich St Louis MO， USA. R was diluted in glacial acetic acid (final concentration 0.5% acetic acid in distilled water) and subcutaneously administered (SC) at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg. P was dissolved in ether， benzyl alcohol was added， and finally， it was resuspended in corn oil. P administration was also SC， at a dose of 4 mg/kg.\n\n【12】Experimental design\n\n【13】The experimental protocol was carried out along 21 days， according to Figure 1. From day-5 to-1 animal received either a daily Intraperitoneal (IP) injection of sterile saline or an SC injection of P. On odd days from 1 to 13 animals received either daily reserpine or sterile saline according to the group . Catalepsy test was carried out on even days from 2 to 14. Novel Object Recognition test(NOR test) was performed on day 8， and Forced Swimming Test(FST) was performed on day 9.\n\n【14】At the beginning ， animals were randomly assigned to one of 4 groups (n=10 each) injected with： 1) Sham (S)， saline-saline；2) saline-reserpine (R)； 3) Progesterone-Reserpine (P+R)； and 4) Progesterone-Saline (P+S).\n\n【15】Reserpine model\n\n【16】Reserpine (R)， a monoamine depleting agent， is an ester alkaloid derived from Rauwolfia sp. root utilized initially for the treatment of hypertension . R was underused for years as a useful reagent to induce animal Parkinsonism since it was not selective for dopamine， the hallmark neurotransmitter whose lack by death of dopaminergic neurons in the substantial nigra was always considered to be the responsible for the pathophysiology of the illness， according to Jenner in 1989 . Today this is not the case anymore as different monoamines besides dopamine (noradrenaline， serotonin) and different nuclei besides the substantia nigra (raphe nuclei and locus coeruleus) are all known to be affected by the disease . Today， R is a well-established model to induce animal Parkinsonism .\n\n【17】Catalepsy test\n\n【18】In the catalepsy test， the subject is placed in an unusual posture and then the observer measures the time that takes to the animal to correct this unusual posture . We used a horizontal Plexiglass bar held between two vertical support bars located at 9 cm from a smooth surface. Animal's front limbs were positioned on the bar and the latency time to step down from the bar was recorded. Three trials were made per rat on each observation. Result for each observation was the mean value. We establish catalepsy like behavior criteria， considered as immobility posture time. Maximum time allowed for the whole test was 180 sec.\n\n【19】Novel object recognition\n\n【20】The experiment was realized as described elsewhere . Briefly， the apparatus consisted of a wooden box (70 cm x 45 cmx30 cm) with a white acrylic floor. It was located in an isolated testing room that was dimly lit by constant indirect illumination from the primary source， a 25 Wlight bulb suspended over the box. The objects utilized as familiar (previously experienced object) or unfamiliar(object not previously experienced， i.e. the novel one) were three copies of a pink truncated pyramid and a grayish-opaque candlestick of approximately the same size， all of them heavy enough to prevent accidental displacement by the subjects.\n\n【21】The animals were allowed to get used to the experimental room for at least 1 h. The day before training， each animal freely explored the apparatus with no objects for 2 min. A training session (T1) was followed by a test session (T2) 24 h later. During the training session， animals were placed in the arena containing two identical objects(pink truncated pyramids). In the test session， a familiar object was changed for an unfamiliar one (grayish opaque candlestick). Both training and test stages were 3 min each. The position of the objects(familiar and unfamiliar) and the extreme of the box used to place the objects were randomly exchanged for each experimental animal to avoid the use of potential confounding spatial clues. Exploration was defined as the orientation ofthe animal’s snout toward the object within a range of 2 cm or less from the object. Running around the object or sitting on it was not recorded as exploration. The objects and floor were carefully cleaned with ethanol (10%) after each trial to equate olfactory cues. The experiments were recorded with a camcorder digital camera JVC Everio GZ-MG330 (Japan) using a black and white recording mode to improve the register. The measures in the object recognition test were as follows： 1) total time spent by the subject exploring both objects during training (T1)； 2) total time spent by the subject exploring just the novel object during T2； and 3) discrimination index， the difference between time spent exploring unfamiliar and familiar objects during T2.\n\n【22】Forced swimming test\n\n【23】The FST was slightly modified from the original one . The device consists of a plexiglass cylinder 38 cm in diameter and 60 cm in height. The cylinder contained water at 25C， 45 cm in height. Rats were individually introduced into the cylinder for 5 min and removed to be dried before returning them to their home cages. The test was videotaped . The following parameters were scored：1) Immobility time： time spent with the head above the water surface， and the necessary movement to maintained it； 2) swimming time： movements through the apparatus with front limbs inside the water； 3) climbing time： Movements with the front limbs against the cylinder wall； and 4) diving： Events of exploratory movements under the water with all the body submerged\n\n【24】Statistical assays\n\n【25】All data were analyzed by a one-way ANOVA test followed by a Tukey post hoc test and expressed as the mean ± SEM. A value of p<0.05 was considered statistically significant.\n\n【26】Results\n\n【27】In the present work， when compared to another study ， relatively small but repeated doses of R (0.1 mg/Kg) were used to C= Control group； R=Reserpine group； P=P group； P+R=P plus reserpine group. Results are expressed as mean ±SEM. p<0.05， \"p<0.01，p<0.001. obtain subtle but reliable motor changes as well as cognitive and affective ones. In this sense， we were able to induce Parkinsonism signs in our subjects since all of the animals treated with R developed changes in each of the testing conditions.\n\n【28】These changes included： a) More time spent in the bar during the catalepsy test， indicating a definite impact on motility， particularly from day 10 of R treatment until reaching a peak on day 14 ； b) subjects significantly spent less time swimming during the forced swimming task， which is a clear indication of what is known as a \"depression\" like behavior in rodent models when compared to controls without treatment or subjects treated with P alone . The diving activity was measured by the number of accumulated events. Control group made 21 dives， while in the reserpine group we observe only 4 events.\n\n【29】Reserpine group previously treated with progesterone obtained a cumulative result of 11 dives， while for the group treated only with progesterone the cumulative result was 16 dives； c) also in the recognition of the novel object during the test， controls， and P alone treated subjects did not have any problem at all in recognizing the new object. On the other hand， R treated subjects， nonetheless spending the same total amount of time in exploratory behavior -also a clear indicator of what is supposed to be expected from animals that did not suffer from any lack of motivation and/or translation problems ignored the condition of new object during the test day， indicating an impact on memory， a cognitive component of the model. These results， when taken together， allow us to consider our subjects as a valid model of monoamine depletion. By extension also as a modelofpremotor and motor signs of Parkinsonism， suitable for being used to study eventual neuroprotection by the neuroactive steroid P.\n\n【30】Discussion\n\n【31】Regarding P， it was striking the effect when administered for five days before the injections of R. In fact， in every condition tested， P. prevented the impairment of all the components previously C =Control group； R=Reserpine group； P=P group； P+R=P plus reserpine group. Results are expressed as mean ±SEM. Swimming time in seconds. p<0.01，“p<0.001. described， resulting in motor， cognitive and affective performances quite comparable to control subjects. It is important to note that P had not any effect per se. Additionally， we must stress here that the model we used in the present work allows us to study the acute effect of neuroprotection instead of addressing neurorestoration， being more useful for the later models based on intrastriataladministration of toxins like 6-Hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA).\n\n【32】Several papers stress the importance of sex steroids and neurosteroids as neuroprotective factors . Men are more susceptible than women to Parkinson's disease， at least until women reach menopause ， which is highly suggestive for a role of sex steroids like estrogen . Moreover， steroid hormones synthesized by the brain have been shown to display neuroprotective properties eventually useful for the prevention and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases . Probably， what it is particularly interesting here are twofold：1) the validity of reserpine as a reagent suitable for generating a deficit constellation in rodents that remembers what happens -at least in part- in Parkinson's disease. It does so relatively quickly when compared to another method， and it does consistently every time according to our results. Additionally， the whole picture is reversible when R is discontinued； and 2) P. prevented impairments in all areas-again consistently-when administered for a short time before R administration. There are advantageous animal models of Parkinsonism that are widely used . However， all of them involved some cumulative changes and cell death with compensatory changes as well. In this work， we show short bursts of P. before Rtreatment， and a short Rtreatment to induce the reported malfunctions.\n\n【33】Parkinson's disease is a very complex disorder in which probably many factors contribute to the onset and later stages of the disease. At present， there is no single successful treatment to stop the progression of the illness . As such it results interesting the possibility of addressing the role of several treatments at once acting synergistically to prevent neuronal death or restore brain damage. In this sense -among others- gonadal steroid hormones have been shown to result promising. As we mentioned earlier， since women are less prone than men to present Parkinson's disease  at least until menopause- it looks promising to think about gonadal steroids as putative candidates to be one of the combined strategies to treat the disease. In fact， and besides that estrogens have been less contradictory that progestin's in showing beneficial effects， P also has been reported to be useful . In our lab， treatment with P. for 3 days after 6-OHDA injections improved behavioral targets as well as normalized glutamatergic and dopaminergic activities. However， here we are dealing with acute effects， instead of the chronic model of neuronal death by 6-OHDA， which poses the question of that， apparently， at least， we could talk of dysfunctional neurons here more than dead cells. Since one of the possible targets of Parkinson’s disease is neurotrophic factors ， it would be possible that P. before administration of reserpine could -acting quickly- exert their protective effect on membrane progesterone receptors， stimulating neurotrophic factors， such as BDNF. In our lab we have seen an increase in BDNF levels in response to administration of allopregnanolone， an endogenous neurosteroid derived from progesterone that acts as a GABAA positive allosteric modulator (unpublished data). Since nigral Dopamine (DA) neurons are sensitive to several neurotrophic factors (BDNF among them) it would not be impossible to think of P as inducing an increase of such neurotrophic factors and then， preventing DA neurons of becoming dysfunctional and hence， avoiding the potential proinflammatory damage of reserpine. Interestingly， Jarras et al. reported that in mice gut -gastrointestinal symptoms are also common in Parkinsons disease- lesioned with 1-Methyl-4-Phenyl-1，2，3，6-Tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) they showed neuroprotection and immunomodulation of DA neurons (they had previously shown also neuroprotection in brain DA neurons；).\n\n【34】In brief， we suspect (being careful of taking into account the great complexity ofthe first motor disorder in human beings) that， at least in early stages ofthe disease there could be a possible proinflammatory situation enhanced by some kind of oxidative stress that would be deleterious for-among others-DA neurons in substantia nigra. Based on the evidences， we suggest that neurotrophic factors could protect the neurons under dysfunctional state. In this sense， P. could be in part responsible for stimulating such trophic factors； however， more studies become necessary to test this hypothesis. Actual efforts are underway to increase our understanding in this devastating disease.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 11:23:04", "endTime": "2024/09/24 11:23:19", "cost": 15.055}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:29", "update_time": "2024-09-23 19:23:19", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 19:23:03"}

Its clinical and radiological manifestations are not entirely clear due to the rarity of the disease； and hence diagnosis of this condition can be delayed due lack of knowledge associated with the disease. We present a case of a 63-year-old man who presented with a few weeks of cognitive deficits with dysphasia and marked impairments in short term memory. His MRI brain showed subtle FLAIR and T1contrast abnormalities near the lateral ventricles abutting the temporal lobe at the choroid plexus. On brain biopsy he was noted to have perivascular atypical B lymphocytes consistent with PCNSL. High-dose methotrexate， teniposide， BCNU， prednisolone and Rituximab， followed by 5 months of consolidative chemotherapy with cytarabine resulted in clinical and radiological improvement. He subsequently relapsed twice and salvage chemotherapy with consolidative radiotherapy was delivered. Unfortunately， 6 months later his condition worsened and he was referred to palliative care， and then deceased. PCNSL of the choroid plexus is very rare and cases of relapsed disease generally have poor outcome despite a variety of chemo and radiotherapy options. Targeted therapies with optimal penetration of the blood brain barrier are warranted.\n\n【2】Keywords： Primary CNS lymphoma； Choroid plexus； Brain malignancy\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Approximately 4% of all intracranial tumors are primary CNS lymphomas ， of which intraventricular neoplasms are rare representing 1% to 10% of primary CNS malignancy . There is an increased incidence of primary CNS lymphoma in individuals with acquired or inherent immunodeficiency . Involvement of the choroid plexus by lymphoma is rare with only less than10 individual case reports in the literature. The aim of this report is to present a case of a 63-year-old man who presented with cognitive deficits and after a myriad of investigations on brain biopsy was found to have primary CNS lymphoma of the choroid plexus. The case highlights the challenges in diagnosis， the rarity of such cancer affecting the choroid plexus and the response to treatment where treatment efficacy might be reduced due to location of the lesion.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 63-year-old man was brought into the ED by his partner， dueto a1-weekhistoryof\"confusion\"， short-term memory loss and inability to recall directions. There was no history of recent headaches， photophobia， neck stiffness， or seizures. He did not have fevers or night sweats but according to his partner， had lost 3 kg in weight in the past 3 months. His past medical history included a lumbar spinelaminectomy 10 years ago and he was a current smoker (30 pack-year history) but had recently quit. He worked as a farmer and had horses， cattle， dogs， and sheep in the farm. He sailed regularly and his most recent travel was to Japan 3 months prior to his presentation.\n\n【7】On examination he was afebrile with a blood pressure of 122/74 mmHg. There was no palpable lymphadenopathy no hepatosplenomegaly. Visual acuity was normal with pinhole correction.\n\n【8】Cranial nerve， gait and neurological limb examination， and fundoscopy were normal.\n\n【9】There were no abnormalities on examination of higher centers， frontal， parietal or occipital lobe functions， however marked deficits in recall with retrograde amnesia extending for at least one week with inability to form new memories. He scored 17/30(0/3 recall) on Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and NUCOG of 71/100 with deficits in short-term memory. Formal neuropsychological testing confirmed specific deficits in recall of recent events.\n\n【10】Full blood examination， renal and liver function， inflammatory markers， Vitamin B12， folate，TSH，ANA，dsDNA，rheumatoid factor， pANCA and cANCA were all normal. Anti-GAD， anti-NMDAR and VGKC antibodies were negative. HIV serology was negative. Immunoglobulin levels were normal. Serum protein electrophoresis detected a paraprotein band of IgMlambda 4g/L.CT chest/abdomen/pelvis revealed no evidence of malignancy with no enlarged lymph nodes seen.\n\n【11】Lumbar puncture showed an opening pressure of 4 cm， H，O with 48 ×10/L polymorphs， 177 × 10/L lymphocytes and 0 x10/L red blood cells. Glucose was 1.5 mmol/L and protein was 3.93g/L. Cytology showed chronic inflammation with no evidence of malignancy. There was no clonal B- or T-cell populations identified by flow cytometry. Cryptococcal antigen， Herpes virus multiplex PCR and syphilis screen were negative. Electrophoresis was normal. NMDA receptor and neuronal antibodies were not detected in CSF.\n\n【12】MRI brain with gadolinium revealed thickening of the choroid plexus at the level of the atria of the lateral ventricle (extending to the temporal horns)， more pronounced on the right side associated with marked enhancement ofthe choroid plexus . There was no pathological contrast enhancement within the brain parenchyma outside the ventricular system， and the brain parenchyma was of normal volume with no volume loss of the hippocampal formation. The differential diagnosis from the MRI findings included malignancy， sarcoid or infection. A diagnostic biopsy of the choroid plexus lesion confirmed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma consistent with PCNSL on histology and immunohistochemistry  showing presence perivascular atypical CD20 positive B cells， which were MUM1positive and a Ki-67 index of approximately 80%. A bone marrow biopsy for staging showed no evidence of lymphoma involvement.On slit lamp examination，there was no ocular lymphoma involvement.\n\n【13】He was subsequently referred to Hematology and commenced treatment withmulti-agentchemotherapy with high-dose methotrexate， teniposide， BCNU， prednisolone and Rituximab(monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody). He received 2 cycles， following which a MRI scan showed near complete resolution of his CNS lymphoma.Hlee then receivedconsolidation with high-dose cytarabine. Five months later， he presented with deterioration in gait and MRI brain scan showed recurrence of periventricular/choroidal enhancement. He received 8 cycles ofsalvage chemotherapy withhigh dose methotrexate and rituximab with the addition of temozolomide on odd-numbered cycles. Restaging MRI showed resolution of the CNS lymphoma consistent with improvement in clinical symptoms. He preceded with 30 Gy of consolidative whole brain radiotherapy delivered in 20 fractions. Unfortunately， six months later， patient exhibited worsening cognition and short-term memory loss and MRI scan confirmed relapsed disease in the ependymal surface of all ventricles， most pronounced in the lateral ventricles of both hemispheres. There was increased T2 signal extending into the white matter and this pattern of disease was in similar distribution to his original scan in June 2014 . Due to his poor prognosis， palliative treatment was discussed with him and his partner and he died within a month of his second relapse.\n\n【14】Discussion and Conclusions\n\n【15】PCNSL is an uncommon variant of extra nodal Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL) that involves the brain， leptomeninges， eyes， or spinal cord without evidence of systemic disease . The CNS normally lacks lymphoid aggregates and it remains speculative whether malignant transformation develops locally within normally trafficking CNS lymphocytes， or from within a sub-population of lymphocytes with specific tropism for the CNS . Such tropism may be facilitated through the expression of specific cell-surface adhesion molecules， such as CD44 and CD18，and various chemokine receptors . Spreading of malignant lymphoid cells within the CNS is believed to involve a complex interaction of selection and cadherin molecules， such as adhesion molecule CD44 and transmembrane protein receptor Fas (CD95) .\n\n【16】Intraventricular neoplasms consist of two categories： those that originate from the ventricular wall， and those that originate from structures within the ventricular system such as choroid plexus . The choroid plexus is a leaf-like structure with a granular surface attached to the ependyma by a thin stalk in the lateral， third and fourth ventricles. It produces CSF and is crucial in maintenance of ionic balance . Tumors arising from the choroid plexus are extremely rare， and include choroid plexus papilloma， choroid plexus carcinoma and non-neoplastic lesions. Of these，lymphoma is an extremely rare form of choroid plexus tumor. A PubMed search revealed only less than 8 cases of primary CNS lymphoma of choroid plexus， highlighting the rarity of the disease.\n\n【17】The risk factors for PCNSL include： iatrogenic immunosuppression， congenital immunodeficiency including ataxia-telangiectasia， Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome and severe combined variable immunodeficiencies . PCNSL can also arise from EBV-mediated clonal expansion and malignant transformation of B-lymphocytes， a process that is likely regulated by immune mechanisms.\n\n【18】High-dose methotrexate-based induction chemotherapy is currently the first-line of treatment. As monotherapy， high-dose methotrexate achievesa 35%to74%response rate andcombination chemotherapy regimens have increased response rates to 77% to 85%. However， 35% to 65% of patients still relapse and radiation therapy is utilized as salvage treatment for relapsed or refractory disease with neurocognitive long-term toxicity a major concern . In a recent study Yang and colleagues reported the outcomes of 11cases of intraventricular primary CNS lymphoma showing that the majority (70%) relapsed and in the majority of cases salvage therapy(high does methotrexate and radiotherapy were required) . The overall prognosis for relapsed PCNSL is poor with salvage radiation treatment increasing median overall survival by approximately 11months in radiotherapy-naive patients . Another multi centre study used induction therapy with rituximab， high dose methotrexate and temozolomide followed byhigh dose consolidation with etoposide in addition to cytarabine (without whole brain radiotherapy). A complete response to rituximab， methotrexate and temozolomide of66% and progression free survival at 2 years of 57% were seen . Other studies have reported high dose chemotherapy-autologous stem cell transplantation as a first line treatment for primary CNS lymphoma； and in a phase 2 trial of 30 patients， 5 year probability of relapse-related death was 21% for all patients (n=30) and 8.7% for patients treated with high dose chemotherapy plus autologous stem cell transplantation .\n\n【19】The case that we presented died from relapsed disease where salvage chemotherapy was ultimately ineffective in controlling the underlying illness. Age and premorbid function are thought to be independent risk factors for future prognosis in PCNSL. A complete response on neuroimaging after two courses of chemotherapy is also reported to be predictive of progression-free survival . The case presented did not have complete resolution of radiological changes after the course of chemotherapy. One reason could have been that the location of the neoplasia being within the choroid plexus was presumably hard to access for the therapeutic agents. Future studies are required to decipher PCNSL location and its association with future outcome.\n\n【20】PCNSL of the choroid plexus is a very rare tumor. We present a case of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma of the choroid plexus with extension into the temporal horns ofthe lateral ventricle. Radiological and clinical improvement were achieved with high-dose methotrexate combination treatment with Rituximab but the patient experienced 2relapses within 5 to 6 months of completion oftreatment， heralding a poor prognosis. This is consistent with the literature where recurrent or relapsed PCNL has been reported to have poor outcome despite the many varieties of therapies that have been trialed. Targeted therapies that could penetrate the blood brain barrier are required to deal with this highly invasive brain cancer.

Developing countries including Africa are at risks of getting more infected due to less awareness and ill-equipped health facilities. For such countries， accurate prediction of the COVID-19 cases could help the policy makers in decision making and proper utilization of the available resources. Machine Learning (ML) approaches are excellent tools for making predictions especially for an uncertain and stochastic phenomenon such as COVID-19. Therefore， Artificial Neural Network (ANN) as ML tool was employed to predict cumulative COVID-19 cases in Nigeria. In this way， data including daily and cumulative cases as well as daily and cumulative mortality rate were collected from February 2020 till December 2021. Five different models were developed using varied input combinations. Determination Coefficient (DC) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) were employed as performance metrics. The results showed all the developed models produced good prediction skill but M4 with DC=0.9996 and RMSE=0.0017 in the validation step led to better performance. The general results of this study emphasize the importance of using ANN for the prediction of COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria.\n\n【2】Keywords： COVID-19；Machine learning； Pandemic； Nigeria； Africa\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】The total confirmed cases of COVID-19 have reached 396，558，014 as of February 9hh， 2022according to the World Health Organization. The pandemic has become a serious health challenge worldwide. The call for artificial intelligence integration in the fight against the deadly virus was made by the White House in collaboration with tech companies and research institute as well. Personalized preventive measures can significantly help from precise characterization of the population based on classified COVID-19 vulnerability. The initial examination that elderly populace has an elevated risk to coronavirus disease 2019 is challenged by a different study that more and more youthful adults experienced chronic COVID-19 signs， showing an emergency need of abroad risk assessment based on physiological features and personalized genetic.\n\n【5】Machine Learning (ML) algorithms have the capacity to integrate and analyze huge-scale data of coronavirus disease 2019 patients， which can help in understanding the viral spread pattern， develop new efficient therapeutics strategies， further improve testing/diagnostic accuracy and speed and potentially explore the most susceptible persons based on personalized genetic as well as physiological features . Interestingly， within a limited time period since the pandemic started， ML methods have been utilized in taxonomic categorization of coronavirus disease 2019 genomes， survival projection of chronic COVID-19 patients . Namasudra et al.  employed Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict COVID-19 cases. Nabi et al.  employed ANN and other ML tools for the prediction of COVID-19 diseases outbreak. De Araijo Morais and da Silva Gomes  applied ANN and other prediction model for the forecasting of daily COVID-19 cases in the world.\n\n【6】Despite been amongst the highest recorded number of cases and death in Africa， studies of COVID-19 cases in Nigeria are very limited. Therefore， owing to its robustness in dealing with the uncertain aspect of COVID-19， Artificial Neural Network (ANN) was employed to predict cumulative COVID-19 cases in Nigeria using several input combinations.\n\n【7】Materials and Methods\n\n【8】Study country\n\n【9】Nigeria is a tropical zone region located in west Africa with 923，770km’ oftotal area. A distance of 1，050 km separated southern Nigeria from northern Nigeria while1，150 km is the west to east optimum distance. Benin， Cameroon， Niger and Chad are some of the African countries that share border with Nigeria . Figure 1 shows the study country.\n\n【10】It can be seen from Table 1 that the COVID-19 cases in Nigeria within the selected period were up to a maximum 6，158 in a single day and cumulatively， the cases were up to 241，513 (as of February 28h，2020 to December 315，2021). A maximum of 93 daily death can also be seen while cumulative death stands at 3，030.\n\n【11】Data normalization and performance criteria\n\n【12】To ensure all variables have the same treatment and to eliminate their dimensional discrepancy， data Normalization is usually applied for AI-based modeling . Therefore， the data were normalized to fall between 0 and 1 as：\n\n【13】Where D，D，D. and D are the normalized data， ith data value， minimum and maximum data values， respectively.\n\n【14】To determine the performance of the developed models， Determination Coefficient (DC) and Root Mean Square Error(RMSE) were employed ， given by：\n\n【15】Where CC is cumulative case of the ith value， N， cc， and CC are the number of observations， predicted values and mean of the observed values， respectively. The DC ranges between - o to 1 and RMSE between 0 to o with DC towards 1 and RMSE close to 0 imply high efficiency.\n\n【16】Artificial neural network (ANN)\n\n【17】ANN provides a determined approach in dealing with non-linear， noisy， and dynamic data， more specifically when the physical fundamental relationships are not completely known. Detail information regarding ANN can be found in study .\n\n【18】Results and Discussion\n\n【19】In this study， the potential of ANN in predicting cumulative COVID-19 cases in Nigeria was investigated. For machine learning applications， selection of the most appropriate inputs are significant in determining the most efficient prediction performance， as incorrect inputs may results in error and performance deficiency. Recent studies including Ibrahim et al.  show that using COVID-19 cases at previous time step may lead to accurate prediction. However， the daily COVID-19 cases as well as the daily and cumulative death could have a significant impact on cumulative cases. Therefore， in this study，5 different models were developed using different input combination to determine the highest performance. Table 2 shows the developed models and their training and validation percentages.\n\n【20】For the ANN model in both stations， FFBP was used for the model training using Levenberg Marquardt (LM) algorithm. Single hidden layer was used and via trial and error， the best number of hidden laver neurons was selected. Table 3 shows the results of the developed models. The structure x-y-z implies number of inputs， hidden layer neurons and output layer， respectively.\n\n【21】As shown in Table 3， different inputs combination led to different performance. These results show that using COVID-19 cumulative cases at previous time and other data could be employed sufficiently for COVID-19 case prediction. In the training phase， it can be seen that M2 (CCCCCCCC )，M4 (New case， new death， CCp CC2) and M5 (New case， new death，CCr.3p CC a) provided the best prediction performance in terms of DC with 0.9999 value. However， with respect to RMSE，M4 (New case， new death， CC CC) produced better skill than all other models with 0.0004 value. Therefore，this demonstrated the rationality of combining daily cases and death with previous cumulative cases to enhance prediction performance.\n\n【22】In the validation phase in Table 3， it can be seen that despite the nonlinear aspect of ANN and its ability to deal with uncertain stochastic phenomena， the performance of ANN decreases in the validation phase. Similar to the training phase， M4 in the validation phase led to best performance with lowest error RMSE=0.0017 and highest goodness of fit DC=0.9996. Comparing the results of this study with that of Ibrahim et al.  it can be seen that despite having same study location (Nigeria)，performance of the ANN model in this study is superior. Many issues could lead to the discrepancy in the results. (i) The duration of the data could play a major role in the performance as this study covered entire period from the day of first cases in Nigeria  to where decline in number of cases started. This implies that the study covered both the peak and least periods of the pandemic which might results in proper simulation of the uncertainty surrounding the system. (ii) The study by Ibrahim et al.  employed only the previous time step for their prediction while this study shows that addition of the cases and death input data could enhance prediction of the pandemic. Figure 2 shows the graphical comparison of the developed models.\n\n【23】Table 1： Statistical description of the used data.\n\n| Data  | Period  | Minimum  | Maximum  | St. deviation  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| New case  | 28-02-2020-31-12-2021  | 0  | 6158  | 460.17  |\n| Cumulative case  | 28-02-2020-31-12-2021  | 1  | 241513  | 75734.58  |\n| New death  | 28-02-2020-31-12-2021  | 0  | 93  | 6.97  |\n| Cumulative death  | 28-02-2020-31-12-2021  | 0  | 3030  | 914.75  |\n\n【25】Table 2： Models development with their training and validation subsamples.\n\n| Model  | Inputs  | Training subsample  | Validation subsample  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| M1  | CCi-1gCCn-2pCCrapCC | 75%  | 25%  |\n| M2  | CC-spCC1-5pCCf6FCC471  | 75%  | 25%  |\n| M3  | New case， new death， cum. death  | 75%  | 25%  |\n| M4  | New case， new death， CCerjCCnt2)  | 75%  | 25%  |\n| M5  | New case， new death，CCfneaja CCvc)  | 75%  | 25%  |\n\n| Table 3： Results of the developed models.  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Model  | Structure  | DC  | RMSE  | DC  | RMSE  |\n| M1  | 4-10-1  | 0.9978  | 0.004  | 0.9637  | 0.0473  |\n| M2  | 4-7-1  | 0.9999  | 0.0014  | 0.9993  | 0.0023  |\n| M3  | 3-8-1  | 0.9998  | 0.0035  | 0.9836  | 0.0109  |\n| M4  | 4-11-1  | 0.9999  | 0.0004  | 0.9996  | 0.0017  |\n| M5  | 4-9-1  | 0.9999  | 0.0011  | 0.9991  | 0.0026  |\n\n【28】The radar chart shown in Figure 2 compares the performance of the 5 developed models based on DC and RMSE. From the chart， as goodness of fit measure， the more open and wider the chart is， the better performance based on DC. While narrower chart signifies the most efficient performance with respect to RMSE. It can be seen from Figure 2 that all models led to performance close to 1. Similarly， the models performed excellent with a relatively small error for RMSE. This is an indication that once ANN model is well developed， the performance indicators irrespective of whether graphical or tabular approach is used the results would be accurate. Figure 3 compares the performances ofthe developed models against the observed data.\n\n【29】For violin plots shown in Figure 3， the internal line represents the range of the values while the white central dot signifies mean of the data values. The more similarity and resemblance a model have with the observed data， the more efficient COVID-19 prediction， thus， as seen in Figure 3， all the models have a close resemblance with the observed data， which indicates the accurate performance by all models.\n\n【30】Conclusion\n\n【31】In this study， Machine Learning (ML) approach was employed to predict cumulative COVID-19 cases in Nigeria. For this purpose， cumulative data at previous time step (up to 7-day period) as well as daily cases， daily death and cumulative death were used as inputs for 5different models based on Artificial Neural Network (ANN).\n\n【32】The results showed that with unique inputs of the applied models， different results were achieved. The obtained results demonstrated that M4 (New case， new death， CCCC) provided the most efficient performance in terms of DC and RMSE. This emphasizes the need of combining both cases at previous step and other COVID-19data for successful prediction of cumulative cases in Nigeria. The results indicated that provided an efficient input selection approach and sufficient quality data are achieved， a successful prediction of COVID-19 cases in Nigeria could be achieved using ANN. The results of this study could be useful in policy making and in prediction of other COVID related diseases. Further studies should involve other machine learning approaches and other countries in Africa.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 11:39:57", "endTime": "2024/09/24 11:40:49", "cost": 51.752}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:29", "update_time": "2024-09-23 19:40:49", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 19:39:57"}

Also， there are relatively few literature data referring to the etiological hypotheses of this condition. This paper presents our results regarding the histopathological appearance highlighted in surgically resected venous aneurysm specimens that reveal the potential causes that lead to this condition onset， as well as a brief review the literature data. At the same time， current therapeutic options are discussed.\n\n【2】Keywords： Primary venous aneurysm etiology； Endophlebohypertophy； Endophlebosclerosis\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Isolated Venous Aneurysms (VA) can be defined as a focal dilation at least two or three times larger than the diameter of the venous trunk， and it should not be contained in a varicose vein segment . VA is a relatively rare abnormality (literature data reveal a number between 300 and500 cases described around the world so far) . However， the etiology of VA is uncertain. This article discusses possible hypothesis of etiology for VA by presenting our results obtained from morphological analysis of several specimens (surgically resected VA， optical microscopy analyses) and a brief review of literature.\n\n【5】Methodology\n\n【6】Seven specimens (surgically resected primary VA) from 7 different patients (4 females， 3 males， age： 44.6± 8.2 years， BMI： 29.1±3.4)， were analyzed by the Pathology Laboratory (Hematoxylin-Eosin and the Masson trichrome stain). Our results were compared with literature data searched in PubMed and Google Scholar database (publications in English written from the establishment of the database to September 2022).\n\n【7】Results\n\n【8】Sixgreat saphenous vein aneurysms measuring between 2.2/1.5 cm and5.5/3.8 cm，and one small saphenous vein aneurysm (2.3/2.1 cm) were analyzed. Histological examination demonstrated that the pathophysiological processes which occur once with primary venous aneurysm development， involve all layers of the vein wall. Irregular intimal surface with disrupted endothelial layer and marked cellular infiltration of the intimal layer was noted in most of the cases. For that reason， intima appears thicker than the media， due to the pronounced infiltration. Most affected seems to be tunica media， where there is significant degradation of collagen fibers， fibrosis， and a reduction in the number of vascular smooth muscle cells. Progressive loss of smooth muscle tissue is most likely due to inefficient reparative elastogenesis. In some places， the tunica media is replaced by hyalinized connective tissue， and the elastic lamina is damaged. At the level of the tunica media and tunica externa， an inflammatory reaction occurs with predominantlylymphocytes and macrophages，which form vascular-associated lymphoid tissue and develop vasa vasorum thickening. The inflammatory reaction is present in places， consists mainly of lymphocytes and macrophages， eosinophils， neutrophils， and plasma cells may be present . In 2 cases， a thrombus (adherent to the endo-vein surface) was noticed.\n\n【9】Discussion\n\n【10】Chronic Venous Disease (CVD) is a common pathology that significantly affects patient’s quality of life . However， on the opposite side， primary venous aneurysms are a relatively rare pathology. There are not many literature data related to the microscopic morphological appearance of varicose veins ， and no regarding venous aneurysms and their etiology， either.\n\n【11】Morphological analysis of various surgically resected specimens revealedi an aneurysm venousSwall with thickened， fibrotic， moderately cellular intima adiacent to a densely fibrotic adventitia fragmentation， attenuation of the elastic lamellae， and loss of smooth muscle cells. In the case of thrombosis， medial fibrosis in areas of thrombus adherence was observed . The cases we described present similarities with the microscopic morphology described in the literature. In the case of large venous aneurysms， the deposition of fibrous tissue between the smooth muscle lavers that explained the degeneration of the media can be considered the cause which led to their enlargement. There are theories that the development of VA is the result of the congenital absence of smooth muscle in the venous media ， associated with low amounts of elastin fibers and smooth muscle cells， fibrous connective tissue， and elastic fibers in the venous wall .Endophlebohypertophyand endophlebosclerosis，processes that occur with age， have also been considered to have a potential role in the development of aneurysms . Considering the age of the patients included in this study， our results plead for endophlebohypertophy (marked cellular infiltration of the intimal layer，intima appears thicker than the media)and endophlebosclerosis(fibrous tissue dispersed between the circular and longitudinal muscle layers， excessive subendothelial collagen deposition) as the most probable hypothesis of etiology.\n\n【12】Even if treatment guidelines are not clearly established and thus treatment strategies vary， depending on the location and clinical manifestations， some principles have been described . Some data recommend conservative treatment for uncomplicated or asymptomatic aneurysms， or with jugular， subclavian， thoracic， or visceral localization. There are also reported cases with iliac localization successfully treated conservatively by anticoagulant medication and inferior vena cava filter. In the case of symptomatic， complicated or growing aneurysms， or those located in the deep veins of the lower limbs， primary surgery is indicated. Interventions for aesthetic reasons have also been described. As surgical techniques， ligation/excision，tangential aneurysmectomyand lateral venography， resection of VA with interposition autologous vein graft can be practiced. The endovascular approach has also been described in some cases for subclavian VA . Cryostripping has been described as a feasible therapeutic alternative for the surgical resection of the venous segments containing the aneurysm 14.\n\n【13】Due to the decreased frequency of this disease， there are still insufficient studies that provide data for its etiology. For patients who are not in the first decades of life， we consider that the presence of aneurysms is due to the processes of endoflebosclerosis. The destruction of tunica media produced by the separation of the smooth muscle bundles and the significant deposits of fibrous tissue， which weaken the structure of the venous wall， allows aneurysmal dilatation. Multicentric studies which analyze more data about the VA etiology would be useful to reach a consensus. Regarding the treatment， most data， including our clinical experience， recommend venous aneurysm resection performed through different procedures as the first therapeutic option.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 11:36:18", "endTime": "2024/09/24 11:36:26", "cost": 7.621}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:29", "update_time": "2024-09-23 19:36:26", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 19:36:18"}

It is estimated that 32.1% ofchildren and adolescents in the United States are overweight or obese . However， if prevention is key， then greater emphasis should be directed toward programs that focus on youth in this country. Childhood and early adolescence represent a critical period of growth and maturation when youth are transitioning toward making their own decisions regarding lifestyle behaviors. This includes food choices as well as physical activity selection and participation. It also reflects a time of significant physical， physiological， and mental development before behaviors become so ingrained，they cannot change. Therefore， targeting children or early adolescents is key to the prevention of obesity and unhealthy lifestyle habits in the future. Schools provide an excellent opportunityto influence our nation’s youth because of the great amount of contact and infrastructural support they provide to nurture and educate students while communicating the right health messages to them. However， facing significant pressure to improve language arts， math and science scores， the attention to physical activity and obesity prevention has taken a back seat. The President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology has called for a 33% increase in Science， Technology， Engineering， And Mathematics (STEM) bachelors’degrees each year  and this college trend has trickled down to the public schools. However，public schools must learn how to be creative in integrating both physical activities and academics into the classroom in order to advance cognitive gains without sacrificing physical activity participation and improved metabolic fitness. By balancing both elements， schools can get the right health message across to students to help them maintain active， healthy lifestyle behaviors.\n\n【2】In the take 10 program， teachers implemented 10-min physical activity sessions integrated into the academic lessons. The 10-min sessions increased physical activity levels while also reinforcing academic skills and concepts learned in the classroom . The “Physical Activity across the Curriculum\"program was a 3-year expansion of this integrative curriculum. In programs providing>75 min/week of physical activity， body mass index declined. Significant gains in composite reading， math， and spelling scores were also observed . Using accelerometers in a similar Texas-I can study， students in the experimental group showed a significant increase in physical activity compared to controls along with a 20% increase in moderate-vigorous-physical activity. Furthermore， times on task or attention to the academic lessons were improved following the physical activity sessions . These types of active lessons using activities such as “cardiac relays\" and“spelling freeze tag\"not only improved physical and metabolic fitness but also enhanced academic learning. In the middle schools， Planet Health  and a N.Y. program  possessed integrative elements of academic instruction and physical activity； however， they were used in a different manner. In Planet Health， health-related units and brief sessions of physical activities were integrated into traditional classes such as language arts， math， and science. In both programs， the physical activities did not possess an academic component as implemented at the elementary level， however， physical activities did support health-related concepts taught in class. In the N.Y program， after one semester， insulin resistance， inflammatory markers， and percent body fat， were reduced. Future research should be directed toward finding the optimal types of physical activities for youth， whether they require an academic component for optimal results or not， and/or whether they should consider implementing an independent nutrition and exercise science curriculum incorporating physical activity.\n\n【3】It's time to move away from citing overweight and obesity statistics for every age， state， and race or sending home report cards of BMI to parents and their children. This information can be very psychologically distressing to children and adolescents. It’s well known that an increase in physical activity is associated with greater self-esteem， less body size dissatisfaction， and better academic performance . More emphasis is needed on how active lessons that integrate physical activities into the classroom can be interfaced in public school settings， in after-school settings， and/or in summer programs. The latest study among 1.7 million adults showed that those meeting cardiovascular and muscle strengthening guidelines also possessed lower rates of obesity . Finding creative solutions to improve metabolic health and habitual physical activity in youth is where we should be headed and the obesity problem will take care ofitself. Incorporating physical activity into the classroom daily teaches our youth it's that important to incorporate it into their everyday lifestyle behaviors. Dropping or reducing physical activity or exercise conducted on a regular basis， sends the opposite and wrong health message. It’s time we get it right for the future of our nation's youth.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 10:55:46", "endTime": "2024/09/24 10:55:57", "cost": 11.134}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:29", "update_time": "2024-09-23 18:55:55", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 18:55:44"}

We wanted to present this case to emphasize the importance ofusing targeted agents in LG patients for whom treatment modalities are not clear.\n\n【4】Introduction\n\n【5】Lymphomatoid Granulomatosis (LG) is a rare lymphoproliferative disease associated with Epstein-Barr virus， characterized by multiple pulmonary nodular lesions with lymphocytic invasion of the vascular walls on biopsy . The most common presenting symptoms are cough， fever， malaise， weight loss， neurological abnormalities， and shortness of breath . Lesions in the lung are usually well circumscribed and consist of small lymphocytes， plasma cells， and a variable number of large atypical mononuclear cells. Most small lymphocytes are T cells， while large atypical cells are usually B cells . B cells typically express CD20， but rarely CD30. They are negative for CD15. Rarely， patients are asymptomatic and have histopathologically low-grade (grade 1 and 2) disease limited to the lungs. Sometimes spontaneous remission can occur in this patient group so these patients can be followed up with clinical and radiological evaluations. Active treatment is usually required if symptoms develop or if the disease progresses radiologically . In general， the recommended treatment options for high-grade (grade 3) LG consist of the treatment modalities used for Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL)， but there is not much data on the effectiveness of these treatments. Other recommended treatments include multi-agent chemotherapy and targeted agents such as anti-CD20 and anti-CD30 monoclonal antibodies (rituximab，brentuximab vedotin) .\n\n【6】Case Presentation\n\n【7】A 71-year-old female patient presented with complaints of cough， shortness of breath， and weight loss. In the whole body tomography imaging， a mass lesion with central hypodense soft tissue density， which filled the right hemithorax almost completely， was detected and there were multiple lymph nodes in the mediastinum . Trucut biopsy of the right lung was performed on the patient； pathology report was reported as compatible with CD20+， CD30+ Lymphoproliferative disease， Lymphomatoid Granulomatosis. The patient was planned to be treated with CD20and CD30 targeting agents， rituximab and brentuximab vedotin， and the antineoplastic agent bendamustine. Rituximab 375 mg/m’1 day， brentuximab vedotin 1.8 mg/kg 1% day， bendamustine90 mg/m²1+2 Day； treatment was started every 28 days. After the first course of treatment， the patient’s clinical complaints regressed significantly. After 3 cures of treatment， the patient was evaluated by taking a tomography again. Almost complete regression was detected in the lung mass lesion and mediastinallymph nodes . After the patient's treatment was completed for 6 cycles， it was planned to discontinue bendamustine and continue with rituximab and brentuximab vedotin targeting agents.\n\n【8】Discussion\n\n【9】LG was first described in 1972 by Liebow et al. It is a very rare type of extranodal lymphoma and it exhibits a very characteristic angiodestructive behavior. High-grade cases are considered to be aggressive high-grade lymphomas and patients require prompt and intensive treatment with immunochemotherapy agents including rituximab . In our case， besides CD 20 positivity， CD 30 was also detected. Thereupon， we added brentuximab vedotin treatment together with rituximab to our patient who had a mass lesion covering the rightlung. We alsopreferred bendamustine as a chemotherapeutic agent and we obtained a very satisfactory result in our patient.

As per guideline， Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMZ) is the recommended regimen for managing Pneumocystis Jirovecii Pneumonia (PJP). However，TMP/SMZ is associated with the serious side effect of drug induced hemolytic anemia associated with Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. Although substitute regiment does exist， the success rate of using those alternative regimens is below 80% except for the combination use of TMP and dapsone， which is also a medication contraindicated in patients with G6PD deficiency. Jennifer et al.  therefore suggested avoiding using TMP/SMZ in patient with the deficiency of G6PD. On the other hand， a literature reviews done by Youngster et al.  Suggested that TMP/SMZ is probably safe when given in usual therapeutic dose. Together with the inconclusive recommendations， there was also no real-world experience on the use of TMP/SMZ in G6PD deficiency patients in Taiwan. In this article， we reported a G6PD deficient patient whom recovered from PJP by administration of TMP/SMZ.\n\n【8】Case Presentation\n\n【9】A 31-year-old Han Taiwanese man with a history of G6PD deficiency was admitted due to fever， cough， fatigue， muscle soreness and occasional dyspnoea for 20 days. After admission， Chest X-Ray (CXR) revealed bilateral infiltration. The White Blood Cell (WBC) count was 5200 cells/mL， N-Seg 72.3%， lymph 19.2%， Hemoglobin (Hb) 13.2 g/dL， platelet 231，000/mL， Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) 16 mg/dL， Creatinine (Cr) 0.8 mg/dL， Sodium (Na) 136 mmol/L， Potassium (K)3.6 mmol/L， Aspartate Transaminase (AST) 30 U/L， Alanine Amino Transferase (ALT) 21 U/L and total bilirubin 0.7 mg/dL. Blood and sputum acid fast satin， TB culture， pneumococcal and legionella urinary antigen test， Mycoplasma IgM， Chlamydophila IgM， Toxoplasma IgG all showed negative. High-Resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT) was arranged and showed diffuse Ground-Glass Opacities (GGO) and thickening of interlobular septum. PJP was then considered. HIV EIA and HIV western blot both showed positive result. CD4 counts were 50 cells/mm’. HIV RNA (Ribonucleic Acid) load was 45588copies/ml. Oxygen supplement was delivered and TMP/SMZ 240mg/1200 mg intravenously was given every eight hours. At Day-13 of TMP/SMZ treatment， a review of medication was preformed and the issue of G6PD deficiency history was raised. The blood test was done immediately and Hb was 11.6 g/dL， total bilirubin was 0.7 mg/dL， direct bilirubin was 0.3 mg/dL. With no obvious sign and symptoms as well as episode of acute hemolytic， the TMP/ SMZ treatment was continued. At Day-16， under stable condition， the patient was discharged with oral TMP/SMZ240 mg/1200 mg three times a day for five more days and an Out-Patient Department (OPD) appointment was arranged. After 21 days ofPJP treatment completed， aprophylaxis dose of TMP/ SMZ 160 mg/800 mg once daily was given until CD4reach 200 cells/mm. The G6PD enzyme activities were measured by quantitative fluorescence assay and showed a level of 0.6 U/g Hb(reference range： 6.4 U/g Hb to 12.9 U/g Hb) which was classified as severe enzyme activity deficiency by the definition defined by World Health Organization (WHO) .\n\n【10】Discussion\n\n【11】G6PD deficiency is the most commonly inherited Red Blood Cell (RBC) enzymatic defect， affecting around 400 million people worldwide . About 7.5% of the world population carries one or two genes for G6PD deficiency. It is an X-linked genetic disorder with 187 known allelic mutations . In Taiwan， G6PD deficiency prevalence between male and female were approximately 2.81% and0.7% respectively.\n\n【12】TMP/SMZ is used in a variety of infectious diseases and is the recommended treatment option in current practice for managing PJP ； however， it is associated with hemolysis when administered to G6PD deficient patients. Chisholm-Burns et al.  demonstrated a case with of African ethnicity with G6PD deficiency that experienced hemolysis after administration of double strength of TMP/SMZ orally for eight days. Reinke et al.  also reported a black woman with HIV infection who received only one dose of TMP/SMZ intravenously for managing PJP which then resulted in acute hemolysis. On the contrary literature had reported challenging G6PD subjects with genetic variant alleles. A commonly observed in the African population， with TMP/SMZ at the dose of 320/1600mg every 12 h. The level ofhemoglobin did not decrease significantly nor did any hemolysis occur throughout the trial . The possible explanation was that the regeneration rate of hemoglobin was faster than destruction of hemoglobin in G6PD A-variant population. However， the severity of hemolytic anemia varies among individuals with G6PD deficiency. Specific G6PD alleles are associated with G6PD variants with different enzyme activity and， therefore， result in different levels of disease severity . In Southeast Asia， the most common variant alleles appear to be G6PD Kaiping and Canton， which are different from the western or African ethnicity . To date， there is still insufficient evidence for the population in Taiwan to suggest a robust relationship between our G6PD variant alleles and the degree of disease severity with regards to the safety in the use of TMP/SMZ in G6PD deficiency .\n\n【13】Conclusion\n\n【14】The experience and evidence regarding safety in the use of TMP/SMZ in G6PD deficient HIV infected patients is not vet clear. Herein， we documented a case of a G6PD deficient HIV infected man successfully treated the PJP with high dose of TMP/SMZ without any signs and symptoms of hemolysis.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 11:30:46", "endTime": "2024/09/24 11:31:32", "cost": 46.081}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:29", "update_time": "2024-09-23 19:31:32", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 19:30:45"}

Gastroesophageal fibroscopy and histopathological examination confirmed the presence of mucormycosis which was treated with fluconazole， amphotericin and gastrectomy.\n\n【3】Discussion： Mucormycosis is a rare fungal infection that primarily affects immunocompromised individuals including those with poorly controlled diabetes. The symptoms are quite diverse. Diagnosis is established by detailed microscopic and histopathological evaluation. Treatment varies from single antifungal treatment to gastrectomy. In our case the patient was treated by antifungal therapy combined with gastrectomy.\n\n【4】Conclusion： Gastric mucormycosis is a very rare entity. Clinical manifestations are not very characteristic. Antifungal treatment and surgical debridement are the pillar of treatment. Gastrectomy should be performed as soon as possible if single anti-fungal treatment and surgical debridement are unavailing.\n\n【5】Introduction\n\n【6】Mucormycosis is a very rare and potentially fatal infection caused by fungi of the subphylum Mucoromycotina. It can touch any organ system， but the most common are the airways， sinuses， orbit， lungs or brain . Even though rare， gastrointestinal involvement in mucormycosis has also been reported2.\n\n【7】It accounts for around 7% of all recorded cases and it is associated with high mortality rates particularly in immunocompromised patients with hematological malignancies， transplant recipients and poorly controlled diabetes . Clinical signs generally depend on the initial site of onset.\n\n【8】The main route of infection is inhalation. However， for the gastrointestinal tract， ingestion of filaments is involved . Early surgical management and removal of necrotic tissue， appropriate antifungal treatment and control of risk factors such as diabetes are the cornerstones of effective management of this infectious disease .\n\n【9】We present here a case of gastric mucormycosis which was revealed by profuse hematemesis and abdominal pain that successfully treated by antifungal and timely gastrectomy.\n\n【10】Case Presentation\n\n【11】A 56-year-old man， unbalanced diabetes， complained of abdominal pain， fever and nausea. He presented gradually worsening anorexia and recent profuse hematemesis.\n\n【12】The general physical examination revealed fever， tachycardia and laboratory investigations showed systemic inflammation and acute renal failure.\n\n【13】Urgent gastroesophageal fibroscopy showed an ulcerated and proliferative tumor involving the entire gastric body， sparing the antrum， with extensive deep ulcerations covered with fibrin and hard peripheral mucosal buds .\n\n【14】Biopsies were obtained and histopathological examination revealed highly active antral gastritis with Helicobacter pylori infection， areas of intestinal metaplasia， as well as the presence of mucormycosis (spores and non-septate mycelial filaments) and gastric candidiasis. the patient’s renal function has been adjusted and he was treated with fluconazole， amphotericin， antibiotics targeting H. pylori， and a proton pump inhibitor.\n\n【15】The evolution was highlighted by a clinical worsening with persistent hematemesis， tachycardia and a decrease in hemoglobin despite transfusions.\n\n【16】We opted for emergency surgical treatment. A total gastrectomy and esophagojejunostomy was performed， the specimen was sent for histological analysis  and the patient was referred to intensive care. The clinical and biological course was excellent.\n\n【17】A brain-face-chest-abdomen and pelvis computed tomography was performed， which did not show any other location of the disease.\n\n【18】Anatomopathological examination of the specimen confirmed the diagnosis of gastric mucormycosis .\n\n【19】Discussion\n\n【20】We reported d asuccessful surgical treatment foOrrgastric mucormycosis. The main strength of our work is the choice of the surgical treatment and its timely performance in cases of single medicaltreatment failure.\n\n【21】Mucormycosis is a rare but life-threatening fungal infection that primarily affects immunocompromised individuals， including those with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus， recipients of organ transplant ， or even with an intact immunity system .\n\n【22】These underlying factors not only predispose to the disease but also worsen the outcome of patients . Diabetic ketoacidosis， as seen in our patient with a history of poor therapeutic compliance creates a favorable environment for fungal growth due to elevated blood glucose levels and impaired host defense mechanisms .\n\n【23】Thetransmissionn mechanism OI mucormycosis entails ingestion or inhalation of spores， and direct inoculation of damaged mucocutaneous surfaces While pulmonary and rhinocerebral are the most common presentations ， gastrointestinal mucormycosis was extremely rare.\n\n【24】It accounts for around 7% of all recorded cases， and has a poor prognosis， with a mortality rate of 85% . The stomach is most often involved which is followed by the colon and ileum .\n\n【25】The symptoms are quite diverse， ranging from non-specific abdominal pain， fever and vomiting to hematemesis， hematochezia and even g intestinal perforation. Thereare unfortunately no PCR-based or serological tests available for early diagnosis .\n\n【26】Diagnosis isestablished by detailed microscopi1cCanc histopathological evaluation of a tissue biopsy that shows aseptate， fungal hyphae in proximity to necrotic areas . This can be obtained endoscopically or surgically .\n\n【27】The cornerstone of invasive gastric mucormycosis treatment is intravenous antifungal therapy， combined in some cases with surgical debridement or gastrectomy Rapid initiation of antifungalttherapy improveddpatients prognosis whereas delayed treatment has been associated with a two-fold increase in mortality rates . While no consensus has been reached on the optimal antifungal treatment， amphotericin B is recommended as first-line therapy . Polyene antifungal agents and liposomal formulations have proven to be effective due to their low nephrotoxicity， however the role of combination antifungal therapy is uncertain . Single antifungal treatment is generally insufficient. Surgical debridement of necrotic tissue， sometimes leading to total gastrectomy， is necessary for the effective treatment of invasive mucormycosis .\n\n【28】Gastric mucormycosis generates tissue necrosis， which can impede the penetration of antifungal agents to the site of infection. Rapid debridement of all damaged tissue， seems appropriate in order to prevent the spread of mucormycosis to adjacent structures and to reduce the mass of infecting molds . In fact， Roden et al. trial revealed that surgery was an independent predictor of improved outcomes . In addition， A. Chakrabarti and al suggested that combination of surgery and amphotericin B was significantly better than single antifungal therapy in terms of survival rate (79.6% vs.51.7% patient survival) .\n\n【29】In our case， we opted for a total timely gastrectomy after failure of the single medical treatment.\n\n【30】In summary， we reported the case of a 56-year-old diabetic patient complaining of abdominal pain and hematemesis due to a gastric mucormycosis diagnosed by urgent gastroesophageal fibroscopy and histopathological examination of a tissue biopsy and treated successfully by an antifungal treatment and an early total gastrectomy.\n\n【31】Our case highlights that early diagnosis， prompt initiation of antifungal therapy， management of underlying conditions and a timely indication of surgical treatment， are crucial for favorable outcomes.\n\n【32】Conclusion\n\n【33】Gastric mucormycosis is a very rare entity that can affect patients who are usually predisposed， such as immunocompromised patients and diabetics， but also immunocompetent patients.\n\n【34】Clinical manifestations are not very characteristic and the confirmation ofdiagnosilsSis based anatomopathological examination.\n\n【35】Early antifungal therapy and surgical debridement of all necrotic tissues are the pillar of treatment.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 11:13:31", "endTime": "2024/09/24 11:14:15", "cost": 43.769}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:29", "update_time": "2024-09-23 19:14:14", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 19:13:30"}

According to the CDC， MDD affects more than 16.1 million American adults， or about 6.7% of the U.S. population age 18 and older in a given year. People suffering from MDD experience sadness， anhedonia， feelings of guilt， loss of energy， lack of concentration， loss in appetite， and psychomotor symptoms with possible suicidal ideation. It is a mental disease that unfortunately is still marginalized and ostracized in society today. We wrote this case report in hopes of raising awareness for depression and how it can affect individuals through secondary pathways.\n\n【2】Background\n\n【3】The role of the gut microbiome and its correlation with the production and dissemination of serotonin is still a relatively novel concept and one that has not been give its due amongst the scientific community. By showing how intrinsic the enteric nervous system and its maintenance is to promoting the production of various neurotransmitters involved in mental health diseases， we hope to make its role intricate to the understanding of mental illness and its potential treatment going forward. Gastric acid is involved in the primary function ofpreparing food for digestion and absorption by the intestine. Acid production is a central component of the stomach's contribution to digestion. Low gastric acid means higher susceptibility to food poisoning. Proton pump inhibitors use can cause diarrhea， enteric infections， and alter the gastrointestinal bacterial population by suppressing the gastric acid barrier leading to Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth (SIBO) . Normally when food leaves the stomach， it is acidic， and it leads to changes in pH and the pancreas and gallbladder release pancreatic juice and bile but if the stomach is not producing gastric acid， the gallbladder stops releasing bile. Prolonged PPI treatment produces bowel symptoms and symptoms such as cramps，hypotension and hypomagnesemia. The gallbladder has a very important role to play as the same nutrients that work in the gallbladder produce bile. Therefore， when a patient undergoes cholecystectomy， they develop an imbalance of neurotransmitters. Bile makes glycine and taurine and when it is depleted we cannot absorb calcium and this leads to hypocalcemia. Gallbladder bile rinses bacteria off the intestinal lining and the bacteria sticks to the wall increasing its bowel population leading to gastrointestinal symptoms such as malabsorption. This now increasing enteric bacterial populace leads to the formation of the \"leaky gut”bacteria causing inflammation and depression by increased intestinal permeability associated with an upload of Lipopolysaccharide(LPS) translocation which induces depression symptoms . Hence gut microbiota and probiotics alter behavior and brain neurochemistry.\n\n【4】Case Presentation\n\n【5】In the case of our patient we had a 62-year-old female who had suffered from years of Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) as well as obesity class 1 with a BMI of 33. Our patient also complained of alternating bowel movements， abdominal cramps， dyspepsia， and years of H2receptor blockers and PPI use， as well as recurring cholecystitis and its affiliated symptoms. In March of 2017 our patient underwent a cholecystectomy after feeling months of gastric discomfort and dyspepsia and had finally had enough and could no longer further prolong her discomfort. Her ultrasound imaging and lab results pointed to a diagnosis of cholelithiasis with concurrent cholecystitis and she presented to the ER with intractable abdominal pain in the right upper quadrant. After initial stabilization with fluids， antibiotic treatment， and pain management， the patient in agreement with the consulting Gastrointestinal (GI) physician， decided to have a cholecystectomy performed as she had been struggling with cholecystitis for years now. The procedure was done laparoscopically with no post operational complications. Three months later the patient presented with severe fatigue and weight gain and the recurrence of her pre-cholecystectomy symptoms. Additionally she did not feel like leaving her house， stopped socializing with her friends， felt a loss of energy and just seemed to stop caring about things. She was taken to her primary care physician， who referred her back to her GI doctor， and recommended a psychiatry consult. After standard imaging and pertinent lab results conducted by the GI physician failed to show any causal gastro intestinal factors that could be contributing to our patients state she visited a psychiatrist who，based on her presenting symptoms， diagnosed her with moderate depression secondary to the life stresses compounded by her recent surgery. The purpose of this report is to theorize how her enteric system undergoing chronic inflammation along with her cholecystectomy further exacerbated the inflammation and ultimately lead to her depression， highlighting the “Leaky Gut\"phenomenon.\n\n【6】Past medical history\n\n【7】Past family history\n\n【8】Thepatient's father and motherboth had ahistory ofhypertension， gastroesophageal reflux disease and hyperlipidemia. Both parents now deceased， died of cardiac causes.\n\n【9】Past social history\n\n【10】Patient denies use of alcohol， nicotine and illegal drugs.\n\n【11】Differential diagnosis\n\n【12】Social Anxiety\n\n【13】Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease\n\n【14】Post-cholecystectomy Syndrome\n\n【15】Cholecystitis\n\n【16】Cholelithiasis\n\n【17】Factitious Disorder\n\n【18】Munchausen Syndrome\n\n【19】Major Depression Disorder\n\n【20】Generalized Anxiety Disorder\n\n【21】Panic Disorder\n\n【22】Primary Hypertension\n\n【23】Secondary Hypertension\n\n【24】Treatment\n\n【25】The patient besides mild pain following surgery felt well post-surgeryand had hoped her symptoms of abdominal pain， continuous GERD， IBS， and nausea would get better. She was prescribed cholestyramine andesomeprazole to deal with any residual symptoms post-surgery. The patient was also scheduled to follow up with a dietician who prescribed a course of medical nutrition therapy individualized to our patient， and to follow up with her PCP to better manage her other chronic medical concerns and for medication reconciliation. The patient was advised to limit fat intake， increase dietary fiber gradually， and to avoid caffeinated and carbonated drinks， chocolate， citrus products， spicy foods and to eat small meals. Due to a combination of factors including non-compliance with proposed dietary restrictions and inability to comply with her PCP's instructions pertaining to maintaining a healthier lifestyle， our patient experienced a return of pre-surgical symptoms as well as a sudden loss of interest in activities of daily living and was diagnosed with moderate depression by a psychiatrist. The psychiatrist after a careful review of the patient’s file suggested a thorough course of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)， a modified and realistic diet in consultation with a dietician， a workout routine and therapy sessions relating to the patient’s depression and eating habits. After two months of little improvement， the patient was started on Wellbutrin XL by her psychiatrist keeping the associated weight gain with other antidepressants in mind. The patient was instructed to take Wellbutrin XL 150 mg once daily in the morning for the first 4 days after which she would start on Wellbutrin XL 300 mg once daily.\n\n【26】Outcome and Follow-Up\n\n【27】Although our patient was given the appropriate post-op care， she initially did feet better but then began to deteriorate to her pre-surgery levels in terms of symptoms and in addition developed this new feeling of being depressed all the time which could have been related to her non-compliance with the physician ordered lifestyle recommendations in terms of her diet and other appropriate lifestyle changes. After a psychiatric consult and initial assessment， the patient tried to be more adherent to the recommendations and hoped her CBT sessions， therapy， and new dietary guidelines coupled with exercise would alleviate her concerns yet she continued to feel depressed and continued to have abdominal symptoms similar to what she felt before she had her cholecystectomy. The patient was then prescribed Wellbutrin XL and advised to continue her CBTand follow her dietary， exercise， and healthy lifestyle recommendations. After an intense and strict adherence to her diet/exercise/CBT routine together with the medication the patient experienced mild relief within five months post-surgery， her abdominal symptoms had disappeared， and she had started to lose weight and felt happier. The patient started to socialize more and took up a proactive approach to bettering her eating habits and other lifestyle choices. The Wellbutrin XL initially started at 150 mg once a day was increased to 300 mg once today after the initial four day period and then maintained as the patient did not feel like there was any need for an adjustment.\n\n【28】Discussion\n\n【29】A dysbiotic state leads to increased intestinal permeability and allows contents such as bacterial metabolites and molecules as well as bacteria themselves to leak through the submucosa and into the systemic circulation， a phenomenon aptly named leaky gut syndrome . In our digestive gut， sugar precursors E. coli &proteobacteria Bifidobacterial species act on the chorismite from where E. Coli， proteobacteria， B. subtilis， firm elves， mycobacterium and actinobacteria leads to formation of tryptophan which in the intestinal epithelial cells causes serotonin production in the gut. When the concentration of these bacteria is reduced due to antibiotics or PPI use， it decreases their quantity in the gut and the lack of bile post-cholecystectomy prevents the cleansing ofthe gut liningto get rid ofthe bad bacteria. This in part leads to less tryptophan and serotonin being produced in the enteric system，leading to depression. Tryptophan is synthesized from chorismite by members of several bacterial phyla including protein bacterium， actinobacterium & fircules. E. Coli can synthesize chorismite， a tryptophan precursor， which acts as a branch point for microbial metabolic pathways consistent with this key role for bacteria. Antibiotics and PPI treatment alters tryptophan and undoes metabolism leading to less serotonin and melatonin in the brain. Tryptophan， tyrosine， and phenylalanine are made in the gut. When tryptophan is shuttled through the kynurenine pathway there is less tryptophan available to make serotonin and hence less serotonin in the gut available to be transported to the brain via the vagal nerve. Low bile，post-cholecystectomy， causes leaky gut as bile acid stimulates biliary lipid secretion due to their physical chemical properties. They can form mixed micelles together with biliary phospholipids which allows the solubilizing in bile of cholesterol and other lipophilic compounds. Mixed micelles also account for the emulsion of dietary fat and lip soluble vitamins in the gut， helping their absorption. Bile acids also facilitate intestinal calcium absorption. At the intestinal level， bile acids are known to modulate pancreatic enzyme secretion and cholecystokinin release. Moreover， they are potent anti-microbial agents that prevent bacterial over growth in the small bowel.\n\n【30】There is also a systemic IgM-mediated immune response in depression directed against LPS (which is part of the bacterial wall of gram negative bacteria) suggesting that bacterial translocation may play a role in the inflammatory and pathophysiology of clinical depression. Bacterial translocation indicates the presence of “leaky gut”or an increased permeability of the gut wall or loosening of the tight junction barrier . Hyperactivity of the HPA axis is also one of the most reliable biological findings in patients suffering from major depression. Exposure to stress and cytokine responses may impair neuronal plasticity and stimulation of neurotransmission. Administration of exogenous IL-1b significantly enhances IL-1b levels in the Pre-frontal Cortex (PFC) and hippocampus and further increases Hypothalamic， Pituitary， and Adrenal (HPA) axis activity. Likewise， acute stress markedly increases IL-1b levels in the PFC， hippocampus and hypothalamus. Repeated stress sensitizes the HPA axis response to administration of exogenous IL-1b and possibly leads to depression .\n\n【31】The gut is composed of nerve tissues and uses neurotransmitters to communicate with the brain. The gut microbiota affects brain development and plasticity by secreting various neurotrophins and proteins， such as Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF)， synaptophysin and postsynaptic density . Our brain has an intimate connection with our gut via vagal nerve， which has hundreds of millions of nerves cells that regulate our digestive processes. This“second brain\" in the gut is spread out throughout the entire length of the gut. This second brain has many sensors in the enteric nervous system. The connection between depression and the gut is integrative from serotonin in the gut and how it relates to serotonin in the brain. Many patients with depression complain of constipation. This might be due to 95% of our serotonin being produced and stored in the gut via enterochromaffin cells which leads to modulation of mood， appetite， and well-being. The serotonin in the gut is synthesized from the food that we inject and the microbes that live in our gut that stimulate the production of serotonin. 60% of the production is due to the signals that come from the microbes in our gut. The serotonin cells are sandwiched between the cells that make the lining ofthe gut. The cells have vagal nerve association and the signal when the cell is activated goes to the brain via the vagal nerve from where it is delivered into the limbic system. This case study involves a patient with a long history of GERD treated with H2 antagonists， PPIs， and a host of other medications over the vears who underwent a cholecystectomy. This was followed by symptoms of depression that required treatment with an ant-depressant coupled with healthier lifestyle changes and dietary restrictions.

Here， we reported the first case of a patient with alcoholic liver cirrhosis super infected by HCV presenting with a SAE of Eosinophilic Gastro Enteritis (EGE) complicating acute perforation during daclatasvir plus sofosbuvir therapy.\n\n【2】Abbreviations\n\n【3】CT： Computed Tomography； DAA： Direct-Acting Antiviral； EGE： Eosinophilic Gastro Enteritis； HCV： Hepatitis C Virus； SAE： Serious Adverse Event\n\n【4】Case Presentation\n\n【5】A 58-year-old Chinese man with history of alcoholic liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh A) more than10 years had been diagnosed with HCV infection (serum HCV RNA 6.85 logIU/mL， genotype 6a) and was treated with daclatasvir plus sofosbuvir. (Velpanat composed of velpatasvir 100 mg plus sofosbuvir 400 mg) The patient’s virological response was achieved at week 7， but his peripheral eosinophils rose from normalbaseline to 2.79×10/L . Since the patient was asymptomatic， the dual therapy was continued. On September 24，2017 (about at week 8)， the man was hospitalized due to sudden severe right upper abdominal pain， abdominal distention and a fever of 38.9℃. Blood examination showed elevated leukocytes of 13.06×10/L and eosinophils of 2.64×10/L，and slightly decreased hemoglobin and platelets. Erect plain abdominal radiograph showed free air in subphrenic space and hepatic hilar region . Abdominal CT showed intraperitoneal free air， perforation in duodenal bulb and thickened gastric and duodenal wells . Since the patient refused gastrointestinal endoscopy and surgical operation， symptomatic and supportive treatments and discontinuation of DAAs were conducted after specialist consultations. Thepatient’s abdominal symptoms alleviated and free air disappeared on the third day after the suddenness， the peripheral eosinophils almost restored to normal level on the fifth day ， and the patient was discharged with negative serum HCV RNA and normal eosinophils on the twelfth day. After discharged， the patient was asymptomatic and the negative serum HCV RNA and Discussion EGE is usually diagnosed by endoscopic biopsies showing eosinophilic infiltration. In this case， acute duodenal perforation stopped endoscopists from conducting endoscopy. However， abdominal pain， thickened gastric and duodenal walls in CT images with peripheral eosinophilia and no evidence of parasitic or extra intestinal disease met all of the three criteria established by Talley et al.  in addition， fast healing and no history and symptoms of peptic ulcer excluded the perforation secondary to peptic ulcer or cancer. Concordantly， a case with EGE presenting with gastric perforation has been reported.\n\n【6】EGE is speculated to be induced by some allergens in the diet or air. In this case， daclatasvir or sofosbuvir was highly suspected since peripheral eosinophilia occurred at week 2 during their exposure and disappeared within five days after their with drawl without corticoid or anti allergic therapy. Although EGE induced by DAAs has not been reported in the literature so far， drug-induced EGE correlated with minocycline and celecoxib has been reported. Compared with daclatasvir， sofosbuvir with much better safety profile constituted the“backbone” of most combination treatments . Thus， EGE in this case was perhaps related to daclatasvir. It is well known that additional cautions are needed in dealing with special patient populations {e.g. with end-stage renal disease or decompensated cirrhosis) . It means that the history of alcoholic liver cirrhosis perhaps enhanced the susceptibility. Concordantly， a patient with Child-Pugh A cirrhosis secondary to HCV genotype 3 suffered from an acute kidney injury after treatment with daclatasvir plus sofosbuvir .\n\n【7】DAA therapy largely simplifies the treatment of HCV infection. However， this case indicates that some DAAs needs further clinical assessment of their safety and also reminds us to re-emphasize the significance of comprehensive monitoring. Life-threatening SAE may occur in patients only with history of profound liver damage. In this case， to identify EGE by noticing peripheral eosinophilia and conducting endoscopy earlier， and to discontinue the therapy in time might prevent the life-threatening acute duodenal perforation.\n\n【8】Learning Points\n\n【9】When using DAAs， the comprehensive monitoring of adverse drug reaction is required.\n\n【10】EGE is usually diagnosed by endoscopic biopsies showing eosinophilic infiltration.\n\n【11】EGE induced by DAAs is uncommon but can be present， thus emphasizing the need to notice peripheral eosinophilia and conduct endoscopy earlier.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 11:22:51", "endTime": "2024/09/24 11:22:58", "cost": 7.923}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 02:09:29", "update_time": "2024-09-23 19:22:56", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 19:22:45"}
