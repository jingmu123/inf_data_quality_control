We took Tiger on， fixed him up， and he became our loving companion for nine years. Hearing about other stray and abandoned felines numbers grew to thirty-six colonies， and Tiger was joined by more than a dozen others.**\n\n【5】**Now， a quarter of a century on， the Lonely Miaow Association is an Incorporated Society with dozens of volunteers， and has rescued 11，649 stray and abandoned cats and kittens from 3，337colonies in the Auckland region at a cost of around $2 million.**\n\n【6】**Lonely Miaow Resources and Processes**\n\n【7】**Over the years Lonely Miaow has built up a number of strategic assets which enable us to humanely manage stray and abandoned cats.**\n\n【8】**Our volunteers are first and foremost， with excellent and hard-working people managing the functions of Administration， Cat Rescue， Foster Homes， Marketing， IT， Fundraising， and Finance. Each manager has a small team of volunteers， or in the case of Foster Homes a large team!**\n\n【9】**OPEN ACCESS**\n\n【10】**_\\*Correspondence：_**\n\n【11】**_Peter Dormon， Stray Cats New Zealand_ _Trust， New Zealand，_ _E-mail： straycatsnz@gmail.com_ Received Date： 19 Dec 2022Accepted Date： 18 Jan 2023 _Published Date： 23 Jan 2023_**\n\n【12】**Lonely Miaow has a comprehensive database， devised in the first instance by Natalija James， and enhanced and expanded by Simon Morris， and Lisa Lu our Marketing Manager. All incoming calls and communications from the public are entered onto the Call Log database and resolved or moved on to the Colony Record database. Members of the public can now also log a new colony directly through our website， which has reduced the number of calls and enabled our Cat Rescue Manager to action rescues more quickly. Each colony is automatically assigned a number， as is each rescued cat. Each cat is assigned to a colony and a colony is closed once all the cats there have been rescued. Each cat is Outcome once it leaves the care of Lonely Miaow. The great majority are vet checked， desexed， vaccinated， defleaed， dewormed， and microchipped before finding their new forever home with a caring and responsible member of the public. A number of key Management Reports are readilyo3S1btainable from our database on the cats and colonies. This data was used by Mark Farnworth and Glenn Aguilar of Unitec in their ground-breaking report\"Distribution characteristics of unmanaged cat colonies over a 20-year period in Auckland\"published in Applied Geography in December 2013.**\n\n【13】**_Citation：_**\n\n【14】**_Dormon P.

As well as our own volunteers going out to colony locations to directly rescue the stray and abandoned cats， we often loan cages to members of the public who have unwanted strays on their property. Each cat rescued is taken to a local vet for a temperament and health assessment， with the great majority being collected by a local foster home\\[1\\].**\n\n【18】**Lonely Miaow Focus and Strategy**\n\n【19】**We focus on stray and abandoned cats in unmanaged colonies in the Auckland region. We are**\n\n【20】**not involved with owned or feral cats， nor do we manage stray cat colonies.**\n\n【21】**Our management strategy is Trap， Assess， Resolve. We do not return a cat to a situation where its health and welfare are not being cared for. We work with members of the public who report stray cat colonies to us to achieve the best outcome for the individual cat， and we welcome collaboration with other rescue groups.**\n\n【22】**Reasons for our focus I am sure are clear to all. In spite of the significant numbers mentioned at the start of this talk Lonely Miaow has not made a substantial impact on the overall total. A guesstimate figure of 200，000 stray and abandoned cats in Auckland was published in Animals’ Voice in 2012， which could mean around 1 million unwanted kittens born in Auckland each year.**\n\n【23】**The main reason we operate a Trap， Assess， resolve management strategy is because stray and abandoned cats are suffering， from starvation， sickness， and lack of shelter from inclement weather. A cat is a domestic animal， New Zealand's most popular companion animal. We believe it does not have a place outside of the human bond as a stray or feral in New Zealand. The suffering they endure is highlighted by a recent study made by Sarah Jolly， Unitec， 2014，“Welfare Comparison between managed and unmanaged colony cats in the Auckland Region.\" To quote： “It was of great interest that there was a significant difference in body condition score between the managed and unmanaged colony cats. Thin condition was much more prevalent in the unmanaged colony cats than the managed.\"“There was a substantial difference in the subjective quality of life score given to managed and unmanaged colony cats. No excellent quality oflife scores was given to unmanaged colony cats.”**\n\n【24】**What is a Stray Cat?**\n\n【25】**Lonely Miaow receives an unending stream of calls and reports from members of the public about stray and abandoned cats and kittens. All communications are responded to， to ascertain the number of felines involved， their exact location and type of location， and what steps have been taken to establish that these are stray or abandoned felines. Often these cats have turned up， usually at the place of residence and occasionally at the workplace of the person reporting. Most often too the person reporting has started feeding， then kittens have arrived， and now there are too many and none are wanted. We confirm that enquiries have been made to ascertain whether there is an owner， and no owner has been found. We may check ourselves with Pets on The Net， or distribute flyers around the neighborhood. Often， we are told that an old guy or lady had some entire cats， and now that person has gone the cats have dispersed throughout the neighborhood. On visiting the location to rescue those reported we are often told that “there are more down the back.”There are always more!**\n\n【26】**Trap，Assess，Resolve**\n\n【27】**Each cat trapped is assessed by the rescuer and by the vet for temperament and health. The great majority are assessed as suitable for fostering and rehoming， with the main reason for a negative outcome being unsuitable temperament. The great majority of sick cats are treated by a vet， fostered， and rehomed. Whilst no cat is returned to a colony situation， Lonely Miaow makes a great effort to work with members of the public to achieve the desired outcome. Occasionally a cat is wanted back， and therefore after confirming that the person is willing and able to feed it cat food every day， the cat**\n\n【28】**is defleaed， dewormed， vaccinated， desexed and microchipped and returned to the place where it was rescued from， but as an owned， not a colony， cat.**\n\n【29】**What is a Cat Colony?**\n\n【30】**According to the Companion Cats Animal Welfare Code， 2007， published by NAWAC， Section 13： \"Stray cats may live singly or may join colonies.\"Lonely Miaow considers a colony to comprise of one or more stray cats. A single stray is often a pregnant female， resulting in a sudden increase in numbers. The largest colonies we have been involved with have comprised 120 stray cats. An average colony is around five， basically a mother and kittens. The majority of colonies，80%， are located on residential land.**\n\n【31】**Cat Colonies - How they are Managed and Resolved**\n\n【32】**At Lonely Miaow we define anything from one cat to a large group of cats at a property as a colony. When people contact us through our website， email or phone to report cats our call loggers log these in our database as colonies.**\n\n【33】**From these colony logs the Rescue Manager goes through daily and assesses the urgency of each colony based on：**\n\n【34】If the cats are in danger?\n\n【35】**Are they being fed?**\n\n【36】Do they pose a risk to people?\n\n【37】**Do we have foster space?**\n\n【38】**Any cat that is not being fed， is pregnant or is in danger is our top priority.**\n\n【39】**Usually if a cat is injured and requires urgent attention or is being mistreated， they will be referred to the SPCA. Sometimes we get reports of cats that are putting people at risk. We have recently been involved with a stray pregnant cat coming into a 99-year old’s home and posing a tripping hazard. In this case not only is it a priority due to the cat being pregnant but also because the man could come to harm by it being there.**\n\n【40】**Once it is decided that the cats will be rescued a rescue volunteer is organized to go to the property to trap the cat， or the person reporting can drop it to one of our participating vets. When all the cats are in our care the colony can be closed.**\n\n【41】We have still a number of colonies we have been working on for a long period of time that are not as simple to bring in. They have a ale 110colony manager who takes care of trapping and assessing these cats to slowly work towards resolving these larger and possibly wilder colonies.\n\n【42】**Foster Homes andFostered Cats- How thev are Humanely Managed and Adopted Out to a Responsible Owner**\n\n【43】**Lonely Miaow currently has over 100 active foster homes throughout Auckland， a number that has almost doubled in the past vear. The foster home management team have spent the last two years focused on both refining procedures and the growth of Lonely Miaow， hindered only by a lack of financial resources， a limitation that is shared by so many other rescue organizations. Winter is the quieter season when a lot of our hardworking volunteers take a short**\n\n【44】**break and we usually house upwards of about 60 cats and kittens. In kitten season the number of cats and kittens in our care can exceed _200._**\n\n【45】**All of our foster homes are volunteers - supplies and access to veterinary care is provided by Lonely Miaow， but the heart and soul of our efforts lie with them. The gift they give Lonely Miaow is one that many of you will be familiar with- not only do they contribute their valuable time while juggling family and work commitments， they are often found staying up late to feed orphaned or abandoned kittens， administering to cats that are unwell， and exercising patience with those that need a bit of time to come around to the idea of living with people.**\n\n【46】**It's not uncommon for a cat who lacks confidence around people to remain in our care for six months or more before even being ready to meet potential adopters， and the foster homes who not only have the perseverance to continue rehabilitation efforts， but the strength to invest so heavily in these cats， and then see them leave to go to new homes are a huge， and sadly very limited asset that helps to give these less confident， less desirable'strays a chance at a life where they are healthy， safe and cared for.**\n\n【47】**Lonely Miaow’s cats and kittens are all desexed， microchipped， and started on a flea treatment， worming and vaccination protocol before leaving our care. Our adoptions include microchip registration on the New Zealand Companion Animal Register database， which is processed immediately after adoption to ensure that these microchips can be utilized without delay in the event that a cat goes missing. We are proud to be partnered with Pet Plan Pet Insurance， who offer a free four-week cover with almost all of our adoptions.**\n\n【48】**Our policies in assessing potential adopters include a mandatory meet-and-greet before an adoption can be mutually agreed upon(while we will allow a short hold' period， we do not consent to adoptions sight-unseen)， owner-occupancy or confirmation that a landlord is agreeable to a new feline family member， and an open discussion on the household's suitability to the cat (or vice versa). We are lucky to have developed a relationship with Pet Stock stores in Auckland late last year， who have shown exceptional judgement and heart in caring for our more confident cats and kittens in-store and facilitating many more adoptions than we would have been able to achieve on our own. It is this collaboration that has allowed us to achieve our recent growth sustainably with only a few scary financial moments!**\n\n【49】**Lonely Miaow is only as great as our volunteers， and we are so proud of each one of them， and the development and improvements that we have been able to make in recent years. It is the combined efforts of all of us， as well as supporting and helping each other， that will ultimately see us achieve our common goal.**\n\n【50】**FutureManagementofStrayand Abandoned Cats**\n\n【51】**As stated earlier Lonely Miaow has not been successful in making a significant impact on the overall number of stray cats and colonies.**\n\n【52】**This is because we operate a scatter-gun approach， rushing to rescue cats from a colony in one suburb to a colony in other miles away. Over the years we have rescued cats from colonies in ninety-nine Auckland suburbs. We simply can’t keep up. In discussing this issue with William Gomaa， Alley Cat Allies USA， over dinner at a recent NZCAC conference， he put forward a different approach. Start with one colony at one house， expand to neighboring properties， cover the whole block， then adjacent blocks， the whole neighborhood， adjacent neighborhoods， and finally the whole city， region， and country. But that would mean condemning cats in say Henderson to carry on suffering whilst we focused on say Otahuhu. We care for them all equally， so we keep rushing about rescuing a few from everywhere， and meantime the problem continues.**\n\n【53】**Sarah Jolly's study， referred to earlier， points the way for the future.“Global cat overpopulation is no doubt a human responsibility.\"Compulsory， subsidized desexing， microchipping and vaccination laws for owned cats as well as colony cats could be implemented. Registration of cats would help enforce these laws.\"“More resources are needed for the removal of unmanaged colony cats from urban areas and for funding of larger animal shelters to make the potential of rehoming greater. Colony carers， wildlife managers， animal control，shelters， and veterinarians and most importantly the public must all work together to find the most humane solutions to this huge problem. Adoption for socialized cats remains the ideal solution but isn’t possible for all stray cats. The responsibility of managing cat populations lies ultimately with both local and central government who can create and enforce laws and provide funding and resources Non-governmental organizations also play a large role and should work together with the government for the best possible solutions.”**\n\n【54】**We are delighted that the Wellington City Council has introduced compulsory microchipping and registration for cats which will come into force in February 2018， and we hope that this initiative will be taken up by all New Zealand's Territorial Authorities.**\n\n【55】**It is pleasing that the NZCAC has created the National Cat Management Strategic Group comprising NZVA， Companion AnimalSociety， RNZSPCA，locallgovernment，the Morgan Foundation，and NZCAC representatives， to proactively address the impact of cats in New Zealand， and by doing so taking up a number of Sarah's recommendations. The Strategic Goals are commendable， and achievable if we all work together. Management， a comprehensive database， staff and volunteers， legislation and bylaws， Cat Rescue Centers， and above all finance， are all requirements for success. Lonely Miaow fully supports the Intent， Strategic Goals， and Strategic Outcomes and we will play our full part in achieving these.**\n\n【56】**References**\n\n【57】**1\\.

A cross-sectional descriptive studywas conducted in South Dagonand Htantabin Townships in Yangon Region， Myanmar， to conduct dengue vector surveillance during COVID-19 transmission period，2020. In South Dagon Township， 1，065 potential mosquito breeding containers were inspected and Aedes immature stages were found in 246 containers. Meanwhile， 309 Aedes infested containers out of 1，216 inspected containers were found in Htantabin Township. Discarded container type was the highest Aedes infested proportion in both townships and meanwhile， flower vase was the most common type container.

Absence of house-to-house dengue vector surveillance during pandemic situation， health staff were mainly assigned to COVID-19 prevention activities and limitation of manpower were likely the main reasons for the increase of dengue vector abundance.

However， with the emergence of COVID-19， dengue vector control activity was gradualy reduced. First COVID-19 case was reported in March 23，2020 and since then majority of the health staff were assigned to response in COVID-19 prevention activities \\[3，4\\]. Moreover， people were strongly recommended to stay at home and partial lock down was applied in some areas of Yangon Region \\[5\\]. Consequently， vector control activities were limited in dengue endemic areas and thus led to the favorable situation for dengue vector abundance.**\n\n【10】**_KM， Aung ZZ， Phyu PP， et al.

Therefore， it is important to conduct dengue vector surveillance activities during the rainy season to assess the dengue vector abundance under COVID-19 pandemic situation. Meanwhile， neighboring country， Singapore reported the dengue outbreak in 2020 with the recorded number of more than 14，000 cases \\[7\\]. Another study conducted in Peru also suggested the increase of dengue incidence in all endemic regions during COVID-19 pandemic period \\[8\\]. According to WHO， vector surveillance and control activities should be carried out continuously while observing the measures adopted by health authorities to control the pandemic of COVID-19with the participation of community \\[9\\].**\n\n【13】**In the present study， the main objective was to perform dengue vector surveillance in dengue endemic areas， particularly South Dagon and Htantabin Townships in Yangon Region.

South Dagon was one of the high dengue cases-reported townships in last 5 years (VBDC， Annual Report 2019). Meanwhile， Htantabin， a suburban area and located at outskirt of Yangon city， reported the highest dengue cases from January to June 2020. Thus， those two townships were selected purposively for the present study.**\n\n【19】**As precaution measures for COVID-19 transmission， the following measures were precisely performed during the activity：Applied minimum workforce (one entomologist， one epidemiologist， one Basic Health Staff (BHS) and one local ward authority)， applied personal protective measures (masks and face-shields)， routine temperature checking of survey team members and reduced the contact time with inhabitants.**\n\n【20】**Inspections of potential breeding habitats (presence or absence of Aedes mosquito immature stages) in and around household premises were inspected thoroughly by survey team following precaution measures as mentioned previously. Container type， size， place and type of water were noted down using checklist. Residents were requested to bring flower vases which were placed indoor to outside of the houses. In order to reduce communication time with residents， larvae and pupae were not counted and also water containers inside of the houses except flower vases were ignored in the present study.**\n\n【21】**Data analysis**\n\n【22】**Entomological data were analyzed by using R studio software and categorical data were shown in percentage. Following entomological indices were also applied to check the dengue vector abundance situation in the study areas.**\n\n【23】**1) Container Index (CI)： No. of positive containers/No. of inspected containers x 100%**\n\n【24】**2) Household Index (HI)： No. of positive houses/No. of inspected houses x100%**\n\n【25】**3) Breteau Index (BI)： No. of positive containers/No. of houses inspected×100**\n\n【26】**Total of 160 and 189 households were participated in South Dagon and Htantabin Townships， respectively. In South Dagon Township， total of 1，065 potential mosquito breeding containers were inspected and Aedes immature stages were found in 246 containers. Meanwhile，309 Aedes infested containers out of 1，216 inspected containers were found in Htantabin Township. In terms ofthe number of containers， flower vase was the highest number of containers in both townships with 438 and 612， respectively， and followed by barrel and cement drums in South Dagon and ceramic jars in Htantabin Township. However， discarded container type was the highest Aedes infested proportion among all types of containers with the percentage of 81%in South Dagon and 80.6% in Htantabin Township (Table 1).**\n\n【27】**Container Index (CI)， Household Index (HI) and Breteau Index(BI) were 23.1% and 25.4%， 65.6% and 71.4%， and 153.8 and 163.5， respectively， for South Dagon and Htantabin townships (Table 2).**\n\n【28】**Discussion**\n\n【29】**Among those 8 common types of containers (barrel， bucket， cement drum， cement tank， ceramic jar， flower vase， spiritual bowl and discarded)， flower vase container type was the highest number in both townships as a part of the Myanmar culture. One study conducted in Yangon (2018) reported the very low proportion of Aedes infestation in flower vase container type \\[1\\]. However， two studies conducted in Yangon in 2010 and 2011 stated that flower vase was one of the key containers for mosquito breeding \\[6，10\\]. In the present study， proportion of Aedes infestation in flower vase was noticeably high in Htantabin Township which was the highest dengue case-reported township in 2020.**\n\n【30】**Discarded container type was the highest proportion of Aedes infestation in both townships and the same situation was reported in previous studies conducted in Hlaing Thar Yar \\[1\\] and South Dagon townships in Yangon. Majority ofthe health staff fromtownships were assigned to prevention and control of COVID-19 activities (MOH，2020) which led to the gradual decrease of dengue vector surveillance and control activities. It might be one of the major reasons that the**\n\n【31】**Table 2： Entomological indices in South Dagon and Htantabin townships.**\n\n|  | **South Dagon** **(160 households)**  | **Htantabin** **(189 households)**  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Container Index (CI)**  | **23.10%**  | **25.40%**  |\n| **Household Index (HI)**  | **65.60%**  | **71.40%**  |\n| **Breteau Index (BI)**  | **153.8**  | **163.5**  |\n\n【33】**high Aedes infestation in inspected containers especially in discarded and flower vase containers. One study conducted in Bangladesh reported the increase of dengue cases and the decrease of the dengue vector control activities during COVID-19 pandemic situation\\[11\\].

Thus， it is very important to encourage the community to carry out voluntary vector control activities during the pandemic situation.**\n\n【34】**Acknowledgement**\n\n【35】**We give our thanks to the health staff of South Dagon and Htantabin Townships for their full participation in survey activities.

The natural and nutritional red carotenoid pigment is used as dietary supplements. Liver cancer is the fifth most common cancer in worldwide but because of very poor prognosis； it is the third most common cause of death among other cancers. There are currently limited therapeutic regimens available for effective treatment of this cancer. The present study was designed to evaluate the beneficial effects of dietary pigment astaxanthin， against Diethyl Nitrosamine (DEN) -induced oxidative stress and liver carcinogenesis in Wistar rats. ASX was orally administered to experimental rats at 20 mg/kg body weight prior to cancer induction. In the present study， we investigated the anticancer effects of Astaxanthin (ASX) during DEN-induced Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) in male Wistar rats.DEN treatments resulted in increased levels of Aspartate Transaminase (AST)， Alanine Transaminase (ALT)， Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP)， Acid Phosphatase (ACP)， and Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH) in blood serum， and decrease the antioxidantenzymic parameters such as Superoxide Dismutase (SOD)，Catalase (CAT)，Glutathione Peroxidase (Gpx)， Glutathione Reductase (GR) and non-enzymic parameters Vitamin A， C， and E in liver homogenates. Pretreatment with ASX significantly attenuated these alterations and increase in antioxidant parameters and decreased the levels of AST， ALT， ALP， ACP and LDH in blood serum. Nevertheless， the experimental and control rats of liver morphological， histopathological examination and immunohistochemical expression of COX-2 and PCNA analysis are authenticated the protective effects of astaxanthin treated rats. These findings suggest that ASX is a potent antioxidant and anticancer agent against DEN induced HCC.**\n\n【14】**Keywords： _HaematocoCCHS_ pluvialis； Astaxanthin (ASX)；FHepatocellularr carcino\\]ma； Antioxidants； COX-2；PCNA**\n\n【15】**Introduction**\n\n【16】**Antioxidants are quenchers of free radicals that are responsible for inducing oxidative stress generated via Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) in the body； thus they prevent several ROS induced degenerative diseases such as cancer， ulcer， diabetes，cardiovascular diseases etc \\[1\\]. HCC is a majior healthcare problem worldwide because it is the 54 most common cancer with more than one million fatalities occurring annually worldwide \\[2\\]. Liver is one of the most important organs in energy metabolism. Most apolipoproteins， endogenous lipids， and lipoproteins are synthesized in the liver， which depends on the integrity of cellular functions of this organ. Under normal physiological conditions liver ensures homeostasis of lipid and lipoprotein metabolism.HCC impairs this process leading to alterations in the lipid and lipoprotein patterns \\[3\\]. It is less common in most parts of the developed western world but appears to be increasing substantially in incidence and its incidence is very high in Asian countries \\[4\\]. These highly variable geographical distributions of HCC indicate that environmental factors are of major causative importance \\[5\\]. The reason for relatively high**\n\n【17】**incidence in Asian countries is due to the widespread contamination of foods with mycotoxins， moderately high prevalence of Hepatitis B virus， Hepatitis C virus-related chronic liver disease， which are considered as the most important risk factors for the development of HCC. The mortality rate remains high from HCC despite treatment with recent results showing 1-year， 3-years and 5-years survival rates of 66.1%， 39.7%， and 32.5%， respectively \\[4\\].**\n\n【18】**DEN a hepatocarcinogen， is known to cause perturbations in the nuclear enzymes involved in DNA repair/replication and is normally used as a carcinogen to induce liver cancer in animal models \\[6\\]. The presence of nitroso compounds and their precursors in human environment together with the possibility of their endogenous formation in human body have led to suggestions of their potential involvement in human cancers \\[7\\]. The main cause for concern is that DEN is found in a variety of foods like cheese； soybean； smoked， salted， and dried fish； cured meat； and alcoholic beverages \\[8\\]. It is also found in tobacco smoke at a concentration ranging from 1 ng/cigarette to 28 ng/cigarette and in baby bottle nipples at a level of 10ppb\\[9\\].**\n\n【19】**The micro alga， Haematococcus pluvialis (chlorophyte) is one of the richest sources of astaxanthin accumulating up to 2% to 3% of dry weight and constitutes ~85% to 88% of total carotenoid \\[10\\]. As attributed to carotenoid and closely associated to B-carotene，lutein， and zeaxanthin， astaxanthin shares with them many of the general metabolic and physiological activities. On the other hand， ASX has unique chemical properties based on its molecular structure. The presence of the Hydroxyl (OH) and keto (C=O) moieties on each ionone ring explains some of its unique features， namely， a higher antioxidant activity. ASX (3，3'-dihydroxy-B.B-carotene-4，4-dione) has been documented to provide important metabolic functions in animals， including conversion to Vitamin A \\[11\\]， enhancement of immune response \\[12\\]， and protection against diseases such as cancers by scavenging oxygen radicals \\[13\\]. The antioxidant activity of ASX has been reported to approximately 10 times stronger than that of other carotenoids tested \\[14\\]. ASX also shows strong activity as an inhibitor of oxygen radical-mediated LPO \\[15\\].**\n\n【20】**In recent years， a number of studies on astaxanthin have in vitro and in vivo demonstrated its antioxidant effect， for example， the quenching effect on singlet oxygen， a strong scavenging effect on superoxide， hydrogen peroxide， and hydroxyl radicals and an inhibitory effect on lipid peroxidation \\[16，17\\]. In addition to these， several other biologic activities of ASX， including anti-cancer， anti-inflammatory， antidiabetic， immunomodulatory activities and a neuroprotective effect， also have been reported \\[18\\]. From the above reports Astaxanthin is known to be a powerful antioxidant，although these facts suggested that ASX might be a potent candidate for a natural hepatoprotective agent， further basic evidence to demonstrate the hepatoprotective effect of ASX is needed.**\n\n【21】**Cyclooxygenases also known as prostaglandin H2 syntheses are the rate-limiting enzymes involved in the conversion of arachidonic acid into Prostaglandins (PGs) \\[19\\]. Two isoforms of COX exist， with diverse tissue distributions. COX-1 is constitutively expressed in many tissies and cell types， whereas COX-2 is an inducible isoform that participates in pro-inflammatory responses in response to certain stimuli such as mitogens， cytokines and growth factors\\[20-22\\]. Upregulation of COX-2 has also been implicated in cancer development and growth. Recent reports on COX-2 expression in cancers show that this enzyme stimulates angiogenesis and is**\n\n【22】**associated with tumor growth， invasion， and metastasis \\[20，23\\].**\n\n【23】**Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA) is a 36-kDa protein functions as a cofactor of DNA-polymerase and an important marker for evaluating the proliferation of several cancers including HCC\\[24-26\\]. PCNA is synthesized during the late G1-early S phase of the cell cycle， immediately preceding the onset of DNA synthesis， is most abundant during the S phase， and declines during the G2/M phase \\[27，28\\]. X-ray crystallography has shown that PCNA molecules form a trimeric ring around DNA \\[29\\]. The detection of PCNA using immunohistochemical methods is a common way to study the proliferating activity oftransformed cells. Reducing cellular proliferation was one of the hallmarks of controlling the carcinogenic process and higher expression of PCNA protein was closely related to increased proliferation because it plays an essential role in nucleic acid metabolism as a component of the replication \\[30\\]. The present study was conduct to delineate the role of ASX on the expression of COX-2 and PCNA during DEN-induced hepatocarcinogenesis in Wistar rats. To our understanding， no reports have been documented on the same， by morphometric evaluation of the liver along with histological observation and immunohistochemical analysis.**\n\n【24】**Materials and Methods**\n\n【25】**Algal culture**\n\n【26】**Haematococcus pluvialis Flotow was obtained from the culture collection of Algae， Centre for Advanced Studies in Botany， University of Madras， Chennai， India.

Liver is one of the most important organs in energy metabolism. Most apolipoproteins， endogenous lipids， and lipoproteins are synthesized in the liver， which depends on the integrity of cellular functions of this organ. Under normal physiological conditions liver ensures homeostasis of lipid and lipoprotein metabolism. HCC impairs this process leading to alterations in the lipid and lipoprotein patterns \\[3\\].**\n\n【95】**Hepato specific enzymes were activated when hepatocellular damage give rise to abnormalities of liver function and these enzymes are remarkably increased in HCC \\[36\\]. One of the most sensitive and dramatic indicators of hepatocyte injury is the release of intracellular enzymes， such as transaminases， phosphates， and LDH in the circulation after DEN administration. The measurement of phosphatase activity is useful as an indicator of liver function\\[51\\]. In the liver， it is closely connected with lipid membrane in the canalicular zone， so that any interference with the bile flow， whether extra-hepatic or intra-hepatic leads to increased serum levels of ACP and ALP activities. Aminotransferases (AST and ALT) are reliable marker enzymes of liver and they are the first enzymes to be used in diagnostic enzymology when liver damage has occurred \\[52\\]. Because of their intracellular location in the cytosol， toxicity affecting the liver with subsequent breakdown in membrane architecture of the cells**\n\n【96】**leads to their spillage into serum， and their concentration rises in the latter. LDH release into the serum reflects a nonspecific alteration in the plasma membrane integrity and permeability or may be due to its overproduction by tumor cells. LDH is a fairly sensitive marker of solid neoplasm \\[53\\] and many studies revealed increased LDH activity in various types of tumor \\[36，54，55\\]. In the present study the levels of marker enzymes were increase in serum was observed， when administration of DEN and treatment with ASX showed a significant reduction in the levels of marker enzymes in serum.**\n\n【97】**Several studies have demonstrated the antioxidant potential of carotenoids that can significantly reduce free radicals and the oxidative load to help the body maintain a healthy state. Studies have shown that in vivo supplementation with exogenous astaxanthin is capable of suppressing the formation of byproducts (e.g.， TBARS) of membrane LPO induced by superoxide anion. Studies in the past have attributed that the LPO attenuating effect of ASX to its molecular structure \\[56\\]. The above reports were substantiated by our study as administration of ASX to DEN-induced rats significantly reduced the levels of TBARS and hydroperoxides proving its potential antioxidant ability. The enzymatic antioxidants such as SOD， CAT， GPx and GR limit the effects of oxidant molecules on tissues and are activated against oxidative cell injury \\[57\\]. These enzymes work synergisticallyto eliminate active oxygen species and small deviations in physiological concentrations may have a dramatic effect on the resistance of cellular macro molecules and DNA to oxidative damage\\[58\\]. The decreased activities of these enzymic antioxidants observed in DEN-induced rats might be due to increased oxidative stress as enhanced levels of LPO along with the reduced activities of enzymic antioxidants has been observed during DEN-induced malignant alterations \\[56\\]. In this study， ASX administration prevented DEN-induced changes in enzymatic antioxidant enzymes and this could be attributed to its high scavenger potential， which would protect the tissues against free radicals generated by DEN， sparing antioxidant defenses \\[59，60\\].**\n\n【98】**The non-enzymatic antioxidant parameters Vitamins A， C， and E prevent its oxidation. Vitamin A is involved in epithelial cell**\n\n【99】**Figure 8： (I) Macroscopic appearance of the livers from control and experimental group of animals (1-5)； () Histopathological alterations in liver of control and experimental groups of rats.

Vitamin A at pharmacological doses is reported to alleviate oxidative stress mediated membrane LPO and membranes enriched with vitamin A are protected against oxidative stress in vivo and exhibit resistance to LPO induced in vitro \\[61\\]. Vitamin C scavenges ROS generated during the metabolism of carcinogen and thus possibly protects the genetic material at the initiation and promotion stages of carcinogenesis \\[62\\]. Vitamin E scavenges free radicals to prevent LPO of polyunsaturated fatty acids， which can act as promoters of carcinogenesis \\[63\\]. Therefore， the decreasedconcentrations of VitaminsA，Cand Ein DEN administered animals may be due to increased utilization of these antioxidants to**\n\n【101】**2**\n\n【102】**abd**\n\n【103】**Groupl Groupli Grouplli GrouplV GroupV**\n\n【104】**Figure 9： Immunohistochemistry.

Administration of ASX preserved the normal levels of these non-enzymic antioxidants in DEN-induced rats， which might be due to its antioxidant property as ASX has been reported to suppress production of free radicals and subsequent oxidative stress \\[64\\]. The histopathological observations clearly showed that ASX administration at pre-initiation stage greatly influences liver carcinogenesis by altering the efficacy at which DEN can initiate histological changes. Well differentiated signs of tissue injury and tumors were observed in liver tissue sections due to DEN induction that was restored to normalcy in ASX pre-treated rats. The ability of ASX to restore the histological changes induced by DEN indicates the anti-carcinogenic potential of this carotenoid. A previous report suggested that elevated LPO induced certain histological alteration in liver tissues of DEN-induced rats. ASX ameliorated the histopathological alterations in DEN-induced rats probably by extenuating the levels of LPO. Thus， the histological findings clearly support the biochemical data and suggest that ASX may play a promising anticancer role with respect to liver carcinogenesis.**\n\n【106】**ASX treatment significantly attenuated these alterations and decreased the levels of COX-2 and PCNA. Cellproliferation is thought to play an important role in several steps of the carcinogenic process. PCNA functions as a cofactor of DNA-polymerase and an important marker for evaluating the proliferation of several cancers including HCC \\[24，25\\]. The detection of PCNA using immunohistochemical methods is a common way to study the proliferating activity of**\n\n【107】2\n\n【108】**GroupI GroupII GroupIIIGroupIV GroupV**\n\n【109】**Figure 10： Immunohistochemistry.**\n\n【110】**Plate-ll： Representative immunohistochemical staining of PCNA in the liver of contral and experimental animals at 40x of original magnificatian.

Elevated expression of PCNA in the liver of DEN-administered animals indicates the hyper proliferative activity of tumor cells. Reducing cellular proliferation was one of the hallmarks of controlling the carcinogenic process and higher expression of PCNA protein was closely related to increased proliferation because it plays an essential role in nucleic acid metabolism as a component of the replication \\[30\\]. ASX administration resulted in decreased expression of this proliferative marker， which clearly revealed its antiproliferative activity in HCC.**\n\n【112】**COX2 is a key enzyme in arachidonic acid metabolism， is consistently absent in normal tissue， and is increased in the tumor. Increased expression of COX-2 in HCC was observed by several investigators \\[21，22，26，65\\]. In the present study， increased expression of COX-2 was observed in the liver of Group II hepatoma-bearing animals. It is possible that the increased levels of COX-2 serve to lower the intracellular levels of free arachidonic acid， thereby preventing carcinogenesis. ASX treatment significantly inhibited the expression of COX-2， thereby maintaining increased levels of free arachidonic acid in the cells， which might have resulted in the suppression of carcinogenesis.**\n\n【113】**In conclusion， we found that the ASX has exhibited potent antioxidant， immunomodulating and enzyme in ducing properties， all of which suggest a potential role for this carotenoid in the prevention of cancer. Moreover， its unique structural properties and its lack of**\n\n【114】**pro-oxidant activity make it aprime aspirant for further investigation in this area of human health. More research is needed on the absorption and metabolism of this promising anticancer agent in humans， and on its interactions with other carotenoids and Vitamins in the human system.**\n\n【115】**References**\n\n【116】1\\.

We report a case of Brucellosis-associated RPGN in an elderly male and challenges in management. A 67-year-old male patient presented to clinic with weight loss， progressive renal failure， shivering and fatigue； his urinalysis revealed hematuria. Common etiologies were investigated without determination of any possible source leading to further investigation of rare infectious causes. Patient was diagnosed with Brucellosis following positive Rose-Bengal and Wright agglutination tests and prescribed with doxycycline and rifampicin.**\n\n【12】**Introduction**\n\n【13】**Rapidly Progressive Glomerulonephritis (RPGN)， also known as crescentic glomerulonephritis， is an emergency condition that may be fatal in weeks to months due to necrotizing extra capillary proliferative crescentic glomerulonephritis， thus， requiring proper diagnosis and treatment \\[1\\]. Five main types of RPGN induding anti-glomerular basement membrane disease (type 1)， immune-complex mediated (type 2) and pauci-immune with ANCA positive vasculitis (type 3)， combination oftype 1 and 3 (type 4)，ANCA-negative， pauci-immune renal vasculitis (type 5) have been identified\\[1，2\\]. Despite RPGN being the second most common histopathological diagnosis on kidney biopsies after IgA nephropathy， only single case of Brucella-associated RPGN has been reported so far， despite Brucellosis being one of the most common zoonotic infection \\[3，4\\]. Although orchitis and epididymitis are the most common genitourinary presentations of Brucellosis， other types of kidney involvement including membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis， tubulointerstitial nephritis and IgA nephropathy have been reported in the course of Brucellosis \\[5-8\\]. In this case report， we present a rare case of RPGN caused by Brucellosis in an elderly male patient and its’clinical outcome.**\n\n【14】**A 67-year-old male patient presented to our clinic with progressive renal failure， fatigue， weight loss and shivering. Past medical history was significant for hypertension controlled with three medications， ischemic heart disease that required cardiac stenting 5 years ago， aortofemoral bypass3 years ago， and tuberculosis osteomyelitis 4 years ago treated with 12 months of combination therapy. Family history was significant for ischemic heart diseases. No history of smoking or alcohol consumption was present. The patient stated that he did not consume unpasteurized milk and dairy products. Physical examination and vitals of the patient were in normal range. Laboratory analysis revealed anemia (Hb： 8.1 g/dl， Hct： 26.4%)， thrombocytopenia (110.000 cells/mm)； elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (119 mm)， C-Reactive Protein (68.6 mg/L)， blood urea nitrogen(25 mg/dl)， serum creatinine (2.58 mg/dl)， PTH (118 pg/mL)， potassium (5.2 mmol/L)， and low estimated GFR (24.83 mL/min/1，73m). Liver and thyroid function tests， uric acid levels，and other electrolytes were all in normal range. Urinalysis demonstrated hematuria (71 RBC/HPF) without proteinuria. ANA，p-ANCA，c-ANCA， and anti-ds DNA were negative. Urinary ultrasonography and renal Doppler ultrasonography revealed no pathologies； both kidneys were in normal size and parenchymal thickness. Multiple blood and urine cultures were negative. Infection serologies for hepatitis B， hepatitis C and HIV were negative. Infectious causes of patient’s symptoms including Brucella and tuberculosis were evaluated. Tests were positive for Brucella demonstrated by positive Rose Bengal agglutination test and 1/1280 antibody titer on Wright agglutination test (Table 1).**\n\n【15】**Table 1： Blood work-up， urinalysis and infectious serology of the patient at initial**\n\n|  | **Initialpresentation**  | **1-month** **follow-up**  | **1-year** **follow-up**  | **Currentstatus**  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Blood work-up**  |  |  |  |  |\n| **Hb (g/dl)**  | **8.1**  | **8.3**  | **5.6**  | **12.8**  |\n| **Hct (%)**  | **26.4**  | **25.5**  | **17**  | **38**  |\n| **WBC count (1000** **cells/mm)**  | **6**  | **4.8**  | **6.3**  | **4.04**  |\n| **Platelet count (1000** **cels/mm)**  | **110**  | **112**  | **70**  | **75**  |\n| **Sodium (mmol/L)**  | **137**  | **138**  | **136**  | **143**  |\n| **Potassium (mmol/L)**  | **5.2**  | **4.6**  | **3.6**  | **4.7**  |\n| **Bicarbonate**  | **20.7**  | **19.4**  | **18.1**  | **21.9**  |\n| **Calcium (mg/dL)**  | **9.5**  | **8.7**  | **8.9**  |  |\n| **Phosphorus (mg/dL)**  | **3.3**  | **3.7**  | **6.4**  | **一**  |\n| **Parathyroid hormone(pg/ml)**  | **118**  |  | **一**  | **一**  |\n| **Albumin (g/dL)**  | **3.6**  | **2.3**  | **2.7**  | **4.5**  |\n| **Serum creatinine** **(mg/dl)**  | **2.58**  | **4.1**  | **7.6**  | **1.78**  |\n| **BUN(mg/d)**  | **25**  | **47**  | **54**  | **30**  |\n| **Estimated GFR (mL** **min/1，73m²)**  | **24.83**  | **29.14**  |  | **38**  |\n| **CRP (mg/L)**  | **68.6**  | **40.2**  | **79.9**  | **31.5**  |\n| **ESR(mm)**  | **119**  | **74**  | **67**  |  |\n| **ANA**  | **Negative**  | **一**  |  |  |\n| **Anti-dsDNA**  | **Negative**  | **\\-**  | **一**  |  |\n| **Anti-GBM**  | **Negative**  |  |  |  |\n| **p-ANCA**  | **Negative**  |  |  |  |\n| **C-ANCA**  | **Negative**  | **一**  |  |  |\n| **C3c (mg/dl)**  | **一**  | **40**  | **\\-**  |  |\n| **C4(mg/dl)**  |  | **25**  | **一**  | **一**  |\n| **Infection serologies**  |  |  |  |  |\n| **Anti-HlV antibody**  | **Negative**  |  |  |  |\n| **HbsAg**  | **Negative**  |  |  |  |\n| **Anti-HBs antibody**  | **Negative**  | **一**  |  |  |\n| **Anti-HBc antibody**  | **Negative**  |  |  |  |\n| **Anti-HCV antibody**  | **Negative**  |  |  |  |\n| **Rose-Bengal**  | **Positive**  | **一**  | **\\-**  |  |\n| **Wright agglutination**  | **1/1280**  | **一-**  |  |  |\n| **Anti-InfluenzaA**  | **Negative**  |  |  |  |\n| **Anti-Influenza B**  | **Negative**  |  | **一**  | **一**  |\n| **QuantiFERON**  | **Positive**  | **\\-**  |  |  |\n| **Urinalysis**  |  |  |  |  |\n| **Hematuria (RBC/HPF)**  | **71**  | **124**  | **171**  | **7**  |\n| **Proteinuria**  | **Negative**  | **Negative**  | **Negative**  | **Negative**  |\n\n【17】**No sign of tuberculosis reactivation was determined. Patient was diagnosed as acute brucellosis and treated with doxycycline (2 mg/day x 100 mg/day) and rifampicin (2 mg/day x300 mg/day) for 6weeks.**\n\n【18】**At 3-month follow-up the patient was hospitalized due to worsening of fatigue， weight loss， decline in renal functions (SCr： 4.1mg/dl)， oliguria， and presence of hematuria (124 RBC/HPF). Other abnormal laboratory findings include elevated C-reactive protein**\n\n【19】**(40.2 mg/L)， alkaline phosphatase (190 U/L)， blood urea nitrogen(47 mg/dl)， decreased albumin (2.3 g/dL)， complement C3c (40 mg/dL)，and a normal complement C4 (25 mg/dl). Brucella (capture) was<1/80 negative. Patient underwent hemodialysis due to decline in kidney functions and oliguria. Percutaneous kidney biopsy revealed immune complex focal segmental necrotizing glomerulonephritis. Treatment plan at discharge included 64 mg/day oral prednisone， 6cycles of cyclophosphamide (500 mg) for 6 months followed by oral azathioprine (2 mg/dayx50 mg/day) for 6 months.**\n\n【20】**Patient was non-compliant for his follow-ups. Patient was admitted to our clinic with dizziness， headache， night sweating， dry mouth， fatigue， and worsening in kidney function (SCr： 7.6 mg/dl) at 1-year follow-up. Some laboratory findings at admission were hemoglobin 5.7 g/dl， albumin 2.7 g/dL， CRP 79.9 mg/L， and BUN 54mg/dl. Kidney biopsy was performed with the preliminary diagnosis ofacute or chronic renal failure and biopsy revealed immune complex focal segmental necrotizing glomerulonephritis. And patient received corticosteroid and rituximab therapy. On that visit Brucella (capture) was >1/5250 positive. Doxycycline (2 mg/day x100 mg/day)+rifampicin (1 mg/dayx 600 mg/day) + ceftriaxone (2 g/dayx2g/day) treatment was planned by the infectious disease department. CLI Bone marrow biopsy was performed regarding the possibility of bone marrow aplasia in response to immunosuppressive treatment， though， no pathological finding had been determined. Patient was discharged after symptomatic relief and improvement in kidney function (SCr：4.8 mg/dl) (Table 1). Two months later the patient presented to clinic for routine outpatient follow-up. He had no complaints and his kidney functions were improved (SCr： 1.44 mg/dl). Follow-up of the patient for 6 months was uneventful.**\n\n【21】**Discussion**\n\n【22】**Brucellosis is the most common zoonotic infection in Turkey， primarily affects bones， lymphatic tissies， and the heart. The genitourinary involvement rate of brucellosis is around 2% to 20%. Orchitisand epididymitis are the most common types of genitourinary involvement \\[9\\]. Symptomatic renal involvement is especially rare with limited number of cases including membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis， tubulointerstitial nephritis， IgA nephropathy， and a single case of RPGN \\[4-8\\]. Only one case of RPGN associated with Brucellosis reported by Ardalan and SShoja \\[\\[4\\]which demonstrated RPGN in a young male patient which responded to rifampicin + doxycycline+ corticosteroid treatment dramatically in 2weeks \\[4\\]， while we report RPGN case in an elderly male patient who required multiple hospitalizations during the course of treatment and became difficult to manage. Decline in kidney functions， hematuria， weight loss， requirement for RBC transfusions， multiple hospitalizations， morbidity and mortality are possible in the course of Brucellosis-associated RPGN especially， if it is not considered in the differential diagnosis or inappropriately treated. In addition， Brucellosis-associated kidney involvement may occur at any age despite most reported cases include young patients.**\n\n【23】**Furthermore， our case is significant by illustrating immune complex depositions which may be the primary mechanism of kidney involvement in the course of Brucellosis. Since immune complex depositions are frequently observed on kidney biopsies performed with the preliminary diagnosis of RPGN， it is important to consider Brucellosis， an infection， as a differential diagnosis of immune complex deposits especially in areas where it is endemic along with predominant causes， including systemic lupus erythematosus and**\n\n【24】**other immune complex ANCA-positive vasculitis.**\n\n【25】**Even though renal involvement rates are low and most cases report good prognosis and general status， it is important to point out the possibility of RPGN as a manifestation in which emergency cases may develop. Low rates of Brucellosis-associated kidney involvement may also be a consequence of not being considered in the differential diagnosis in most instances. Therefore， we recommend consideration of Brucellosis in the differential diagnosis of glomerulonephritis especially in the areas where Brucellosis is endemic or in patients with specific environmental or other risk factors. Also， it may be beneficial to evaluate Brucella serology in RPGN patients with unknown etiology after elimination ofpredominant causes which could become a cost-effective approach for patient evaluation.**\n\n【26】1\\.

It has been reported in literature in patients with ulcerative colitis. We will describe an atypical case of ulcerative colitis， with no previous history of antiphospholipid syndrome， who developed CAPS after surgical management of her Leriche syndrome. We also provide a review of the literature to identify the importance of CAPS for clinicians to be aware of this syndrome when the patient is not known to have antiphospholipid syndrome.**\n\n【12】**Keywords： Catastrophicantiphospholipidsyndrome； Antiphospholipid syndrome； Hypercoagulable state； Ulcerative colitis**\n\n【13】**Abbreviations**\n\n【14】**Ab2GLP1： Anti-b2 Glycoprotein1； Ab： Antibody； AKI： Acute Kidney Injury； ANA： Antinuclear Antibody； ANCA： Antineutrophil Cytoplasmic Antibody； aPL： Antiphospholipid Antibodies； APS： Antiphospholipid Syndrome； BP： Blood Pressure； CAPS： Catastrophic Antiphospholipid Syndrome； CFA： Common Femoral Artery； CVA： Cerebrovascular Accident； DIC： Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation； DM： diabetes Mellites； GCS： Glasgow Coma Scale； HDL： High Density Lipoprotein； HIT： Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia； HR： Heart Rate； HTN： Hypertension； IBD： Inflammatory Bowel Disease； ICU： Intensive Care Unit； Ig： Immunoglobulin； IMA： Inferior Mesenteric Artery； LDL： Low Density Lipoprotein； LMWH： Low Molecular Weight Heparin； PCEA：Patient Controlled Epidural Analgesia；POD： Postoperative day； PTT： Partial Thromboplastin Time； SFA： Superficial Femoral Artery； SLE： Systemic Lupus Erythematosus； SMA： Superior Mesenteric Artery； TG： Triglyceride； tPA： tissue Plasminogen Activator； TTE： Transthoracic Echocardiography**\n\n【15】**Introduction**\n\n【16】**Failure of multiple organs within a week's period in patients who have antiphospholipid antibodies presents a disastrous situation to surgeons \\[1\\]. This phenomenon was named“catastrophic”antiphospholipid syndrome “CAPS” by Asheron， thus the other name “Asheron Syndrome”\\[1\\]. The CAPS Registry is an international registry for patients who develop catastrophic APS； it was generated by the European Forum on aPL in the year 2000. Analysis of the registry showed that the predisposing factor was primary APS in 46% of patients， SLE in 40%，lupus-like disease in 5%， and different autoimmune diseases in 9% \\[2\\]. It is noteworthy to state that 46% of CAPS patients may present de novo without any event of previous thrombosis. However， 53% had precipitating factors \\[3\\]. Thankfully， as little as 1% of the patients with anti-phospholipid antibodies present with CAPS \\[4\\]. There are manyidentified precipitating factors for the development of CAPS， these include： infections in 20%， operative procedures in 14%， malignancies in 9%， withdrawal of anticoagulation in 7%， complications of obstetrics in 5%， lupus flares in 4% and the use of oral contraceptive pills in 3% \\[5，6\\].**\n\n【17】**Case Presentation**\n\n【18】**A 52-year-old female patient presented to our hospital for an elective aortobifemoral bypass for Leriche syndrome. Her past medical history is significant for ulcerative colitis on mesalamine， HTN， DM， and CVA. On postoperative day 2 she developed“Catastrophic Antiphospholipid Syndrome”(CAPS) and passed away 10 days after the surgery.**\n\n【19】**view.**\n\n【20】**Figure 2： Irregular atheromatous plaque within the aortic arch on CT scan cross section view.**\n\n【21】**Figure 3： Emboli retrieved via embolectomy using Fogarty catheter after acute aortobifemoral graft occlusion.**\n\n【22】**Three months prior to presentation， she had presented to the hospital with a thrombotic stroke in her left middle cerebral artery. Thrombolysis with tPA was attempted and failed. Thrombectomy was performed 10 h after the beginning of her symptoms. During thrombectomy through the femoral approach， the wire failed to pass through her common femoral artery bilaterally but was successfully passed through her right brachial artery. Post-thrombectomy she was started on Enoxaparin 40 mg and Aspirin 100 mg daily.**\n\n【23】**It is worth stating that 11 days prior to her stroke， the patient presented with a 3-week history of diarrhea and was diagnosed with a flare up ofher ulcerative colitis and was thus started on Enoxaparin40 mg daily. Thus， our patient had her stroke despite being on prophylactic anticoagulation.**\n\n【24】**As the wire failed to pass through her femoral artery (bilaterally) during thrombectomy， CT angiography was performed2and**\n\n【25】**demonstrated a complete occlusion of her infrarenal aorta， extending to the common iliac arteries consistent with Leriche syndrome. The inferior mesenteric artery was completely occluded. She had multiple splenic and bilateral renal infarcts. The colon had a tubular lead-pipe appearance (Figure 1). She had an irregular atheromatous plaque within the aortic arch (Figure 2).**\n\n【26】**Concerningthe hypercoagulability workup， the patient had a negative lipid profile， with HDL cholesterol of 32 mg/dl， LDL cholesterol of 24， and TG of 138. Negative ANA， C3， C4， Homocysteine， Protein C， Protein S， Procalcitonin， Antithrombic activity， Factor VIII， p-ANCA and c-ANCA. She also had negative Cardiolipin Ab IgG and IgM， Phospholipid Ab IgG and IgM. Her Lupus anticoagulant was positive， but she was on Enoxaparin， thus it was interpreted as a false positive result， especially with the negative cardiolipin Ab.**\n\n【27】**She had a Fecal calprotectin of >2100 (high quantity >200micrograms/g). Ten days after her stroke， she was discharged with right sided hemiplegia and aphasia on Aspirin and Rivaroxaban.**\n\n【28】**Three months following her CVA， the patient was admitted for an aortobifemoral bypass. Preoperatively， she was switched from Rivaroxabanto enoxaparin. She had Patient Controlled Epidural Anesthesia (PCEA) inserted directly preoperatively for postoperative pain control. Intraoperatively， the right external iliac artery was atherosclerotic. 5000 Units of unfractionated heparin were injected intravenously before clamping of the aorta. An anastomosis was performed between Dacron graft and the aorta， then between the graft and both femoral arteries. At the end of the procedure a positive right and left Common Femoral Artery (CFA) pulse was felt.**\n\n【29】**Postoperatively， ultrasound showed flow in the SFA and profound a bilaterally. In the ICU， the patient developed altered mental status with worsening ofher aphasia. Brain MRI did not show new changes. Enoxaparin was started 40 mg SC BID 5 h post-operatively. Her**\n\n【30】**Figure 4： CT angiography of the abdomen showing proximal SMA thrombus.**\n\n【31】**Figure 5： CT angiography of the abdomen showing multiple scattered hepatic infarcts as well as splenic infarcts.**\n\n【32】Figure 6： CT angiography showing occlusion of both renal arteries distally with bilateral renal infarcts.\n\n【33】**Figure 7： CT angiography showing lower lobar arterial pulmonary emboli.**\n\n【34】**post-operative course was complicated by acute occlusion of her aortobifemoral bypass on post-operative day 1. Subsequently， a bilateral embolectomy was performed using Fogarty catheter (Figure3). The patient was then started on unfractionated Heparin IVSP25000 IU /24h monitored by PTT level.**\n\n【35】**Post-embolectomy， the patient developed _d_ rhabdomyolysis complicated by AKI， she also had hypotension unresponsive to IV fluids and became tachypneic but was not able to compensate for her metabolic acidosis. She was intubated， started on norepinephrine and antibiotics and on day 3 post-operatively she was started on hemodialysis. Methylprednisolone 100 cc once was given due to a possible component of adrenal insufficiency and was continued at a rate of 50 cc q 6 h. The skin on her right thigh also showed livedo reticularis， but these were not confirmed by biopsy due to financial reasons. She developed thrombocytopenia with a platelet count reaching 49 000/mm. Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT) and Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC) were ruled out as she had a D-dimer of 3.06 and a fibrinogen level of 354. Her mental status was disturbed as she was intubated， off sedation， with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of3. Brain CT did not show any changes.**\n\n【36】**CT angiography showed acute mesenteric ischemia involving the small bowel secondary to a proximal SMA thrombus (Figure4)， multiple scattered hepatic infarcts， occlusion of both renal arteries distally (Figure 5) with increase of the bilateral renal infarcts(Figure 6). Bilateral lower lobar arterial pulmonary emboli (Figure7). Her Beta 2 Glycoprotein Abs IgM and IgG were positive， Lupus anticoagulant and Anticardiolipin IgG and IgM were negative. She was continued on methylprednisolone 50 mgq6 h and therapeutic range unfractionated heparin monitored by Anti-factor X a assay. Due to her poor prognosis， her family changed the authorization to comfort care only. She deteriorated and passed away 10 days post-operatively.**\n\n【37】**Discussion**\n\n【38】**Asheron et al. proposed criteria for diagnosing CAPS. Certain features were common between these patients： Multiple organs (>2)**\n\n【39】**involved， many small vessels obstruction found histologically and the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies on serology \\[5\\] (Table 1).**\n\n【40】**These were later validated in the year 2005 by Cervara et al.\\[6\\] who found that they are 90.3% sensitive and 99.4% specific \\[6\\].**\n\n【41】**It is of utmost importance to have the diagnosis early； but， due to multiple reasons， it is challenging. Aside from the fact that CAPS is a rare disease， it might not be thought of in patients without a known APS. Even if considered， not all diagnostic criteria may be met； especially in the acute setting \\[7\\].**\n\n【42】**Regarding management of patients with CAPS，early initiation of treatment， within 8 hours of diagnosis， was considered of extreme importance. The first and most important treatment for such patients is therapeutic level anticoagulation \\[7\\]. Steroids， anticoagulants and plasma exchange combined provided the highest recovery rate \\[3\\].**\n\n【43】**We present a case of a 52-year-old female， with no previous pregnancy attempts， not known to have APS who was operated on and died after developing probable CAPS. Yet， she is known to have ulcerative colitis. The aim of this case report is to emphasize the importance of identifying CAPS as a differential diagnosis for patients who develop thrombocytopenia with no DIC nor HIT； but， with multiple organ damage and are not known to have APS nor SLE. This is of utmost importance as rapid treatment may save the life of the patient.**\n\n【44】**We also aim to emphasize the probability of CAPS in the large population of patients with IBD and increase the level of suspicion for CAPS in surgical patients. There is evolving evidence that the pathogenesis of formation of both arterial and venous thrombosis involves antiphospholipid antibodies \\[9\\]. In fact， in a studyconducted by Kraiem et al. \\[10\\]， titled antiphospholipid antibodies and procoagulant profile in Tunisians with IBD， the authors concluded that the antiphospholipid auto antibodies， mostly IgA ab2GPI antibodies， were very often found in Tunisian patients with IBD. They suggested more prospective studies be conducted to learn about this marker's exact function and clinical relevance \\[10\\].**\n\n【45】**A case report published by Stammler et al. \\[11\\]， further supported recommendations that anti- vitamin K medication is the anticoagulant of choice in patients who have all three positive antiphospholipid antibodies \\[11\\]. Our patient， who had only 2 of the three antibodies positive， was on Enoxaparin 40 mg daily before she had her stroke. She had her stoke， despite being on enoxaparin which was prescribed to her due to an ulcerative colitis disease flare up. Postoperatively our patient developed CAPS triggered by the surgery.**\n\n【46】**Importantly， in preparation for her postoperative pain， a PCEA was placed preoperatively. On POD 4， while the patient was on therapeutic anticoagulation， removal of the PCEA was problematic， as it would requires interruption of the anticoagulation due to fear of an epidural hematoma. This is an area of controversy， and further**\n\n【47】**studies are required for identifying patients who are not fit for epidural pain control due to their hypercoagulable state that might require uninterrupted therapeutic anticoagulation post operatively. Patients with hypercoagulable state could be identified as being a relative contraindication for placement of apreoperative PCEA.**\n\n【48】**In conclusion， we encountered a case of probable CAPS in a patient not known to have antiphospholipid syndrome but known to have ulcerative colitis. It was a dramatic experience to have a patient develops such a chaotic sequence of events. Despite its rarity， CAPS should be kept in mind as one of the differentials in a patient with known ulcerative colitis who develops thrombocytopenia with multi-organ dysfunction following surgery. The early diagnosis of the disease with early management with uninterrupted therapeutic anticoagulation and steroids could save the life of the patient. Further studies are required for finding the incidence of developing CAPS in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.**\n\n【49】**Placement of a PCEA is an area of controversy that requires further studying. Surgeons must always keep in mind that surgery acts as a trigger for developing a hypercoagulable state leading to CAPs.**\n\n【50】**References**\n\n【51】**1\\. Asherson RA.

This infection can be acquired intrauterine when the first infection of pregnant woman occurs and the Toxoplasma gondii reaches the fetus by transplacental via. The damage to the fetus can compromise the pregnancy and life quality of the infected individual. Early diagnosis of infection allows emergency therapeutic intervention with reduction of the transmission rate and also the severity of the sequelae. Different methodologies are available for the diagnosis of acute gestational toxoplasmosis with detection of IgG and IgM anti-T. gondii antibodies. The methodologies differ mainly by specificity and sensitivity values reached， as well as execution facility and time required. These parameters can decisively influence the choice of the most appropriate technique by the municipal health polices， in public health strategies. The main ofthe present review is to synthesize the major characteristics of serological tests for congenital toxoplasmosis.**\n\n【15】**Keywords： Congenital toxoplasmosis； Gestational toxoplasmosis； Public health； Serology**\n\n【16】**Introduction**\n\n【17】**Toxoplasmosis is a protozoonosis worldwide distributed； its etiologic agent is Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondit)， a protozoan belonging to the phylum Apicomplexa， class Sporozoasida， order Eucoccidiorida， family Sarcocystidae， genus Toxoplasma and single species， T. gondii \\[1\\]. The parasite exhibits a heteroxene cycle， with sexual reproduction in the intestines of felids， and asexual reproduction in all warm-blooded animals， such as birds and mammals， which act as intermediate hosts \\[2\\].**\n\n【18】**The asexual cycle begins with the ingestion of oocysts that have been eliminated by the feces of the infected cats or tissue cysts containing bradyzoites present in the raw or uncooked meat of the intermediate hosts \\[3\\]. After ingestion， the external wall of the oocysts or tissue cysts is ruptured by enzymatic degradation and the infective， sporozoite and bradyzoite evolutionary forms (slow-growing forms)， respectively， are released into the intestinal lumen where they rapidly invade the host cells and differentiate in tachyzoites (forms of rapid multiplication) by asexual division \\[4\\]. The tachyzoites can invade any nucleated cell and form a parasitoid vacuole， where they undergo rapid and successive divisions by endodiogenia， originating new tachyzoites， which break the parasitized cell and invade healthy cells， which characterizes this phase as proliferative \\[5\\].**\n\n【19】**The dissemination ofthis parasite in the organism occurs through freeor intracellular tachyzoites through the lymph， or blood， and can give rise to a polysymptomatic picture， with varying severity according to the parasite load， the parasite strain and the susceptibility of the host \\[6\\].**\n\n【20】**The frequency of infection may vary according to age， eating habits， cultural patterns and the urban or rural origin of the individual. The prevalence can vary between parts worldwide， with higher taxes in Latin America， parts of Eastern/Central Europe， the Middle East， South-East Asia and Africa \\[7\\]. The infection can occur by the ingestion of food or water contaminated with oocysts， or ingestion of undercooked or raw meat with cysts bradyzoites， or the tachyzoites bytransplacental**\n\n【21】**via， nevertheless， the human toxoplasmosis has been associated with low socioeconomic conditions \\[8\\].**\n\n【22】**This increased risk may be due to changes in the placenta. In early pregnancy， the placental barrier reaches a thickness of 50 to 100um and progressively decreases to 2.5-5 um at the end of pregnancy， allowing parasites to more easily invade trophoblasts.**\n\n【23】**According to the gestational age on the first infection with T. gondii， the damage to the fetus can vary due to the morphogenesis phase when affected by the parasite， therefore， in 80.0% to 90.0%of infections in immunocompetent individuals there is no clinical manifestation； however， when there is the infection in the first trimester of gestation， fetal death is common， and when in the second and third trimesters of gestation it may lead to prematurity and Sabin's tetrad， which associates microcephaly，retinocoriditis，cerebral calcifications and mental deficiency \\[9\\]. In 50.0% of congenital infections， fetal alterations such as hydrocephalus and periventricular necrosis with macro or microcephaly are reported. In 90.0% of patients there is marked retinal destruction and retinocoriditis， in69.0% cerebral calcifications are developed and in 60.0% of the cases are generated mental retardation or neurological disorders with signs of encephalitis and with seizures \\[10\\].**\n\n【24】**The chance of congenital in fection is estimated between 4.5% and15.0% when there is toxoplasmosis in the first trimester， followed by 17.3% to 30.0% in the second third， and 60.0% to 75.0% in the last period \\[10，11\\]. This increase in the rate of infection according to gestational age is due to the morphological changes of the placenta， because in the first trimester of pregnancy， the placenta has reduced dimensions and the chance of the parasite reaching the fetus is small， in contrast， as in this phase happens the organogenesis， when there is differentiation of the germinative leaflets， ectoderm， mesoderm and endoderm giving rise to the internal organs of the organism， aggravating the infection， that can lead to fetal death \\[12\\].**\n\n【25】**In the second trimester， increased placenta reflects a greater chance of infection， however， in this period， the infection becomes less severe， since almost all organogenesis has already occurred， meantime， it can result in important damages such as Sabin's Tetrad， in which the fetus presents retinocoriditis， cerebral calcifications， mental retardation or neurological disorders and hydrocephalus， with macro or microcephaly \\[9\\]. In the third trimester， the placenta presents the largest dimensions of the period， consequently， the chance ofinfection is higher and， in contrast， the chance of developing serious damage at birth is remote， with manifestations of the disease such as fever， body spots， blindness， in a few days， weeks or months after birth \\[12\\].**\n\n【26】**The reduction in incidence， as well as morbidity and mortality rates associated with congenital toxoplasmosis can be achieved in the presence ofcollaborative efforts among pregnant women， researchers， doctors and health policy managers， on the adoption of primary and secondary health preventive measures in the gestation \\[13\\].**\n\n【27】**The diagnosis of acute T. gondii infection in the gestationalperiod is crucial to define the risk of fetal involvement \\[14\\]. For this，prenatal care should be carried out continuously from the gestational diagnosis， in order to avoid congenital toxoplasmosis and also the other risks associated with the life of the pregnant woman and the fetus \\[15\\]. In Brazil，health professionals who work in the care ofpregnant women who perform prenatal care through the Unified Health System (SUS)， comply with the protocols established by the Ministry of Health，**\n\n【28】**which guide the serological monitoring for primary infection by T. gondii \\[16\\]. Confirmation of toxoplasmosis is based on indirect or immunological methods， since the direct demonstration of the protozoan by culture， inoculation， immunohistochemistry and pathology is in frequent \\[17\\].**\n\n【29】**The molecular techniques with direct detection of T. gondii tachyzoite is possible during the acute phase of infection and can confirm fetal infection from different body fluids such as blood， amniotic fluid， cerebrospinal fluid， aqueous humor，bronchial lavage fluid alveolar and even urine by PCR technique with a sensitivity of up to 92.0%， which makes this the method of choice in cases of low parasitemic， on the other hand， in the chronic phase of infection， as in cases of cysts in brain or pulmonary tissue， the technique will not be useful \\[18\\].**\n\n【30】**Indirect or serological techniques， through the detection of antibodies of the IgM， IgG， IgE and IgA classes， do not require invasive procedures that pose a risk to the fetus such as amniocentesis and can be performed at any time during pregnancy. Several methods are available for the serological diagnosis of gestational toxoplasmosis such as the Sabin-Feldman technique， Immunofluorescence antibody test (IFAT)， Hemagglutination (HA)， complement fixation (FC)， enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)， immunoblotting and Imunosorbent Agglutination Assay (ISAGA)， with differences between the values of sensitivity and specificity reached \\[19\\].**\n\n【31】**It is important that the serological tests for specific anti-T.gondii antibodies are performed at the first prenatal visit with serial analysis in the second and third trimester of gestation and the pregnant woman should receive guidance on the preventive measures of infection \\[10\\].**\n\n【32】**In the serological diagnosis， specific IgM class antibodies are usually the first to be detected， whereas IgG antibodies appear later， with high titers during the acute phase and gradual reduction with persistence of low titers in the majority of cases， throughout the individual's life， both in the latency phase and in the chronic phase. IgM antibodies may be detectable for long periods， months to years after the acute phase of infection only by highly sensitive diagnostic methods. However， when this antibody is not detected by traditional techniques， or inability to observe IgG seroconversion during pregnancy， the expression of increased IgG titers in serial samples obtained at least three weeks apart， and in tests may suggest the diagnosis of the acute phase of T. gondii infection. Among the techniques for identification of recent T. gondii infection in pregnant women is the IgG and IgM capture ELISA \\[20\\].**\n\n【33】**In immunocompetent individuals， serological tests with IgG and IgM screening are sufficient for diagnosis because they are sensitive， specific and easy to perform \\[21\\].**\n\n【34】**Serological screening has several advantages， such as the identification of seronegative pregnant women， which provides the opportunity for health professionals to act in the preventive education of gestational and congenital toxoplasmosis， since eating habits and personal hygiene practices are identified as factors associated with the risk of infection. On the other hand， the identification of asymptomatic patients allows the establishment of adequate therapeutic measures， while the early detection of maternal seroconversion during pregnancy makes it possible to monitor and treat fetal infection and newborns \\[22\\].**\n\n【35】**The mechanisms by which parasites overpass the maternal-fetus interface remains poorly understood and may reinforce the**\n\n【36】**importance of the screening serological tests to a successful gestation and to minimize the outcomes in the pregnancy due to congenital or gestational toxoplasmosis 23\\].**\n\n【37】**The main characteristics of the techniques used to diagnose T. gondii infection in prenatal care were the object of our study and are summarized in this mini review of qualitative literature， made up of scientific articles and books， available online， on the theme\"serological diagnosis for gestational and congenital toxoplasmosis\".**\n\n【38】**Major characteristics of the methods for anti-T. gondii antibodies detection**\n\n【39】**Sabin-feldman dye test： The Sabin-Feldman reaction or dye test was described by Sabin & Feldman， in 1948 and is a differential serological test， where there is specific neutralization of the viable parasite in the presence of antibodies and complement. This method is considered excellent for the diagnosis of individual toxoplasmosis in the acute or chronic phase and also for epidemiological surveys， on account of its high sensitivity， indicating IgG antibodies in serum dilutions up to 1：16000 and specificity with little cross-reaction with other diseases， however， due to the need to manipulate the parasite in its infecting form， is not used as first option for routine diagnosis. Currently， for biological safety， the technique has been replaced by Indirect Immunofluorescence which also has lower cost and also detects IgG and IgM antibodies \\[24\\]. Besides the conventional Sabin-Feldman dye test are the gold stand for human toxoplasmosis， the conventional test using in vivo tachyzoites is the highest percent of toxoplasmosis detection in human serum when compared the results when using cell culture-derived T. gondii tachyzoites and when test indirect immunofluorescent antibody tests (IFAT) using in vivo and _in vitro tachyzoites._**\n\n【40】**The Microparticle Enzymelmmunoassay(MEIA)technique**\n\n【41】**The MEIA1Imakes quantitative determination of IgG and IgM anti-T. gondii antibodies in human serum or plasma. The immunoassay works on a random and continuous way in an Abbott company machine (AXSYM)， and for the IgM antibodies detection a rheumatoid factor neutralization solution is required to remove no specific antibodies avoiding false positive results. At the end of the reaction， the immune complex bound to the alkaline phosphatase-labeled conjugate reacts with the substrate to generate fluorescence of intensity proportional to the antibody concentration of the analyzed sample \\[25\\].**\n\n【42】**The Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELFA)**\n\n【43】**The ELFA is an automated test in the VIDAS system of the company Bio-Mérieux， used for IgG and IgM antibodies anti-T. gondii detection， through the immunoenzymatic method with a final fluorescence detection as the main reaction， named immunocapture， where the IgM antibodies present in the immunocomplexare labeled with alkaline phosphatase. This method， when compared to the ISAGA (Immunosorbent Agglutination Assay)， demonstrated agreement of 98.9%， sensitivity of 93.5% and specificity of 99.3%\\[26\\].**\n\n【44】**The Indirect Fluorescent Antibody Test (IFAT)**\n\n【45】**IFAT is indicated for serological surveys and diagnosis ofacquired infection， because it can reach sensitivity up to 95.0%， however， false positive reactions with antinuclear factor (FAN) and false negative in the presence of low IgG titers can occurs \\[27\\].**\n\n【46】**Enzimed Link Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA**\n\n【47】**The ELISA is an immunoenzymatic assay can reach up to 80.0%**\n\n【48】**of positivity and identifies early infection， with special importance for the diagnosis of congenital toxoplasmosis. The technique eliminates the interference of IgG and rheumatoid factor that are present in IFAT and can be standardized for detection of different classes of antibodies. When ELISA is used for IgG detection， a high positivity index has been observed in the Brazilian population， however， it is not possible to predict whether the infection is acute or chronic \\[28\\].**\n\n【49】**In regions were the cost of the kits is expansive for screening proposes， some in-house ELISA for the detection of toxoplasma antibody demonstrated sensitivity and specificity as the commercial kit used in the study with a better cost-effective diagnostic \\[29\\].To detect recent infection， the research is directed to the identification of IgA， which remain with high titers for at least 24 months and， because they do not cross the placenta and are not eliminated through breast milk， increase the importance to the use of this technique for the diagnosis of toxoplasmosis in the newborn \\[30\\].**\n\n【50】**The ELISA is available as commercialkits andrequires an Analyzer for the detection of specific IgG against T. gondii. Briefly， the serum-specific IgG against the parasite is linked to T. gondii coated antigen on the surface of reagent wells， forming an antigen-antibody complex The goat anti-human IgG labeled with horse radish peroxidase can be used as the secondary antibody to the antigen-antibody complex and after incubation and wash， as a chromogenic substrate is added to each well. The process should be stopped using a stop solution of 1N of H，SO . The Optical Density (OD) is recorded at 450 nm in the analyzer equipment. Calibrator and positive/negative control sera are used in each test set and the immune status ratio value of each sample is calculated by dividing OD of the sample by the cutoff value (cutoff is the mean OD of the calibrators x correction factor). Results were interpreted based on the manufacturer's recommendations as non-reactive， equivocal， or reactive \\[31\\].**\n\n【51】**The ELISA (for the qualitative determination of specific IgM antibodies anti T. gondii in dry blood samples collected on filter paper for in vitro diagnostic use only)， MEIA and ELFA have been used to improve the diagnosis of toxoplasmosis， which has demonstrated to be useful for the diagnosis of toxoplasmosis， as they show greater sensitivity and specificity \\[32\\].**\n\n【52】**The lgG avidity test**\n\n【53】**IgG Avidity concerns on the observation that， in most patients， during acute T. gondii infection， IgG antibodies bind poorly to the antigen that is low avidity， whereas in the chronification of the infection， the bond strength increases and high avidity can develop. These antibodies with high avidity reflect the fact that the primary infection occurred in the distant past， estimated about more than three months， although this method cannot determine if the infection was recent， since eventually low titers can persist for long periods， such as after antiparasitic treatment， which can maintain low avidity for more than four months. Thus， the test is especially indicated for the first trimester of gestation in IgG and IgM reagent women for screening serology， when it was shown to be the best marker ofacute infection in patients with positive IgM \\[27\\].**\n\n【54】**The Immunobloting Test**\n\n【55】**Immunoblotting is performed by segregation of the protein antigens components through the polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis The proteins are transferred to a nitrocellulose paper and processed against the serum to be tested， which， in the presence of reaction， can be visualized. The test is used to determine antigens involved in the**\n\n【56】**different stages of infection，however， it is not a routine test \\[19\\].**\n\n【57】**Conclusion**\n\n【58】**The serological screening for gestational toxoplasmosis is essential for the identification of susceptible pregnant women and fast detection of IgM seroconversion， with monitoring since the first trimester of pregnancy for the efficient prevention of congenital toxoplasmosis. Among the techniques for detection of anti-T. gondii antibodies in pregnant women， the sensitivity and specificity of antibodies， verified by MEIA， ELFA and ELISA techniques were higher when compared to IFAT detection. The recent infection in the first trimester of gestation should be confirmed by the avidity test.**\n\n【59】**References**\n\n【60】**1\\. Bresciani KDS， Costa A.

Because of the lower risk of intraoperative complications， possibility of using regional anesthesia， reduced infective morbidity， lesser pain and early return to routine activities， vaginal hysterectomy should be performed in preference to abdominal hysterectomy where possible. It can often be safely performed in women with prior caesarean section， nulliparity and a bulky uterus， after a thorough patient assessment. Long term follow up data from various studies show a low incidence of vault prolapse. Where feasible， the vaginal route should be preferred for hysterectomy.**\n\n【9】**Methods： It was a retrospective study in which the case notes of 336 patients undergoing vaginal hysterectomy at a single center over a 5 year period were retrieved. The demographic profile， intraoperative and postoperative data and five year follow up details of these patients was evaluated.**\n\n【10】**Results： The average age of the patients was 57 years and the most common indication for surgery was uterovaginal prolapse (81.8%). The mean duration of surgery was 61.6 min and the average blood loss was 50.1 ml. Four patients (1.2%) had intraoperative complications. Six patients (3.3%) had grade 2 or more vaginal vault prolapse at 5 year follow up.**\n\n【11】**Conclusion： Vaginal hysterectomy is safe and cost effective， and should be the approach of choice for hysterectomy whenever feasible in view of its advantages and lower complication rates. It can often be safely performed even in the presence of generally accepted contraindications.**\n\n【12】**Keywords： Vaginal Hysterectomy； Prolapse； Complications； Contraindications**\n\n【13】**Introduction**\n\n【14】**_Citation：_**\n\n【15】**Vaginal hysterectomy is a procedure which follows all the parameters of minimally invasive surgery \\[1\\]. It has beenlong-practiced and has even been mentioned in the descriptions of Berengario de Carpi (1470-1550) \\[2\\]. When choosing the route and method of hysterectomy， safety and cost effectiveness must be kept in consideration \\[3\\]. Because of the lower risk of intraoperative visceral injury， possibility of using regional anesthesia， reduced infective morbidity， lesser pain and earlier return to normal activities， vaginal hysterectomy should be performed in preference to abdominal hysterectomy where possible \\[3，4\\]. Where this is not possible，laparoscopic hysterectomy may avoid the need for an abdominal hysterectomy. However， the length of the surgery increases as the extent ofthe surgery performed laparoscopically increases and there is a greater risk of substantial bleeding and damage to the urinary bladder and ureters when compared to vaginal hysterectomy \\[5，6\\].No benefits were found for laparoscopic versus vaginal hysterectomy in a few studies \\[5，6\\].**\n\n【16】**While the most common indication for a vaginal hysterectomy is pelvic organ prolapse， its use is not limited to urogynecology and pelvic floor reconstructive surgery. Other indications include uterine fibroids， adenomyosis， abnormal uterine bleeding， endometrial hyperplasia or early endometrial malignancy and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia \\[7，8\\].**\n\n【17】**Studies have concluded that a large uterus (>14 weeks size)， nulliparity， previous caesarean delivery， pelvic laparotomy or need for oophorectomy rarely constitute contraindications to vaginal hysterectomy \\[8-13\\]. Doucette et al.\\[9\\] have reported that if the vagina can allow access to divide the uterosacral and cardinal ligaments，uterine mobility is usually increased enough to allow vaginal hysterectomy，even in cases where there is minimal uterine descent \\[9\\]. When the uterus is**\n\n【18】**enlarged， vaginal hysterectomy often can be accomplished safely by using uterine size reduction techniques such as wedge morcellation， uterine bisection and intramyometrial coring \\[12，14\\]. In patients with large uterine fibroids vaginal hysterectomy can be attempted if the surgeon is familiar with uterine morcellation， resources to convert to an abdominal route expeditiously are available， the size of the pelvis allows adequate exposure and the contour of the fibroid allows some degree of uterine descent \\[15\\]. In a study by Davies et al， the proportion of vaginal hysterectomies performed can be increased by a factor of 6 if the criteria for vaginal hysterectomy is extended to patients without clinically significant prolapse \\[13\\].**\n\n【19】**The vaginal axis is better maintained after a vaginalorlaparoscopic hysterectomy than after an abdominal hysterectomy \\[16\\]. Completing a procedure vaginally could substantially decrease the total operative cost， in part because of its low associated morbidity rates \\[17-19\\]. It can be successfully adopted as a same-day discharge procedure \\[20\\].**\n\n【20】**Materials and Methods**\n\n【21】**We conducted a retrospective， descriptive， non-comparative study in women undergoing vaginal hysterectomy for various indications between January 15， 2007 to December 315， 2011 at KK Women's and Children’s Hospital， Singapore. Inclusion criteria were medical indication for vaginal hysterectomy like pelvic organ prolapse， uterine fibroid， abnormal uterine bleeding and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. Patients with concomitant vaginal mesh insertion or sacrospinous ligament fixation were excluded from the study. All surgeries were performed by the same surgical team. The Centralized Institutional Review Board (CIRB) approval was taken before the commencement of the study.**\n\n【22】**The medical records of these patients were retrieved and their demographic data was analyzed. The preoperative fin dings including the degree ofprolapse， as assessed by the Baden-Walker classification system were noted. The intra-operative details like concomitant surgeries， type of anesthesia， and mean duration of surgery， mean blood loss， intra-operative complications and weight of the uterus were analyzed. Postoperative complications， length of hospital stay， duration of catheterization， histology report of the uterus， readmission rate and reason for readmission were noted.**\n\n【23】**Patients were followed up post operatively in the urogynecology clinic at 3 days after discharge and then at 1 month， 6 months， 1，2，3，4and 5 years postoperatively. At all these visits， patients were assessed for symptoms of vaginal vault prolapse， urinary incontinence， voiding difficulty or dyspareunia and a clinical examination was done.**\n\n【24】**The data was analyzed using the SPSS software with frequency， mean and standard deviation used for quantitative variables. Chi square test was used for analyses in patients with concomitant procedures who had longer duration of surgery， more blood loss， longer duration of hospital stay and greater re-catheterization rates. The difference was considered significant at a P value equal to or less than 0.05.**\n\n【25】**Results**\n\n【26】**A total of 1，024 women underwent vaginal hysterectomy for various indications between January 15，2007 and December 315，2011. Of these， 774 case notes could be retrieved. Four hundred and thirty eight patients underwent concomitant vaginal mesh placement or sacrospinous ligament fixation and were excluded from the study. Three hundred and thirty six patients were included in the study. The**\n\n【27】**mean age of the patients was 57 years with the youngest patient being35 years old and the oldest aged 86 years. The mean parity was 2.9. Ninety-six percent of them had previous vaginal deliveries (Table1). The pre-operative symptoms included lump coming out of the vagina in 82.1 percent， voiding difficulty in 3% and stress urinary incontinence in 37.5 percent of the patients (Table 2).**\n\n【28】**Twenty nine percent of women had grade 3 cystocele to 4cystocele on pre-operative examination， 58 percent of them had grade3 to 4 uterovaginal descent and 32.5 percent had grade 3 rectocele to 4 rectocele.

Augustine et al. \\[26\\] in their study on vaginal hysterectomy in nulliparous women without prolapse found that the success rate in multiparous women was more than that in nulliparous women， but the difference was not statistically significant \\[26\\]. The difference in success rates may be explained by the technical difficulty due to a narrower vagina and lesser uterine descent in nulliparous patients. The rate of complications for nulliparous women was three fold higher in their study. Poindexter et al. \\[27\\] in their study did not find a higher complication rate in women with up to three previous caesarean sections undergoing vaginal hysterectomy \\[27\\]. Similar observations were made by Unger et al. \\[28\\] and Sheth et al. \\[29\\] in their studies on women with previous caesarean section undergoing hysterectomy through the vaginal route \\[28，29\\].**\n\n【57】**Oophorectomy was possible vaginally in all 12 cases where it was attempted. It was done for various indications like ovarian cyst， endometrial hyperplasia or early endometrial carcinoma and on patient request. Sheth et al. \\[31\\] in their study reported that prophylacticoophorectomywas possible during vaginal hysterectomy in 1，510 of 1，572 cases (96%)， without laparoscopic assistance\\[30\\]. Davies et al. \\[33\\] reported a 97.5% success rate in performing oophorectomy at the time of vaginal hysterectomy \\[33\\].**\n\n【58】**Pakbaz et al. \\[30\\] in their study on vaginal hysterectomy in women with prolapse reported an average duration of surgery of 76min and a mean blood loss of 128 ml \\[30\\].**\n\n【59】**The incidence of major intraoperative complications was 1.2%in our study. One of the patients with rectal perforation which was repaired intraoperatively developed a rectovaginal fistula and had to be readmitted for repair of the fistula \\[34\\]. Bhattacharya et al. \\[35\\] reported an overall complication rate of 4% in their series of 1，105cases of vaginal hysterectomy \\[33，35\\]. They reported a primary hemorrhage rate of 0.81 percent and a secondary hemorrhage rate of0.45%.Rectal perforation occurred in 9 patients. Pakbaz et al. \\[30\\] in their study on 941 patients undergoing vaginal hysterectomy reported9 cases of reoperation after vaginal hysterectomy for indications like intraperitoneal or retroperitoneal bleeding， bleeding from sutures， vaginal vault abscess and urinary retention after Tension free Vaginal Tape \\[30\\]. Rizvi et al. \\[34\\] reported a 4.2% intraoperative hemorrhage rate and 0.2% incidence of bladder injury in 430 patients undergoing vaginal hysterectomy.12/468 (2.6%) of the patients had postoperative fever，20 (4.7%) required blood transfusion and 7(1.6%) had urinary tract infection \\[34\\].**\n\n【60】**In our study， there were 10 patients in whom the uterus weighed more than 300 grams. Vaginal hysterectomy was possible in all these cases with the weight of the largest uterus removed vaginally being825 grams. The average duration of surgery in these patients was 73.9min and the average blood loss was 78.7 ml. Sheth et al. \\[31\\] in their study reported that five patients needed conversion to a laparotomy when the uterine volume was more than 500 cm31\\].Furuhashi et al.\\[32\\] in their study comparing complications of vaginal hysterectomy in patients with leiomyomas to those with adenomyosis reported that there was no significant difference in the operative time and estimated**\n\n【61】**In our study， eight patients were readmitted for various reasons like for TVT tape excision or loosening in patients who had postoperative urinary retention， staging surgery for endometrial malignancy， urinary tract infection requiring intravenous antibiotics and repair of rectovaginal fistula. In the study by Pakbaz et al. \\[30\\]，14 out of the 941 patients required readmission for indications like thrombosis， ileus， vaginal vault abscess and urinary retention \\[30\\].**\n\n【62】**There was no mortality in our case series. Sheth et al. \\[31\\] reported2 fatalities in their series ofover 5，655 vaginal hysterectomies \\[31，35\\].**\n\n【63】**Six (3.3%) of the 180 patients followed up till five years postoperatively developed grade 2 or more vaginal vault prolapse. Marchionni et al. \\[36\\] reported an 11.6 percent incidence of vault prolapse in women who had previous hysterectomy for prolapse and1.8% when hysterectomy had been performed for other indication\\[36\\].**\n\n【64】**Liang et al. \\[37\\] in their study on postsurgicalurinaryincontinence in continent women undergoing hysterectomy for vaginal prolapse concluded that neither urodynamics nor clinical examination predict with 100 percent certainty which women with pelvic organ prolapse will benefit from a prophylactic anti incontinence procedure during prolapse repair surgery \\[37\\].**\n\n【65】**Strengths of the present study are the large number of patients studied and the long postoperative follow up duration. Weaknesses are that it is a retrospective study and not all case notes could be retrieved.**\n\n【66】**Conclusion**\n\n【67】**In conclusion， vaginal hysterectomy is safe and cost effective， and should be the approach of choice for hysterectomy whenever feasible in view of its advantages and lower complication rates. It can often be safely performed even in the presence of generally accepted contraindications like prior caesarean section， nulliparity and bulky uterus， after a thorough patient assessment. Long term follow up shows a low incidence of vaginal vault prolapse.**\n\n【68】**Declaration**\n\n【69】**Authors'contributions**\n\n【70】**P Singh： Data analysis， manuscript writing/editing.**\n\n【71】**MAC Donsen： Protocol development， data collection.**\n\n【72】**HC Han： Protocol development， manuscript editing.**\n\n【73】**Acknowledgement**\n\n【74】**The Authors would like to thank Ms Jolene Peh， Clinical Coordinator， Department of Urogynecology， for her support in preparation of the manuscript.**\n\n【75】**References**\n\n【76】1\\.

It is brought on by car accidents， falls， and assault. The primary insult of TBI occurs at impact， which leads to subsequent damage and a cascade of cellular processes. Other variables that contribute to subsequent TBI insult include excitotoxicity， neuroinflammation， apoptosis， necrosis， mitochondrial malfunction， and lipid peroxidation. Secondary damage during TBI must be treated in order to avoid its development and additional neurodegeneration. However， no specific drug is available to prevent secondary insult in TBI， but alternative medications such as anti-inflammatory， diuretic， and corticosteroids are preferred. There are various diagnostic markers used to confirm the injury stage and its progressions such as HMGB1， Tenascin-c，S100B proteins， ghrelin，UCHL-1，and others.

In India， the bulk of TBI cases (60%) are caused by car accidents， falls (20% to 30%)， and violence (10%)， among other things \\[1\\]. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)， 1.7 million individuals in the United States suffer from TBI each year， with an additional 5.3 million living with TBI-related disability \\[2\\]. It is one of the most common causes of morbidity， death， and medical complications in modern countries； around 70% to 90% of TBI are moderate， and only a tiny fraction of individuals are sent to the hospital as a result， The National Institute of Health (NIH) declared in 1999 that mild TBI is a major health problem because majority of peoples suffers from post- traumatic related disabilities such as retrograde amnesia， migraine， behavioral changes， lack of attention， and neurological problems such as Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson's disease， the probability of PD occurrence after TBI has been increased \\[2\\]. The process behind TBI is the transmission of external stresses to brain tissue， which can induce brain damage. The main damage is produced by an impact and contusion，laceration， and diffuse axonal injury as a result of shearing， tearing， or stretching. The severity of injury is determined by the originating forces as well as the location， direction， and amount of the force \\[3\\].**\n\n【19】**According on the location of the damage， it can be either diffuse or focal. Focal brain injuries affect a specific part of the brain， but diffuse brain injuries can penetrate deep and impact various parts of the brain depending on the severity. Because they are caused by penetrating foreign bodies that can occasionally be left there and seriously impact the brain， skull， and cranial cavity， focal brain injuries can be acute or blunt. Similarly， diffuse brain injury is classified into two types： Cerebral contusion and diffuse axonal injury \\[4\\]. Diffuse axonal in jury will penetrate inside the skull， causing the foreign body to remain inside the brain； this is also known as penetrating injury， and it can cause further damage inside the brain and ultimately cause death \\[5\\]. Whereas in the case of blunt focal injury， external forces play an important role， when a high acceleration force strikes the head， the brain is accelerated further， moving inside the cranial cavity and impacting on the opposite side of the skull， causing further injury on the opposite side of the skull \\[6\\]. Blunt damage to the rear of the**\n\n【20】**_cited._**\n\n【21】**head， speeding the brain and smashing within the foot’s skull. Whereas diffuse brain damage is further classified into two types： Cerebral contusion and diffuse axonal injury. In the case of cerebral contusion， cerebral refers to the brain， and contusion refers to a bruise. When any tissue is damaged， the small blood vessels are disrupted， causing blood to leak out into the tissue spaces， so a contusion or a bruise is simply bleeding from small blood vessels， resulting in blood in the tissue spaces \\[7\\]. However， in the event of diffuse axonal injuries， when an external force is applied to the head， the brain suffers from acceleration and deceleration， causing the brain's top section to move in both directions， but the brain stem part remains constant or fixed in the same position and due to the movement of the upper portion axons present in the brain stem are damaged because these axons are very sensitive to shearing， they got injured that means consciousness might still be generated because consciousness is generated from the brain stem， but when axons are injured TBI injured patient suffered from impaired consciousness and became confused \\[8\\].**\n\n【22】**TBI's pathogenic process comprises both primary and secondary brain damage. The Primary brain injury is also called phase 1 injury occurwithin minutes ofprimary insult which damage meninges， glial-limitans， and parenchyma cells of the brain such as ATP (Adenosine Triphosphate)， HMGB-1. These signals binds with the PAMP(Pathogen-Associated Molecular Pattern) or DAMP (Damage-Associated Molecular Pattern)， Inflammation is initiated by PAMP or DAMP \\[9\\]. They induce inflammation to eliminate infection or for healing wounds. An example of DAMP or PAMP is TLR (Toll-Like Receptor)and Purinergicreceptor that induce immediate activation of resident myeloid cells like (Microglial cells and NALP1) that promote the generation of IL-1B and IL-18. NF-KB (Nuclear Factor Kappa B) is also activated which further induce immunological response and translocate to the nuclei of cells and persuade immunological program involving cellular proliferation and release inflammatory marker such as chemokines， cytokines， NO (Nitric Oxide) and ROS(Reactive Oxygen Species) \\[10\\]. NF-KB play important role as anti-**\n\n【23】**apoptotic agent， inhibit the apoptosis in TNF pathway. when TNF-a molecule bind to its TNFR1 receptor and initiate the apoptosis process by increasing the activity of SODD (Silencing of Death Domain)， but if SODD is not activated or TNF-a unable to bind with its receptor then TRAF-2 (TNF Receptor-Associated Factor) is recruited on the SODD site due to which apoptosis process is skipped and we will move towards the NF-KB pathway， TRAF (TNF-Receptor Apoptosis Factor) complex further recruits IAP protein (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein) and binds with the TRAF， further TRAF also recruits rip protein(receptor-interacting protein kinases)， this IKK (Inhibitor of nuclear factor Kappa-B subunit alpha) protein has kinase activity. This IKK molecule phosphorylate Inhibitor of Kappa B (IK-BA) due to which NF-KB dislocated from IKBA and NF-KB molecule become free and able to enter inside the nucleus， drives the expression of pro-inflammatory genes and anti-apoptotic genes and cytokines production (Figure 1)\\[11\\].**\n\n【24】**Aswe detect secondarybrain damage， it frequentlyprogresses from hours to months or years. It refers to the full set of phases or stages of cellular，tissue，chemical， orblood vascular alterations in the brain that may exacerbate brain tissue damage. Variables such as excitotoxicity， mitochondrial dysfunction， oxidative stress， neuroinflammation， axon degeneration， apoptotic cell death， and lipid peroxidation will all contribute to the secondary insult \\[12\\]. It has been shown that glutamate and aspartate assist to generate cellular alterations during secondary damage. Excess glutamate after TBI is caused by a lack of glutamate re-uptake owing to glutamate transporter malfunction. Furthermore， some studies show a 40% reduction in the expression of astrocytic sodium-dependent glutamate transporters GLAST and GLT-1 within 24 h of TBI， resulting in a considerable decrease in glutamate resorption. These are excitatory amino acids that play a crucial role in the activation of both ionotropic Glutamate Receptors(iGluRs) and metabotropic Glutamate Receptors (mGluRs) \\[13\\]. The N-Methyl-D-Aspartate (NMDA) receptor and -Amino-3-hydroxy-5-Methyl-4-isoxazole Propionate (AMPA) receptors are examples of**\n\n【25】**Figure 2： Role of glutamate in TBl and its role in apoptosis and neurodegeneration.**\n\n【26】**(iGluRs)， which are ligand-gated ion channel receptors that enable the inflow of Na+，k+， and Ca2+ upon binding to glutamate，causing membrane depolarization in neurons. Excess glutamate activates both AMPA and NMDA receptors， affecting ion homeostasis in postsynaptic neurons by increasing calcium and sodium ion influx. Glutamate activation of NMDA receptors increases the formation of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) and Nitric Oxide (NO)， which can trigger secondary brain damage \\[14\\] (Figure 2).**\n\n【27】**Accumulation of Ca2+ and ROS impairs mitochondrial function， which is one of the defining events of TBI because it causes severe metabolic and physiologic abnormalities， ultimately leading to cell death. Excess calcium andiron influx into the mitochondria cause the formation of ROS， inhibit the synthesis of ATP， and depolarize the mitochondrial membrane，resulting in the breakdown of the electron transport chain and disruption of the oxidative phosphorylation process， affecting the restoration of metabolic reactions for cell survival and calcium cycle regulation \\[15\\]. When the inner membrane protein Adenine Nucleotide Translocator (ANT) interacts to cyclophilin D， the conformational shift causes the mPTP to open， increasing the inner membrane permeability \\[16\\]. TBI contains particular proteins that target mitochondrial activity， causing mitochondria to enlarge by spilling apoptotic effectors over the mitochondrial membrane. These proteins are tiny mitochondria-derived activator caspases that are released into the cytosol and attach to the inhibitor of apoptosis protein， preventing apoptosis inhibition. Furthermore， cytochrome C is released from the mitochondria， where it binds to APAF-1 and ATP to form apoptosomes. These apoptosomes then cleave pro-caspase into caspase 3， resulting in cell death \\[17\\].**\n\n【28】**Preclinical TBI Biomarkers**\n\n【29】**Biomarkers are biological substances present in the blood and other bodily fluids that can play an essential role in providing**\n\n【30】**objective and quantitative information regarding the process behind neurological impairments and the degree of the damage. In the case of TBI， biomarkers such as HMGB1， S100B protein， MMP (Matrix Metalloproteins)， TIMP， LGALS3， ghrelin， UCHL-1， Tenascin-C， and HSP proteins are utilized to aid in the diagnosis and prognosis of the condition.**\n\n【31】**Role of HMGB1 protein in TBI**\n\n【32】**HMGB1 (High Mobility Group Box-1) is a ubiquitous nuclear protein that is an architectural chromatin-binding factor that can be involved in the maintenance of nucleosomes as well as the regulation of gene transcription \\[18\\]. It has two DNA binding domains known as the A and B box domains. A box has a binding site for the HMGB1receptor， but the B box has been identified as a pro-inflammatory domain， suggesting that it might be a functional biomarker of TBI\\[19\\]. During the primary insult， BOX protein is produced in the form of alarmin signals from the injured meninges and parenchyma cells； these signals then bind to the DAMP (Damage-Associated Molecular Pattern\\]OI _PAMP(Paracrine-AssociatedMolecular Pattern\\]_ (Pathogen-Associated Molecular Pattern) TLR (Toll-Like Receptor) is an example of a DAMP. These receptors also trigger or activate microglial cells and NLRP1 (Nucleotide-Binding Oligomerization Domain)， which can accelerate the creation of an inflammasome， which initiates pro-inflammatory cytokine production and causes an inflammatory response. HMGB1 has been shown to disrupt the Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB)， resulting in cognitive impairment \\[20\\]. It has been observed that TBI is related with neuroinflammation and cognitive abnormalities \\[21\\]， and HMGB1 has been shown to increase or begin neuroinflammation. In experimental models of TBI， treatment with an HMGB1 antagonist had a positive impact \\[22\\]. BOX protein is released after 30 min of damage and its expression decreases between one and six hours after TBI \\[23\\]. BOX protein has been linked to increased intracranial pressure in patients and the**\n\n【33】**promotion of cerebral edema following injury， with the hazardous impact of box protein aided by microglial activation. When compared to a normal control， the amount of HMGB1 following trauma increases up to thirty-fold within the first hour of damage \\[22\\].**\n\n【34】**Role of Heat Shock Protein (HSPs) in TBI**\n\n【35】**HSPs are basically chaperones that allow proteins to fold and accelerate the refolding of denatured proteins. They are increased inside cells when they are subjected to extreme stress， such as heat， cold， UV radiation， or damage. In the event that a protein is substantially misfolded， HSP has the capacity to destroy it \\[24\\]. Stress on the cells occurs during TBI as a result of a blow to the head and trauma， and at the time of the primary insult， \\[25\\] these proteins are released in the form of alarmin signals and bind with the DAMP proteins， inducing a cascade of events and allowing the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines \\[26\\]. HSPs are classified based on their molecular mass， and each one performs a unique set of functions. For example， HSP40 is involved in the breakdown of damaged proteins， whereas HSP70 has been shown to enhance neurological outcomes \\[27\\]. It has been observed that HSP70protects brain cells from experimental brain damage during TBI， but HSP70downregulation has different results， and HSP70 activation reduces protein aggregation. HSP induction is mediated by the Heat Shock Factor (HSF)， which binds to all HSP genes. HSF is essentially a transcriptional factor \\[28\\]. Under normal settings， HSPs are found intracellularly and coupled with HSF1， but when cells are subjected to stress， such as injury or trauma， this causes protein dissociation from HSF， causing these HSPs to linktothe denatured proteins \\[29\\].HSP70overexpression decreased the degree of brain bleeding and Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB) disruption， which will lessen BBB damage in TBI and suppress MMP production， improving neurological outcomes\\[30\\]. HSP70 also plays an important role in apoptosis， influencing the recruitment ofprocaspase 9 and Apoptosis protease factor1 (Apaf-1) and so inhibiting the intrinsic apoptotic pathway \\[31\\]. It has also been discovered that HSP70 suppresses NF-kB activation， which affects the**\n\n【36】**generation of pro-inflammatory cytokines \\[32\\].**\n\n【37】**Role of MMP (Matrix Metalloproteinases) and TIMP (Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase) in TBI**\n\n【38】**MMPs are extracellular enzymes that can play a significant role in the destruction of extracellular matrix proteins， \\[33\\] they have been found in the Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) of TBI patients in several investigations. MMPs have a role in proper growth， wound healing. and development； they are generally released as latent enzymes \\[34\\]. In the event of TBI， inflammation develops， which increases BBB permeability and， as a result， the number of MMPs greatly increases\\[35\\]. MMP-9 (Gelatinase-B) and MMP-2 (Gelatinase-A) levels rise during injury， which can lead to BBB breakdown， while MMP-3(stromelysin-1) contributes to the degradation of BBB basal lamina and tight junction proteins \\[36\\]. However， a larger concentration of MMP-9 has been found in the CSF of TBI patients， indicating the severity of the damage； they are an essential CSF biomarker for predicting the clinical fate of TBI patient \\[37\\]. As a result， while a rise in MMP concentration after TBI may be advantageous， a larger concentration might have negative consequences. It has also been claimed that MMPs are implicated in subsequent brain damage. MMP-9 levels are increased in neurological disorders， and its activation causes excitotoxicity， mitochondrial malfunction， and apoptosis \\[38\\]. The level of MMP-9 increases on the first day of the primary injury and is increased for seven days following the insult. Its concentration is greater in the TBI patient's cerebral cortex and hippocampus \\[39\\]， and it has also been observed in blood plasma. It has been suggested that a high level of MMPs leads to the development of Post-Traumatic Epilepsy (PTE)， and that inhibiting MMP-9 may bebeneficial in guarding against PTE \\[40\\]. The molecular mechanism of MMP and its function in TBI are (Figure 3). MMPs contribute to apoptosis， they activate the TNF-a which further activate TRADD and FADD， results in caspase-3 activation which induce apoptosis41.**\n\n【39】**Tissue Inhibitors of Metalloproteinase (TIMPs) are balancing**\n\n【40】**proteins that modulate the activity of MMPs. TIMPs are classified into four kinds (1， 2， 3， 4). They all have diverse mechanisms of action and operate on different MMPs to modulate their activities， such as TIMP-1 controlling MMP-9 or MMP-3 activity and TIMP-2 inhibiting MMP-2 activity \\[42\\]. TIMPs are dimers composed of an N-terminal domain and a smaller C-terminal domain that are stabilized by three disulfide bonds. The n-terminal domain of TIMP non-covalently binds to MMPs substrate unit at the zinc-binding site， which can be useful in inhibiting MMP activity \\[43\\].TIMP-1is an inducible form whose upregulation is dependent on factors such as TGF， IL-1， IL-6， epithelial growth factor and leukemia inhibitory factor， oncostatin， retinoids， etc. TIMP-1 is known to induce neuroprotective effects in the CNS by maintaining the BBB， suppressing apoptosis， and inhibiting excitotoxic cell death of neurons， whereas TIMP-2 and TIMP-3 are soluble non-glycosylated proteins that are expressed constitutively，and TIMP-3 is an insoluble protein that will bind to ECM components， and it is the only MMP that will inhibit TNF-a\\[44\\].**\n\n【41】**Role of ghrelin in TBI**\n\n【42】**Ghrelin is a peptide that is released inside the stomach. Its main function is to control food and metabolism， and it also has some neuroprotective properties. It also stimulates the production of growth hormone \\[45\\]. Ghrelin Receptors (GHS-R1a) are situated inside the brain and trigger growth hormone release. It also has certain extra-hypothalamic neuronal activities such as learning， memory， stress， and motivation \\[46\\]. Ghrelin has the ability to cross the BBB and has significant beneficial effects in TBI， particularly reducing the poor results of subsequent brain injury \\[47\\]. Following a first injury， numerous proteins are produced，which may contribute to later brain damage such as increased apoptosis and neuronal inflammation \\[48\\]. However， it has been reported that ghrelin has anti-apoptotic activity， and the mechanism behind this is that during the primary insult， proapoptotic BAX protein is stimulated and anti-apoptotic BCL-**\n\n【43】**2 protein is suppressed， causing cytochrome-C to be released from the mitochondria due to the opening of the MPTP and interacting with APAF-1 protein \\[49\\]. This will then interact with procaspase-9， resulting in the activation of the procaspase-9 molecule， which will then activate caspase-3， and apoptosis will begin； however， ghrelin also inhibits the activation of the BAX protein， which plays a crucial role in apoptosis. It will also activate ERK1/2， the protein kinase C pathway， and the protein kinase-A pathway， as well as enhance the production of mitochondrial Uncoupling Protein (UCP-2). Long-term inflammation is also a key source of secondary damage after TBI， although ghrelin will have a favorable impact by regulating inflammation and decreasing the production of TNF-or IL-1，making it appears to be advantageous in TBI \\[51\\].**\n\n【44】**Role of galectin-3 in TBI**\n\n【45】**Galectins are a protein family with 15 members， each with a unique function. Galectin-3 is one of the proteins present inside the nucleus or cytoplasm， and it will become the master regulator of inflammatory response in neurodegenerative illness \\[52\\]. In general， active microglial cells produce galectin-3； moreover， it is required for resident microglial activation and proliferation in response to damage \\[53\\]. Galectin-3levels in plasma are linked to the severity and prognosis of severe TBI； it is involved in cell adhesion， proliferation， migration， activation， apoptosis， and phagocytosis \\[54\\]. Galectin-3plays an important role in the regulation of brain inflammation and neurodegeneration； its level in the CSF is significantly increased within 24 h of injury； microglial cells express this protein in the presence of brain trauma \\[55\\]； and it has been observed that during the time of primary insult， the BBB is immediately disrupted， resulting in substantial leakage of Galectin-3 from the parenchyma cell into the CSF \\[56\\]. It will bind to the Toll-Like Receptors (TLR)， which are DAMP (Damage-Associated Molecular Pattern) that will induce activation of microglial cells， resulting in the release of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1， TNF-， and NF-kB， which**\n\n【46】**can further promote neurodegeneration， so neutralizing antibodies against Galentin-3 provide a beneficial effect， inhibiting the activation of microglial cells and the formation of inflammatory cytokines and promotes neuroprotection in head injury. TLR receptor inhibition has also been shown to be advantageous. According to research， Galactin-3 acts as an alarmin signal in TBI， and a high quantity of Galectin-3 in the CSF suggests a significant degree of damage \\[57\\].**\n\n【47】**Role of S100B protein in TBI**\n\n【48】**S100B protein is a calcium-binding protein present in the cytoplasm that is involved in a variety of activities such as cell differentiation and cell cycle progression \\[58\\]. It is an essential blood biomarker protein that plays a key role in TBI after the primary insult， these proteins are quickly released from the injured glial cell into the circulatory system， and it is an important tool that may be utilized as a proxy of imaging in TBI in contrast to MRI.**\n\n【49】**The mechanism underlying S100B in TBI is that during the primary insult， the BBB is damaged， causing S100B to be immediately released from the damaged glial cells. Following this， microglial cells are activated， and ROS production begins， which increases the production of proinflammatory cytokines and may lead to cell death and neuronal dysfunction \\[59\\]. It also increases RAGE signaling activation in neurons， which can lead to neuronal death. Changes in the expression of this marker have been linked to the severity of the injury and neurological consequences. It has been observed that in patients with severe damage， the concentration of S100B in blood is greater than 1.13 ng/ml， which is associated with an increase in mortality and morbidity \\[60\\].**\n\n【50】**Role of UCHL-1 in TB**\n\n【51】**Ubiquitin C-terminal hydroxylase is a blood biomarker protein that is present mostly in neurons throughout the brain after TBI \\[61\\]. It can be used to detect the severity of injury because it is a promising TBI biomarker that belongs to the family of deubiquitinating enzymes that recycle ubiquitin monomers and has the ability to promote the aggregation of a-synuclein， during the time of injury neurons are injured and then UCHL-1 are released into the CSF， it can also be detected in the systemic circulation \\[62\\]. UCHL-1 shows some favorable effects， such as mending the axons or neurons after injury by eliminating the aberrant protein via ubiquitin-proteasome pathway， which can keep the axons intact \\[63\\]. During the time of brain injury， various unpleasant lipid proteins are released， such as cyclopentenone and prostaglandin， which interact with the UCHL-1and hinder its activity. It has been shown that after moderate TBI， only a temporary increase in the level ofUCHL-1 has been seen \\[62\\]， however in severe TBI， the level of UCHL-1 in CSF is too high， and the level ofthis protein in the CSF or serum may be measured within7 h to 9 h after severe TBI. It can be identified by using the sandwich ELISA technique， and it is an essential biomarker that may be used to distinguish between minor and severe TBI. The half-life time(t1/2) of UCHL-1 in mTBI is around 7 h， but that of severe TBI is approximately 10 h\\[64\\].**\n\n【52】**Role of Tenascin-C in TBI**\n\n【53】**TNCs are matricellular proteins that are important inducers of inflammatory cascades in response to various stimuli and tissue injury \\[65\\]. TNCs， which are MCPs (Multicellular Proteins)， are significantly expressed throughout embryonic development. Theyare triggered by glial cells and astrocytes and play a vital part in brain development \\[66\\]， performing a range of activities including as**\n\n【54】**neuronal progenitor cell maturation， cell proliferation， proper CNS development， and maintaining synaptic plasticity， among others.**\n\n【55】**TNC levels have been significantly increased in brain parenchyma cells such as neurons and astrocytes during TBI， indicating multiple deleterious events such as BBB disruption， apoptosis， activation of the MAPK pathway， and NF-KB pathway activation \\[67\\]， which can further increase the severity of the injury. It will also raise the likelihood of first injury， which may increase the likelihood of subsequent damage. TNC will activate the TLR-4 receptor， which is basically a DAMP signal， which will further induce the activation of the microglial cells and inflammasomes， which will promote the generation of proinflammatory cytokines like IL-1and NF-KB， which can promote the generation of ROS and enhance the inflammation\\[68\\]. TNC will also upregulate the production of MMP-9 by activating the MAPK pathway， resulting in secondary brain damage. Excitotoxicity， mitochondrial malfunction， and apoptosis will follow\\[691. Patients with TBI had increased TNC levels in their CSF and plasma， indicating severe TBI \\[70\\] (Figure 4).**\n\n【56】**Role of tau protein in TBI**\n\n【57】**Tau protein is a microtubule-associated protein that is found in the neurons and helps in maintaining the morphology of neurons， they will play important role in signal transduction or vesicular transport \\[71\\]. The normal physiological function of tau protein is to promote the formation of microtubules. It will undergo post-translational changes， such as phosphorylation， which is essential for their proper functioning and is controlled by the balance of kinase and phosphatase activity \\[72\\]. This will affect the affinity of microtubules binding. Tau proteins become hyperphosphorylated during TBI because the microtubule by which tau protein binds is disintegrated during primary injury， resulting in the formation of neurofibrillary tangles of tau protein， which accumulate inside the brain and increase a cascade of events that show harmful effects such as increased oxidative stress because mitochondria is damaged and ROS formation is increased \\[73\\]. Tau proteins will also boost glutamate activation via the NMDA receptor， resulting in an increase in calcium influx into the cell， which will exacerbate excitotoxicityand neuronal death \\[74\\]. It also activates glial cells， which can boost the production of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1 and TNF-a. These cytokines further exacerbate neuroinflammation， which eventually leads to neuronal death. These variables occur because tau protein hyperphosphorylation ameliorates subsequent damage in TBI while eventually worsening the situation \\[75\\].**\n\n【58】**Diagnostic techniques for TBI**\n\n【59】**Diagnosis of TBI is itselfa chalengingtaskbecausein TBI different signs and symptoms have been seen with respect to time and different diagnostic techniques have been implemented， the mildness of injury is difficult to identify. Patients suffering from TBI report complex neurocognitive， neuropsychological， and physical symptoms these symptoms differ with respect to the severity of injury (e.g.， dizziness， motor problem，blurred vision，irritability， sensitivity to noise or light， the problem with memory or concentration， transient neurological abnormalities， sleep disturbance， nausea and behavioral/emotional symptoms (e.g.， depression， anxiety， aggression， impulsivity). whereas in case of severe TBI symptoms have been worsened like loss of consciousness， severe headache， short term memory loss， seizures or convulsions， coma， locked-in syndrome， and brain herniation have been seen. Therefore， clinicians have evaluated the severity of the injury and facilitate the diagnostic management for each patient**\n\n【60】**different diagnostic tool have been employed and practically used for the assessment of TBI \\[761.**\n\n【61】**Evaluation of Consciousness**\n\n【62】**Different tools have been used to check the level of consciousness.**\n\n【63】**Glasgow coma scale**\n\n【64】**The Glasgow coma scale is a useful instrument for providing an initial evaluation score by monitoring a persons degree of consciousness following a TBI \\[77\\]. GCS evaluates a patient's ability to do the visual movement， motor movement， and verbal test； these three characteristics assist clinicians in determining the severity of the damage \\[78\\]. GCS scores range from 1 to 15， if the patient score is 1to 3， it indicates that the patient's condition is worsening or that the injury is more severe because the patient is completely unconscious\\[791. If the patient score is 13 to 15， it indicates that the patient has a mild TBI and is not in danger \\[80\\]； with the help of this scoring scale， clinicians can determine the severity of the injury.**\n\n【65】**Evaluation of Cognitive Function**\n\n【66】**For assessment of cognitive function different tests have been conducted like-**\n\n【67】**King-Devick test**\n\n【68】**King-Devick is a concussion screening test used to assess the patient's cognitive health because after TBI， the hippocampus， also known as the memory store， is disrupted， resulting in post-injury cognitive impairment \\[81\\]. If the patient's cognitive function is disrupted， it indicates the severity of the damage because it has been seen that in severe TBI， cognitive or memory function is impaired82.**\n\n【69】**The doctor analyses the patient’s cognitive performance with the assistance of this KD test， which consists of several cards with numbers printed on them， and the patient reads the number aloud. This test takes less than 2 min to complete， and the clinician scores the patient based on the time required.**\n\n【70】**Evaluation ofMotorFunction**\n\n【71】**Balance Error Scoring System (BESS)**\n\n【72】**BESS is an important tool for evaluating the patient's postural stability and motor function； in this subject， perform some simple activities such as opening the eyes， falling out of the initial position， movement of the hands， lifting the toes， remaining out of the same position for more than 5 sec， simply walking in a straight line， and so on. Clinicians use these functions to assess the patient's motor function and postural stability \\[83\\].**\n\n【73】**Blood biomarker analysis**\n\n【74】**These are crucial tools in the diagnosis of a TBI. Using these blood biomarker tests； clinicians may quickly evaluate the degree of the damage and the status of the TBI. Various biomarker analyses， such as levels of S100B， MMPs， HMGB1， TAU protein， and Galentin-3， can be performed. If the level of these protein biomarkers in the bloodstream significantly increases， it indicates the severity of the injury because these protein biomarkers are somehow involved in the injury， some of which are released from the damaged cell and further ameliorate the injury condition， and some of which are involved in worsening the primary injury to secondary injury and at that time\\[84\\]. These biomarkers are released into the bloodstream or CSF by blood plasma analysis. These proteins are identified in an excessive**\n\n【75】**amount， indicating the severity of the damage， and are utilized as a diagnostic tool.**\n\n【76】**Neuroimaging for diagnosis of TBI**\n\n【77】**Neuroimaging techniques can be used for the diagnosis of brain injury these are of various types and they will provide injury status of the brain \\[85\\]，andtheamount of injury received by the brain generally Computed Tomography (CT)， Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)， Positron Emission Tomography (PET) \\[86\\]. CT is a widely used neuroimaging technique for the diagnosis of brain injury because it is a fast and highly accurate process in the detection of skull fracture and hemorrhage， it is generally indicated for moderate and severe TBI where GCS score is less than or equals to 12 (GCS ≤ 12) and for the patient who is suffering from persistent headache， seizures， amnesia， loss of consciousness， etc. CT is able to reflect the size， shape， and distribution of the brain tissue， but there is a limitation with the CT that it is unable to detect all types of brain injury \\[87\\]**\n\n【78】**The second widely used neuroimaging technique is MRI， it can provide detailed information of the concussion， tissue injury， and hemodynamics， by the help of MRI clinician is able to detect the minute bleeding， contusion or it is able to detect changes in the brain function. Nowadays PET imaging technique has increased attention clinically in detecting the condition of the brain after TBI in this radiotracer is used to detect the injury generally， Fluorodeoxyglucose(FDG) is the most widely used radiotracer， by the help of (PET) clinicians are able to analyze a single biomarker like TAU protein level in the brain， amyloid-B level， etc.， \\[88\\].**\n\n【79】**Current drug therapy used in TBI**\n\n【80】**TBI is a serious problem all over the world. Generally， at the time of impact， primary injury occurs， which is unpreventable； however， if the patient remains untreated or undiagnosed，the condition worsens and leads to secondary brain injury， which is the leading cause of death； various factors are involved in secondary injury， which can exacerbate the injury.**\n\n【81】**Many drugs that can undergo clinical trials and have the ability to reduce the incidence and disastrous effect of secondary injury， many of them inhibit secondary injury and increase the chance of the patient becoming healthy， these are some drugs that can be used in TBI like N-acetyl cysteine， minocycline，phenserine， progesterone， Erythropoietin， Glibenclamide、 Iminocycline， propranolol， Tranexamic acid， Valproic acid， simvastatin， Cyclosporine.**\n\n【82】**N-acetyl cysteine**\n\n【83】**N-acetyl cysteine is a key neuroprotective drug thatTcan increase the level of GSH in the brain because GSH possesses (ROS) scavenging characteristics \\[89\\].NAC will also lower Tau proteins and amyloid-deposition in the brain and serve as an anti-inflammatory agent. NAC will enhance cognitive performance and alleviate mild TBI symptoms \\[90\\].**\n\n【84】**Minocycline**\n\n【85】**Minocycline (MINO))isanantibiotic thatwill exhibit neuroprotective activity in TBi. In a TBI rat model，(MINO) will treat the neurological deficits caused by TBI \\[91\\]. MINO is also known to decrease microglial activation and IL-1 release， both of which can contribute to an inflammatory response and exacerbate damage \\[92\\]. It will also diminish TBI-induced locomotor abnormalities， which will enhance long-term results post-TBI. At a dosage of 100 mg BID for 7 days， MINO will drastically lower S100B and NSE levels \\[9331\\].**\n\n【86】**Cyclosporine A**\n\n【87】**Cyclosporine is a commonly used immunosuppressant medicine with a neuroprotective effect because CsA suppresses apoptosis and the mitochondrial permeability transition pore， preventing mitochondrial damage after TBI， \\[94\\] CsA’s neuroprotective impact is dose-dependent， and its therapeutic window lasts up to 24 h after damage \\[95\\]. When CsA is taken early after a severe TBI， it has an excellent activity and safety profile， and it also reduces lesion volume. CsA injection post-injury dramatically reduces brain lesion volume and improves indicators of neurological impairment \\[96\\].**\n\n【88】**Progesterone**\n\n【89】**Progesterone (anti-oxidant) was given within 24h of the TBI，and the intervention lasted from three days to six weeks \\[97\\]. The effect of progesterone therapy on TBI clinical outcomes was beneficial， with increased recovery from damage， stabilization of edema， enhanced cognitive performance that can be compromised during injury， and decreased TBI sequelae.**\n\n【90】**Progesterone is able to reduce the proinflammatory cytokine production， the amount of inflammation-relatedsubstances， excitotoxicity， and apoptosis by reducing the level of caspase-3， which inhibits secondary damage outcomes and clinically improves the condition of patients \\[98\\].**\n\n【91】**Simvastatin**\n\n【92】**Simvastatin is an antihyperlipidemic medication that will also exhibit neuroprotective action in a TBI model by inhibiting the apoptotic pathway by downregulating caspase-3 activation and increasing the production of various growth factors that can induce neurogenesis \\[99\\]. Simvastatin inhibited the activation of Toll-Like Receptors (TLR) throughout the clinical trial， which are DAMP signals that can further activate proinflammatory cytokines， TLR remain inactivated，however， due to Simvastatin's protective function， and the activation of IL-1， NF-KB，and TNF-is blocked \\[100\\].**\n\n【93】**Simvastatin also reduces the amountofGFAP，which is a powerful TBI blood biomarker that can reflect the severity of the injury \\[101\\].**\n\n【94】**Propranolol**\n\n【95】**Over-excitation of the sympathetic or adrenergic system has negative consequences after a TBI； to reduce sympathetic excitation， propranolol has a positive impact in TBI \\[102\\]. our strategy is to use p-blocker to reduce sympathetic hyperactivity. Propranolol has a beneficial effect by reducing sympathetic storm， it can cross the BBB and help reduce brain edema， increase cerebral perfusion， improve neurological outcomes， and it also inhibits the cascade of inflammatory changes associated with injury \\[103\\].**\n\n【96】**Phenserine**\n\n【97】**Phenserine is an anti-acetylcholinesterase drug that reduces neuroinflammation by suppressing the synthesis of proinflammatory cytokine like TNF-a and prevents apoptosis by upregulating BCL-2and BDNFlevels \\[104\\]. While decreasing the amounts ofproapoptotic enzymes like as caspase-3， phenserine has been shown to lower the level of GFAP protein biomarker of TBI and limit the creation of amyloid precursor protein and a-synuclein.**\n\n【98】**Phenserine reduces the effects of secondary damage by inhibiting excitotoxicity and oxidative stress \\[105\\].**\n\n【99】**Calcium channel blockers**\n\n【100】**Excitotoxicity is the primary source of subsequent damage**\n\n【101】following TBI； it arises as a result of a high intracellular calcium concentration， which can over-activate glutamate 106Excitotoxicity can be prevented by using one of two types of calcium channel blockers： L-type or N-type calcium channel blockers \\[107\\].\n\n【102】**The two primary calcium channel blockers that will prevent additionalIieruI1a1damageareNimodipine(L-type) and Ziconotide (N-type). Ziconotide has been demonstrated to increase mitochondrial function and has been shown to improve patient condition \\[108\\].**\n\n【103】**Future outcomes**\n\n【104】**T'BI is a complex dynamicprocess that initiates a cascade ofcellular pathway that will produce a deleterious effect. Pathology of TBI is so wide， it includes a variety of events that will initiates the injury and worsening the condition like excitotoxicity， neuroinflammation， cell death， oxidative stress. Primary injury is unpreventable but our main goal is to prevent the secondary injury， many biomarkers are which can be used for the diagnosis of TBI like HMGB1， MMP， UCHL-1， but there is a greater need to explore specific biomarker ofTBI.**\n\n【105】**Each biomarker of this review could be carefully considered for future application in the research of TBI.**\n\n【106】**References**\n\n【107】**1\\.** **Venkatesh VT， Pradeep Kumar MV， Jagannatha SR， Radhika RH，** Pushpalatha K.

However，the suitability of RMT for patients with different characteristics and different severity of COPD is unknown. We investigated the effectiveness of home-based RMT in three patients with COPD with different characteristics， including symptoms of respiratory diseases， dynamic hyperinflation， and respiratory muscle weakness， and who presented with varying degrees of COPD severity from COPD Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) grades II to IV. The three patients underwent home-based RMT therapy. They all continued to take existing medication and performed RMT exercises for 8 weeks with a target respiratory muscle training load of 50% of each participant's maximum respiratory muscle strength. Data on dyspnea sensation， Quality of Life (QoL)， respiratory muscle strength， pulmonary function， 6-Min Walk Distance (6MWD)， and diaphragm excursion were collected. The patient with symptoms of respiratory diseases improved the most as indicated by a decrease in dyspnea sensation during activity and an improvement in diaphragm excursion at rest. The patient with dynamic hyperinflation had an increase in the changed of inspiratory capacity and the 6MWD. The patient with respiratory muscle weakness had an improved QoL. Further studies should be performed with larger sample sizes.**\n\n【15】**Keywords： Respiratory muscle training； Symptoms of respiratory diseases；IDynamic hyperventilation； Respiratory muscle weakness； Diaphragm sonography； COPD**\n\n【16】**Introduction**\n\n【17】**COPD has an estimated prevalence rate of 6.1% in the general population in Taiwan \\[1\\]. Rochester showed that generalized muscle weakness in patients with COPD contributes to low inspiratory muscle strength next to hyperinflation \\[2\\]. Furthermore， Maximum Inspiratory Pressure (MIP) is known to be impaired by hyperinflation due to shortening of the inspiratory muscles \\[3\\]. Total Lung Capacity (TLC) is calculated according to lung volume-related physiology as the sum of End-Expiratory Lung Volume (EELV) and Inspiratory Capacity (IC) \\[4\\]. Thus， when air trapping during physical activity， EELV increases， IC decreases， and TLC remains constant. This phenomenon is known as dynamic hyperventilation.**\n\n【18】**We can surmise that hyperventilation leads to diaphragm limitation during exercise. A Min et al. found that the degree of diaphragmatic excursion during deep breathing was lower in patients with COPD and correlated significantly with disease severity \\[5\\].**\n\n【19】**Alba et al. demonstrated that inspiratory muscles training induces adaptive changes in the structure of the external intercostal muscles \\[6\\]. Improvement in inspiratory muscle performance is associated with an increase in 6MWD and the sensation of dyspnea \\[7\\]. Furthermore， Chun et al. \\[8\\] reported significant improvements after pulmonary rehabilitation in diaphragmatic motion during full inspiration and expiration in both lungs， indicated by fluoroscopy imaging findings \\[8\\].**\n\n【20】**Therefore， this case series investigated the effects of RMT in patients with COPD who exhibit classic respiratory symptoms， dynamic hyperinflation， or respiratory muscle weakness.. We investigated the effectiveness of RMT in patients with COPD of varying severity who present with various symptoms.**\n\n【21】**Materials and Methods**\n\n【22】**Study design and subjects**\n\n【23】**The study protocol was approved by the ethics committee of the Taipei Medical University Joint Institutional Review Board， Taiwan(Study Code： N201808069). Data collection were performed from October 2018 to June 2019 at Taipei Medical University Hospital Pulmonary Rehabilitation Center， Taipei， Taiwan. A signed consent form has been obtained from all of the patients. The inclusion criteria were the participants who were categorized from moderate (GOLD II) to very severe (GOLD IV) COPD， age from 40 to 90 years old with stable condition. The GOLD strategy for COPD categorization was located in group B. The exclusion criteria were neuromuscular disease， diaphragm paralysis， dementia and COPDAE past 3 months.**\n\n【24】**Patient 1 exhibited respiratory disease symptoms. Patient 2exhibited dynamic hyperventilation. Patient 3 had respiratory muscle weakness. Participants were permitted to continue taking existing medication. We collected the following information： Health history， dyspnea sensation， Quality of Life (QoL)，respiratory muscle strength， pulmonary function，6MWT，and diaphragm excursion.**\n\n【25】**Respiratory muscle training with a Dofin breathing trainer**\n\n【26】**RMT involving both inspiratory and expiratory muscles was performed. The target training load was set individually at 50% ofeach participant's MIP and MEP. After 4 weeks， participants returned to the pulmonary rehabilitation center for a respiratory muscle strength evaluation. Updated MIP and MEP values were used to adjust each participant's target training load. Participants then performed RMT involving 30 breaths per day with a pause of 30s to 60s after every five breaths. The experimentlasted for 8 weeks.**\n\n【27】**Outcome evaluation**\n\n【28】**Exercise pulmonary function test： Dynamic hyperinflation used to be indicated by a change in IC (AIC， in liters) of less than or equal to -0.10 L at the peak of exercise \\[9\\]； however， it is more recently indicated by a tidal volume at peak exercise (VT peak) /TLC of less than 0.4 \\[10\\]. Pulmonary function test was assessed using a spirometer (Vitalograph model 6800). Participants performed a6MWT to measure their exercise endurance index.**\n\n【29】**Respiratory muscle strength test： The MIP Lower Limit of Normal (LLN) was 62 - (0.15 ×age)， and the MEP LLN was 117 -(0.83 xage) cmH，O in men \\[11\\]. In our analysis， patients with MIP<60 cmH，O were considered to have inspiratory muscle weakness\\[12\\]. MIP and MEP were measured with GaleMedGas Pressure Gauge， while participants were in a sitting position.**\n\n【30】**Quality of life evaluation： QoL was measured using the CAT formulated by from GlaxoSmithKline. A Short Form 12-item (SF-12) survey was used to measure functional health and wellbeing from each participant’s perspective.**\n\n【31】**Diaphragm excursion measurement： Diaphragm excursion was measured using ultrasound imaging (Hitachi Noblus) of resting deep breath by one thoracic medical physician. The measurement reference lines were the bilateral scapular lines and bilateral posterior**\n\n【32】**axillary lines. We measured the distance moved according to the grid lines on the screen of the ultrasound imaging machine.**\n\n【33】**Results**\n\n【34】**Patient 1 was a 78-year-old man presenting with symptoms of a respiratory disease and moderately severe COPD with predicted FEV1 of 54% and an mMRC score of 2. The 6MWD at baseline was147 m， and that after RMT intervention was 244 m. At baseline， the Borg scale at rest was 5 and that after the 6MWT was 7； after the RMT intervention， the Borg scale at rest was 2 and that after the 6MWTwas3， indicating an improvement in the sensation of dyspnea.**\n\n【35】**QoL also improved considerably. Scores from the SF-12 survey increased from 40% to 63%； specifically， the scores increased from21% to 50% in the physical component and 52% to 71% in the mental component. The CAT score decreased from 20 to 14 points.**\n\n【36】**MIPincreased from 80 cmHO to 104cmH.O，and MEPincreased from 100 cmH，Oto 120cmH，O. Diaphragm excursion also increased from 4 cm to7cm.**\n\n【37】**Patient 2 was a 77-year-old man who presented with dynamic hyperventilation and severe COPD with predicted FEV1 of 35% and an mMRC score of 1. The exercise pulmonary function test revealed a AIC of -0.12 L after the 6MWT. At baseline，his 6MWD was 263 m， and post-RMT， his 6MWD was 433 m. Also， it is worth noting that the AIC was from -0.12 improved to 0.09.**\n\n【38】**The QoL and CAT scores also improved.

The resting deep breath diaphragm excursion was unchanged at 4cm.**\n\n【45】**Patient 3 was a 75-year-old man who presented with respiratory muscle weakness and very severe COPD with predicted FEV1 of 11%and an mMRC score of 4. The 6MWD at baseline and that following RMT intervention were 89 and 111 m， respectively. QoL improved considerably. Scores from the SF-12 survey increased from 51% to77%； The CAT score decreased from 21 to 19 points.**\n\n【46】**His respiratory muscle strength improved slightly. At baseline， his MIP was 12 cmH.O， and MEP was 48 cmH.O. Post-RMT intervention， the MIP was 22 cmH.O and MEP was 54 cmHO. The diaphragm excursion did not change significantly. The distance in the right post-axillary line was 1.5 cm at baseline and 2 cm post-RMT intervention (Table 1，2).**\n\n【47】**We measured diaphragm movement using four lines， which were**\n\n【48】**the scapular line and the post-axillary line on both the right and left sides. The distribution was related. The post-axillary line was slightly longer than the scapular line (Figure 1).**\n\n【49】**Discussion**\n\n**The aim of this case series was to identify characteristics that are associated with favorable outcomes from RMTintervention. Increased breathing difficulty is indicated by a high inspiratory pressure to MIP ratio， which is related to perceived dyspnea sensation \\[13\\]. Chuang et al. \\[14\\] revealed that RMT increases MIP， improves 6MWT， reduces sensations of dyspnea， and improves QoL， allowing patients to more easily perform daily activities in patients with moderate to very severe COPD|14.**\n\n【51】**We found that in patient 1， when symptoms subsided， the QoL improved. Previous research has shown that MIP has a significant negative correlation with diaphragm excursion \\[15\\]. His diaphragm excursion increased from 4 cm to 7 cm accompany by increase MIP also noted.**\n\n【52】**Patient 2 presented MIP， MEP and 6MWD increased after the RMT intervention. A previous study showed that higher inspiratory muscle strength leads to improved exercise capacity and reduces dynamic hyperinflation and breathlessness during exercise \\[16\\]. We now have a better understanding of the mechanisms that lead to improved exercise capacity through RMT. QoL also improved with increased exercise tolerance. No change was observed in the diaphragm excursion in patient 2， different results might be observed if the diaphragm is measured in an active state.**\n\n【53】**Patient 3 presented with very severe COPD and with respiratory muscle weakness. Decreased MEP is common in patients with advanced COPD \\[2\\]. His 6MWD increased by only 22 m. But the minimum clinically important difference of the 6MWD suggests approximately 32 m \\[17\\]. The increase in diaphragm excursion only**\n\n【54】**0.5 cm was below the threshold of clinical measurement accuracy. Despite the poor clinical results， this patient’s QoL improved much. The benefits of RMT for patients with very severe COPD remains unknown. Patient 3 did not show significant improvement probably because the training period was too short or because complementary modalities were required. In any case， RMT resulted in maintained muscle strength and increased exercise capacity， thereby improving QoL.**\n\n【55】**In conclusion， RMT has varying degrees of benefit for patients with COPD. Prolonged RMT or RMT in combination with additional training may provide better results.**\n\n【56】**Conclusion**\n\n【57】**Additional RMT increased MIP，MEP， CAT scores and QoL. The participant with symptoms of respiratory diseases had the greatest improvement in diaphragm excursion. The participant with dynamic hyperinflation had an increased AIC， which subsequently improved exercise capacity. The participant with respiratory muscle weakness， which is usually associated with very severe COPD， exhibited improvement in QoL.**\n\n【58】**Acknowledgment**\n\n【59】The authors gratefully acknowledge the support of the patients who were involved in this study.\n\n【60】**Funding**\n\n【61】This study was funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan (MOST 108-2314-B-038-113-MY3； MOST111-2314-B-038-090-MY3； MOST 111-2314-B-038-082-， and the Ministry of Education of Taiwan (DP2-111-21121-01-T-01-05).\n\n【62】**References**\n\n【63】**1\\.

The spectrum of symptoms and organ involvements - in the acute， subacute phase and in post-COVID-19 syndrome-are still evolving and not fully known. Infected patients may be asymptomatic or they may present mild to severe multi-organ complications \\[1\\]. Among neurological manifestations of COVID-19 infection， an altered sense of smell or taste was early recognized as one of the most characteristic symptoms. Data from a multicenter European study reported olfactory and gustatory dysfunction among 85.6% and 88.0% of patients， respectively\\[2\\]. Recently， there has been a growing evidence of otoneurological symptoms such as tinnitus， hearing loss and balance disorders \\[3\\]. Several authors， however， remarked on the need of studies with follow-up assessments using standard objective tests \\[4\\].**\n\n【23】**Herein we reviewed the international literature of COVID-19-related vestibular disorders including only detailed cases with clinical confirmed diagnosis. Additionally， we reported two cases ofobjective vertigo with nausea and vomiting， experienced during COVID-19 infection and in post-COVID-19 period， referred to our hospital.**\n\n【24】**A structured search of the English literature published on PubMed， from December 01，2019 to January 22nd， 2022， was performed by searching the terms “vestibular neuritis” and“COVID-19”.Only inherent reports with SARS-CoV-2-positive patients， as confirmed by molecular nasopharyngeal swab and with detailed clinical and diagnostic data were considered. Survey-based studies and papers clearly not related to the object were excluded.**\n\n【25】**A description of two consecutive cases of COVID-19-induced vestibular impairment evaluated at the Audiology and Phoniatrics Unit of Treviso Hospital between January 01， 2021 and January22m，2022 is reported. The study was conducted in accordance with the principles of the Helsinki Declaration. Patients gave their written consent for clinical case publication. Data were examined**\n\n【26】**in accordance with Italian privacy and sensitive data laws， and the in-house regulations of our Institution.**\n\n【27】**Results**\n\n【28】**Literature review**\n\n【29】**The review process is shown in Figure 1. After applying the above mentioned criteria， 15 papers were retrieved and 6 were included： 1retrospective 5\\] study and 5 case reports 6-10J.**\n\n【30】**Four patients were excluded from the article by Malayala et al.\\[6\\] due to repetition of previously published cases \\[7\\]， and to the presence of unconfirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We found5 case reports which overall described 6 patients who were given the diagnosis of VN related to COVID-19. Five patients were female and one patient was a young male (age ranging from 13 to 63). They all were given the diagnosis of mild or moderate COVID-19 according to the international guidelines \\[1\\]. Table 1 summarizes characteristics of included patients.**\n\n【31】**All the patients experienced typical symptoms of VN： Rotatory vertigo and unsteadygait with associated nausea and vomit. Diagnosis was obtained through physical examination， instrumental tests and exclusion ofother possible disorders (Table 2).**\n\n【32】**In three cases \\[6，8，9\\] the VN symptoms emerged at onset of COVID-19. In the other three patients the vestibular symptoms occurred after 13 days of COVID-19\\[6\\]， after 32 days \\[10\\] and after2 months \\[7\\] from the beginning of infection. Notably two cases described by Vanaparthyet al. \\[7\\] and Aasfara et al.\\[10\\] alsopresented unilateral facial palsy. All patients were treated with corticosteroids and/or vestibular rehabilitation. In the cases who performed a follow-up \\[6，8-10\\]， a resolution of symptoms was noticed after one month.**\n\n【33】**Case report 1**\n\n【34】**A 31-year-old woman referred to our department. According to her history， in August 2020 she complained of cough， fever， rhinitis， headache， fatigue， muscular pain， and loss of smell and taste. The patient underwent nasopharyngeal swab and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection， as confirmed with Real-Time PCR test.**\n\n【35】**After three days since symptoms onset， she had sudden objective24-h-lasting vertigo， with nausea and vomiting. She did not have any associated cochlear symptoms (e.g.， tinnitus， hearing loss or ear fullness) or central nervous system symptoms (e.g.， diplopia or loss of consciousness). Accordingtohergeneralpractitioner'sadvice，shetook symptom-relief medications and rested. During the following days her vertigo and dizziness progressively improved. One month later， she tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 infection (PCR test on repeated nasopharyngeal swab). During the following months she complained of recurrent episodes of dizziness， therefore she underwent clinical evaluations in our department. At physical examination no relevant clinical signs were present： No postural sway， external auditory canals and tympanic membranes were normal， spontaneous nystagmus was absent， and bed-side examination (Rose position， Dix-Hallpike and Pagnini-McClure maneuvers) were negative. Bithermal caloric test was performed at 50°C for warm air and 24C for cold air， 60sec of stimulation per year under direct visualization of tympanic membrane. It showed a left side hyporeflexia (40% left hypofunction with 15% right side directional preponderance). Dizziness handicap inventory resulted in 30/100 (mild handicap). All other instrumental tests were negative： ocular motility tests were normal， pure-tone audiometryand ABR revealed bilateral normal hearing，and Distorted Product Otoacoustic Emissions (DPOAE) were present.**\n\n【36】**The patient had not suffered from any pre-existent audiovestibular disorder before infection. According to the symptoms described during SARS-CoV-2 infection and reported findings， a diagnosis of COVID-19-related Vestibular Neuritis (VN) in compensatory phase at the moment of our evaluation was hypothesized， therefore vestibular rehabilitation exercises were prescribed. One month later， on a telephone follow-up interview， the patient stated that her dizziness episodes had resolved.**\n\n【37】**Case report 2**\n\n【38】**A 44-year-old man was evaluated at our unit complaining of sudden onset， 4 h before， of objective rotatory vertigo， nausea and vomiting.

A neurologic examination showed no abnormalities， a CT scan of the brain was negative for acute ischemic-hemorrhagic events； blood tests were within normallimits.**\n\n【45】**The patient had not suffered from any audiovestibular disorder previously. Recent medical history was relevant for mild COVID-19disease one month before. The infection that was confirmed by a positive PCR nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 lasted 2 weeks and was characterized by anosmia and dysgeusia.**\n\n【46】**A right side VN of probable viral origin was then diagnosed. At discharge a counseling， including reassurance on benignity of symptoms， was performed， oral steroid therapy was prescribed (50**\n\n【47】**mg prednisolone daily for 5 days and subsequent tapering of the drug for 5 days) followed by vestibular rehabilitation exercises after therapy.**\n\n【48】**A follow-up appointment was set for one month after. At the second evaluation， the patient denied any rotatory vertigo. Romberg's and Unterberger's tests were normal， spontaneous and positional nystagmuses were absent. Bithermal caloric test was performed， as previously described， and the exams showed right side hyporeflexia (29% right hypofunction with 21% left side directional preponderance). Ocular motility was within normal limits， pure tone-audiometry， tympanometry DPOAE and ABR revealed normal hearing functions， dizziness handicap inventory resulted in 6/100 (no handicap).**\n\n【49】**Discussion**\n\n【50】**VN is an inflammatory inner ear disorder that involves the vestibular portion of the 84h cranial nerve \\[11\\]. Current findings about etiology mainly support the role of viruses (first infection and viral reactivation) and dysregulated immunological responses. VN is usually a benign and self-limiting condition， but in some cases can lead to residual imbalance. Diagnosis is typically based on clinical history and symptoms， ear nose and throat evaluation including vestibular test， videonystagmography with caloric test， and audiometry \\[12\\]. Application of the HINTS protocol (Head Impulse， Nystagmus， test of Skew) in the emergency room is essential to rule out a cerebellar stroke， with a sensitivity of 96.7% and a specificity of94.8%\\[131. The presence ofunidirectional nystagmus， a positive head impulse test in the opposite side than the fast phase of nystagmus and the absence of vertical eye misalignment and other neurologic symptoms can be highly diagnosed of acute peripheral vestibulopathy\\[14\\]. In doubtful cases， a neurological evaluation - eventually including neuro-radiological images - is required in order to exclude any central causes of vertigo. In recent years， a growing interest was put in cervical and ocular Vestibular Evoked Myogenic Potentials(cVEMPS and oVEMPS) and in the video Head Impulse Test (vHIT) as useful tools for the diagnostic work-up of VN. In particular vHIT， by analyzing the distribution of semicircular canals involvement， allows identification of selective vestibular structures alterations \\[12\\]. Definition of the site of vestibular damage and distinction between upper and/or lower branch of vestibular nerve involvement may correlate with the underlying cause of acute peripheral vestibular deficit， but does not change the initial treatment. The management of VN typically includes symptomatic relief medications， such as antiemetic drugs. Corticosteroids are prescribed with the aim of reducing vestibular inflammation. Vestibular rehabilitation has the role of enhancing the mechanism of central balance compensation that usually occurs within 2 to 8 months \\[15\\].**\n\n【51】**The incidence of vestibular disorders in COVID-19 patients is still unknown and varies across different studies. Data based upon an Italian multicenter study questionnaire administration \\[16\\] showed that 18.4% ofpatients reported equilibrium disorders after COVID-19diagnosis (dizziness in 94.1% and acute vertigo episodes in 5.9%). A recent investigation about possible residual vestibular impairment in48 recovered patients found dizziness in 8.3% of subjects， spinning vertigo in 2%， dynamic and static imbalance in 2% and 6.3%respectively \\[4\\]. These symptoms were mostly transitory and there was no evidence of clinically relevant persistent vestibular damage. Preliminary meta-analysis showed a pooled prevalence of 7.2% for rotatory vertigo， but the authors reported a possible overestimation**\n\n【52】**because it was not always clear whether the included studies report a new onset vertigo or change in preexisting symptom \\[3\\].**\n\n【53】**The retrospective study by Charpiot et al. \\[5\\] is a quantification of the numberofhospitaladmissions forAcute PeripheralVestibulopathy(APV) in 5 French Hospitals over the period February-May 2020 \\[3\\]. A comparison with 2018 and 2019 showed no significant increase in admission for APV， no significant difference among hospitals located in COVID-19high-and low-risk zones and no significant increase in the severity ofthe APV cases \\[3\\]. In accordance， a retrospective review of acute cochleo-vestibular disorders after and before pandemic conducted at our department found no significant changes regarding incidence of APV.**\n\n【54】**Our review retrieved only 5 case reports， in which overall6different ppatients with COVID-19 related acute vestibular impairment were included. Moreover we reported clinical and instrumental findings of two cases of vestibular impairment possibly associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Other main differential diagnoses of acute peripheral vestibulopathy have to be considered. A first episode of Meniere’s disease \\[17\\] or vestibular migraine attack18could have occurred \\[18，191. Nevertheless， the literature review we have presented may support our clinical hypothesis. According to our review， in three cases VN was present at the onset of COVID-19\\[6，8，9\\]. The mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 can cause VN is unclear and speculative. Given its neurotrophic potential， a direct effect on the cochleo-vestibular nerve can be postulated， similarly to its pathogenesis in hypo/anosmia and optic neuritis. In this respect， the cellular receptor Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2(ACE2)， that mediates the intracellular entry of SARS-CoV-2， has been found in nasal tissues in murine and human model and in Eustachian tube， middle ear and cochlear tissues in murine model \\[20\\]. A relationship with vasculitis or vasculopathy has also been suggested \\[6\\]. Another possibility is that the physical and emotional stress that people with SARS-CoV-2 infection experienced could have played a role in the expression ofvestibular symptoms-as occurred for headache patients\\[21\\]-or could have triggered the reactivation ofpossiblelatent viruses(e.g.， HSV-1) \\[22\\]. This latter mechanism could be hypothesized especially in patients in which VN was not present at COVID-19symptoms onset but later during the course of the disease \\[6，7，10\\]. Our second case， as well as the cases of Vanaparthy et al. \\[7\\]， due to the temporal delay between PCR negativity and onset of vertigo， suggests the possibility of VN occurrence in the subacute phase of infection. To date， the post-COVID-19 syndrome is characterized by neurological symptoms such as headache， anxiety/depression， sleep and cognitive disturbances \\[23\\]. Finally， a SARS-CoV-2 neuro-invasive disease，leading to a COVID-19-related meningoencephalitis， may be implicated， as described for audiovestibular impairment in other neurotrophic viruses \\[24\\]. The latter situation does not certainly regard our patients， as oculomotor testing was accurate and ruled out any functional change in the central vestibular pathways.**\n\n【55】**The data we found in literature could be underestimated because many patients may not have undergone medical evaluation \\[25\\]. Therefore， many diagnoses of possible COVID-19-related VNs may have been missed and only disclosed in later assessments， as occurred in our first described case. In general， a decrease in the number of vertigo/dizziness outpatients during the pandemic outbreak has been observed， due to visit cancellations and government restrictive measures \\[26\\]. Therefore， to give support to patients in diagnosis and therapy，the role oftelemedicine was enhanced and a specific guideline of virtual management of vestibular disorders was recently published**\n\n【56】**\\[27\\]. Preliminary data have shown the role and utility， during the pandemic， of telemedicine in the management of dizziness patients\\[28\\]， but further studies are necessary to better define possibilities and limits of these methods.**\n\n【57】**Conclusion**\n\n【58】**According to the present review，only a few cases ofinstrumentally diagnosed COVID-19-related VN have been reported so far. Since hearing and balance disorders are rarely reported among patients with COVID-19， it would be appropriate to routinely test for SARS-CoV-2 infection patients with diagnosed VN. Moreover，prospective studies on a large series of COVID-19 patients should try to better define the epidemiology of cochlear-vestibular involvement and elucidate the SARS-CoV-2-related prognosis on peripheral and central audiovestibular functions. Among patients that can’t be easily visited due to quarantine regimen， a telemedicine evaluation could be helpful， as performed in accordance with standards of recent guidelines. In cases with cochlear-vestibular involvement， a long-term follow-up of more than 6 months should be preferred.**\n\n【59】**References**\n\n【60】**1\\.

A mass lesion which filled the right hemithorax almost completely was detected and there were multiple lymph nodes in the mediastinum in the tomography imaging. Trucut biopsy was performed and pathology report was compatible with CD20+， CD30+lymphoproliferative disease， Lymphomatoid Granulomatosis (LG). The patient was planned to be treated with CD20 and CD30targeting agents， rituximab， brentuximab vedotin， and the antineoplastic agent bendamustine. After 3 cures of treatment， almost complete regression was detected in the lung mass lesion and mediastinal lymph nodes.**\n\n【18】**Discussion： High-grade LG cases are considered to be aggressive high-grade lymphomas and require aggressive treatments. We wanted to present this case to emphasize the importance ofusing targeted agents in LG patients for whom treatment modalities are not clear.**\n\n【19】**Introduction**\n\n【20】**Lymphomatoid Granulomatosis (LG) is a rare lymphoproliferative disease associated with Epstein-Barr virus， characterized by multiple pulmonary nodular lesions with lymphocytic invasion of the vascular walls on biopsy \\[1，2\\]. The most common presenting symptoms are cough， fever， malaise， weight loss， neurological abnormalities， and shortness of breath \\[3\\]. Lesions in the lung are usually well circumscribed and consist of small lymphocytes， plasma cells， and a variable number of large atypical mononuclear cells. Most small lymphocytes are T cells， while large atypical cells are usually B cells \\[4\\]. B cells typically express CD20， but rarely CD30. They are negative for CD15\\[5\\]. Rarely， patients are asymptomatic and have histopathologically low-grade (grade 1 and 2) disease limited to the lungs. Sometimes spontaneous remission can occur in this patient group so these patients can be followed up with clinical and radiological evaluations. Active treatment is usually required if symptoms develop or if the disease progresses radiologically \\[6\\]. In general， the recommended treatment options for high-grade (grade 3) LG consist of the treatment modalities used for Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL)， but there is not much data on the effectiveness of these treatments. Other recommended treatments include multi-agent chemotherapy and targeted agents such as anti-CD20 and anti-CD30 monoclonal antibodies (rituximab，brentuximab vedotin) \\[7-9\\].**\n\n【21】**Case Presentation**\n\n【22】**A 71-year-old female patient presented with complaints of cough， shortness of breath， and weight loss. In the whole body tomography imaging， a mass lesion with central hypodense soft tissue density， which filled the right hemithorax almost completely， was detected and there were multiple lymph nodes in the mediastinum (Figure 1). Trucut biopsy of the right lung was performed on the patient； pathology report was reported as compatible with CD20+， CD30+ Lymphoproliferative disease， Lymphomatoid Granulomatosis. The patient was planned to be treated with CD20and CD30 targeting agents， rituximab and brentuximab vedotin， and the antineoplastic agent bendamustine. Rituximab 375 mg/m’1 day， brentuximab vedotin 1.8 mg/kg 1% day， bendamustine90 mg/m²1+2 Day； treatment was started every 28 days. After the first course of treatment， the**\n\n【23】**Figure 1， 2： Thorax tomography images of the patient.**\n\n【24】**patient’s clinical complaints regressed significantly. After 3 cures of treatment， the patient was evaluated by taking a tomography again. Almost complete regression was detected in the lung mass lesion and mediastinallymph nodes (Figure 2). After the patient's treatment was completed for 6 cycles， it was planned to discontinue bendamustine and continue with rituximab and brentuximab vedotin targeting agents.**\n\n【25】**Discussion**\n\n【26】**LG was first described in 1972 by Liebow et al. \\[10\\]. It is a very rare type of extranodal lymphoma and it exhibits a very characteristic angiodestructive behavior. High-grade cases are considered to be aggressive high-grade lymphomas and patients require prompt and intensive treatment with immunochemotherapy agents including rituximab \\[11\\]. In our case， besides CD 20 positivity， CD 30 was also detected. Thereupon， we added brentuximab vedotin treatment**\n\n【27】**together with rituximab to our patient who had a mass lesion covering the rightlung.

However， TMP/SMZ has been reported to cause hemolysis when administered to patients with deficiency. PJP might be fatal without receiving treatment.

As per guideline， Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMZ) is the recommended regimen for managing Pneumocystis Jirovecii Pneumonia (PJP)\\[1\\]. However，TMP/SMZ is associated with the serious side effect of drug induced hemolytic anemia associated with Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. Although substitute regiment does exist， the success rate of using those alternative regimens is below 80% except for the combination use of TMP and dapsone， which is also a medication contraindicated in patients with G6PD deficiency. Jennifer et al. \\[2\\] therefore suggested avoiding using TMP/SMZ in patient with the deficiency of G6PD. On the other hand， a literature reviews done by Youngster et al. \\[3\\] Suggested that TMP/SMZ is probably safe when given in usual therapeutic dose. Together with the inconclusive recommendations， there was also no real-world experience on the use of TMP/SMZ in G6PD deficiency patients in Taiwan. In this article， we reported a G6PD deficient patient whom recovered from PJP by administration of TMP/SMZ.**\n\n【23】**Case Presentation**\n\n【24】**A 31-year-old Han Taiwanese man with a history of G6PD deficiency was admitted due to fever， cough， fatigue， muscle soreness and occasional dyspnoea for 20 days. After admission， Chest X-Ray (CXR) revealed bilateral infiltration. The White Blood Cell (WBC) count was 5200 cells/mL， N-Seg 72.3%， lymph 19.2%， Hemoglobin (Hb) 13.2 g/dL， platelet 231，000/mL， Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) 16 mg/dL， Creatinine (Cr) 0.8 mg/dL， Sodium (Na) 136 mmol/L， Potassium (K)3.6 mmol/L， Aspartate Transaminase (AST) 30 U/L， Alanine Amino Transferase (ALT) 21 U/L**\n\n【25】**and total bilirubin 0.7 mg/dL. Blood and sputum acid fast satin， TB culture， pneumococcal and legionella urinary antigen test， Mycoplasma IgM， Chlamydophila IgM， Toxoplasma IgG all showed negative. High-Resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT) was arranged and showed diffuse Ground-Glass Opacities (GGO) and thickening of interlobular septum. PJP was then considered. HIV EIA and HIV western blot both showed positive result. CD4 counts were 50 cells/mm’. HIV RNA (Ribonucleic Acid) load was 45588copies/ml. Oxygen supplement was delivered and TMP/SMZ 240mg/1200 mg intravenously was given every eight hours. At Day-13 of TMP/SMZ treatment， a review of medication was preformed and the issue of G6PD deficiency history was raised. The blood test was done immediately and Hb was 11.6 g/dL， total bilirubin was 0.7 mg/dL， direct bilirubin was 0.3 mg/dL. With no obvious sign and symptoms as well as episode of acute hemolytic， the TMP/ SMZ treatment was continued. At Day-16， under stable condition， the patient was discharged with oral TMP/SMZ240 mg/1200 mg three times a day for five more days and an Out-Patient Department (OPD) appointment was arranged. After 21 days ofPJP treatment completed， aprophylaxis dose of TMP/ SMZ 160 mg/800 mg once daily was given until CD4reach 200 cells/mm. The G6PD enzyme activities were measured by quantitative fluorescence assay and showed a level of 0.6 U/g Hb(reference range： 6.4 U/g Hb to 12.9 U/g Hb) which was classified as severe enzyme activity deficiency by the definition defined by World Health Organization (WHO) \\[4\\].**\n\n【26】**Discussion**\n\n【27】**G6PD deficiency is the most commonly inherited Red Blood Cell (RBC) enzymatic defect， affecting around 400 million people worldwide \\[5\\]. About 7.5% of the world population carries one or two genes for G6PD deficiency. It is an X-linked genetic disorder with 187 known allelic mutations \\[6\\]. In Taiwan， G6PD deficiency prevalence between male and female were approximately 2.81% and0.7% respectively7\\].**\n\n【28】**TMP/SMZ is used in a variety of infectious diseases and is the recommended treatment option in current practice for managing PJP \\[8\\]； however， it is associated with hemolysis when administered to G6PD deficient patients. Chisholm-Burns et al. \\[9\\] demonstrated a case with of African ethnicity with G6PD deficiency that experienced hemolysis after administration of double strength of TMP/SMZ orally for eight days. Reinke et al. \\[10\\] also reported a black woman with HIV infection who received only one dose of TMP/SMZ intravenously for managing PJP which then resulted in acute hemolysis. On the contrary literature had reported challenging G6PD subjects with genetic variant alleles. A commonly observed in the African population， with TMP/SMZ at the dose of 320/1600mg every 12 h. The level ofhemoglobin did not decrease significantly nor did any hemolysis occur throughout the trial \\[11\\]. The possible explanation was that the regeneration rate of hemoglobin was faster than destruction of hemoglobin in G6PD A-variant population. However， the severity of hemolytic anemia varies among individuals with G6PD deficiency. Specific G6PD alleles are associated with G6PD variants with different enzyme activity and， therefore， result in different levels of disease severity \\[12\\]. In Southeast Asia， the most common variant alleles appear to be G6PD Kaiping and Canton， which are different from the western or African ethnicity \\[13\\]. To date， there is still insufficient evidence for the population in Taiwan to suggest a robust relationship between our G6PD variant alleles and the degree of disease severity with regards to the safety in the use of TMP/SMZ in G6PD deficiency \\[14\\].**\n\n【29】**Conclusion**\n\n【30】**The experience and evidence regarding safety in the use of TMP/SMZ in G6PD deficient HIV infected patients is not vet clear. Herein， we documented a case of a G6PD deficient HIV infected man successfully treated the PJP with high dose of TMP/SMZ without any signs and symptoms of hemolysis.**\n\n【31】**Acknowledgment**\n\n【32】**I would like to express my gratitude to Yeo Han Ting Jillian， who gave me writing and editing assistance.

It is characterized by a highly aggressive clinical course with a median survival of 15 months. PCGDTCL involves the subcutaneous fat and can often mimic both clinically and histologically other more indolent conditions such as Cytophagic Histiocytic Phagocytosis (CHP) and Subcutaneous Panniculitic T-Cell Lymphomas (SPTCL). In addition， diagnosis of PCGDTCL can be challenging due to aberrant expression of surface markers in the neoplastic cells and varied histologic presentation and multiple biopsies are required to make a correct diagnosis. This is a case report that the initial histopathologic findings were most consistent with CHP but with a very aggressive and uncommon clinical course and with extreme subcutaneous ulcerations.**\n\n【20】**Introduction**\n\n【21】**Cytophagic Histiocytic Panniculitis (CHP) lesions show histiocytic infiltration of adipose tissue with hemophagocytosis and lymphocytic invasion \\[1，2\\]. The clinical course of CHP may be indolent with intermittent exacerbations or rapidly fatal heralded by fevers， hepatosplenomegaly， pancytopenia， coagulopathy， and transaminitis \\[2，3\\]. Non-fatal， indolent CHP is responsive to immunosuppressive therapy whereas fatal CHP often requires cytotoxic therapy \\[2，3\\]. The presentation of fatal CHP is similar to Subcutaneous Panniculitis-like T-Cell Lymphoma (SPTL) with differentiation made by the presence of malignant lymphocytes on histologic review of lesions \\[2\\]. However， initial biopsies of SPTL are often consistent with CHP suggesting that CHP represents an indolent lymphoid malignancy \\[3，4\\]. The following case illustrates an extreme clinical presentation of SPTL initially diagnosed as CHP.**\n\n【22】**Case Presentation**\n\n【23】**A 63-year-old Caucasian female presented with a month history of daily fevers up to 39.4C， night sweats， increasing fatigue， bilateral lower extremity edema and multiple erythematous lesions on her extremities and back. The patient reported she had similar symptoms of a milder nature one year prior， that had resolved spontaneously after six weeks without a diagnosis. At the time of presentation， the patient was a febrile and vitally stable. Multiple erythematous， patchy lesions with associated deep ulceration， necrosis， and subcutaneous nodular lesions were noted on the bilateral upper and lower extremities， left breast， and back (Figure 1-5). Cardiovascular， respiratory， and abdominal examinations were normal and without hepatosplenomegaly. Her course progressed rapidly over the next several months with aggressive， deep ulcerative lesions throughout her extremities， breast， and abdomen with ongoing intermittent fevers and progressive fatigue.**\n\n【24】**Initial blood work reported normal hemoglobin of 11.6 with giemsa smear showing microcytic hypochromic red blood cells and normal white blood cell and differential and platelet count. Iron studies were indicative of anemia of inflammation (Ferritin 1，188； Iron 44； TIBC 298 and Iron Saturation 15%). Markers of inflammation were elevated including CRP 7.9 and ESR 55. The patient had a mild transaminitis (AST 106， ALT 77) that spontaneously normalized on repeat laboratory work up.**\n\n【25】**Figure 1： Ulcerative Panniculitis， left distal， medial leg. Figure 4： Left Leg.**\n\n【26】**Figure 2： Left Breast.**\n\n【27】**Figure 5： Left Leg.**\n\n【28】**Figure 3： Left medial foot.**\n\n【29】**Figure 6： Healed Ulcerative panniculitic following chemotherapy.**\n\n【30】**Skin punch biopsy oflesions on upper and lower extremities were obtained from outside facility. Outside pathology of all three biopsies were read as squamous cell carcinoma with a co-existent lobular panniculitis. Second review of the original pathology was read as ulcer and atypical squamous proliferation with lobular panniculitis and interface dermatitis. Repeat biopsies were completed due to high suspicion of possible SPTL， but the pathology confirmed a lobular panniculitis composed predominantly of epithelioid histiocytes with phagocytosis of red blood cells. There were also small lymphocytes and karvorrhectic cells. Normal CD4：CD8 ratio with histiocyvtic predominance did not support a typical lymphoma diagnosis. Overall， these findings were reported suspicious for Cytophagic Histiocytic Panniculitis (CHP). No malignant or infectious processes were appreciated on complete pathologic stains.**\n\n【31】**cardiolipin antibody， C-ANCA， P-ANCA， smooth muscle antibody， alpha-1-antitrypsin enzyme， angiotensin converting enzyme， and interleukin-2 receptor. However， mitochondrial antibodies were elevated at 1.31 with normal index value <0.91 and lipase was only mildly increased at 196. D-dimer was elevated at 1，214 ng/mL and fibrinogen was 556 ng/dL. Infectious disease and rheumatologic consults were obtained， both felt that an infectious or rheumatologic underlying process were unlikely.**\n\n【32】**Work-up for an underlying neoplastic process was performed. Computed Tomography (CT) of the chest， abdomen， and pelvis with contrast was obtained which noted mildly enlarged lymph nodes throughout the abdomen， pelvis， lower neck， mediastinum， and left axilla. Fat stranding of the subcutaneous soft tissues of the abdomen and pelvis and left breast were also reported. Mammography was reported as negative for malignancy.**\n\n【33】**Work-up for underlying causes ofCHP was performed. Infectious etiologies including HIV， EBV， CMV， Hepatitis B， Hepatitis C， Syphilis， andTuberculosis were excluded. Autoimmune and Vasculitis work-up was negative including Anti-Nuclear Antibodies(ANA)， SS-A/Ro and SS-B/La antibodies， Beta-2-Glycoprotein，**\n\n【34】**While evaluating for underlying etiologies，the patient was actively being treated for aggressive CHP as she continued to have progressive**\n\n【35】**deep cutaneous ulceration/panniculitis and systemic symptoms. She was started on prednisone 40 mg per day and hydroxychloroquine200 mg twice daily for treatment of CHP. While this treatment course initially achieved mild improvement of skin lesions and edema， the patient developed progression of symptoms with visual disturbance， ptosis， and left eye discomfort. CT scan of the orbits showed an enlarged heterogeneous lacrimal gland without bony erosion or fat stranding. The patient was changed to prednisone 60 mg per day with cyclosporine 500 mg per day. The patient experienced disease progression on this regimen， and then she was initiated on Anakinra100 mg subcutaneously daily.**\n\n【36】**Due to a worsening disease course despite immune suppression and concern that CHP may be masking and underlying SPTL， repeat multiple skin biopsies were obtained. The previous biopsies did not show abnormal T cells and PCR studies for TCR gene rearrangement were inconclusive. A final set of skin biopsies were then obtained. Pathology confirmed lymphocytes positive for CD3， TCR delta， CD56， and TIA positive， CD4， and CD8 negative. PCR identified a clonal TCR gamma gene rearrangement. These findings were consistent with Subcutaneous Panniculitis T-Cell Lymphoma(SPTL) gamma/delta type (Primary Cutaneous Gamma/Delta T-Cell Lymphoma (PCGDTCL)) presenting as cytophagic histiocytic panniculitis. Anakinra was discontinued and patient was referred to bone marrow transplant for further management. She received six cycles of EPOCH regimen with excellent response and healing of the large， deep cutaneous ulcers (Figure 6and 7). She is currently receiving Pentostatin and being prepared for allogenic stem cell transplantation.**\n\n【37】**Discussion**\n\n【38】**Cytophagic Histiocytic Panniculitis (CHP) presents as ulcerating nodules or plaques based in the subcutaneous fat without antecedent infection \\[1，2\\]. CHP is defined histologically by infiltration of subcutaneous adipose tissue by benign appearing cytophagic macrophages and T-cell lymphocytes \\[1-3\\]. The course of CHP may be indolent or aggressive with a fatal hemophagocytic disorder \\[3，5\\]. As in this case， an initial benign course can progress to a fatal hemophagocytosis \\[2，3\\]. This progression is often heralded by systemic findings including recurrent pyrexia， pancytopenia， consumptive coagulopathy and hemodynamic instability \\[2，3，5\\]. This patient did not have any cytopenias， liver or spleen abnormalities or a consumptive coagulopathy. Her clinical course was unusual in that she had a mild form of the disease one year prior that became latent.**\n\n【39】**Then， she developed progression of symptoms starting with cycling of fevers， fatigue， and multiple， large deep subcutaneous ulcers are not commonly seen to this extent in panniculitis. In addition， she developed orbital involvement that is also a rare finding in primary cutaneous gamma/delta T-cell lymphoma.**\n\n【40】**The systemic symptoms of aggressive CHP are also noted in SPTL\\[2\\]. Differentiation of CHP and SPTL is classically based on histologic findings， with SPTL displaying neoplastic T cell infiltrate into subcutaneous tissue involving fat septate and lobules \\[2，6\\]. However， a dominant benign inflammatory cell population accompanies neoplastic lymphocytes in SPTL， potentially obscuring them \\[5\\]. Furthermore， as documented in this case， initial biopsies of SPTL may be more consistent with CHP\\[3，6\\]. Thus， an indolent course of CHP with histology interpreted as benign cannot be assumed non-fatal， as neoplastic transformation or a missed diagnosis may occur \\[3\\].In addition， the heterogeneity of the lymphoma can make this diagnosis more difficult to confirm.**\n\n【41】**T-cell gene rearrangements have been examined in an attempt to definitely differentiate CHP from SPTL. Though T-cell monoclonal rearrangements are more frequently associated with SPTL， they have also been noted in CHP \\[7\\]. Furthermore， T-cell clonality is sometimes observed in benign conditions， and therefore is a poor diagnostic marker \\[3\\]. EBV positivity has also been studied with latent infection noted in both CHP and SPTL \\[8\\].**\n\n【42】**Given the similarity of clinical presentation， the lack of definitive molecular tests， and the transition of presentation， CHP and SPTL may be better characterized as a clinical spectrum rather than separate entities. This case provides excellent illustration of such disease progression and heterogeneity in the pathologic specimens. Maintaining a high suspicion of the development or an underlying cutaneous lymphoma is warranted in these rare cases. In addition， this case provides a reminder that patients with initial diagnoses of indolent CHP should be carefully monitored for neoplastic disease. Patients with aggressive CHP or SPTL would benefit from early aggressive therapy to prevent a fatal course.**\n\n【43】**References**\n\n【44】**1\\. Winkelman RK， Bowie EJ.

Along with Echocardiographic investigation， the role of CT scan in localization of vegetation is highly appreciable. With the advancement in the CT-technology was recently Photon Counting CT system (PCCT) introduced. It is a form of X-ray Computed Tomography (CT) in which X-rays are detected using a Photon-Counting Detector (PCD). These photon-counting detectors have the potential to overcome the limitations of current CT detectors， by providing CT data at very high spatial resolution， less noise， improved contrast-to-noise ratio， low radiation dose and with intrinsic spectral information. They are much more dose efficient than other detectors， have smaller pixels， which can significantly increase the spatial resolution. Here， we can expect qualitative images that visualize very fine tissue structures with low radiation and less use of contrast agent. Photon-counting CT offers several significant advantages over other existing CT imaging techniques， which opens potential to scan cardiovascular patients， overcoming compromises in lung and bone imaging and imaging of other organs and systems \\[1，2\\]**\n\n【16】**_Asif MY， Dillinger D， Waldeck S，_ _Zielezinski T， Feyrer R.

Six months later， the patient was admitted again in the same hospital with progressive dyspnea(NYHA III)， general weakness and weight loss. The laboratory report presented with leukocytosis， thrombocytopenia， CRP elevation， raised transaminase and creatinine levels. The blood cultures were negative. The Transthoracic and Transesophageal Echocardiography (TTE， TEE) showed a high-grade tricuspid valve regurgitation and a 3.2 cm x 2 cm long vegetation on the RV lead. In**\n\n【23】**Figure 1： Shows vegetation visualization (star) in transesophageal echocardiography.**\n\n【24】**Figure 2： Shows the vegetation with a close contact to the tricuspid valve(arrow).**\n\n【25】**history as well as in physical investigation there were no infective foci found.**\n\n【26】**For further assessment and therapy， the patient was referred to our hospital. Here we repeated transesophageal echocardiography， which showed similar findings， a vegetation on theRVleadandahigh-grade tricuspid valve regurgitation. For further evaluation we decided to perform a CT-scan. A full cardiac cycle CT-scan with a photon counting CT scanner (NAEOTOM Alpha， Siemens Healthineers， Forchheim， Germany) was performed， which showed vegetation on the RV-lead and multiple minor vegetations on the anterior leaflet of tricuspid valve. So， we decided for sternotomy， surgical intervention on tricuspid valve and open CRT-ICD explanation. The vegetations were removed， the anterior leaflet of tricuspid valve was partly resected and reconstructed using modified De Vega technique. The**\n\n【27】**Patient recovered fast and had a very uneventful stay in our hospital(Figures 1-3).**\n\n【28】**Discussion**\n\n【29】**In routine practice， the echocardiographic investigations are gold standards for the diagnosis of endocarditis. Its accuracy depends on factors like size and localization of vegetations， calcifications， concomitant valvular defects and the experienceofechocardiographer\\[3\\].**\n\n【30】**The photon counting CT have certain advantages over other preexisting CT-scan techniques. The metal artifacts， beam hardening artifacts and noise streaks are better mitigated. High contrast and high-resolution structures are also better visualized \\[2\\]. The photon counting CT scan reduces radiation exposure， reconstructs images at a higher resolution， corrects beam hardening artifacts， optimizes the use of contrast agents and creates opportunities for quantitative imaging relative to other CT technology \\[4\\]. A full cardiac cycle CT investigation enables the assessment of morphological and functional structures of heart and can also be used to analyze in depth the ventricular function \\[5\\].**\n\n【31】**In our case， the vegetations on the tricuspid valve were in echocardiography not clearly visible， so we decided to perform CT-scan. A full cardiac cycle CT investigation with a photon counting CT scanner was done to explore the vegetations on tricuspid valve. The result was very convincing and helpful in making the decision for major surgical intervention.**\n\n【32】**There are also otherTaa.lternative methods，Ssuch as18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission1Tomography with Computed Tomography-based attenuation Tomography correction(18F-FDG PET/CT)， which has been increasingly used in the diagnosis of infective endocarditis. Its accuracy and sensitivity are reported to be better than echocardiographic investigations \\[6\\].**\n\n【33】**Conclusion**\n\n【34】**Despite all echocardiography remains first choice and a great diagnostic tool in evaluation of infective valvular disease， but CT scan performed especially on photon counting CT scanner can play an additional important role in representation of cardiac structures as a whole. It should be considered as standard in some selective cases of infective endocarditis， where echocardiography cannot provide sufficient information.**\n\n【35】**References**\n\n【36】1\\.

Her past medical history included heart transplant8 years ago for cardiomyopathy， hypertension and a recent open umbilical hernia repair with mesh. Her medications included oral immunosuppressive medications (tacrolimus and mycophenalate) and anti-hypertensive's (amlodipone). She was not known to have any allergies.**\n\n【10】**Routine observations on admission were normal. Abdominal examination demonstrated a non-distended abdomen with localized guarding and rebound tenderness in the right iliac fossa.**\n\n【11】**ECG was in sinus rhythm with heartbeat of 96 Beats per Minute (BPM). A recent echocardiogram demonstrated normal ventricular and valvular function. Routine biochemistry was largely unremarkable with a mildly raised CRP at 38 but normal white cell count and no evidence of neutrophilia. Computerized tomography showed uncomplicated acute appendicitis and a post-operative seroma around her previous open umbilical hernia repair site.**\n\n【12】**Broad spectrum intravenous antimicrobial treatment was commenced prior to surgery and the case was discussed with the patient's transplant team. It was advised that immunosuppressant agents be continued as per her usual dose. Additional treatment with steroids or anti-fungals was not recommended.**\n\n【13】**An open appendicectomy was performed. The appendix was divided and delivered through a Lanz incision using an Alexi's wound protector. The patient remained hemodynamically stable throughout the procedure with systolic BP ranging from 98 mmHg to 118 mmHg. She was admitted to a general surgical ward post-operatively where she made an unremarkable recovery and was discharged three days later. The patient returned 2 weeks post-operatively for a planned wound review and was noted to have a clean well-healing scar. No major complications were recorded within the 30-day post-operative period and histological examination of the specimen confirmed acute appendicitis.**\n\n【14】**Discussion**\n\n【15】A clear understandingand appreciation ofthe altered physiology in particular cardiac physiology in transplant patients is vital. This knowledge is crucial to the general surgeon and will help guide with decisions such as the best approach to intra-abdominal surgery. In addition it is important to recognize that transplant patients are often on of a cocktail of immunosuppressive medications and the impact this may have on post-operative complications， in particular surgical site infections. Effective management of such a patient is best approached with the aid of a multidisciplinary team.\n\n【16】**Altered cardiac physiology in transplant patients and the impact on intra-abdominal surgery**\n\n【17】**The transplanted heart lacks both sympathetic as well as parasympathetic innervation. The loss of vagal tone results in a higher resting heart rate； between 90-110 Beats per Minute (BPM) \\[1\\]. Another key change in physiology is that the transplanted heart depends entirely on venous return. It is said to be pre-load dependant'\\[2\\]. In normal cardiac physiology，hypovolaemia results in an increase in cardiac output by increasing heart rate and increasing contractility. This is achieved by the stimulation of neurohormonal pathways as well as the activation of Frank-Starling mechanism\\[3\\].**\n\n【18】**A transplanted heart cannot respond to sympathetic and parasympathetic stimuli， and is therefore dependant entirely on venous return \\[1，2\\]. This is an important consideration in intra-abdominal surgery， as many gold standard approaches are laparoscopic \\[4\\]. Laparoscopic surgery**\n\n【19】**involves establishing pneumoperitoneum. The increase in intra-abdominal pressures during surgery may decrease venous return and this in turn may reduce heart rate. Unfortunately a denervated heart will be unable to compensate by utilizing neurohormonal pathways due to the reasons discussed above \\[1，2\\]. In the case reported here， this altered cardiac physiology was the primary reason an open approach was adopted. Whilst laparoscopic appendicectomy， is now the gold standard approach， in this case an open approach was in the patient's best interest.**\n\n【20】**Immunosuppression： surgical considerations**\n\n【21】**To reduce the risk of rejection， transplanted patients are on a combination of immunosuppressant medications. The commonest combination is tacrolimus and mycophenalate with or without prednisolone \\[2\\]. Whilst an important， anti-rejection strategy， one of the key considerations post-operatively is the increased risk of infections. In particular the increased risk of surgical site infections\\[5\\]. In our case this was an important consideration for several reasons. Firstly not only was our patient immunosuppressed， an additional factor to consider was the surgical approach. An open approach is associated with increased risk of surgical site infections\\[6\\]. To reduce this risk， intra-operatively an Alexi's wound retractor was used. This offered protection to the wound edge during the operation， in particular during dissection of the acutely inflamed appendix. An additional advantage of using an Alexi’s wound retractor was to confer better visibility intra-operatively facilitating the identification of the appendix prior to dissection.**\n\n【22】**Effective multidisciplinary approach**\n\n【23】**In order to effectively manage transplant patients it is important to involve a number of teams.**\n\n【24】**Pre-operatively， as per Enhanced Recovery after Surgery (ERAS)\\[7\\] protocol， the patient was counseled. Information regarding the approach was discussed with the patient and consent was obtained for an open appendicectomy， due to reasons discussed above. Additionally， advice was sought from the patient’s transplant team. In particular， guidance was sought over the need to continue immunosuppression pre and post operatively. Furthermore a clear direction was sought for the need to start steroid and initiate anti-fungal therapy. The need for anti-microbials was also discussed with the microbiologists.**\n\n【25】**Pre-operatively， the case was discussed with cardiologist and cardiac physiologists to ensure that the transplanted heart was optimized prior to general anesthesia. All essential imaging and**\n\n【26】**cardiac physiology tests (echocardiogram， ECG) were conducted to the highest standard. Anesthetic opinion was sought both pre-operatively and intra-operatively， paying particular regard to goal directed fluid management and effective use of pain management. In accordance with ERAS intra-operative protocols， the incision was deliberately made as small as possible and care was taken to ensure strict aseptic control was maintained throughout. Despite a small incision， surgical visibility was adequate due to the use of the Alexis wound retractor.**\n\n【27】**Post-operatively，thepatient Was discussed with the physiotherapists and early mobilization was encouraged with good oral pain control. Once again in keeping with the ERAS protocols， the patient was encouraged to start oral intake early and effective pain management was prescribed.**\n\n【28】**Effective management of such patients is dependent on input from a number of specialties. Strict adherence to the ERAS protocols pre， peri and post-operatively ensures that patients are offered the best possible care allowing them to return to their normal activities of daily life sooner and decreasing post-operative complications.**\n\n【29】**References**\n\n【30】1\\.

A case series of clinical suspect of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the central nervous system (n=8) were analyzed. Cerebral Spinal Fluid (CSF) and nasopharyngeal swab were analyzed by RT-PCR. Our results showed SARS-CoV-2 in five CSF samples and three patients testing positive for COVID-19 also on nasopharyngeal swab. The patients showed different clinical manifestations， including <95% saturation， fever， cough， dyspnea and abdominal pain. The findings of this study alert to the existence of nonspecific symptoms associated with central nervous system infection caused by SARS-CoV-2.**\n\n【12】**Keywords： SARS-CoV-2；COVID-19； Cerebrospinal fluid； RT-PCR**\n\n【13】**Short Com munication**\n\n【14】**In December 2019， cases of severe acute respiratorysyndrome emerged and were after associated with SARS-CoV-2. Since then， reports have described neurological manifestations in addition to the typical clinical symptoms of COVID-19. This virus can spread from the respiratory system to the central nervous system， using transneuronal and hematogenous mechanisms. Although not all COVID-19 patient test positive for the virus in the cerebrospinal fluid exam， the appearance of neurological symptoms associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection reveals the importance of understanding the neurologic manifestations and capacity for neural invasion associated with the pathogen. These aspects are relevant for correct diagnosis and treatment and for the potential development of vaccines \\[1\\].**\n\n【15】**Hospitalized patients with COVID-19， especialy those with severe disease， can display neurological disorders as shown by Mao et al. \\[2\\]， such as acute cerebrovascular disease in up to5.7%， impaired consciousness in 14.8%， and skeletal muscle injury in 19.3% of cases. Nonetheless， COVID-19 seems to be associated with a wide spectrum of neurological manifestations including meningoencephalitis \\[3-5\\]， encephalomyelitis \\[6\\]， Guillain-Barre Syndrome \\[7\\]， and perfusion abnormalities in brain magnetic resonance imaging \\[4\\]. This study highlights the evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection with a focus on neurological involvement and laboratorial diagnosis， based in a case series.**\n\n【16】**We describe cases of clinical suspect of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the central nervous system. The patients (n=8) were admitted in a Brazilian public hospital. Cerebral Spinal Fluid (CSF) and nasopharyngeal swab were obtained for laboratorial tests. The samples were analyzed by RT-PCR using technical protocol based on the Center of Disease Control.**\n\n【17】**Ours results showed SARS-CoV-2 in five CSF samples. Of the total， 3 patients also presented positive test for COVID-19 in nasopharyngeal swab. The patients showed different patterns of clinical manifestations， including <95% saturation， fever， cough， dyspnea and abdominal pain(Table 1).**\n\n【18】**Laboratorial analysis of 3 CSF samples by RT-PCR did not demonstrate the presence of the virus. Of the 8 patients evaluated， 6 were newborns， 3 of them were children of mothers with COVID-19during the pregnancy (Table 1).**\n\n【19】**This study describes cases of COVID-19 with clinical presentation and positive RT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 in CSF. To our knowledge， this presentation of COVID-19 is little reported so far and is important to consider as an atypical manifestation of the viral infection. Our findings reinforce data obtained by Huang et al. (2020)\\[8\\] that RT-PCR of SARS-CoV-2 in CSF can be**\n\n【20】**_cited._**\n\n【21】**Footnote： Blank columns means no symptoms or negative lab test； Black columns means presence of symptoms or positive laboratory test； ITU： Intensive Treatment Unit CSF： Cerebral spinal fluid.**\n\n【22】**considered as a detection modality for cases of COVID-19 affecting the central nervous system.**\n\n【23】**We demonstrate that patients with COVID-19 displaying distinct neurological disorders have extremely low levels of SARS-CoV-2in CSF， according high CT (cycle threshold) value of the samples， indicating that viral clearance precede the neurological involvement. It is important to emphasize that the RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2detection in CSFhas not been validated yet. Besides that， undetectable results in some CSF samples of patients could be false negative. This finding points to the need for the development of more sensitive molecular tests and the investigation of other neurotropic pathogens to exclude neuroinfection.**\n\n【24】**Considering the sole report of a severe case ofmeningoencephalitis with detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA in CSF \\[5\\]， likely presenting a low viral load since just one of two RT-qPCR assays turned positive at a cycle CT of 37， we can assume that whether SARS-CoV-2 is detectable in CSF， it may depend on disease severity， the time of sample collection or the sensitivity of the molecular test used. On the other hand， herpes simplex viruses 1 and 2， varicella zoster virus， and enterovirus are responsible for the greatest number of CNS infection in immunocompetent hosts \\[9\\]. Therefore， CSF investigation of COVID-19 patients presenting with GBS or CNS manifestations to exclude concurrent neuroinfection with other neurotropic viruses should be encouraged \\[4，8\\]**\n\n【25】**It was not possible to perform the next generation sequencing in the positive samples， to determine the genetic variant responsible for the infection， because this methodology requires a high viral load，**\n\n【26】**consequently， a low Ct value. Based on the SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance network in Brazil， during the period in which the present studysampleswere collected，the variantofconcernthatpredominated was Gamma (P.1)， with an occurrence of 85% in the month of March2021， 93.8% in April and 95.5% in May. It may be reasonable to infer that the variant responsible for the CNS manifestations was Gamma by the circulation scenario at the time \\[10\\].**\n\n【27】**Few cases of encephalitis/meningitis with positive RT-PCR assays of the CSF have been described \\[1-81. This can be attributed to several reasons： The RT-PCR assay of CSF may yield negative results when performed early； the method has limited sensitivity associated with false negative tests in CSF；and low viral load in the CSF \\[1\\].**\n\n【28】**Cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection with invasion of the nervous system are being described with the emergence of the new pandemic due to the infectious disease COVID-19. Patients with COVID-19maypresent initially neurologicaallSsymptomIsSor experience neurological complications during hospitalization. The diagnosis of neuro-COVID-19 can be challenging. Since SARS-CoV-2 has neuroinvasive and neurotropic properties， early recognition can help initiate treatment and isolation early， to prevent clinical worsening and spread of the virus and the underreporting of neurological cases associated with COVID-19 \\[1\\].**\n\n【29】**Recent observations suggested possible neurological complications of COVID-19， including the first report of suspected viral encephalitis. We report a case of a 29-year-old male with on nasopharyngeal testing- confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection with severe respiratory symptoms， followed by clinical and radiological**\n\n【30】**signs ofencephalitis. Magnetic resonance imaging ofthe brain showed an asymmetric FLAIR-hyperintensity of the left medial temporal cortex associated with mild gyral expansion. Lumbar puncture was normal and PCR for SARS-CoV-2 on CSF were negative. Clinicians treating SARS-CoV-2 infected patients should be aware of possible neurological complications， like encephalitis. The diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 encephalitis is difficult as the laboratory analysis of the CSF may not be altered \\[9，11\\]**\n\n【31】**Clinicians treating SARS-CoV-2 infected patients should be aware of possible neurological complications. In case of suspected meningoencephalitis， additional exams should be performed such as brain MRI scan， long-term EEG monitoring， and lumbar puncture. However， the absence of a typical CSF profile of viral meningitis/encephalitis as well as the negative PCR for SARS-CoV-2 in CSF， makes diagnosing encephalitis linked to SARS-CoV-2 less obvious9，12.**\n\n【32】**One ofthe studylimitations was the lack of follow-up of diagnosed patients. This follow-up was not possible because the diagnosis was performed as a service to the municipal health authorities，therefore， there were no personnel and financial resources available for this purpose.**\n\n【33】**Conclusion**\n\n【34】**The findings of this study alert to the existence of nonspecific symptoms associated with central nervous system infection caused by SARS-CoV-2. This raises the need for laboratory examination to detect this virus in CSF samples and subsequent early and assertive treatment. Further studies are important to elucidate mechanisms of pathogenesis， protocols of clinical management， and laboratory practices of SARS-CoV-2 neurological manifestations.**\n\n【35】**Contributors**\n\n【36】**A.B.

Gall bladder shows areas of necrosis.**\n\n【34】**of suicides world over， owing to the fear of infection， isolation， unemployment， financial crisis， stress， and mass panic \\[2\\]. One such incident is the case of a young female who presented with a large amount of ingestion of a caustic substance at her residence. Hemodynamic stabilization and securing the airway are crucial in the initial hours of corrosive injury to prevent early deaths. Early endoscopic assessment and liberal use of CT scans in cases of discordant findings on endoscopy will help in detecting the extent of the injury and plan further management accordingly. In cases of extensive caustic injuries， large duodenal perforations， traumatic injuries to the pancreas and duodenum， it is imperative to perform a pancreaticoduodenectomy although carries a high rate of morbidity (80%) and mortality (40%) \\[3\\]. The rate of complications is also high owing to hemodynamic instability， extensive injuries，and unanticipated difficulties at the time of surgery. All injured organs should be identified and resected during the first operation \\[4\\]. The reoperation rate in these patients is high one reason being delayed extension of caustic necrosis to other intra abdominal organs \\[5\\]， which could have led to the dislodgement of feeding jejunostomy in this case. The other reasons for reoperations are intra abdominal collections due to anastomotic leaks， pancreatic and biliary fistulas， erosion of other intra abdominal organs， and hemorrhage. Although pancreaticojejunostomy has a high risk ofleakage in the setting of the soft texture of pancreas， small duct size， and the complication rate following pancreaticojejunostomy at the time of primary surgery is lower than with closure of pancreatic duct remnant， although both carry similar morbidity and mortality rates \\[5\\]. Although mortality rates are high， surgery may be the only choice for these patients.**\n\n【35】**References**\n\n【36】1\\. Zargar SA，Kochhar R，Mehta S， Mehta SK.

The N-BEATS deep learning method has been applied to a dataset from an example of EHG by considering their first six principal components. Thus， it can be seen that the preview of EHG， and the early prediction of labor from the N-BEATS method， depends on the data size and recordings duration.**\n\n【15】**Keywords： Principal component； Uterine contraction； Machine learning； Prediction**\n\n【16】**Introduction**\n\n【17】**Maternal and child health is and remains a public health issue. But the approaches vary between low and high income countries. What is common to both is the problem of preterm births (gestation week less than 37 weeks and more than 26 weeks)， which still remains a huge public health issue. In addition to this， for low-income countries carrying a pregnancy to term (gestation week over 37weeks) is still a public health issue； whereas this is no longer the case in high-income countries. This is due to the lack of sufficient and quality health structures， adequate technical facilities and available qualified human resources. The problem is even more acute in rural and peri-urban areas. In this context， in order to solve the problem of premature births， high-income countries have initiated research that has led to the recognition of the Electrohysterogram as an effective technique for monitoring pregnancies in pregnant women. Several methods have been developed around it and several parameters have been discovered for its characterization in order to diagnose preterm birth earlier. In the literature， thirty of these parameters have been found to be the most widely used.**\n\n【18】**In order to address the various deficits mentioned above for low-income countries， we are interested in the prediction of labor in pregnant women with full-term pregnancies. It is in this context that we have sought to better understand the techniques of external recording of EHG and especially electrodes positioning on the pregnant woman's abdomen \\[1\\]. In the same vein， we wanted to be able to distinguish between physiological contractions related to pregnancy and those leading to labor； the methods for doing so were identified in the literature \\[2\\]. As a logical extension of this， in this work we are interested in predicting labor by forecasting the behavior of the EHG signal using a deep learning method. We will start with the principal component analysis， which will allow us to make an objective choice of the main components to be considered in the dataset to be provided to the learning algorithm. In the following sections of this paper we will describe the different methods used， the results obtained after their application，the discussion of these results and the conclusion.**\n\n【19】**Method**\n\n【20】**Used data**\n\n【21】**The Term-Preterm EHG database \\[3\\] was used in this work. In our study， we considered the record with the identity 1737 and carried out at 35.6 weeks of gestation with delivery at 39 weeks(full term pregnancy). Then， as data used in this study， we exploited the thirty (30) parameters most used in the literature for the characterization of the EHG signal and uterine contractions (Table 1).**\n\n【22】**Empirical mode decomposition**\n\n【23】**The raw data from PhysioBank was then subjected to Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD).**\n\n【24】**This is a method used to analyze and decompose non-stationary and non-linear signals. It performs operations that partition a series into N finite \"modes\" (IMFs： Intrinsic Mode Functions) without leaving the time domain \\[4\\]. The first extracted IMF contains the fastest oscillations of the signal， the last extracted IMF concerns the slowest ones， while the residual， r(t)， represents the signal trend \\[5，6\\].**\n\n【25】**The usefulness of EMD in our work is that it allows us to eliminate unnecessary variations in the original signal.**\n\n【26】**Principal component analysis**\n\n【27】**This is a widely used dimension reduction technique. Given a dataset with n features， the obiective is to have k features with ks n so that the k features retain most of the variation present in all the original variables. Let us assume the following dataset in matrix form to illustrate the technique：**\n\n【28】**with each row representing an observation and each column a Darameter**\n\n【29】By associating to each dataset a， b， c a function f，the average of each column gives：\n\n【30】**which allows us to obtain the covariance of each parameter fthrough：**\n\n【31】**Thus， following the rules of covariance we have：**\n\n【32】**cov(ff) cov(介))cov(f，f)**\n\n【33】**Considering the square matrix Ae m\\*n and aeR an eigenvalue of A， reR\"-{0} is the corresponding eigenvector of A if：**\n\n【34】A.=A. (eigenvalue equation)\n\n【35】**det(A-A7)= _b一A_**\n\n【36】C3 (6)\n\n【37】**Solving this equation (using the Sarrus rule)， we have an equation of the form： al+bA2+cA+d=0.**\n\n【38】**After solving this equation we obtain the eigenvalues： 入，入入， with：**\n\n【39】**We then obtain， by solving the eigenvalue equation， the different eigenvectors：2 P，**\n\n【40】V，，\"’\"， represents respectively the eigenvectors ofA，1..\n\n【41】**Considering (a)， we can choose k ≤n principal components with k=2 in our case. This giving us the corresponding matrix：**\n\n【42】**This can still be written by transformation into a new subspace in the form：**\n\n【43】**It is therefore a technique whose objectives are to： Simplify and reduce data， select variables， classify， model，predict， etc. \\[7\\]. It also allows us to identify patterns in the data， and to compress them by reducing the higher dimensions to the lower ones， without causing any effect on the whole data or without losing important information\\[8\\]. In other words， at the end of this analysis， we obtain a given number of Principal Components (PCs) such that this number is less than or equal to the number of initial dimensions of the dataset.**\n\n【44】**Stationarity and deep learning**\n\n【45】**The stationarity of the data series to be sent to the forecasting algorithm must be ensured. For this purpose， the method of visual observation of the signal， its mean and its standard deviation， all represented on the same graph， is used. A statistical method is associated with this for increasingly complex data series. In our case， the Augmented Dickey Fuller test \\[9\\] was used as it is the most widely used statistical method of stationarityanalysis in the literature. It is a mathematical method based on a null hypothesis and an alternative. The non-stationarity of the data is often considered as a null hypothesis. The objective is to eliminate it by obtaining a p-value lower than 0.05.**\n\n【46】**Once the stationarity of the data series is ensured， the forecasting process can start. For this purpose， the deep learning method N-BEATS \\[10\\] has been identified. It is a predictive algorithm with a deep neural architecture based on backward and forward residual links and a very deep stack of fully connected layers. The architecture has a number of desirable properties， being interpretable， applicable without modification to a wide range of target domains， and fast to train \\[10\\]. It is a method that has proven itself in the field of time series forecasting in recent years. For its implementation， PyTorch Forecasting was used， itself being a PyTorch-based package with an open source machine learning framework (Figure 1).**\n\n【47】**Results**\n\n【48】**The application of the EMD on the EHG signal of our example(woman at 35 weeks of gestation) over a period of 20s centered on the peak characterizing the uterine contraction (Figure 2)， gives 4 IMFs among which we selected the second one in the framework of our study. The choice to focus on the periods of contraction is the one most often made in the literature.**\n\n【49】**After obtaining the IMFs from the EMD， when we apply the principal component analysis considering the 30 parameters， we obtain Table 2. Considering the results in Table 2， we have identified the 15 best parameters (RMS， MF， TM5， SM3， MYOP， ApEn， Tr， MAV2，TM3， SE (SampEn)， VCF， MNF，LOG， ZC，MAV1) by taking in order the principal components and the parameters representing them.**\n\n【50】**Atthe end of this， we notice that the first six principal components**\n\n【51】**Figure 1： N-BEATS architecture.**\n\n| **Table 1： Summary of the most used parameters in the literature.**  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Authors**  | **Title**  | **Parameters/features**  |\n| **Garcia-Gonzales et** **al.，2013**  | **Characterization of EHG contractions at** **term labor by nonlinear analysis**  | **Nonlinear： Sample Entropy (SampEn)**  |\n| **Alamedine et al..2013a**  | **Parameters extraction and monitoring in** **uterine EMG signals.

Thus， in the following， these six principal components will be used to train our deep learning and decision algorithm for predicting the future behavior of our EHG signal. The application of our deep learning method to our dataset leads to Figure 3.**\n\n【54】**As we can see from the different graphs， the higher the number of epochs， the less the model learns. The number of cycles refers to learning across the entire training data set. In this case， we will opt for small training cycles.**\n\n【55】**Discussion**\n\n【56】**In the literature， a fixed number of parameters have often been used regardless of the patient； in our work the parameters are selected according to the EHG signal， the characteristics of which depend on the patient， the week of gestation， and external factors that also affect the uterine contraction muscles. Indeed， when applying the method to other examples， the parameters do not appear in the same order from one woman to another and from one week of gestation to**\n\n【57】**another. Furthermore， we find that it is unnecessary to go beyond a certain number of principal components (usually 6). Since often the first six principal components already represent 90% of the signal information if not more. We therefore recommend the analysis of the principal component before any characterization of the EHG**\n\n【58】**Figure 2： EMD over a period of 20s from a woman at 35 weeks of gestation.**\n\n【59】**Table 2： Principal components of a patient at 35 weeks of gestation.**\n\n| **PC**  | **Parameters**  | **PC**  | **Parameters**  | **PC**  | **Parameters**  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **PC1**  | **RMS**  | **PC11**  | **SampEn**  | **PC21**  | **TM4**  |\n| **PC2**  | **MF**  | **PC12**  | **MAV2**  | **PC22**  | **EMG**  |\n| **PC3**  | **TM5**  | **PC13**  | **MF**  | **PC23**  | **RMS**  |\n| **PC4**  | **SM3**  | **PC14**  | **VCF**  | **PC24**  | **SM1**  |\n| **PC5**  | **MYOP**  | **PC15**  | **MNF**  | **PC25**  | **WL**  |\n| **PC6**  | **ApEn**  | **PC16**  | **LOG**  | **PC26**  | **EMG**  |\n| **PC7**  | **Tr**  | **PC17**  | **ZC**  | **PC27**  | **TTP**  |\n| **PC8**  | **ApEn**  | **PC18**  | **RMS**  | **PC28**  | **MNP**  |\n| **PC9**  | **MAV2**  | **PC19**  | **MAV1**  | **PC29**  | **SS**  |\n| **PC10**  | **TM3**  | **PC20**  | **DASDV**  | **PC30**  | **WAMP**  |\n\n【61】**Figure 3： Summary of learning and forecasting by cycle.**\n\n【62】**signal and thus of the uterine contractions. So， parameters that do not actually represent a good proportion of the signal information can be discarded，unless one wants to study the signal specifically with respect to these parameters.**\n\n【63】**In our work， due to the sampling frequency and time interval， we have made forecasts over short periods. This can be remedied by increasing for example the recording time to extend the prediction over an earlier prediction horizon. The physiological signals forecasting and in particular the EHG ones， is still at an immature stage， with few articles on this subject. In our perspectives， we would like to build up larger datasets with longer recording times in order to make predictions over hours.**\n\n【64】**It should also be noted that in this work we have not stuck to the standard classification on the basis of parameters or their associated methods. This is generally done in the literature so far to see which parameter(s) better identify or predict the contractions that will lead**\n\n【65】**to labor， or which method(s) achieve this result or the classification between preterm and term birth. Future perspectives would be to consider representative parameters of the principal components for prediction (corresponding to what is done in the literature) and to compare the results with those obtained by proceeding in the way indicated in the present work. But the majorlimitation of our work is the size of our data due to the lack of a more representative database of local populations and more adapted to our needs. We hope to overcome this limitation with the validation of our recording kit.**\n\n【66】**Conclusion**\n\n【67】**In this work， we have prioritized the most commonly used parameters in the literature by the proportion of information on the signal they represent， using the principal component analysis method. This allows us to avoid choosing the parameters for characterizing the EHG at random； especially as the order of the main components of the EHG as observed here varies from one patient to another and according to the weeks of recording. Furthermore， this allows us to know that the parameters we consider in our prediction models best represent the signal. Our prediction model here is based on predicting the behavior of the EHG signal by the deep learning method called N-BEATS. This is a recent method that is proving itself in other areas compared to existing methods. It allows a learning process which， in order to last in time， needs a large quantity of data at the beginning which was not possible in our case due to the limits of the exploited database. It would therefore be desirable to have a database of its own for longer predictions.**\n\n【68】**References**\n\n【69】**1\\. Jossou TR， Et-Tahir A， Tahori Z， El Ouadi A， Medenou D， Bybi A， et al.

Despite being the most common intracranial cysts， they are relatively rare，representing 1% ofintracranial space-occupying lesions， with a prevalence of 1% to 3% in pediatric age \\[1，3，5\\]. There seems to be a male-to-female preponderance of 2-5：1 and the left hemisphere is more often affected， both with no acceptable scientific explanation so far \\[1，5\\].**\n\n【17】**_Citation：_**\n\n【18】**AC are nearly always single and sporadic， mostly detected in the first two decades oflife \\[2\\]. Most of these simple cystic lesions of unknown etiology represent incidental findings on neuroimaging studies \\[2，5，6\\]. Although these lesions can occur throughout the neuroaxis， more than half are found in the Middle Temporal Fossa (MTF)/Sylvian fissure \\[1，5\\]. Other possible locations include the posterior fossa， suprasellar region and intra ventricularly \\[1，5\\].**\n\n【19】**Interestingly， many AC are detected during perinatal surveillance and long-term follow-up has revealed that some are quiescent throughout life； some may remain asymptomatic for many years before demonstrating signs and others may even disappear \\[1，2，6\\]. With the greater worldwide availability of neuroimaging， more intracranial AC are being found in all age groups， but mostly in children (75%)\\[2，3\\].**\n\n【20】**The vast majority of AC are asymptomatic (93.2%)， but occasionally AC may produce symptoms (6.8%) due to expansion or rupture， originating Subdural Hygroma (SH) or bleeding\\[1，5，7，8\\]. Manifestations also depend on AC’s size and location， being headache the most common presenting symptom \\[2，5，8\\]. Other possible symptoms are due to increased intracranial pressure，**\n\n【21】**hydrocephalus or local mass effect \\[1，2，5\\]. Hemorrhage is rare in the pediatric population (0.3% to 6%)， being trauma and larger cyst size the main underlying risk factors \\[1，7\\].**\n\n【22】**The overwhelming majority of lesions do not change in size relatively to the initial diagnosis and only rarely expand in the pediatric population， being expansion primarily found under four years of age \\[1，5\\].**\n\n【23】**Case Presentation**\n\n【24】**A two-year-old boy， with no personal/family history of note， brought to the emergency room due to headache that arose after falling from his own height the day before. The headache was intermittent， limited to the frontal region， with phonophobia and photophobia and was triggered by exertion (running) and defecation. A single postprandial vomiting was recorded. There were no visual complaints.**\n\n【25】**On physical examination there were no traumatic injuries， the patient was conscious， with normal vital signs and there were no focal deficits in the neurological examination.**\n\n【26】**Due to the headache's persistence， he underwent on Computed Tomography (CT) head scan， which revealed a left frontotemporal cystic lesion with 27 mm x54 mm， with slight right deviation from the midline structures. Brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) confirmed a left temporal AC 82 mm x52 mm x 77 mm filling the temporal fossa and compressing insula and adjacent structures， with subfalcine herniation of 5 mm. It was also visualized a bilateral frontal SH of greater thickness on the left (4 mm) of probable posttraumatic etiology， extending to the inter hemispheric cleft.**\n\n【27】**Duringthe in-hospital surveillancehe remained hemodynamically stable with progressive headache's improvement. He was discharged with a recommendation for avoidance of high-impact physical activity. He is still regularly followed in Neurosurgery Consultation for clinical and imagiological evaluation.**\n\n【28】**Duringfollow-up， thepatient's familyIreported some paroxysmal episodes of eye blinking usually lasting only a couple of seconds. A consultation of Neuropediatrics was requested which confirmed a neurological examination without alterations. A video-electroencephalogram was also performed and showed no abnormalities. There were no other complications and these paroxysms disappeared with time， as well as the headache.**\n\n【29】**Subsequent brain-MRI revealed a progressive decrease in AC dimensions. On Figure 1， we can see the 7 months' neuroimage follow-up with almost total resorption of the left hemispheric collection.**\n\n【30】**Currently， he is 4 years old and is asymptomatic， without any restriction of physical activity， and there are no concerns about his neurodevelopment.**\n\n【31】**Discussion**\n\n【32】**Most AC are usually asymptomatic， constituting an incidental finding in neuroimaging studies， although rare symptomatic cases are described， usually after minor traumatic brain injury \\[1，7\\].**\n\n【33】**This clinical case deals with a large AC that became symptomatic after a minor head injury that probably lead to AC rupture with subsequent SH formation.

Symptoms usually become severe for days or weeks after onset， but they eventually resolve \\[2，7\\]. Physical findings are usually limited to papilledema， which was absent in this clinical case. Furthermore， history of minor trauma without loss of consciousness， verified in this clinical case， is described as a relatively common finding in the literature \\[1，7\\].**\n\n【36】**The treatment approach of an AC with SH remains controversial and neurosurgical treatment was traditionally recommended， but newer reports have been questioning this strategy \\[1，7，8\\]. There is no Class I evidence regarding the role and type of surgery for the treatment of these lesions \\[1\\]. Conservative management has been proposed for patients who do not demonstrate signs of increased intracranial pressure or focal neurological signs， because of the surgery's morbidity \\[1，7，8\\].**\n\n【37】**Some authors suggest that AC should be treated if there is evidence of local mass effect on neuroimaging \\[7\\]. However this can be potentially problematic in the context of SH， since any moderately sized SH and even many of the asymptomatic AC can produce the appearance oflocal mass effect on adjacent tissues \\[7\\].**\n\n【38】**Recent articles have been highlighting the natural course of cyst-associated SH， even when symptomatic， that is usually benign and symptom resolution can be expected in most cases. Therefore， symptomatic SH is not considered an absolute indication for surgical treatment anymore and expectant management can result in good outcomes in many cases， even in the presence of intracranial hypertension symptoms \\[1，5，7，8\\].**\n\n【39】**We must， therefore， weigh the risks and benefits of conservative versuis surgical treatment in symptomatic patients on an empirical individual patient basis \\[1，5，7\\]. There are still other important variables to consider in this equation： AC location， impact on CSF flow dynamics， symptomatic progression， risk of disfigurement due to bone remodeling (for large cysts)， as well as presence of focal neurological deficits or focal seizures \\[5，8\\].**\n\n【40】**Finally， this clinical case corroborates the most recent evidence， by illustrating the success of the conservative approach.**\n\n【41】**Conclusion**\n\n【42】**Most arachnoid cysts are usually asymptomatic， constituting an incidental finding in neuroimaging studies. Symptomatic cases are described after minor traumatic brain injury， possibly leading to rupture， with subsequent subdural hygroma formation.**\n\n【43】**The approach of an arachnoid cyst with subdural hygroma remains controversial and neurosurgical treatment was traditionally recommended，but newer reports have been questioning this strategy.**\n\n【44】**Conservative treatment seems to be promising， even if AC's large**\n\n【45】**dimensions and presence of intracranial hypertension symptoms.

Yet， it is not the standard of care to screen for either of these sexually transmitted diseases upon diagnosis of primary penile cancer. We present a 50 year old male who had a confirmed diagnosis of penile cancer for 2 years prior to his presentation to our clinic in Dakar， Senegal. Outside institutions repeatedly failed to screen the patient for sexually transmitted diseases， namely HPV and HIV. We share this case to emphasize the importance of sexually transmitted disease screening upon diagnosis of penile cancer with hopes to increase awareness in both developed and developing nations. We call for consensus in sexually transmitted disease screening guidelines upon penile cancer diagnoses.**\n\n【14】**Keywords： Penile cancer； HPV；HIV； STD screening**\n\n【15】**Introduction**\n\n【16】**Primary penile cancer is a rare malignant overgrowth of cells， typically located on the glans or the internal prepuce of the penis. It has a worldwide incidence of 1/100，000 and most commonly affects males between the ages of 50 years to 70 years. Delayed diagnosis often yields significant morbidity and mortality \\[1，2\\]. While penile cancer is uncommon in Europe and North America， the developing world has much higher rates of incidence up to 8 cases per 100，000 in some countries\\[3\\]. Variations in incidence worldwide are hypothesized to be affected by socioeconomic status， healthcare accessibility，cultural tradition，and psychological factors of the patient populations \\[1，4\\].**\n\n【17】**Over 95% of penile carcinomas are Squamous Cell in Carcinoma (SCC) \\[1\\]. Additionally， there are a wide variety of other histological variants， such as basaloid， verrucous， and sarcomatoid \\[3\\]. The majority of lesions are found on the glans (48%)， with the remainder located on the prepuce(21%)， both glans and prepuce (15%)， coronal sulcus (6%)， and shaft (<2%)\\[4\\]. Diagnosis is often clinical， though clinical presentation is variable and commonly asymptomatic initially. Lesions can present as indurated nodules， ulcers， or fun gating masses. With progression， symptoms such as itching， bleeding， discharge， or pain may occur. Advanced disease can present with palpable lymphadenopathy， weight loss and fatigue \\[5\\].**\n\n【18】**Certain biological pathologieshavebeentiedto increased incidence. Poorhygiene， uncircumcised males， urethral stricture， tobacco use，and even psoralen ultraviolet A photochemotherapy have all been associated with increased penile cancer incidence in prior studies \\[6\\]. Chronic inflammation may also be a critical component of tumor development， as many penile cancers arise from sites of infection， chronic irritation or injury \\[1\\]. Further， penile cancer is best known to have a strong association with carcinogenic strains of Human Papillomavirus (HPV). For example， HPV infection is found in 45% to 80%\\[5\\] of penile SCC cases. This association is even higher in other histological types such as verrucous， basaloid and sarcomatoid \\[7\\]. The most commonlyaccepted explanation for the association is HPV's ability to produce the oncogenic proteins E6 and E7， which interfere with the p53 and Retinoblastoma tumor suppressor genes， respectively \\[8\\]. This carcinogenic mechanism is especially important in populations with high HPV infection rates， such as Sub-Saharan Africa. HPV incidence was found to be around 61% of the male population in Sub-Saharan Africa in 2012\\[13\\]. Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) may also play a role in SCC pathogenesis. Though a**\n\n【19】**causal link between immunosuppression and penile oncogenesis has not yet been made， men who are HIV+ carry up to an 8X greater risk of penile SCC \\[5，9\\].**\n\n【20】**Despite HPV and HIV's well known association with penile cancer， there is a serious lack of attention to the preventive health component of this condition. For example， the European Urological Association's (EUA) guidelines for penile cancer address diagnostic standards， staging， and possible treatment avenues that individual cases may necessitate. However， there is little acknowledgement of the public health risks that penile cancer may pose with an underlying HPV and HIV infection. Additionally， there seems to be no recommendation for penile cancer management specifically in developing nations， including Sub-Saharan Africa， which may have unique socioeconomic roadblocks. Consequently， this case report aims to emphasize the critical importance of screening for HIV/HPV upon a diagnosis of penile cancer， such that it should be included in official penile cancer guidelines. Prompt evaluation of a patient's STD status can not only decrease morbidity and mortality for the patient， but also provide preventative measures against future HPV-related cancers， as well as HIV complications in the community.**\n\n【21】**Case Presentation**\n\n【22】**We present a 50 year-old Senegalese male with a history of recurrent urethritis， who presented to our clinic for an evolving ulcerative swelling on his penis for the past 2 years. The patient's medical history is limited secondary to lack of documentation and resources from outside institutions. The patient had presented to several local clinics before the diagnosis of penile cancer was made； those records were unable to be obtained. The patient received 12chemotherapysessions before being referred to our clinic. Ofnote，the patient was polygamous with 2 wives， though became divorced since the beginning of the disease. He did not report having unprotected intercourse with other women.**\n\n【23】**CT scans demonstrated local invasion of the cancer into the subcutaneous fat overlying the pubic symphysis. Lymph node metastases with left inguinal necrotic lymphadenopathy of 5 cm were also present. Furthermore， there were bilateral， multiple lung nodules of different sizes， mostly predominant on the left side.**\n\n【24】**The patient never received an STD screening since his diagnosis. We performed an HIV and HPV test that came back positive for HIV2，previously unknown to the patient. The results also came back HPV (+) for serotype 16. As of May 2020， the patient is currently alive and being treated accordingly.**\n\n【25】**Discussion**\n\n【26】**There are no written recommendations for STD screening in patients diagnosed with penile cancer despite overwelming evidence that there is some association between HIV， HPV and penile cancer\\[10，11\\].Evidenced by our patient remaining undiagnosed with HIV2after initial presentation 2 years ago， delay in STD diagnosis can have dire consequences. An earlier diagnosis for our patient may have prevented the eventual progression of his penile cancer and further metastatic disease.**\n\n【27】**We hypothesize that early diagnosis of HPV and HIV infections in patients can have a marked benefit for public health as well. With earlier identification and Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Therapy(HAART)，HIV transmission will likely decrease. A case report written by Konan et al. acknowledges a link between HIV and penile cancer**\n\n【28】**Figures 1 and 2： Urogenital exam revealed an ulcer of 8 cm of long axis of the penis enveloping the glans and the proximal 2/3 of the penis with a clean bottom. He had inflammation of the 2 bursa， and a penascratal fistula fram which pus drained. There were hard and painful inguinal lymphadenopathies bilaterally. A urinary catheter in place drained cloudy urine.**\n\n【29】**and suggests that a diagnosis of HIV may worsen the prognosis of the disease. Additionally， Konan recommends screening HIV+ patients for penile cancer so that tumors can be discovered in earlier stages. Patients would therefore be more likely to be treated conservatively. As for HPV， there is evidence to suggest that good clinical suspicion to screen for the virus in sexually active patients may reduce the risk of subsequent oropharyngeal cancers in the public \\[12，13\\]. Hence， it may be extrapolated that early diagnosis of these viruses may prevent their transmission and subsequent complications in the community.**\n\n【30】**Despite the plethora of information on the internet， there is still not enough consistent information to educate developing nations on the infectious disease management ofpenile cancer. For example， the EUA never recommends screening for HPV/HIV in penile cancer patients and the American Urologic Association has no specific guidelines for penile cancer whatsoever. Consequently， Teh et al.\\[2\\] was right to describe finding consistent information on penile cancer as a “needle in the haystack\". Additionally， they state that there seems to be a discrepancy in the quality of websites in differing languages， with significantly lesser quality available in the developing world. With all of the inconsistencies in literature， the severity of our patient's case could have been prevented by access to clear， concise STD recommendations.**\n\n【31】**Necessarily，wecallforspecific，evidenced-basedrecommendations for STD testing for penile cancer diagnosis. A clear consensus would address the discrepancies and current confusion across resources.For our future patients and the entire medical community， we seek more thorough guidelines in regards to testing for HIV and HPV upon a diagnosis of penile cancer.**\n\n【32】**Conclusion**\n\n【33】**The association between penile cancer， HPV， and HIV has been well established. However， in the developing world， it is not always common practice to properly screen for STDs upon a diagnosis of**\n\n【34】**penile cancer. Prompt screening of these patients can lead to earlier treatment， better outcomes， increased public health awareness， and potential for more cost effective care. Thus， screening for sexually transmitted diseases should be the standard of care in anyone diagnosed with penile cancer.**\n\n【35】**References**\n\n【36】**1.Bleeker MCG， Heideman DAM， Snijders PJF， Horenblas S， Dillner J，** Meijer CJLM.

The cause of ARVD/C is not yet clear， but recent studies suggest it is most often related to genetic mutations. Left Ventricular (LV) or biventricular involvements are increasingly identified in ARVD/C patients. The genetic background of cardiomyopathies could shed light on the mechanism of their development， clinical presentations and new treatment options.**\n\n【12】**We describe here a patient affected by arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy with left ventricular involvement， with the presence of coronary artery anomalies. There were aneurisms of coronary arteries and Left Circumflex Artery (LCx) arises from right coronary sinus. Physiological， imaging and invasive study was performed in details. In addition， genetic analysis by Next Generation Sequencing (NGS)， using panel of genes for hereditary cardiomyopathy， was done.

The cause of ARVD/C is not yet clear， but recent studies suggest it is most often related to desmosomal abnormalities \\[2，3\\]. ARVD/C is not a simple RV disease. Left Ventricular(LV) or biventricular involvement is increasingly identified in ARVD/C patients \\[4\\]. Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) is a valuable diagnostic tool for ARVD/C due to the high negative**\n\n【19】**predictive value， which can identify LV impairment and thus has a significant impact on clinical decision-making \\[5，6\\]. Most of the ARVD/C patients had CMR evidence of LV involvement， of which Late Gadolinium Enhancement (LGE) and Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) were the most sensitive indicators. Biventricular and left-dominant disease variants have been identified and have led some to use the term Arrhythmogenic Cardiomyopathy(ACM) to define the broader spectrum of the disease phenotypic expressions. LV involvement can be considered a late manifestation of advanced disease；however，recent studies at the level ofgenetic characterization have hypothesized that potential LV involvement may develop ahead of significant RV dysfunction in patients with ARVD/C. CMR evidence of LV involvement is a strong independent predictor of hard cardiac events \\[7\\]. Additionally，the presence of LV dysfunction plays an incremental role in predicting adverse cardiac events compared to RV dysfunction alone.**\n\n【20】**Case Presentation**\n\n【21】**Patient presentation**\n\n【22】**A 73 years old patient was admitted in our clinic with symptoms and signs of decompensated right and left sided heart failure. There were the following concomitant diseases： optimally treated arterial hypertension and atrial fibrillation， known for 4 months before hospitalization. The treatment included Acenocoumarol and beta blocker -Bisoprolol5 mg/daily.**\n\n【23】**Physical examination**\n\n【24】**The following symptoms were observed： elevated jugular venous pressure with positive venous pulse and hepatojugular reflux； vesicular breathing with basal crackles； Heart Rate (HR) 80/min， systolic murmur in the 4\"h left intercostal space，louder in inspiration； hepatomegaly，peripheral oedema.**\n\n【25】**Electrocardiogram (ECG)： on admission-atrial fibrillation， HR**\n\n【26】**80/min.**\n\n【27】**Holter ECG - Atrial fibrillation， heart rate 60/min， premature ventricular beats， non-sustained wide complex tachycardia (Figure1A).**\n\n【28】**Echocardiography demonstrated dilated _d_ cardiac chambers， predominantly right sided， mildly reduced left ventricular ejection fraction- 42%；right ventricular dysfunction， Fractional Area Change(FAC) - 28%； Tricuspid Annular Plane Systolic Excursion (TAPSE)-12 m/sec， Moderate Mitral Regurgitation (MR)， severe Tricuspid Regurgitation (TR)， with Pulmonary Artery Pressure (PAP) - 37mmHg (Figure 1B).**\n\n【29】**Invasive study： coronary arteriography reveals no stenosis but dilation and aneurisms of coronary arteries， Left Circumflex Artery(LCx) arises from right coronary sinus. Right heart catheterization：high Right Atrial Pressure (RAP)-25/30/21 mmHg with severe tricuspid regurgitation and Ventricularization of Right Atrium (RA)， mild pulmonary hypertension PAP-35/20mmHg； Right Ventricular Pressure (RVP)-37/9/17 mmHg. Regarding diagnostics of unknown cardiomyopathy CMR was performed- cardiomegaly with RV and RA dilation (RA -75/67 mm)， apical trabeculation of RV， dilated inferior v. cava -30 mm， desynchrony in RV Outflow Tract (RVOT)， hypokinesis of the apical and septoapical segments of the RV and LV， jet of significant tricuspid regurgitation with incomplete coaptation of the valve leaflets. Late Gadolinium Enhancement (LGE) in RV free wall to RVOT and LV apical and septoapical zone. The RVEF was36.5% and LVEF - 45%， with moderately increased End-Diastolic Volume (EDV) and End-Systolic Volume (ESV) of LV (Figures1C-1E). Due to the wide complex tachycardia， CRT-D (Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy-Defibrillator) was implanted followed by no dynamics in echo-parameters， clinically stable， no sustained wide complex tachycardia on Holter ECG.**\n\n【30】**and septaapical part of LV，jet phenamenon proximal of tricuspid valve during systale with incomplete coaptaion of valve leaflets. LGE in RV free wall to RVOT and**\n\n【31】**LV apical and septoapical zone. RVEF-36.5% and LVEF-42% with moderate increasing of EDV and ESV of LV.**\n\n【32】**Genetic testing**\n\n【33】**Genetic testing was offered to the patient and performed after signing an Informed consent. Using Next Generation Sequencing(NGS) of genes’ panel for hereditary cardiomyopathy， the following genetic variant was detected： NM\\_000256.3 (MYBPC3)： c.1316G>A(p.Gly439Asp). This sequence change replaces glycine with aspartic acid at codon 439 of the MYBPC3 protein (p.Gly439Asp). The glycine residue is highly conserved and there is a moderate physicochemical difference between glycine and aspartic acid. This variant is present in population databases at an extremely low frequency (rs763045718， ExAC 0.01%). Clin Var contains an entry for this variant in a patient with cardiomyopathy (Variation ID： 628463). Algorithms developed to predict the effect of missense changes on protein structure and function are either unavailable or do not agree on the potential impact of this missense change (SIFT： Deleterious； PolyPhen-2：Benign； Align-GVGD： Class C1). In summary， the available evidence is currently insufficient to determine the role of this variant in disease. Therefore， it has been classified as a Variant ofUncertain Significance.**\n\n【34】**Discussion**\n\n【35】**Abnormalities in cardiac Myosin Binding Protein C (MyBP-C， encoded by MYBPC3) are the most common cause of Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM) - mutations are detected in about 30% of HCM cases. Most MYBPC3 mutations in HCM result in premature termination codons that cause RNA degradation and a reduction of MyBP-C in the heart \\[8\\]. Pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants(mostly missense and splicing mutations) in MYBPC3 were reported in about 5% of cases with Dilated Cardiomyopathy (DCM) as well\\[9\\]. It is an interesting observation how different mutations in a same gene could make different myosin dysfunctions. It was demonstrated that stepwise loss of MyBP-C resulted in reciprocal augmentation of myosin contractility. Direct attenuation of myosin function， via a damaging missense variant (F764L) that causes Dilated Cardiomyopathy (DCM)， normalized the increased contractility from MyBP-C depletion \\[10\\]. Another therapeutic agent MYK-461， a pharmacologic inhibitor of myosin ATPase， rescued relaxation deficits and restored normal contractility in HCM cardiomyocytes with MYBPC3 mutations. These data define dosage-dependent effects of MyBP-C on myosin that occur across the cardiac cvcle. Therapeutic strategies to MyBP-C activity may rescue depressed cardiac contractility in patients with DCM， whereas inhibiting myosin by MYK-461 should benefit the substantial proportion of HCM patients with MYBPC3 mutations.**\n\n【36】**Conclusion**\n\n【37】**WVi quite complex arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy， with left ventricle involvement and anomalies in coronary arteries， whereby genetic testing revealed an extremely rare genetic missense variant in MYBPC3 gene. The genetic change in the exon 14 of the gene causes aminoacidic change Glycine/Aspartic acid with a moderate physicochemical difference in the protein. The association of this mutation with the development of that complex cardiomyopathy is worthy to be investigated， since it could have an important impact on the application of new treatment， using specific agents， connected to myosin activity.**\n\n【38】**1\\.

His diet consists of mangoes， papayas， oranges， cereals in industrial preparation for children， soda water. Clinically， he presented with anorexia， gastrointestinal disturbances in the form of vomiting and diarrhea. There was moderate dyspnea. He then benefited from two successive antibiotic therapies， the first of which consists of a Sulfonamide-Trimethoprim combination for seven days and the second of a synergistic combination of Amoxicillin and Clavulanic acid for a week. At the end of the three days of partial remission of the primate， he received therapy based on metronidazole.**\n\n【13】**Although the patient's condition improved， it was not satisfactory because the diarrhea and vomiting persisted. Then， he received a gastric dressing based on diosmectite and a reconstituting intestinal microbiota. On the day’s death， dyspnea aggravated and the emergency care based on dexamethasone treatment failed to save the patient life. Immediately following the death of this chimpanzee， the Abidjan (Cote dIvoire) zoo administration referred the primate to us in order to investigate the case.**\n\n【14】**Autopsy Findings**\n\n【15】**Externally， the subject was in a good condition but moderately dehydrated. Internally， there were interstitial mild hemorrhagic multifocal and moderate emphysematous pneumonia； diffuse congestive and catarrhal colitis with telangiectasia (Figure 1)， diffuse severe catarrhal enteritis； diffuse moderate to severe hepatic steatosis， mild to moderate and focal congestive myocarditis.**\n\n【16】**Parasitological Examinations**\n\n【17】**The fecal material of the subject was positive to Strongyloides stercoralis parasite with a parasitic load of 200 eggs per gram.

This immunosuppression is chiefly caused by long term and high dose of glucocorticoid treatment \\[1\\]. A few described conditions include inappropriate use of immunosuppressive drugs \\[2\\]. In the current case， none of these etiologies could be valid. It is comprehensive**\n\n【47】**that immunosuppression condition if it is proven， could explain dissemination.Nonetheless， in the current case，there was no evidence of immunosuppression due to absence ofhypoplasia of lymph nodes. Yet， we recognize that the blood values have not been estimated during ante mortem in order to appreciate lasting leukopenia. It is a pathological process that initially affects the digestive function with a significant subsequent impact on the lungs (for the record， the chimpanzee grabbed his chest shortly before death)， liver and whose main etiology is Strongyloides stercoralis hyperinfection followed by its dissemination. The constitutions of thrombi in the lungs have not yet been described in this pathology. This fact could be explained by hemorrhagic lesions in lung that imply necrotizing vasculitis. But these thrombi that can cause thromboembolism are a serious factor. However， diffuse alveolar hemorrhage due to Strongyloides stercoralis hyperinfection has been substantiated in a recent human clinical hospitalized case \\[3\\]. The skin dermis was highly parasitized. In our case，the responsibility of Ancylostoma duodenale in the dissemination of strongyloidiasis remains unknown. This is an unexplained and particular disseminated strongyloidiasis： There was neither evidenced immunosuppression nor lasting glucocorticoid treatment. Another lesson of this rare case is that human alimentary practices could be a major risk factor for Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Diseases (NAFLD) in captive Non-Human Primates (NHP).**\n\n【48】**Many chemicals that cause Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis(NASH) as well in human and animal model such as Paraquat， Atrazine， Simazine， and Arsenic \\[4\\] are still used as herbicide or**\n\n【49】**crop chemicals. In many under developing countries， agriculture foods such as fruits that are sold before the end of withdrawal time-a delay that has to be observed after a crop chemical treatment in order to permit elimination of residues. Thus， the consumers including captive NHP become exposed for a long time.**\n\n【50】**In consequence， as far as NASH is becoming a public health concern in termsof its potential complications(cirrhosis， hepatocellular carcinoma， for instances)， its physiopathological relation with strongyloidiasis dissemination deserves to be addressed.**\n\n【51】**Final Diagnosis**\n\n【52】**Disseminated strongyloidiasis withNon-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis stage F1 of chimpanzee.**\n\n【53】**References**\n\n【54】**1\\.

Due to the limitations of physical experiments such as difficulty in observation， rapid occurrence of phenomena， and dangers， as well as the impact of subjective and objective factors such as school funding， teacher constraints， and students weak experimental awareness， many physical experiments are not convenient to conduct in the classroom or laboratory， such as wave optics， fluid mechanics， particle physics， and nuclear physics experiments. The development of computer and simulation technology has enabled virtual experiments to be realized \\[1-3\\]， but most of the existing physical experiment simulation software in China is two-dimensional simulation \\[4\\]， such as Zhang Wenmiaoyun et al.\\[5\\]， who implemented optical experiment simulation based on Python， and Cao Fujun et al. \\[6\\]，who designed and developed two-dimensional simulated electromagnetic experiments using EWB 5.0. The effect of two-dimensional simulation experiments is not intuitive and visual enough，lacking a sense of immersion \\[7\\] and a sense of restoration， and the teaching effect is limited. The significance of designing the three-dimensional experimental simulation software based on the interest and observability of the experiment \\[3\\]. Currently， relevant scholars have developed 3D simulation software， such as Guo Tiezheng et al. \\[8\\]， who implemented cricket system simulation experiments based on Unity3D， Xiong Yanfan et al. \\[9\\]， who discussed the application of VR technology in practical teaching， and Feng Jiao et al. \\[10\\]， who implemented flight simulation systems using the WebGL framework Three.js. Most of these 3D simulation software uses Unity3D，VR， and Three.js， with good results， However， using Unity3D \\[11\\] requires downloading and installation， while VR has a high cost of configuring hardware devices. In view of the application requirements of physical experiment simulation software， Three.js， which is lightweight， plug-in free， and can be directly run in a browser \\[12\\]， has become the best choice for developing physical virtual simulation software.**\n\n【18】**This article takes the classic experiment of fluid mechanics \"Saxon bowl sinking experiment\"as an example， and uses Three js to design and implement a virtual simulation system for physical experiments. This system breaks through the limitations of two-dimensional planes by constructing three-dimensional models， achieving three-dimensional and visualized full simulation of experimental equipment and experimental processes， truly simulating the interaction between teachers and students offline \\[7\\]， providing a series of interactive animations to complete simulation details， such as smooth control of object placement Error control when measuring inner and outer diameters with vernier calipers， etc.； Adding multiple tools to reduce experimental errors and**\n\n【19】**Figure 1： Three.js workflow diagram.**\n\n【20】**providing multiple learning methods such as text， speech， and video greatly increases the interest and observability of the experiment\\[7，13\\]， improving and enhancing teaching effectiveness.**\n\n【21】**Three.js Technology**\n\n【22】**Technical overview**\n\n【23】**The Three.js library is a 3D engine packaged and running based on native WebGL \\[14，15\\]， which is an application programming interface for generating 3D graphics effects on the Web. Three.js not only supports Canvas animation and CSS animation， but also supports more advanced physics-based rendering technology based on general 3D engines \\[16\\]. It provides a set of simple solutions and practical built-in objects for creating 3D graphics. At the same time， it can quickly instantiate elements such as Scene， Light， Camera， and Renderer， greatly improving the development efficiency of 3D graphics during COVID-19 pandemic.**\n\n【24】**Workflow**\n\n【25】**The workflow of Three.js mainly includes four parts： creating a scene， configuring a scene， creating model objects， and rendering \\[17\\]. The five main elements of 3D graphics rendering are： Scene， camera， object，light， and renderer \\[16\\]. A scene is a three-dimensional space used to place models， lights， and cameras， which are then rendered using a renderer. Objects need to be presented through a camera to determine the observation position， direction， and angle， and to determine the final scene displayed on the display. Objects are three-dimensional models for display. Simple models can be created through Three.js built-in solutions， while complex models need to be modeled using professional 3D drawing software \\[16\\]. Lights provide illumination for the scene， and different light sources and colors can be selected based on the scene effect. The function of the renderer is to render the created scene and the projections of three-dimensional objects observed by the camera on a two-dimensional plane， and present them to the browser (Figure 1).**\n\n【26】**Introduction to Saxon Bowl and Its Timing Principle**\n\n【27】**The Saxon bowl is a bowl with a perforated bottom， which is timed by observing the natural sinking of the bowl in water. In this paper， theoretical analysis of the relationship between the Saxon bowl sinking time and related physical parameters is conducted，and experimental simulation is established.**\n\n【28】**Assume that a bowl with a mass of m，， a thickness ofd， a height of h，， and a cross-sectional area of S holes at the bottom is placed in a liquid with an infinite width and a density of \\[18\\]. When t=0， the bottom of the bowl is in contact with the liquid surface； At the time of t=t\\_， the bowl mouth is flush with the outer liquid surface， and the physical process of the Saxon bowl sinking within the time period 0≤tsta is analyzed. By establishing a physical model and combining fluid mechanics processes， it is concluded that the settling time of the Saxon bowl in liquid is \\[18\\]：**\n\n【29】**Design of Saxon Bowl3DSimulation Experimental System**\n\n【30】**System architecture design**\n\n【31】**The simulation experiment platform adopts a hierarchical model： A presentation layer， an application layer， a business logic layer， a data access layer， and a database five-tier structure (Figure2). The presentation layer is used to display system interfaces and experimental data， display simulation models， and provide interface services for the application layer. The business logic layer processes the system's business logic (rules， workflow， data integrity， etc.). The data access layer provides data.**\n\n【32】**3D animation design**\n\n【33】**The Saxon Bowl simulation experiment designed a series ofthree dimensional animations to simulate the real experimental process， and added interactive details of user operations， achieving human-computer interaction beyond the viewing level to enhance the user experience. For example， when measuring mass with a tray balance， the system will determine whether the user has placed items on the tray， and whether they have moved weights or weights， so as to control the left and right swing and placement position of the objects， in order to prevent model overlap and threading The vernier caliper will be opened and closed according to the user's operation； When measuring the density of a liquid with a densitometer， place it in the liquid to be measured and float up and down until it becomes stable； Liquid surface texture in a water tank simulates fluid flow； The Saxon bowl sinks， equipped with a movable bowl rack to ensure that the bowl is in a static state when it first touches the liquid level， and then sinks according to the sinking path simulated by the fitting curve.**\n\n【34】**During the process， the small hole in the bottom of the bowl flows liquid， and the liquid level in the bowl will rise accordingly.**\n\n【35】**Implementation of Saxon Bowl 3D Simulation Svstem**\n\n【36】**Construction of three-dimensional experimental environment**\n\n【37】**The experimental environment is an important link that affects the visual effect of virtual simulation experiments. In order to enhance the user's experience in experiments and restore the experimental scene of the laboratory Saxon Bowl experiment， it is necessary to build a 3D high-definition rendered virtual scene during COVID-19pandemic.**\n\n【38】**First， use the three coordinate axes x， y， and z in the scene created by three.js to form a simple virtual simulation experiment three-dimensional space \\[19\\]， laying the foundation for subsequent3D experimental equipment creation and experimental simulation effects. In order for the 3D model in the scene to also present a 3D**\n\n【39】**effect in the human eye rather than a simple planar figure， it is also necessary to create a Perspective Camera that can adjust its own observation range， angle， and distance from the 3D model to make the model present different visual effects. The light sources in the scene can not only enhance the 3D feel of the model， but also highlight the material characteristics of the model. For example， applying a point light source to a tray balance can well highlight its metal texture. In order to meet the requirements similar to those of real experiments， the system strictly sets camera parameters to ensure the effectiveness of experimental equipment measurement data during simulation experiments. In addition， arranging scene lights can also give a three-dimensional sense of the environment. The core code is as follows：**\n\n【40】**Construction of three-dimensional experimental equipment**\n\n【41】**Modeling of three-dimensional experimental equipment is the foundation for implementing a three-dimensional simulation system for physical experiments， providing necessary materials for the construction of virtual scenes and the implementation of interactive behaviors20.**\n\n【42】**Firstly， select an appropriate method to construct 3D model components based on real physical equipment data. Components with regular shapes are constructed using a box (THREE. BoxGeometry)， a cylinder (THREE. CylinderGeometry)， a sphere(THREE. SphereGeometry)， and a cone (THREE. ConeGeometry). Components with irregular shapes need to first obtain data on each vertex of the component， use THREE. Vector3() to store the data， and place it in a vertex array， then， THREE.Face30 stores the triangular faces formed by connecting the vertices of the component， and places them in a triangular face array. Finally， the required components can be constructed using the above two arrays. After all components are built， use the intersection， union， and subtract components in the Three BSP plug-in library to assemble the 3D model. Taking a vernier caliper as an example， the modeling scheme is as follows：**\n\n【43】**Let scene，camera，ambientLight**\n\n【44】**scene = new THREE.SceneO；//create a scene**\n\n【45】**camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(x， width /height， 1，**\n\n【46】**1000)；//create a Perspective Camera**\n\n【47】**camera.position.set(-3，1，30)；//position the camera**\n\n【48】**camera.lookAt(new THREE.Vector3(-10， 0， 0))；//set camera observation point**\n\n【49】**ambientLightt=InewTHREE.AmbientLight(0x606060)；//add light source**\n\n【50】**scene.add(ambientLight)；//Adding Lights to a Scene**\n\n【51】**The vernier caliper mainly consists of a ruler body， a depth ruler， a master ruler， a vernier ruler， an internal measuring claw， an external measuring claw， and fastening screws. The master ruler， ruler body， and depth ruler are selected as cuboids (THREE. BoxGeometry)，and the coordinates are placed or embedded in appropriate positions. For irregular shaped internal and external measuring claws， it is difficult to restore true vernier calipers using traditional geometric graphics. Now， it is possible to obtain the data of each vertex of this part through an array and store it. Then， use the connection function of THREE.Face3() to connect each vertex in the space， and finally combine the two parts of the space. The shape of the fastening screw is similar to the cylinder (THREE. CylinderGeometry) in the three.js library. We use the cylinder to construct its shape and place the figure in the appropriate position on the vernier caliper. The above process completes the basic construction of the vernier caliper equipment model，and then uses the THREE. TextureLoader texture map to add a scale to the vernier caliper (Figure 3).**\n\n【52】**Other experimental equipment such as tray scales， densitometers， and Saxon bowls all use the above modeling ideas. The parts with regular shapes use simple geometric graphics from the three.jslibrary， while the irregular parts use arrays to obtain vertex coordinates and**\n\n【53】**construct them in space using aline method. Finally，the two parts are combined during COVID-19 pandemic.**\n\n【54】**Implementation of three-dimensional interactive behavior**\n\n【55】**Experimental simulation effect is an important factor affecting its practical value. In addition to presenting realistic visual effects and realistic experimental processes， rich and detailed interaction behavior is also a major factor affecting experimental simulation effect \\[20\\].**\n\n【56】**In the Saxon Bowl simulation experimental platform， the key to achieving interactive behavior is the interaction between a series of behaviors generated during user use and the coordinates of the model in the scene， thereby achieving manipulation of the model behavior. Due to the characteristics of the three.js runtime environment， using a mouse and keyboard is sufficient to change the X， Y，and Z coordinate values of the 3D model， completing all operations such as movingand rotating. By monitoring mouse and keyboard events during use， the model is bound to corresponding events. When the event is monitored and the corresponding event is triggered， the position of the model in three-dimensional space can be changed， achieving corresponding effects. This change in position is not constrained by the movement characteristics on the plane like 2D， and can achieve better 3D effects and experimental simulation effects during COVID-19 pandemic.**\n\n【57】**In the process of changing the position of a model， other models in the scene monitor their own coordinates and the model coordinates ofthe changed position in real time. Once the relationship between the two coordinates meets the coordinate relationship of the interaction conditions between the pre designed models， the two models will make the specified interaction behavior in time to achieve the ideal interaction effect. For example， during the process**\n\n【58】**of manipulating experimental equipment to move and place it on a pallet balance tray， the system will calculate the distance between the coordinates of the experimental equipment and the monitoring area above the pallet balance tray in real time. When the monitoring area above the pallet is reached， the interaction condition between the experimental equipment and the balance is reached， and the balance and experimental equipment will tilt in the corresponding direction to achieve interaction during COVID-19 pandemic.**\n\n【59】**In order to present 3D interactive effects and enhance the immersive experience of user experimental operations， the renderer. render() in three.js is used to refresh the position of the models in the scene based on coordinates after a very short period of time， and change the virtual simulation scene in real time. Cooperate with a perspective camera and combine model coordinate changes to present different display effects， giving people a sense of realism and achieving realistic 3D interactive behavior.**\n\n【60】**Simulation system 3D effects**\n\n【61】**The Saxon Bowl Physics Experiment System is a software based on the B-S mode \\[16\\]， and its main interface is shown in Figure 4. By selecting the \"Experiment Introduction\"， \"Experiment Principle\"， or \"Start Experiment\" buttons， you can jump to the corresponding interface. The user can complete the experiment preview and operation in the measurement and simulation process display area of the four major parameters of mass， radius， density， and time， and fill in the experimental measurement data in a table to save during COVID-19 pandemic (Figure 4).**\n\n【62】**Conclusion**\n\n【63】**Aiming at the problem that the existing domestic physical experiment simulation software iss two-dimensional and lacks**\n\n【64】**three-dimensional simulation software， this article takes the classic fluid mechanics experiment - Saxon bowl sinking experiment as an example， develops a fluid mechanics experiment simulation system based on Three.js， introduces 3D technology to achieve three-dimensional simulation effects， breaks through the limitations of two-dimensional software planarity， and greatly increases the interest and observability of the experiment. In the future， it provides effective methods and ideas for developing other physical experiment simulation software during COVID-19 pandemic.**\n\n【65】**Acknowledgment**\n\n【66】**This work was supported by the Philosophical and Social Sciences Research Project of Hubei Education Department (19Y049)， and the Staring Research Foundation for the Ph.D. of Hubei University of Technology (BSQD2019054)， Hubei Province， China.**\n\n【67】**References**\n\n【68】1\\.

Once diagnosed， the splenic aneurysms should be treated properly. The majority of patients receive interventional therapy， which is difficult to preserve the spleen. We presented a case of splenic aneurysm resection and splenic artery anastomosis performed completely by laparoscopic surgery. The operation went smoothly with the spleen successfully preserved. The patient reported no discomfort or complications after the surgery. A review of intensive CT at 3 months post-operation revealed a normal spleen size and shape as well as patent blood flow at the anastomosis. Laparoscopic surgery have the advantage of exploring the entire abdominal cavity， clearly observing the situation around the aneurysm， and peeling the tumour from the splenic artery for ligation without damaging the spleen； however， laparoscopic surgery requires a skilful laparoscopic technique.**\n\n【14】**Keywords： Splenic aneurysm； Laparoscopy； Splenic aneurysm resection； Splenic artery reconstruction**\n\n【15】**Introduction**\n\n【16】**The patient， a 37-year-old man， was admitted to the hospital with a left adrenal adenoma discovered by a health examination 6 weeks prior and a splenic aneurysm demonstrated by a Computed Tomography (CT) scan at the same time. He had a history of hypertension for 18 years， withthehighestbloodpressurereaching180/120mmHg(1mmHg=0.133kPa).After administration of controlled-release nifedipine tablets， the blood pressure was stabilized at 140/90 mmHg. He was diagnosed with diabetes for 3 years without systematic treatment， and the blood glucose level varied in the range of 8 mmol/L to 10 mmol/L. Physical examination： General condition with no obvious abnormalities of the heart， lungs or abdomen； bilateral kidneys were not palpated； and no sacral pain in the kidney areas， no bulges in the suprapubic bladder area， and no abnormalities in the external genitalia. Preoperative contrast-enhanced urinary MRI (Figure 1)： There was a left adrenal nodule with a size of 2.3 cmx 1.9 cm， T1WI low signal intensity， in-phase/anti-phase decreased signal intensity，T2WI slightly high signal intensity， and DWI high signal intensity. The post-contrast arterial phase image showed significant enhancement， and the delay phase showed circular enhancement， considered as sebaceous adenoma； local nodular enlargement of the splenic artery near the inside of the spleen was identified， approximately 1.9 cm x1.4 cm in size. The plain scan indicated a flow-shadow signal， and the post-contrast image showed a prominent highlight signal， similar to the splenic artery signal， considered a splenic aneurysm. Preoperative blood tests， blood biochemical tests， and cardiopulmonary function examinations were performed routinely. No obvious abnormalities were reported with a normal level of adrenalin. After the patient was admitted to the hospital， a Multidisciplinary Team (MDT) discussion was organized by the urinary department， interventional department， vascular surgery department， imaging department， and anesthesia department after patient admission. Based on the patient's medical history and auxiliary examination results， the diagnosis of left adrenal adenoma and splenic aneurysm was confirmed， with indications for surgery. Given that the splenic aneurysm was a benign lesion and was on the same side as the left adrenal tumor， a decision was made to perform a surgical operation at the same time， and a spleen-preserving surgical scheme was adopted.**\n\n【17】**Materials and Methods**\n\n【18】**A 3D laparoscopic resection of the left adrenal tumour and splenic aneurysm + splenic artery anastomosis was performed under general anesthesia. The patient took a right 70° inclined supine**\n\n【19】**Figure 1： Preoperative post-contrast MR indicated that the left adrenal adenoma was adjacent to the splenic aneurysm (red arrow： Adrenal adenoma； yellow arrow： Splenic aneurysm).**\n\n【20】**Figure 2： Resection and anastomosis reconstruction of the splenic artery during surgery.

(D) Completion of the anastomosis (red arrow； proximal part of the splenic aneurysm； green arrow： distal part of the splenic aneurysm； yellow arrow； body of the splenic aneurysm).**\n\n【21】**position. Laparoscopic trocar position： 2 cm above the umbilicus for the 12 mm trocar， which was the lens hole； 5 mm and 12 mm trocars were placed as the main knife operation holes below the inferior costal margin of the midline of the left clavicle and at the midpoint of the umbilical and anterior superior iliac spine lines； and a 10 mm trocar was placed on the plane of the axillary midline as an auxiliary hole for the assistant， and the position was diamond-shaped with the other three holes. During the operation， the left adrenal tumor was observed in the lateral branch， was approximately2.5 cm in size， and was slightly adhered to the surrounding tissue. During progressive adenoma resection， no significant fluctuation in blood pressure was observed. Subsequently， the splenic artery was discovered near the renal hilum on the inside of the spleen， combined with preoperative CT positioning. The assistant provoked the spleen through the auxiliary hole. The splenic aneurysm was located 4 cm near the spleen， and the tumour was approximately 2.0 cm in size with obvious vascular fluctuations. The splenic aneurysm and its distal and proximal 2 cm normal splenic arteries were completely separated， and the proximal and distal ends of the splenic artery were blocked with vascular blocking clips. The aneurysm sacs became soft. Incise the tumour wall， the normal splenic artery boundaries were identified under direct vision， and the aneurysm was completely removed with scissors. The normal splenic artery wall was anatomized with 5-0vessel lines， and the vessel cavity was flushed with heparin saline to prevent thrombosis. After the anastomosis， the vascular blocking clip**\n\n【22】**was released， and the splenic artery was filled well without bleeding(Figure 2). The operation time was 2 h and 10 min， the arterial occlusion time was 25 min， and the intraoperative blood loss was 50ml.**\n\n【23】**Results**\n\n【24】**Postoperative pathological examination showed \\[1\\] macroscopic observation (Figure 3)： Adrenal glands and surrounding fat， nodular masses within the adrenal gland， approximately 2.3 cm×2.0cm×1.5cm in size； a section of blood vessel， 2.0 cm in length and 0.5 cm in diameter， with a tumour-like bulge on the vessel wall， approximately1.7 cm x0.5 cm x 0.5 cm in size \\[2\\]. The tumor cell cytoplasm was mostly transparent with no mitotic images or local protrusion of the capsule observed. There was no necrosis or vascular invasion， which was consistent with the adrenal adenoma； the local blood vessel wall budged locally， considering the gross morphology， which was consistent with the aneurysm. The patient reported no discomfort， no complications， and a normal body temperature. He resumed walking and eating on the first postoperative day and was discharged on the fourth postoperative day. The treatment cost was no more than30，000 Yuan. A review of intensive CT at 3 months post-operation revealed patent blood flow at the anastomosis and a normal spleen size and shape (Figure 4).**\n\n【25】**Discussion**\n\n【26】**In August 2019， a case of splenic aneurysm resection with splenic artery anastomosis and reconstruction was completed under laparoscopy in the urology department of our hospital. The spleen was preserved， and the operation was a success. After a literature**\n\n【27】**Figure 3： Resected splenic aneurysm.**\n\n【28】**Figures 4： Postoperative contrast-enhanced CT at 3 months post-operation indicating successful reconstruction of the splenic artery， with good filling and normal flow.**\n\n【29】**search， we confirmed it as the first case worldwide. We report the case as above.**\n\n【30】**Splenic artery aneurysms are the third most prevalent type of visceral aneurysms， only after abdominal aortic aneurysms and iliac aneurysms. The female： male incidence of splenic artery aneurysms is approximately 4：11. In recent years， the incidence of splenic aneurysms has increased substantially， with asymptomatic splenic aneurysms mostly discovered on health examination. However， symptomatic aneurysms are more life-threatening， among which hemorrhagic shock caused by the sudden rupture of the splenic artery is most common and most severe， especially for pregnant patients， with a mortality rate reaching as high as 70% \\[2\\]. Once a splenic aneurysm is diagnosed， it should be treated promptly. Indications for the surgical treatment of splenic aneurysms include (1) acute rupture or threaten of rupture； (2) a tumor larger than 2 cm in diameter or a progressive increase in tumor volume (reviewed every 2 months)；(3) intentioned pregnancy or has been pregnant； (4) the diameter is less than 2 cm with a good general condition， while the patient requires treatment； (5) the tumor compresses adjacent anatomical structures， causing pathophysiological changes and resulting in symptoms； and(6) portal hypertension and regional portal hypertension \\[3\\].**\n\n【31】**It was the France surgeon Beaussier who first reported splenic aneurysms in 1770 and performed the first open splenic aneurysm resection worldwide \\[4\\]. Originally， splenic aneurysms were mostly treated by surgery. Because surgery corrects the hemodynamic abnormality caused by splenic aneurysms and avoids furthertortuous and enlarged consequences， it has a relatively good long-term effect. Although traditional surgery can completely remove the lesion and achieve anastomosis under direct vision， reducing the risk of splenectomy due to the secluded position of the spleen artery and the complex surroundings such as the pancreas， stomach， colon， and adrenal glands， the incision has to be large enough for better exposure， which often leads to problems such as large trauma， a high incidence of complications， and slow recovery after surgery.**\n\n【32】**With the advancement of science and technology， most splenic aneurysms can currently be treated effectively with interventional embolism. Although interventional surgery is less invasive and the patient recovers quickly， this technique also has certain defects. (1) Patients undergoing embolization will suffer from different degrees of embolism syndrome， such as low fever， abdominal pain， lower back pain， and gastrointestinal symptoms. (2) Whether simple tumor lumen coil embolization or stent covering is performed， there is a possibility of insufficient blood supply to the spleen. In severe cases， this technique may even cause a large-scale acute spleen infarction， spleen abscess and major bleeding. (3) Potential aneurysm neck expansion and postoperative endoleak can lead to stent displacement， followed by failure of vascular lumen isolation and continuous pressure on the tumor wall to increase the risk of rupture. (4) If the spring coil fails to fulfill the tumor cavity during the operation， blood will enter the tumor cavity constantly， and the effect of complete isolation can hardly be achieved. (5) For patients with stent implantation， the risk of stent displacement and stent stenosis cannot be ignored， so the long-term application of aspirin and clopidogrel for antiplatelet therapy is essential， which results in higher costs， increased risk of bleeding and reduced quality oflife \\[5\\].**\n\n【33】**Duringthe last two decades， laparoscopic surgery has gradually become a mature minimally invasive surgical approach， demonstrating advantages such as limited trauma， reduced pain， fast**\n\n【34】**postoperative recovery， few complications， and short hospitalization. Compared with traditional open surgery， it can more clearly and intuitively display the tissue relationship around the aneurysm， with a higher degree of refinement. However， there are few reports on the laparoscopic treatment of splenic aneurysms， which is mainly due to the higher requirements ofthelaparoscopic technique and experience of the surgeon. In 1997， Kawasaik et al. \\[6\\] reported the first case of successful laparoscopic aneurysm repair \\[6\\]. Under laparoscopy， a flake intestinal clamp was placed on the base of the splenic aneurysm， and an endovascular stapler was used for repair. The nails were arranged parallel to the longitudinal axis of the splenic artery without tumor incision， as a result of which the cystic cavity was completely separated from the splenic artery. This case was the first domestic and foreign 3D laparoscopic splenic aneurysm resection and splenic artery reconstruction reported. The treatment was precisely the same as that of open surgery， which removed the lesion integrally under the premise of blocking the normal distal splenic artery and then anatomized and reconstructed the splenic arteries under laparoscopy to restore the integrity of the vascular cavity. Finally， the vascular blocking clip was released， and the patency of anastomotic blood flow was assessed directly. Compared with the method reported by Kawasaik， the treatment in this case had more accurate anastomosis of blood vessels under direct vision while avoiding the retention of metal foreign bodies and reducing the cost of surgery. This surgical method is safe and reliable， with the advantages of limited trauma and rapid postoperative recovery， but it has certain challenges. The requirements for the laparoscopic vascular anastomosis technique and the surgical experience of the operator are relatively high， so it should be carried out prudently.**\n\n【35】**Acknowledgement**\n\n【36】**Professor Nianzeng Xing contributed to the conception and design of the study， as well as final approval of the version to be submitted.

One of the most easily quantifiable and consequently high profile issues has been the impact on surgical waiting lists. Efforts to ameliorate the impact on the throughput of the worst prognosis cancer patients were often at the expense of elective cases and the resulting increase in waiting times and numbers is dramatic reaching record levels in many cases. The emergence of Omicron， the latest SARS-CoV-2 variant has again stressed the NHS with further elective surgery cancellations anticipated \\[1\\]. We examined the elective HPB surgery cancellations during the 4 “surges’ to identify the underlying causes. A single centre， retrospective analysis of booked cases in Leicester General Hospital was carried out for five， three month intervals， corresponding to the pre-pandemic period， and the 4 surges. There was an 84.6% increase in the number of HPB elective surgery cancellations during the 15' wave (March to May 2020) when compared with the period preceding the COVID outbreak (October to December 2019). There were less cancellations during the 2nd(October to December 2020) and 3rd waves (May to July 2021) with a 21.1% increase and 15.4%decrease compared with the pre-COVID period respectively. Notably however the most recent 44Omicron wave (November to January 2021) again saw a marked increase again to first wave levels of 76.9% (Figure 1， 2). When stratified by the reason for cancellation， the largest contributing factor during the 1 wave was hospital infrastructure related issues (44 of the total 96 cancellations). This is consistent with findings at other centers across the UK during the same period， with hospitals unable to cope with the unprecedented demands \\[2\\]. In contrast， during the 4h surge the principal issue was the lack of crucial staff both numerically and of the appropriate skill-mix consistent with large number of NHS staff being infected with the highly transmissible new variant or in self-isolation \\[3\\]. Pandemic the 2n and 3 waves of the pandemic saw a return to cancellation rates similar to pre-levels. Possibly due to strategies implemented by the hospital to mitigate COVID infections during elective surgery intending to restore throughput albeit still at a reduced rate compared with the pre-pandemic period \\[4\\]. Also evident in the 1and 4 waves were cancellations by patients， possibly reflecting their reluctance to attend hospitals due to strict lockdown measures during the first wave and the highly infective nature of the omicron strain during the 4 wave. This study demonstrates the effect of the COVID pandemic on elective surgery in an HPB surgical unit. It also demonstrates that Omicron， although less severe than previous variants has had a similar**\n\n【15】**Figure 1： HPB elective surgery cancellations during the COVID pandemic surges.**\n\n【16】**impact due to its increased transmissibility and effect on staff as well as patients. The consensus among the scientific community is that we should expect the emergence of further variants， the impact of which will be determined by their virulence and transmissibility \\[5\\]. This scenario mandates solutions and policies to prevent waiting lists spiraling out of control and cancer care deteriorating.**\n\n【17】**References**\n\n【18】1\\. Collaborative CO.

India is a country of diverse culture and dynamic life-style which shows variations from one geographical location to another. Evidence suggests that 70% to 90% of cancers in India are related to lifestyle and can be easily prevented by adapting healthier life styles. Thus， this review aimed to examine risk factors of lifestyle cancers in different geographical locations in India. Three electronic databases， namely Psych INFO，JSTOR and Medline were systematically screened from December， 2017 to February，2018 for literatures on cancer and lifestyle risk factors. The search was limited to India， adults and papers written in English. 2，301 articles were identified and 10 were reviewed. Smoking and tobacco consumption were strongly related with lung， gastric and oral cancers in South and West India. Additionally， in West India， tea consumption was identified as a contributory factor for esophageal cancer while consumption of cabbage and sprout were found to lower the risk of colorectal cancer. In North India， attributions to esophageal cancer were snuff， smoking， salty tea， hookah， sundried foods and red chilli. A number of risk factors were unique to the different geographical locations in India. Awareness of these risk factors would help in strengthening preventive interventions which would facilitate a decline in cancer incidence in India and other countries where similar risk factors are prevalent. This review proposes to organize tailor-made awareness programs reflecting resonance to socio-cultural practice of people to reduce cancer incidence. Also， facilitation of tobacco and smoking cessation programs and strengthening of policies are strongly recommended to strengthen preventive interventions and reduce cancer incidence.**\n\n【12】**Keywords： Lifestyle； Cancer； Risk factor； Dietary patterns； India； Tobacco； Smoking**\n\n【13】**Introduction**\n\n【14】**Cancer is a lifestyle disease which is grouped according to the location of the cancerous stem cells. The World Health Organization defined cancer as “a generic term used for a large group of diseases that are characterized by the growth of abnormal cells beyond their usual boundaries and can invade to adjoining parts of the body) \\[1\\]. Cancer is reported to be the second leading cause of death globally which accounted for 8.8 million deaths in 2015 \\[2\\]. The burden of diseases is doubled in the developing countries in that both non-communicable diseases and communicable diseases contribute largely to morbidity and mortality， and India seems to fall in this category where the burden of non-communicable diseases and communicable diseases are 63% and 37%， respectively \\[3\\]. The WHO Cancer Country profile revealed that 19.1% of premature deaths from NCDs (3，022，150) in 2016 resulted from cancer \\[4\\]. In addition， WHO cancer country profile， also revealed an increase in cancer mortalities from 683，800 deaths in 2014 to 784，821 deaths in 2018which implies the increasing trend in cancer mortalities in India \\[4，5\\]. Anand et al. \\[6\\] opined that only 5% to 10% of all cancer cases can be attributed to genetic defects， while the remaining 90%to 95% have their roots in the environment and lifestyle which includes cigarette smoking， diet， tobacco consumption， alcohol consumption， sun exposure， environmental pollutants， infections， stress， obesity， and physical inactivity.**\n\n【15】**In India alone， about 800，000 new cases of cancer are estimated to occur every year with stark variation across region where the age-adjusted incidence rates in men vary from 44 per 100，000 in rural Maharashtra to 121 per 100，000 in Delhi \\[7\\]. The major cancers in men are mostly tobacco-related namely lung， oral cavity， larynx， esophagus， and pharynx. In women， the leading cancers sites include are cervix， breast， and ovary cancer and those related to tobacco namely oral cavity，**\n\n【16】**esophagus， and lung \\[7\\]. India has the largest number of oral cancers in the world， due to the widespread habit of chewing tobacco \\[8\\]. Also， India is a nation with wide diversity in food habits and cultural practices， some of which are also found in other countries of the world. The prevalence of lifestyle cancers in India therefore gives a reason to critically examine the risk factors associated with these cancers for the management of lifestyle cancer incidence in India and the world at large.**\n\n【17】**Methodology**\n\n【18】**Literature selection criteria**\n\n【19】**A computerized search for literature was conducted using electronic databases namely Medline through Pubmed， Psych Info and JSTOR. The broad search term used for this review was cancer’which was combined with keywords prevalence’， fepidemiology， burden， qualityoflife， health care services，using AND'as Boolean operator. Each combination was carried out individually to get maximum results. In addition， MeSH term for cancer i.e. ‘neoplasm’was also used for each combination to cover maximum results. All search results were limited to studies with humans and published in English language. To retrieve more recent literature， a timeline of 10years was traced for database search but in case of JSTOR， timeline of only last five years was retrieved owing to huge nature of JSTOR.**\n\n【20】**Since lifestyle behavior is mainly formed in adult life， thus present review focuses on cancers among adults leaving children out of the scope of selection procedure. Thus， inclusion criteria for identifying the studies for this review included：**\n\n【21】**_1\\._ Research papers only， review papers or conceptual articles were excluded**\n\n【22】**_2\\._ Cancer as main disease， cancer as co-morbidity was excluded**\n\n【23】**_3\\._ Cancer among adults， studies with children were excluded**\n\n【24】**_4\\._ India as nationality and residency，studies with non-Indians and migrant Indians were excluded.**\n\n【25】**Data extraction process**\n\n【26】**Identification of studies for this review involved four stages. At the first stage， a total of 2，301 studies were retrieved from three databases using above keywords， out of which 1，402 were irrelevant to present review since these were pharmacological studies， molecular studies， genetic studies or studies conducted outside India. In addition， 167duplicates were manually removed by the titles resulting in 732studies to be screened by abstract.**\n\n【27】**At the second stage， 732 papers were screened with abstract reading， out of these 617 studied either children or elderly subjects， focused cancer as comorbidity， conducted with non-Indians or migrated Indians. This resulted in 115 studies after abstract screening to be reviewed for full text availability.**\n\n【28】**At the third stage， all the selected 115 studies were searched for full text availability but only 82 studies were available in full text to download excluding 33 studies from the scope of this review. Further， another 67 studies were removed because they combined children and adult population， focused on lesions， or were review papers which were not clear from abstract reading. Another 5 duplicate studies that were previously omitted were manually removed at full text reading resulting in 10 studies eligible for this review. The selection procedure of eligible studies is presented in Figure 1. Step 1**\n\n【29】**& 2 was first conducted by DK which was then reviewed by TB&AK Step 3& 4 were conducted by DK and TB together.**\n\n【30】**Data from selected 10 studies were extracted using a self developed data extraction form (Table 1) which presented information like year of study， location， age group， duration of study， study setting， objectives， study design， sample size， sampling strategy， analysis procedure and results to facilitate transparency in data analysis. DK extracted data from selected studies. TB and AK then assessed a 30% sample of randomly selected studies to check accuracy and ensure rigor in data extraction process. We differed at few instances in methodology and findings sections of the reviewed studies but consensus was arrived after discussion.**\n\n【31】**Results**\n\n【32】**On the basis of geographical location ofthe research， the selected studies were grouped into three categories：**\n\n【33】**_1\\._ South India (three studies)**\n\n【34】**_2\\._ West India (four studies)**\n\n【35】**_3\\._ North India (three studies)**\n\n【36】**We could not find any study from eastern part of India using our search strategy.**\n\n【37】**Studies from South India**\n\n【38】**One study from South India reported the clinical profile and epidemiological trends of lung cancer with an emphasis on smoking practices \\[9\\]. The data was collected from a sample of 258 lung cancer patients (200 males， 58 females) from January 2003 to December2007. The age range of the participants in this study was 26 to 77years. The study reported 60.5% participants were ever-smokers while only 39.5% were never smokers. Among the smokers， 71.8%smoked cigarette while 28.2% smoked bidi. A significant correlation(P=0.0028) was found between advanced age at presentation (>60years) and those with a history of smoking.**\n\n【39】**Jayalekshmi et al. \\[10\\] reported a cohort study conducted in Kerala on the risk of gastric cancer in relation to tobacco and alcohol consumption. A baseline survey was conducted on every resident of Karunagappally taluk covering 65，553 participants (30 to 84 years) for socio-demographic and other lifestyle-related factors from January 1990 to December， 1997. The face-to-face interview survey was conducted with the help of trained field investigators for each resident using a 6-page， standardized questionnaire which was constructed with specific questions to elicit factors such as household socioeconomic status， religion， education， income， and occupation along with lifestyle factors such as smoking and drinking habits， and dietary practices \\[10\\]. The study reported that Bidi smoking was associated with Gastric Cancer (GC) risk (P=0.042). The Relative Risks (RR) comparing current versus never smokers was 1.6 (95% CI：1.0-2.5). Gastric cancer risk was associated with the number of bidis smoked daily (P=0.012) and duration of bidi smoking (P=0.036). Those who started smoking bidi at younger ages were at an elevated GC risk. The RRs for those that started bidi smoking under the age of 18 and ages 18 to 22 were 2.0 (95% CI： 1.0-3.9) and 1.8(95% CI：1.1-2.9)， respectively， when their risks were compared with lifetime non-smokers of bidis.**\n\n【40】**Mahapatra et al. \\[11\\] also examined the association between oral cancer risks and consumption of tobacco， cigarette and other oral dip products from March 2013 to July 2013 with 402 participants**\n\n| **Table 1： Summary of reviewed studies.**  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **First AuthorandYear**  | **Objective(S)**  | **Design**  | **Sample and Samplingstrategy**  | **Analysis procedures**  | **Main finding s**  | **ReviewerRemarks**  |\n| **Krishnamurthy et al.\\[9\\]，2012， South India(Chennai**  | **To analyze the clinical profileand the epidemiologicaltrends in lung cancer** **patients with an emphasis onthe smoking practices from asingle tertiary care center**  | **5-Year Retrospective-prospective study on 258lung cancer patients (200males， 58 females) aged26-77 years in a tertiaryhealth setting in Chennai.**  | **Retrospective analysis ofprospectively collected dataof consecutive hospitalin-patients with a provendiagnosis of lung cancer at atertiary care oncology centre.**  | **SPSS software (Version18\\]was used.**  | **60.5% were smokers while** **39.5% were non-smokers.Smokers were cigarette(71.8%) and bidi (28.2%)smokers.**  | **Single facilitystudy which maynot represent thegeneral populationSample sizedetermination wasnot reported.**  |\n| **Krishnamurthy et al.\\[9\\]，2012， South India(Chennai**  |  |  |  |  | **Acenocarcinoma was most** **prevalent among non-smokers(52.7%)and squamous cellcarcinoma among smokers(80.4%).**  | **Study includedsurvival rate of thesample.**  |\n| **Krishnamurthy et al.\\[9\\]，2012， South India(Chennai**  |  |  |  |  | **Signiticant correlation ofsmokers presented atadvanced age (>60 years\\] withsquamous histology comparedto adenocarcinoma histology** **(P=0.00281.**  | **Structured abstract**  |\n| **Ganesh，et al. \\[101，2009， West India(Mumbai)**  | **Evaluating the associationof some life-style factors，dietary items on risk ofesophageal cancer.**  | **3-year hospital-based Casecontrol study on 2，070participants (442cancercases， 1628 controls\\]aged30-75 years in Mumbai.Cancer site is esophagus.Questionnaire andinterview was used for datacollection**  | **Interview of patients at Out-patient department of thehospital prior to diagnosis，recorc of information intopre-designed questionnaire，segregation of subjects into'cancer cases and 'controls.**  | **Univariate analysis andUnconditional logisticregression was appliedusing SPSS Version15.0 software**  | **lobacco+ pan chewers have1(C.3 times excess risk (OR=1.3.**  | **Unstructuredabstract.**  |\n| **Ganesh，et al. \\[101，2009， West India(Mumbai)**  |  |  |  |  | **Smoking bidi increased therisk 1.8 times (OR=1.8\\]andsmokingfr cigarettes increasedthe risk (OR=2)2-fold.

The study reported that the risk of oral cancer is associated with smoking， smokeless， oral dip products， gutkha and other tobacco products. They also reported a preponderance of males (82.8%) over females (17.2%). Majority of the cases consumed gutkha (35.8%)， 14.9% consumed supari， 20.1%chewed tobacco， 17.4% consumed betel quid， 9.7% used snuff， and70% consumed alcohol daily. They further reported the odds of oral cancer in cases that consumed gutka， supari， tobacco， betel quid， bidi and alcohol to be 4.8，6.5，7.3， 3.2， 6.9， 2.1 times higher than those that do not consume these products respectively. Conversely， there was no association between mishiri， betel quid， smoking cigarettes and the risk of oral cancer.**\n\n【46】**Studies from West India**\n\n【47】**Ganesh et al. \\[12，13\\] conducted two 3-year long studies (1989 to1992) in Mumbai on esophageal cancer (N=2，070； 442 cases， 1，628controls) and colorectal cancer patients (N=1831； 203 cases， 1，628controls). They studied the risk of demographic， dietary habits and lifestyle factors through interview in an out-patient department. These examined tobacco， alcohol， unhealthy diet and tea drinking as risk factors of esophageal cancer and colorectal cancer in Mumbai. They reported a moderate 1.3 times excess risk for chewers of pan(betel-leaf) with tobacco， 1.8-fold excess risk each for bidi smokers and alcohol drinkers， 2-fold for cigarette smokers， and tea drinking showed a 4-fold excess risk for esophageal cancer. Both studies also reported a dose-response relationship among pan with tobacco chewers and an increased risk with time duration. Similarly， bidi and cigarette smoking showed a positive dose-response relationship where the risks increased to 2.4 and 2.5 folds respectively. Some significant findings emerged regarding the dietary habits and colorectal cancer. Cabbage-eaters had a 50% reduction in risk among both the genders， compared to those who did not eat cabbage. Sprout**\n\n【48】**eaters also had a 30% to 50% reduction in risk. There was an enhanced1.4-fold risk among ‘dry-fish'eaters compared to non-eaters. Among women， meat-eaters had a 2.4-fold excess risk than non-meat-eaters. Dark-green-leafy-vegetables did not show any protective effect for colorectal cancer \\[12，13\\].**\n\n【49】**Madani et al.\\[14\\]，between February， 2005 and September， 2006examined the risks of oral cancers with consumption of tobacco， cigarette and other oral dip products in Pune. A matched case-control sample (N=700； 350 controls， 350 cases) was studied using a self-reported questionnaire tracking information on consumption of tobacco， poly-ingredient oral dip products， alcohol， dietary habits and demographic status. A great risk of oral cancer in tobacco chewers and oral dipping consumers was reported. Three Smoking categories (filtered， non- filtered cigarette and bidi) were prevalent in cases and all the oral dip products {chewing tobacco， mishiri， gutkha， and supari} except betel quid， (P=0.112)， and panparag(P=0.621)， showed significant difference in cases. The study reported an increased risk amongst bidi smokers but no significant effect of betel quid and filtered cigarette on oral cancer risk \\[14\\].**\n\n【50】**Balasubramanian et al. \\[15\\] reported the risk factors for Non-Hodgkin lymphoma in Mumbai (1997 to 1999) with male subjects only (N=1，773； 390 cases， 1，383 controls) through a pre-designed questionnaire \\[15\\]. The study examined the significance of alcohol， tobacco， dietary items and occupational exposure to non-Hodgkin lymphoma risk. The findings suggested that， among the dietary items， only consumption of mutton showed 7.0-fold significant excess risk for non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Consumption of milk showed a 6-fold excess risk (OR=1.5)； while coffee showed a 50% reduction risk for non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Among occupational factors， exposure to pesticides showed 3-fold excess risk for non-Hodgkin lymphoma.**\n\n【51】**Studies from North India**\n\n【52】**In North India， Sehgal et al. \\[16\\] reported the risk factors of Esophageal Cancer (OC) in Jammu (N=400； 200 cases， 200 controls). Samples were selected from patients who attended the Endoscopy Unit of Government Medical College from October 2007 to July2011. Patients below the age of 80 years and being diagnosed with squamous cell carcinomas of the esophagus were the cases while patients diagnosed with other diseases were the controls. Data on age， gender， educational level， and socio-economic status， family history of OC (first-degree relatives)， clinic pathological symptoms and dietary habits were collected using a short-structured questionnaire. The study examined risk factors and survival rate of OC and revealed that among dietary characteristics， snuff was highest (OR=3.86，95%) followed by salt tea (OR=2.53， 95%)， smoking (OR=1.97，95%)， sundried food (OR=1.77， 95%) and red chilly (OR=1.76，95%). The probability of survival also lowered significantly among those consuming tobacco in the form of snuff and smoking as compared to those who did not take these \\[16\\].**\n\n【53】**Also， Khan et al. \\[17\\] conducted a study at a tertiary care**\n\n【54】**institution in Kashmir from January to December， 2008 with a sample of 100 diagnosed patients of esophageal cancer (cases) and100 healthy individuals (controls). A predesigned questionnaire covering personal， occupational， dietary and family history was administered. A preponderance of male cases over females was reported and majority of the cases were farmers (37%) and house-wives (29%) belonging to the low-socioeconomic status. It was further reported that， 91.7% of the cases were hookah smokers(major mode of smoking in Kashmir)， 78.8% smoked more than 20 g of tobacco per day， and 24% consumed five cups of salty tea per day. Sun-dried vegetable called Haakh was consumed by both cases and controls. With respect to fruit consumption， 45% cases consumed monthly， 40% consumed weekly while none consumed fruits daily. Consumption of meat on a monthly， weekly and daily basis was69%/15%/14% and 44%/42%/14% in controls and cases respectively. None of the groups chewed tobacco or consumed alcohol\\[17\\].**\n\n【55】**The third study is a matched hospital-based case control study(February 2008 to October 2009) conducted on the role of lifestyle and dietary factors in Gallbladder Cancer (GBC) in the Northern part**\n\n【56】**Figure 2： Risk factors for cancer presented on India map.**\n\n【57】**of India \\[18\\]. The study was conducted at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences， New Delhi with a sample size of 244 individuals from Delhi， Uttar Pradesh， Bihar， Uttarkhand， Rajasthan， Punjab， Orissa and Jharkhand. Cases (122) were newly registered confirmed primary GBC patients while controls (122) were healthy relatives of patients. Data were collected using a semi-structured interview schedule. The study revealed that illiteracy， low socioeconomic status， high parity (more than three)； early pregnancy and use of non-liquefied petroleum gas are associated with the risk of gall bladder cancer. They further reported that there was no significant relationship between alcohol consumption， tobacco consumption， education and age at menarche. Vitamin C intake was also reported to have a protective effect \\[18\\]. Geographical distribution of risk factors has been presented on India map in supplementary file (Figure 2).**\n\n【58】**Discussion**\n\n【59】**This systematic review appraised the risk factors for cancer in India. The studies were location-specific with none covering India as a whole. In addition to the commonly known risk factors like smoking， alcohol and tobacco consumption， dietary patterns and life style factors were also identified to pose risk to certain cancers. However， a variation was seen depending upon geographicallocation and different cancer sites.**\n\n【60】**Smoking**\n\n【61】**Smoking has been identified as the predominant cause of lung cancer， esophageal， oral and gastric cancer across the world having increased risk with longer duration andhigh quantity of consumption\\[9\\]. Earlier studies have reported a higher risk with bidi smoking in**\n\n【62】**comparison with cigarette \\[19-21\\]. High prevalence of lung cancer in Chennai was attributed to smoking (bidi and cigarette) especially among males， and the significant correlation found between advanced age at presentation (>60 years) and those with a history of smoking suggests high risk of cancer among advanced age smokers in comparison to young age \\[9\\]. Hookah smoking was quite popular in Kashmir region particularly among farmers. Smoking was also an established risk factor for esophageal cancer \\[22-25\\]. In Pune， bidi smoking was identified as a significant risk to oral cancer while betel quid and filtered cigarette were not. Bidi smoking was observed to be more prevalent than cigarette； this could be attributed to the cheap cost thereby implicating its affordability by the low socioeconomic status \\[14\\].**\n\n【63】**In Kerala， higher frequency and increased duration of bidi smoking heightened the risk of cancer and significant differences were observed for gastric cancer incidence among the low socioeconomic class. These differences could be associated to their dietary patterns， although it was not reported in the reviewed study \\[10\\]**\n\n【64】**Cigarette smoking and bidi smoking were reported to be associated with Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL) in Mumbai while alcohol consumption was not， although riskwas enhanced in drinkers by 50% compared to non-drinkers \\[15\\].**\n\n【65】**Passive smokers**\n\n【66】**Previous studies have established the association between smoking and lung cancer； nevertheless， there has been a rising trend in the occurrence of lung cancer in non-smokers as well especially among females. This could be attributed to second-hand smoking，**\n\n【67】**whereby they were exposed to passive smoking from their spouses while they worked closely on the farm and other indoor air pollutants\\[3，26，27\\]. This has also been reported as a contributory factor predisposing women to the risk of esophageal cancer in addition to the use of cow dung， wood and coal for cooking in Kashmir \\[17，28\\].**\n\n【68】**Tobacco consumption**\n\n【69】**Consumption of tobacco has been reported in various forms， such as， cigarette， hukka， bidi and snuff in the Jammu region \\[9\\]. In addition to previously established association of cigarette， hukka and bidi with esophageal cancer， snuff intake has also been correlated with esophageal cancer because of the presence of tobacco carcinogens in moist snuff \\[291.**\n\n【70】**Over half of all tobacco consumed in India is smoked as bidi(Indian specific non-filtered cigarette) and about one-fourth of tobacco consumption is in smokeless form， such as chewing tobacco and mishiri \\[30\\]. A great risk for oral cancer was found in the habit of tobacco chewing， with or without lime， which is kept in the mouth for different durations depending on personal habits. In an investigation that compared smokers with smokeless tobacco and oral dipping products users， both were at increased risk of oral cancer \\[14\\]. This could be due to the direct contact of these products with the oral epithelium of the users.**\n\n【71】**India has the largest number oforal cancer diagnosis in the world， due to the widespread habit of chewing tobacco \\[8\\]. Oral cancer is strongly attributed to consumption of gutkha， tobacco chewing， consumption of supari and consumption of mishiri. Areca nut， the seed of the fruit of the oriental palm Areca catechu， is commonly used in India to prepare paan or betel quid， pan masala and gutkha. Chewing of pure areca nut has been associated with the risk of oral cancer because of its ability to promote carcinogenesis \\[31\\]. Gutkha contains areca nut， slaked lime， catechu， condiments， and powered tobacco. Gutkha can be highly addictive when compared to chewing ordinary tobacco as it has been previously shown to be a gateway to smoking \\[32\\].**\n\n【72】**When compared with non- consumers， Gutkha consumers were5.1 times more at risk of oral cancer， supari consumers were 11.4times more at risk，tobacco chewers were 6.0 times more at risk， betel quid consumers were 6.4times more at risk and bidi smokers were 2.3times more at risk of oral cancer while Betel quid had no significant effect in causing oral cancer \\[11，14\\].**\n\n【73】**This could infer a protective effect of betel leaf (the main ingredient of betel quid) to the oral mucosa against the harmful alkaloids in areca nut. Betel leaf is known to be rich in beta-carotene which has the capacity to quench free radical \\[2\\].**\n\n【74】**In contrast， another study opined that chewing tobacco with paan (betel leaf) is more harmful in causing esophageal cancer than chewing tobacco only. It was speculated that while chewing tobacco with betel leaf， the juice comes in contact with the esophagus mucosa as opposed to tobacco juice alone which may be spat out without a direct contact with the esophagus mucosa \\[13\\].**\n\n【75】**Alcohol consumption**\n\n【76】**Although oral cancer risk was not reported to be associated with cigarette smoking and mishiri consumption but alcohol was reported to be associated with a high risk of oral cancer \\[11\\]. In Kerala， Alcohol consumed was limited to arrack because it was the commonly consumed among the study population. Majority of the cases were**\n\n【77】**educated only until primary level and this could have an influence on their heightened alcohol consumption. Future researches are therefore recommended to establish the association of gastric cancer with other alcoholic drinks alcohol drinking was not reported in Kashmir； this could be due to the prevalence of Muslims in the region\\[33\\].**\n\n【78】**Dietary pattern**\n\n**Tea is a common beverage in India. Salted tea has been reported as a dietary factor which is strongly associated with esophageal cancer\\[31\\]. The tea is prepared by brewing green tea leaves with sodium chloride to obtain a reddish brown extract after which water， salt and milk are added to it. Consumption of bicarbonate-containing hot salted tea， commonly consumed by Kashmiri people， has been identified as dietary high-risk factor associated with the development of esophageal carcinogenesis. This type of tea is commonly consumed at a high temperature due to the harsh weather that is prevalent in the region. The hyperthermic effect of this tea could be injurious to the esophageal mucosa \\[34\\]. This correlates with an earlier study that reported a relationship between tea drinking and stomach cancer in Kashmir 33|.**\n\n【80】**Also， the risk of esophageal cancer due to tea drinking was reported in Mumbai as a result of the high temperature of the tea consumed， which could be injurious to the esophageal lining， although the actual temperature that causes injury is not known\\[13\\]. In contrast， another investigation reported tea drinking to show less risk and coffee drinking showed a 50% reduction in risk when compared to non-drinkers \\[15\\]. Coffee has been reported to protect from cancer through the activity of its anti-carcinogenic constituents\\[35\\].**\n\n【81】**In Kashmir region， the diet commonly consumed are cooked rice， green-leafy vegetable called haakh and salted tea. These have limited source of protective factor from esophageal cancer， as compared to the consumption of different varieties of fruits and vegetables， which are rich in the presence of vitamins and carotene that induces anti-oxidant effects \\[36\\]. Increased intake of vitamin C was reported to be a protective factor against Gall Bladder Cancer， this is supported by an earlier hypothesis posing vitamin C to be an antioxidant which prevents the formation of carcinogen from precursor compounds， although there is no strong evidence for this \\[37\\]. Also， dietary factors revealed red meat consumption to be a high risk factor for the incidence of NHL； this has also been confirmed by earlier studies\\[38\\]. However， high consumption of vegetables reduced the risk of NHL but they did not emerge as a protective factor \\[15\\]. Fresh fish on the other hand was reported to be a protective factor， this finding is similar to a study reported on risks of esophageal cancers in Mumbai\\[13，39\\]. Animal studies have shown that fat from fish contains 20% to25% saturated fatty acids， and fish and fish oil are a rich source of n-3fatty acids and the fat-soluble vitamins A and D， and these n-3 fatty acids have anti-inflammatory effects \\[40\\].**\n\n【82】**Meat consumption was found to be a risk factor among the women in the population which could be as a result of their small sample size when compared to the males (females =59， males =144). Further research should be conducted on a larger population in order to establish the association between meat consumption and colorectal cancer in females. Among the vegetarian diets， only cabbage and sprout consumption were reported to be protective factors while dark green leafy vegetables， root vegetables and other vegetables were not shown to reduce the risk of colorectal cancer. The anti-carcinogenic**\n\n【83】**actions of cruciferous vegetables are commonly attributed to them because theycontain glucosinolates \\[41\\]. Sprouts contain antioxidants which may be the reason for its protective factor.**\n\n【84】**Food preservation**\n\n【85】**Owing to unavailability of vegetables， nomadic lifestyle and harsh weather， sun-drying is a common strategy used to preserve food in Jammu and Kashmir. This method facilitates the growth of mould， fungi and the presence of trace levels of several volatile and non-volatile N-nitroso compounds which have been strongly implicated with esophageal cancer \\[31，42，43\\].**\n\n【86】**Furthermore， the risk of colorectal cancer in Mumbai was associated with consumption of dry fish. This is speculated to be due to the fact that the dry fish is salted， dried and preserved for later use thereby exposing it to harmful microorganisms \\[12\\].**\n\n【87】**Occupational exposure and socioeconomic factors**\n\n【88】**Occupational exposure was reported as a contributory factor to the risk of esophageal cancer in Kashmir where farmers are likely exposed to hazardous chemicals and biological farming that are suspected carcinogens \\[17\\]. Although， the relationship between farming and risk of esophageal cancer was reported， other occupations were not included， therefore studies that include other occupations are strongly recommended. Also， poor socio-economic status posed to be a major risk factor predisposing the population to esophageal cancer in Kashmir. The absence of dietary nutrients， specifically vitamins A， E，Candtrace elements like zinc and selenium in meals， as observed in poor people increases the chances of cancer44，45.**\n\n【89】**In North India， the risk factors associated with Gall Bladder Cancer (GBC) were low education， three or more parity (childbirth)， early pregnancy and exposure to non-liquefied petroleum gas \\[18\\]. Early pregnancy and multiple pregnancies will elevate the levels of progesterone and estrogen which may change the lithogenicity of bile and increase the risk of GBC \\[46\\]. Non-liquefied petroleum gas does not burn completely therefore producing carbon monoxide， poly-organic and poly-aromatic hydrocarbons and other gases that could be carcinogenic thereby causing harm to women who use them to cook \\[21\\]. The role of traditional non-liquefied petroleum gas fuel in the incidence of GBC has not been well established， therefore future research is recommended in this area.**\n\n【90】**India being a country with a wide variation in food habits and cultural practices infers the possibility of similar lifestyle risk factors in other nations of the world. Consumption of hot tea and smoking are common habits in cold regions where people want to stay warm in the cold seasons. Also， there is a high rate of alcohol and tobacco consumption in many developed and developing countries inferring a high risk ofcancer incidence. In addition， meat is a highly consumed non-vegetarian diet in various countries in the world while vegetables are still less consumed in many countries causing poor nutrient intake in the population. These lifestyle risk factors， though are revealed from studies in India have the potential to draw inferences to other countries which have similar life-style.**\n\n【91】**Major gaps and recommendations**\n\n【92】**Hospital based surveys might not present the actual prevalence of cancer in the regions， therefore large population-based research is required to reveal the lifestyle risk factors of various cancers in the country for policy based interventions**\n\n【93】**Also， occupational exposure history especially exposure to chemicals， poisonous gases， and other occupational hazards needs to be studied with large samples in order to examine the suggesting relationship with cancer. In addition， physical activity which is also a risk factor for lifestyle cancers was not included in any of the reviewed studies.**\n\n【94】**We therefore recommend future research focusing on physical activity and its association with risk of cancers. In addition， we recommend that future research should examine the evidence of these contributory factors in the risk of cancers in India. Also， we recommend the need for quality research in other parts of India， in order to provide a wider perspective to the lifestyle factors that is contributing to the rising burden of lifestyle cancers in India.**\n\n【95】**Conclusion**\n\n【96】**In conclusion， this systematic review reveals that lifestyle cancers have a high incidence in India and this could be associated with the prevalence of risk factors like tobacco consumption， alcohol consumption， and dietary patterns of which tobacco consumption， a common habit in India is foremost. Lung cancer， gastric cancer， oral cancer， colorectal cancer， esophageal cancer， Gall bladder cancer and non-Hodgkin'slymphoma were identified as main cancers attributing to life style factors. Though life style factors like smoking， tobacco consumption， and other oral dip products were common factors in north， south and west India， few risk factors like consumption of salty tea， hookah，sundried foods and red chilly were unique to North India. Cabbage sprouts and Vitamin C rich foods were identified to have protective properties. Consumption of high temperature tea poses a risk of esophageal cancer while coffee has protective tendencies. Also， the consumption of various fruits and vegetables that are rich in vitamins and carotene have anti-oxidant effects which reduce the risk of lifestyle cancers. Among non-vegetarian diets， fresh fish is a protective factor while the risk associated with meat consumption is not yet established. However， the exposure of dry fish to harmful micro-organisms during preservation makes it a threat to the body. Amongst females， cooking methods such as the use of non-liquefied petroleum gas， cow dung， coal and wood and also exposure to passive smoking， high parity， and early pregnancy also emerged as risk factors for life style cancers. Contributory factors like occupational exposure， low education， and low socio-economic status have also been identified with these cancers. There is variation in the incidence of risk factors in different regions due to the diversity of lifestyle patterns in India， a reflection of what exists in the globe. This review therefore implies the need for better and more effective awareness programs which focuses not only on widely known risk factors but also those that are yet to be established. Also，establishment of tobacco and smoking cessation programs at various levels and enactment of policies to strengthen preventive measures are strongly recommended to achieve a decline in the burden of lifestyle cancers.**\n\n【97】**Limitations of the Study**\n\n【98】**Due to time constraint， the reviewer could not explore other databases like CINAHL which could have added to the available studies in the reviewed area. In addition， only published data that was available online was used by the reviewer leaving grey literature out of scope of this review.**\n\n【99】**What is known about the Topic**\n\n【100】**of Tobacco and Alcohol are highly associated with lifestyle cancers.**\n\n【101】**In India， 70% to 90% of cancers can be associated to lifestyle and can be easily prevented by adapting healthier lifestyles.**\n\n【102】**India has the highest number of oral cancer cases in the world due to the common habit of chewing tobacco in the country.**\n\n【103】**What the Paper Adds**\n\n【104】**In addition to the consumption of Tobacco and Alcohol which is generally associated to lifestyle cancer， dietary pattern consumption ofhookah， salty tea， poor food preservation，occupation hazards andpoor socio-economic status were also associated with the incidence oflifestyle cancers in India and were specific to North India.**\n\n【105】**Diversity of lifestyle patterns were noted in the different geographical locations in the country and therefore informed variation in the incidence of risk factors of lifestyle cancers in India**\n\n【106】**Esophageal，gastric，colorectal，oral， Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma，lung and Gall bladder cancers have been associated with lifestyle risk factors in India.**\n\n【107】**References**\n\n【108】1\\.

A review of cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19 especially among Health Care Workers(HCW) is thus required.**\n\n【12】**Aims： The aim of our current study was to provide a comprehensive review of cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19 among HCW through six case reports and a literature review.**\n\n【13】**Methods： We conducted a literature search for cases reports， original and review articles using PubMed and the Google search engines.**\n\n【14】**We included the written in English studies that mentioned cutaneous symptoms during COVID-19infection. In addition to the review， 6 cases were collected among the HCW working at the Charles Nicolle Hospital of Tunis from September 2020 to January 2021.**\n\n【15】**Results： In our review， we included 17 articles in addition to our six cases. The type of papers was case series and case report in respectively 8 and 9 studies. Skin manifestations were reported in two studies including two HCW， in addition to our series of six HCW. Skin manifestations were：Chilblain like lesions (44.5%)， a generalized macular or maculopapular exanthem (32.1%)， a papulovesicular rash and chicken pox-like vesicles (11.5%)， painful acral red-purple papules (4.6%)， urticaria (2.8%)， purpuric or petechial lesions (2.3%) and livedo reticularis lesions (0.45%). Of the218 cases， 203 cases have reported the location of lesions. The very great majority of lesions were found on the trunk， hands and feet. Fifty-one patient (23.4%) experienced lesions on the trunk. The time of onset of cutaneous lesions was variable. At the diagnosis or the onset of COVID-19symptoms，8.3%(18/218) ofpatients presented with cutaneous lesions. After the onset ofrespiratory symptoms or COVID-19 diagnosis，36.7%(80/218) of patients presented with cutaneous lesions. Of the 197 cases with reported healing times， healing times were up to 24 days.**\n\n【16】**Conclusion： COVID-19 has been associated with different cutaneous manifestations， likely of varying pathophysiology and severity， some preceding COVID-19 symptomatology and others occurring during active disease or later in the course. Thus， heightened awareness and timely recognition of cutaneous manifestations in COVID-19 are important for occupational physicians treating HCW with COVID-19.**\n\n【17】**Keywords： Cutaneous manifestations； Healthcare workers； COVID-19**\n\n【18】**Introduction**\n\n【19】**COVID-19 infection initially reported in Wuhan， China \\[1\\] has been spread all over the world. As of July 7uh， 2021， COVID-19 has been diagnosed in more than 184 million people worldwide\\[2\\]. Its rapid spread across geographical borders leading to a pandemic can be explained by several factors such as the high rate of infectivity and transmission from asymptomatic persons \\[3\\]. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the COVID-19 outbreak as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. COVID-19 pandemic still represents a great challenge for Healthcare Workers (HCW) around the world \\[4\\].**\n\n【20】**Healthcare workers are first-line fighters against COVID-19. They may experience symptoms ranging from influenza-like illness to life-threatening respiratory distress \\[5\\]. Apart from pulmonary involvement， it is interesting to note that multiple extra pulmonary manifestations have been reported in patients with COVID-19 including skin manifestations. Common clinical features**\n\n【21】**of COVID-19 are increasingly known but cutaneous manifestations associated with this infection are rarely described. A review of cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19 especially among Health Care Workers (HCW) is thus required.**\n\n【22】**The aim of our current study was to provide a comprehensive review of cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19 among HCW through six case reports and a literature review.**\n\n【23】**Methods**\n\n【24】**We conducted a literature search for cases reports， original and review articles published from the beginning of the COVID-19pandemic until January 2021 using PubMed and the Google search engines. In our study， we used these key search words \"cutaneous\"“skin\"， and1 \"dermatology\" in combination with \"coronavirus\"，\"COVID-19\"and\"SARS-CoV-2\". A manual search of reference lists of some relevant articles was performed. We excluded the studies that did not mention skin lesions.**\n\n【25】**We extracted the socio-demographic and clinical data from the included studies. Socio-demographic data were mainly the number of cases， age， gender and status for COVID-19. The clinical data were mainly the description of the cutaneous lesions， its location， onset and healing time and associated signs. The occupation was extracted from these studies when mentioned. In addition to the review， 6 cases were collected among the HCW working at the Charles Nicolle Hospital of Tunis from September 2020 to January 2021.**\n\n【26】**Results**\n\n【27】**Case presentation**\n\n【28】**Case 1： A 45-year-old nurse with a history of spontaneous pneumothorax， with no previous medication， or previous adverse drug reactions， presented to the occupational medicine department with a fever， a productive cough， asthenia， and body ache with no suspicious contact of COVID-19. The COVID-19 infection was confirmed by a positive RT-PCR on November 05h， 2020. Anosmia， headaches， and dizziness occurred between day 2 and day 13 of the infection. The patient was treated with antibiotics based on azithromycin and a third-generation cephalosporin， combined with vitamins and preventive heparin therapy. The clinical course was marked by the appearance at day 10 of an erythematous and pruritic cutaneous rash on the trunk and limbs with buccal ulcers without fever or signs of hemorrhages of the mucous membranes (Figure 1). Clinical improvement ofthe rash was noted after taking corticosteroid injections for 5 days. The nurse returned to work after 25 days of the**\n\n【29】**Figure 1： Cutaneous rush on day 10 of COVID-19 infection.**\n\n【30】**Figure 2： Erythematous and pruritic herpetiform rash one month after COVID-19 infection.**\n\n【31】**infection with a dry sequela cough.**\n\n【32】**Case 2： A 44-year-old physiotherapist with a history of high blood pressure， paracetamol-drugged hepatitis， and an operated thyroid nodule， tested positive to COVID-19 on October 7ih， 2020with symptoms of ageusia， anosmia， and fever. She was treated with vitamin therapy and antibiotics based on azithromycin. Diarrhea and dizziness appeared respectively at day 2 and day 6 of the clinical evolution. She returned to work on October 20\"h with only hyposmia. One month later， on November 25h， the patient reconsulted for an erythematous and pruritic herpetiform rash on the limbs and the abdomen without fever or other associated signs nor medication use (Figure 2). A progressive and spontaneous improvement of the cutaneous lesions appeared after one week.**\n\n【33】**Case 3： A 57-year-old midwife with a history of hypertension was tested COVID-19 positive on September 25h， 2020， a sample indicated for body aches， asthenia and headaches with a suspicious contact. She was treated with vitamin therapy for 10 days， combined with azithromycin for 06 days. She received preventive heparin**\n\n【34】**Figure 3： Necrotizing neutrophilic leukocytoclastic vasculitis on day13 of COVID-19 infection.**\n\n【35】**therapy for 4 days. On day 13 of the infection， the patient reported cutaneous lesions.**\n\n【36】**These lesions were objectified at the return-to-work medical examination. There was none necrotic purpura (1 cm to 2 cm) on the legs and lower back， with no mucous lesions or fever. There were recurrent attacks that spontaneously resolved after 5 to 7 days. The patient was referred for further explorations. Skin biopsy showed a \"necrotizing neutrophilic leukocytoclastic vasculitis\" (Figure 3). Blood tests were normal and immunological tests were requested. The patient was not put under corticoid or immunosuppressive treatment. The clinical evolution was marked by remission of cutaneous manifestations observed about two months after the onset of the disease around December 5h， 2020.**\n\n【37】**Case 4： A 32-year-old neonatology technician with no notable history presented on October the 64， 2020 with fever， cough， shortness of breath and body aches. The nasopharyngeal swab confirmed COVID-19 infection on October 7h. The patient was put under azithromycin for 9 days combined with a third-generation cephalosporin and vitamin therapy. On October the 16h， 10 days after， the patient reported the appearance of cutaneous lesions， which were confirmed at the return-to-work medical examination on October 204. There was a pruritic rash on the lower limbs and the elbows， which improved after five days of antihistaminic treatment(Figure 4).**\n\n【38】**Case 5： A 33-year-old doctor， with no notable antecedents， was tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 on December the 9h， 2020， by a nasopharyngeal swab indicated for suggestive symptomatology of fever with anosmia and contact with a positive case. The clinical evolution was favorable under medical treatment. On December23m， 15 days after the infection， the patient reported a spontaneous cutaneous lesion on the left forearm with no fever， which was objectified at the medical check-up on December 25h. It was a well-limited superficial ecchymotic plaque of 07 cm long on the anterior face of the lower third of the left forearm which has spontaneously**\n\n【39】**Figure 5： Ecchymotic plaque on day 15 of COVID infection.**\n\n【40】**Figure 6： Maculopustular eruption on day 8 of COVID infection.**\n\n【41】**regressed after one week (Figure 5).**\n\n【42】**Case 6： A 50-year-old medical secretary， with no notable antecedents， was tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 on January the 18h， 2021 by a nasopharyngeal swab indicated for suggestive symptomatology of fever， cough， and odynophagia with no suspicious contact with a positive case. The clinical evolution was favorable under medical treatment. On January 23m， 8 days after the onset， the patient presented with spontaneous pruritic maculopustular eruption on the chin， neck and upper chest with lower back pain without fever. Cutaneous lesions have spontaneously regressed after one week(Figure 6).**\n\n【43】**Review of literature： Seventeen articles were selected for this review. There are 8 case series \\[6-13\\]， and 9 case reports \\[14-21\\]. The mean age was 49.8 years \\[22，23\\]. The gender was not reported in 17.9% of cases. In the other cases that mentioned the gender， sex ratio was 1.15.**\n\n【44】**COVID-19 infection was confirmed in 90.8% of cases. Skin manifestations among HCW were reported in two studies including two physicians \\[19，21\\]， in addition to our series of six HCW.**\n\n【45】**Table 1 summarizes the characteristics and cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19 cases published in scientific literature in addition to our case series.**\n\n【46】**Skin manifestations were： Chilblain like lesions (44.5%)， a generalized macular or maculopapular exanthem (32.1%)， a papulovesicular rash and chicken pox-like vesicles (11.5%)， painful acral red-purple papules (4.6%)， urticaria (2.8%)， purpuric or petechial lesions (2.3%) and livedo reticularis lesions (0.45%). Of the 218 cases， 203 cases have reported the location. The very great majority of lesions were found on the trunk， hands and feet. Fifty-one patient (23.4%) experienced lesions on the trunk. The time of onset of cutaneous lesions in relation to the onset of symptoms was variable. At the diagnosis or the onset of COVID-19 symptoms， 8.3%(18/218) of patients presented with cutaneous lesions. After the onset of respiratory symptoms or COVID-19 diagnosis， 36.7% (80/218) of patients presented with cutaneous lesions. The timeline of the appearance of the skin lesions was not mentioned in 55% of cases. Healing times were up to 24 days in 197 cases.**\n\n【47】**The severity of cutaneous lesions was not correlated with COVID-19 severity in 99% of cases. Only two studies by Mahe \\[19\\] and Estebanez \\[21\\] reported on the possible association between skin lesion severity and COVID-19 in 2 patients. Overall， histological findings were not reported. In our series， we have histological findings that may be related to the COVID infection in one patient.**\n\n| **Author.PublicationYear**  | **Region1**  | **Patientswith SkinSigns (n)**  |

frequent as compared to the common clinical features such as shortness ofbreath， cough and grippal syndrome \\[24\\]. In our study， we summarized the characteristics of cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19 cases published in scientific literature in addition to our case series (Table1). We wished to characterize these manifestations， particularly among HCW for further diagnostic and prognostic value because cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19 have been increasingly reported worldwide. Skin manifestations were reported in 8 case reports and 9 case series.**\n\n【52】**In this review， 44.5% (97/218) of patients presented with chilblain-like lesions. In a previous review by Tan et al. \\[25\\]， the most common COVID-19 skin manifestations in the USA and Europe were the chilblain-like lesions. There was only 1 case reported in Asia. Rash containing macules and papules was the second cutaneous manifestation of COVID-19. However， rashes containing macules and papules were not specific to COVID-19， and there were reports of misdiagnosed cases of COVID-19 in patients with rash containing macules and papules \\[20\\].**\n\n【53】**In the study by Recalcati et al. \\[7\\]， 20.4%(18/88) of COVID-19patients had developed skin manifestations. These manifestations were： erythematous rash (77.8%)， urticaria (16.7%) and vesicle formation (5.6%). These findings are nearly similar to our results.**\n\n【54】**Skin manifestations may aid in timely diagnosis of the COVID-19infection even in the asymptomatic cases with no respiratory or common symptoms. We found that at the onset of the infection， 8.3%(18/218) of patients presented with cutaneous lesions.**\n\n【55】**In order to prevent the misdiagnosis of the COVID-19 signs， doctors'awareness of the skin lesions related to COVID-19**\n\n【56】**infection must be raised \\[24\\]. Furthermore， skin lesions may have several outcomes on the professional quality of life of HCW. Having new manifestations of the COVID-19 infection can lead to frequent consultations seeking care and treatment so that frequent absenteeism. Also， HCW may wonder if they could be assisted with compensation of their skin lesions as sequella of the COVID-19occupational disease.**\n\n【57】**Visible skin lesions present on exposed body parts may induce fear， disgust， aversion， or even intolerance \\[23\\]. Furthermore， some people with limited awareness of skin lesions after COVID-19infection believe that the disease still contagious， which mayeventually contribute to the social isolation of persons with skin lesions. HCW with skin lesions may be subject to segregation and stigmatization， especially if the lesions are visible on the face and exposed bodyareas.**\n\n【58】**Polymorphous cutaneous manifestations could reflect diverse interactions with the skin such as direct viral action in infected cells， hypercoagulability and immune system hyperactivity \\[25\\]. The mechanisms of COVID-19 cutaneous lesions are not yet well known. Some studies have linked the cutaneous symptoms to a primary infection of the skin itself. In other theories， skin disturbances are seen as a secondary consequence after the respiratory infection. Suchonwanit et al. reported that the late-onset of lesions may be related mainly to thrombotic vasculopathy and vasculitis \\[26\\]. Moreover， Litaiem et al. reported a case in Tunisia of a 39 year-old female patient diagnosed with COVID-19 infection， and 18 days after hydroxychloroquine (600 mg daily) initiation she developed a cephalocaudal spread of erythematous and pustular plaques. The Acute Generalized Exanthematous Pustulosis (AGEP) was diagnosed. Skin lesions were significantly improving after hydroxychloroquine withdrawal. They hypothesize that pustular eruptions occurring in COVID-19 patients are more likely to support drug-related origin**\n\n【59】**\\[27\\]. Gianotti et al. described the histopathology of skin COVID-19lesions with a spectrum of findings that ranged from mild spongiosis of the epithelial layer to the important situation of vasculitis and extravasation of red blood cells \\[6\\]. The scientific understanding of cutaneous manifestations in patients with COVID-19 is still evolving.**\n\n【60】**We believe that this work is the first study describing cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19 among HCW. However， several limitations must be considered. Due to evolving literature and language-related exclusion criteria， this paper only examines 218cases. The inclusion of our cases was limited because of the low declaration by the patients and the quarantine restrictions. Moreover， publication bias was encountered. Drug side effects not mentioned in most of the studies must be taken into account. Also， occupation was not mentioned in several cases.**\n\n【61】**Further studies are still required to understand the mechanism and the link between skin lesions and COVID-19.So that prospective studies based on clinical and histological confrontations are needed\\[12\\].**\n\n【62】**Conclusion**\n\n【63】**In summary， COVID-19 has been associated with different cutaneous manifestations， likely of varying pathophysiology and severity， some preceding COVID-19 symptomatology and others occurring during active disease or later in the course. Given the evolving state of evidence， occupationalphysicians should be aware of the variety of skin manifestations related to COVID-19among Health care workers. Thus， heightened awareness and timely recognition of dermatologic findings in COVID-19 are important for occupational physicians treating HCW with COVID-19. Further studies are still required to understand the mechanism and the link between skin lesions and COVID-19.

Pharmacologic therapeutic options include tricyclic antidepressants， serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors， and gabapentin as first line treatments followed by weak (e.g.， tramadol) and strong opioids (e.g.， morphine and oxycodone) \\[2\\]. The medication refractory CNP are treated with non-pharmacological treatment including interventional therapies(e.g.， sympathetic nerve/ganglion block， epidural steroid injection， peripheral nerve blockade)， physical therapies (e.g.， Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS))， and psychological therapies (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)) \\[2\\]. Minimally invasive interventional procedures such as sympathetic nerve blockade/neurolysis/neuro-ablation， Transforaminal Epidural Steroid Injection (TFESI)， and Pulsed Radiofrequency (PRF) have been introduced recently for the management of chronic neurological pain including CCNP.**\n\n【17】**We present a rarely performed minimally invasive intervention ofbilateral lumbar sympathetic nerve block at L3 and subsequently ultrasound guided PRF of bilateral sciatic nerves at the popliteal fossa in SCI related CCNP that was refractory to medical and physical therapy.**\n\n【18】**Case Presentation**\n\n【19】**In February 2021， a female (60 to 70 years old) was referred to the Pain Clinic (Toronto， Ontario) for severe， persistent bilateralleg pain after a remote anterior spinal cord infarct 8 years ago. After her SCI she had a full recovery of her motor and sensory function but had severe bilateral burning leg pain diffusely from her hip to toes， covering both volar and dorsal aspect of the limbs. She described her pain as 10/10 constant electrical and burning pain throughout that was worse at night. In addition， her skin was extremely sensitive to touch. The pain disrupted her functional ability to ambulate，perform physical exercise， and sleep. She denied any major weakness， sensory loss， muscle movements， cramps or tremors which were concordant with the findings on physical examination. Her current sensory and motor examination did not show any neurological deficits. She did not have any allodynia on examination， but she did have diffuse hyperalgesia to pin prick in bilateral lower extremities. In the past she had trialed a few analgesics， including gabapentin (30000 mg/d to 32000 mg/d) and duloxetine (60 mg/d) without significant pain relief. The diagnosis of CCNP secondary to SCI likely involving small fiber mediated pain was made. At this time bilateral L3 lumbar sympathetic block under fluoroscopic guidance was performed with each side receiving a total of solution injected (Figure 1).**\n\n【20】**In 3 month follow up the patient reported complete pain relief of0/10 of the proximal limbs from her back to the distal thigh. She still had residual burning pain of the lowerlegs at an intensity of 7/10. She had functional improvements of increased ambulation duration and improved sleep. She was able to reduce her gabapentin dose to 1500mg/d. Physical examination revealed bilateral hyperalgesia to pin prick diffusely over her lower leg and feet. Subsequently， ultrasound guided bilateral sciatic nerve pulsed radiofrequency simulation at the popliteal fossa was performed. Procedure details： 20 g 3.5-inch needle45V 42·C2Hz 10 ms for 2 min bilaterally**\n\n【21】**In 3 month follow up after this procedure she had significant pain relief of her lower legs， with a severity of 4/10 and reduced sensitivity**\n\n【22】**to touch. At this time， approximately 6 months after her bilateral lumbar sympathetic block， her proximal leg pain continued to be tolerable， with a severity of 3/10.**\n\n【23】**Discussion**\n\n【24】**The current findingshighlights that the multimodal and multistage approach， including targeting both the autonomic and somatic pain systems with sympathetic blocks and pulsed radiofrequency in the SCI related CCNP， which has been barely studied， can lead to lasting significant pain reduction.**\n\n【25】**Generally， there is no robust or sufficient evidence to support the efficacy of non-pharmacological treatment in SCI-related CCNP \\[2\\]. Sympathetic nerve or ganglion management (including blockade， neurolysis， or ablation) with medication， neurolytic modalities， and radiofrequency ablation have been used in CNP mainly in PCNP， including pain associated with herpes zoster， post-herpetic neuralgia， diabetic peripheral neuropathy， and complex regional pain syndrome\\[3，4\\]. With SCI-related CCNP， other modalities including spinal cord stimulation， intrathecal medication delivery， deep brain stimulation， and dorsal root entry zone lesion have been commonly investigated in literature. The level of evidence for this has been low and the recommendation for its use is inconclusive \\[4\\]. However， this case report supports the individualized approach can make the seldom-or non-studied interventional options in the SCI-associated CCNP，i.e.， sympathetic nerve block， available and useful.**\n\n【26】**Systematic reviews and meta-analyses have yielded that PRF can lead to decreased pain， improved function， and quality of life， and reduced oral medication use in Post-Herpetic Neuralgia (PHN) \\[5\\]， trigeminal neuralgia \\[6\\]， knee osteoarthritis \\[7\\]， perineal pain after delivery \\[8\\]， while non-effective in radicular pain \\[5\\]. Merely， one case report was found presenting the efficacy of PRF on a refractory complex regional pain syndrome due to sciatic neuropathy with a disabling pain in the unilateral lower leg and foot \\[9\\].**\n\n【27】**The current finding shows that bilateral lumbar sympathetic blockade can reduce SCI-related CCNP within the proximal bilateral lower limbs. Then with the residual bilateral lower leg neuropathic pain， PRF of the sciatic nerve bilaterally was able to reduce the unresolved pain and hyperalgesia.**\n\n【28】**This case spotlight that individualized， multimodal， minimally invasive interventions for CCNP can be safe and effective in achieving high quality ofpain control， and， ultimately， improve patient function and quality of life and earn patient satisfaction. Lumbar sympathetic nerve blockade can be a therapeutic option for spinal cord injury related chronic central neuropathic pain and， subsequently， PRF can be effectively applied primarily to the peripheral nerve system as the second stage of the management of SCI associated central neuropathic pain.**\n\n【29】**StatementofAuthorship**\n\n【30】**SK： Generated idea， collected data， drafted， edited， and critically appraised the manuscript.**\n\n【31】**MP： Collecteddata， edited， and1criticalIlyaappraisedthe manuscript.**\n\n【32】**AS： Generated idea， collected data， drafted， edited， and critically appraised the manuscript.**\n\n【33】**References**\n\n【34】**1\\.

A patient was treated with the simultaneous sinus elevation and dental implant placement for rehabilitation of the maxillary molar， which is adjacent to a natural tooth with intact root canal filling. Four months later，maxillary sinusitis was diagnosed reflected by nasal obstruction and foul-smelling discharge. The mobile implant was removed and replaced by a short implant without sinus elevation surgery. However， repeated symptoms of sinusitis was observed， which immediately healed after the extraction of natural tooth. Then the patient received implant insertion in the region of missing tooth， and no further complications were observed.**\n\n【17】**Conclusion： We proposed that sinus elevation stimulate the colonization of bacteria from the adjacent endodontically treated tooth， which lead to sinusitis and extraction of both implant and natural tooth.**\n\n【18】**Keywords： Peri-implantitis； Sinus floor elevation； Tooth extraction**\n\n【19】**Abbreviations**\n\n【20】**CBCT： Cone Beam Computer Tomography； RBH： Residual Bone Height**\n\n【21】**Introduction**\n\n【22】**Ever since it was first described by Tatum \\[1\\]，and modified later by others， maxillary sinus floor elevation with grafting material has been proven tobea safe and highlypredictabletechnique.Despite its high survival rate achieved with this augmentation technique， complications do occur， such as membrane perforation， postoperative sinusitis， cyst formation， wound dehiscence， sequestration， and loss of bone graft \\[2\\]. As a result of contamination of the maxillary sinus with oral flora \\[3\\]， infectious complication during maxillary sinus-floor elevation procedure was observed in 9 out of200 patients (4.5%) \\[4\\]. Other studies also demonstrated similar rate of infectious complication， which range from 3.5% to 4.3%\\[5，6\\]. Sinusitis is considered as a major complication because there is risk that the infection could spread throughout the graft and the sinus cavity or the adjacent anatomical structures71.**\n\n【23】**Dental implant placements and dental extractions could be the iatrogenic causes for the occurrence of sinusitis. As the most common complication that occurs during sinus floor elevation procedures， perforations of the maxillary sinus membrane may results in direct communication between graft materials and sinus cavity， which can lead to infection and iatrogenic sinusitis. In addition，protruding and migration of dental implant into the maxillary sinus， blockage of air flow due to diminished intra sinus volume， ostium obstruction caused by postoperative swelling of the maxillary mucosa， and even the surgical procedures themselves have been reported to be the possible causes of sinusitis \\[8，9\\].**\n\n【24】**Odontogenic source is the other cause for cases of maxillary sinusitis， which can happen in people with maxillary teeth caries and maxillary dental trauma \\[10，11\\]. This case report presents an implant failure，persistent sinusitis and extraction of natural tooth that are mainly triggered by**\n\n【25】**sinus elevation and the intact root canal filling of natural tooth itself.**\n\n【26】**Case Presentation**\n\n【27】**A 44-vear old woman visited the clinic for reconstruction of the upper left first molar. Cone Beam Computer Tomography (CBCT) examination indicated that the Residual Bone Height (RBH) at the missing tooth region was about 5.13 mm， and no abnormalities of the sinus cavity was observed (Figure 1). The roots of upper left second premolar protrude into sinus cavity. Patients reported that the premolar received endodontic treatment that then received a post-core and porcelain-fused-to-metal crown several years ago.**\n\n【28】**The minimally-invasive transcrestal sinus augmentation was performed using xenogenic graft (Bio-Oss， Geistlich Pharma)； the vertical distance from sinus membrane to the alveolar crest was about12 mm after the sinus elevation. Simultaneously， the implant (Osstem Implant Co.， Busan， Korea， with 5 mm in diameter and 10 mm in length) was inserted with a good primary stability. However， four months later， the patient complained pain in the implant region， and nasal symptoms including nasal obstruction and discharge. Implant mobility was evident by intraoral observations. Thickening of sinus mucosa and large periapical radio lucency involving both the apical regions of the second premolar and dental implant were observed on CBCT images (Figure 2). Maxillary sinusitis was diagnosed by otorhinolaryngologist. We removed the mobile implant (Figure 3)， performed lavages with sterile saline， and prescribed antibiotics. The symptom of nasal obstruction and discharge relieved along with the healing， with favorable evolution.**\n\n【29】**Six months later， only occasional nasal obstruction was reported by the patient， and no significant abnormalities were observed in the sinus based on CBCT examination. Progress appears to be satisfactory， so re-implantation treatment phase was initiated. We inserted a new implant with 5 mm in diameter and 8.5 mm in length(9 mm height of RBH at implant region was observed by CBCT measurement) without the surgery of sinus elevation (Figure 4). Then the patient was prescribed antibiotics for 3 days.**\n\n【30】**There was no pain or symptom of inflammation around the implant region during the healing process. Implant osseointegration was observed through radiographic examination three months postoperatively， and then the implant was restored by a full porcelain crown. Surprisingly， the patient returned complaining aggravated nasal obstruction and foul-smelling nasal discharge in one month. Objectively， thickened maxillary membrane and periapical radio lucency around the second premolar were observed on CBCT images. The patient received antibiotic therapy with amoxicillin and clavulanic acid for 1 week， but the symptom of sinusitis didn't show any improvement. We proposed that the sinusitis might be caused by the apical infection from the second premolar， which was then extracted. As it to be expected，the pain and nasal discharge subsided immediately after the tooth extraction.**\n\n【31】**The patient was clinically evaluated 1 month and 3 months after tooth extraction， absence of nasal obstruction and discharge was recorded. The post-surgery CBCT at 6 months showed complete resolution of maxillary sinusitis and 1mm thickness of sinus membrane. Then the implant (Bicon， America， 5 mm in diameter， and 8 mm in length) was inserted into the second premolar region(Figure 5). No further complications were observed， and the implant was exposed and restored as planned in 4 months (Figure 6). The patient received a follow-up examination every 3 months， and the**\n\n【32】**Figure 1：CBCTindicates 5.13 mm of the Residual Bone Height (RBH) at the missing first upper left molar befare treatment.**\n\n【33】Figure 2： Four months after implant placement surgery， CBCT examination showed significantly thickened sinus membrane and periapical radia lucency involving both the apical regions of the second premolar and dental implant.\n\n【34】**Figure 3： Implant removal was performed four months after placement.**\n\n【35】implant-supported fixed prosthesis has been functioning well for 18months.\n\n【36】**Discussion and Conclusion**\n\n【37】**Simultaneous sinus elevation and dental implant placement for rehabilitation of the maxillary molar was performed in this**\n\n【38】**Figure 4： A new implant with 8.5 mm in length was inserted into region where the implant was removed without the surgery of sinus elevation.**\n\n【39】**Figure 5： The implant was inserted 6 months after the extraction of the second premolar.**\n\n【40】**Figure 6： Crass-sectional image of the restoration of the upper left first molar and the upper left second premolar 4 months after the surgery.**\n\n【41】**case. However， maxillary sinusitis was observed and extraction of both implant and natural tooth was performed several months postoperatively. Although the incidence of sinusitis after sinus elevation is low， infection can have deleterious effects on graft and implant survival \\[9，12\\]. Among the different forms of sinusitis， the odontogenic form is very common， because the roots of premolars**\n\n【42】**and molars are close to the sinus cavity \\[13\\]. In this case， the root tips of the natural teeth (the second premolar) with root canal filling protrude into the sinus cavity. It has been reported that approximately50% of endodontically treated teeth exhibited histologic signs of inflammation without any clinical symptoms \\[14，15\\]. And the residual bacteria in the asymptomatic endodontic treated tooth have the ability to colonize areas of significant tissue damage， which could be the situation adjacent to a newly placed implant\\[16-19\\].**\n\n【43】**In this case， to achieve the transcrestal sinus elevation， the membrane had to be elevated from the sinus floor mesially and distally over the root tips of the adjacent teeth to become tension-free and thus to avoid any perforation of the membrane. So we proposed that the new environment created by sinus elevation may stimulate the colonization of bacteria from the adjacent asymptomatic endodontic treated tooth， result in the odontogenic infections penetrated into the maxillary sinus. Different from acute sinusitis， chronic sinusitis has always a bacterial etiology \\[13\\]. Amoxicill in with clavulanic acid was prescribed to resolve the symptoms， because it has been reported that this treatment reduces the bacterial load and the related mucosal inflammation \\[20\\]. But the sinusitis symptoms didn’t get any improvement by the drug therapy with antibiotics. According to previous reports， it is very important to completely remove the cause of odontogenic sinusitis for a suiccessful outcome\\[21\\]. As we expected， the patient reported an obvious improvement in nasal obstruction and a decrease in nasal discharge immediately after the extraction of the natural tooth. This further confirms that this natural tooth might be the odontogenic cause for sinusitis and implant failure.**\n\n【44】**In conclusion， even an asymptomatic endodontically treated tooth may be harboring chronic infection， which can spread to the apical region of implant through sinus. The elevation of sinus membrane involving both of the implant region and adjacent natural tooth received root canal treatment should be avoided if the roots of the tooth protrude into the sinus cavity. Otherwise， a short implant with minimal sinus elevation with a safe distance to the apical region ofendodontic treated root could be an alternative option.**\n\n【45】**Funding**\n\n【46】**This study was funded by the grant： The National Key Research and Development Program of China (No. 2016YFC1102700).**\n\n【47】**References**\n\n【48】**l.

India’s first peak was in September2020 and then the number decreased. However， India started vaccine diplomacy but did not arrange sufficient vaccine doses for their people. Lack of social distancing， no use of mask， attending social program fuelled the COVID-19 infection. India got one year to improve the health sector but in reality， all are in a dream now. Lack of oxygen support， vaccines， and capacity in hospital beds are now the bottlenecks to tackle the second wave of COVID-19 India.**\n\n【9】**Keywords： COVID-19；India； Second wave； Vaccine； First Wave； Economy**\n\n【10】**Introduction**\n\n【11】**The biggest threat in humankind is now COVID-19， which is of Zoonotic origin and spreads through aerosol transmission of respiratory droplets. It started from the seafood market in Wuhan， Hubei， China back in December 2019，and within 2 months， it spread worldwide and WHO declared it as pandemic \\[1，2\\]. Most common symptoms include dry cough， fever， difficulty of breathing， and tiredness or fatigue \\[3，4\\]. It is estimated that transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is occurring mainly by airborne \\[5\\]. To tackle the issues， several countries went into a lockdown scheme. During this national lockdown， restrictions were imposed on most of the movement， home confinement was mandatory， and exceptions were given only for essential food shopping \\[6\\]. Physical distance， use of mask， hand sanitization， respiratory hygiene， prompt self-isolating， and prompt testing are the so-far worldwide COVID-19 prevention techniques. A recent survey of WHO reveals that globally90% of countries are still struggling to come back to their pre-COVID-19 condition in terms of health services.**\n\n【12】**Now， the world is experiencing a second wave of COVID-19 infection \\[7，8\\]. Often the second wave from infectious diseases occurs after a relative decrease in the number of patients with the disease. The second wave may increase among specific age groups or populations， or in particular areas of each country and become as widespread as the first wave. The first wave of a pandemic is followed some months later by a second or third wave of infection. This can be severe as experienced previously in the influenza pandemics of 1918 (H1H1)， 1957 (H2H2)， 1968 (H3N2)， and 2009(H1N1) \\[9\\]. It may be a question that why there is always a second wave. Probably the answer is， most often， infected people in one region do not develop herd immunity and they are re-exposed again to the infection from people who got infected from the first wave \\[10\\]. After the COVID-19last year， WHO including all research articles， scientists， and researchers， expected that there could be a second wave from COVID-19. The threat arriving from the COVID-19 second wave was already assumed and reported by researchers \\[11，12\\].**\n\n【13】**Some countries， like South Korea and Singapore， got success to flatten the virus spreading by employing comprehensive testing and tracing regimes. Furthermore， UK， France， Italy， Spain managed to flatten the wave by imposing lockdowns. On June 22nd， 2020，South Korea announced the second wave although the number was low \\[13\\]. In this country so far death count was 301 (as of July31，2020).South Korea has conducted 1，295，962 tests since January 3m， 2020， to detect the illness\\[14\\]. On January 23，COVID-19 officially hit Vietnam and by the 8th of September 2020，Vietnam had a second wave \\[15\\]. The first wave commenced in Spain， from mid-March 2020 and continued for 3 months and again the second wave started in mid-September 2020 which stayed until 2020Christmas \\[16\\]. Sweden's COVID-19 cases peaked during the first wave with 102 reported deaths(7-day rolling average) on April 215，2020.On December 20h， 2020， COVID-19 deaths in Sweden had reached more than 8，000 \\[16\\]. The second wave from COVID-19 was theoretically studied for Iran， where model validation and the prediction were performed using data from January 22nd to June 25h， 2020. It was predicted that the second wave would be more severe than the first wave. The most effective way to the improvement of weakly immune people is to employ appropriate medical**\n\n【14】**Figure 1： Total confirmed COVID-19 cases between March 25m and June 1=， 2020.

Modeling studies in the UK suggested that the test-trace-isolate program could reduce the chances of the second wave in the UK， as there is a chance to reopen the school from September. The absence of sufficiently broad test-trace-isolate coverage and reopening of schools can result in reproductive number over 1 and would peak up cases in December 2020， which will be 2 times to 3times the size of the original COVID-19wave \\[18\\]. This has happened in reality and the UK again started lockdown and strict restrictions.**\n\n【17】**Last year one study revealed that India could face a deadly second wave and in present-day India is facing this enormous life-taking wave. Currently， India is facing another wave， or better to say the second wave， and much more in world discussion. In this work， how Indian is dealing with the second wave of COVID-19 and vaccination and other associated issues are discussed.**\n\n【18】**First Wave in India**\n\n【19】**India is the 2nd most populated country in the world after China， and a center of attraction because of its diverse variation. India has 28 states and 8 Union Territories. Its population is more than 1.35 billion， of which 2.75 million are below the poverty line. A significant variation is present in India where the smallest state Sikkim has a population closer to Bhutan and the largest one Uttar Pradesh has a population similar to Brazil. Goa which has the highest**\n\n【20】**GDP per capita can be comparable to Jordan while the poorest state Bihar is similar to that of Haiti \\[19\\]. Thus， state-wide variation is not surprising. The health care system in India is also a mixture of public and private health care systems， available in rural and urban locations. The government unfortunately spends only 1.17% of its GDP on health care \\[20\\]. The overall capacity of private health care is4 times that of the public sector.**\n\n【21】**January 30h， 2020， was the day when the first case of COVID-19was detected in the southern state of India. Within few weeks， COVID-19 spread throughout the country and reached the count of100 by March and close of 1，600 by end of March. Consequently， the first death from this disease also happened in March. To tackle the spread Indian PM announced a nationwide lockdown without any heads up to the citizen. Initially， the lockdown was until April 14h，2020， which later was extended to May 03， 2020，and then June 012020 \\[21\\]. To understand how the lockdown worked in India， the stringency index was performed which showed that at the starting of lockdown the stringency index was 100 whereas， in other countries which also faced serious lockdown， the in dex was not satisfactory and appeared low. On April 12h， 2020， Italy scored a stringency index of93.5， while Belgium and Peru counted 81.48 on March 22n， 2020，and96.30 on May 015，2020. However， India's score fell to near 82 in May2020， which evidently indicates that lockdown which was followed**\n\n【22】**according to the governmental rules at the beginning， did not at the end.**\n\n【23】**As shown in Figure 1， it is apparent that this lockdown did not help India to stop the spread and India experienced its peak in September 2020. Back in September 2020， India faced 90，000 cases every day including 1，200 deaths. Lockdown had limited success and it drastically impacted the Indian GDP， which fell 23.9% than that of the same quarter in 2019. Sharp unemployment was prominent because of the lack of jobs. Industrial Production (IIP) fell by 36%during the 3 months between April and June of 2020 compared to the previous year \\[19\\]. Indian government behavior towards migrant workers was negligent which the world experienced last year. Unnecessary death， due to the impact of COVID-19 lockdown which was not directly related to the COVID-19 occurred， was nearly600 by late May 2020 \\[22\\]. The death of 23 individuals from March12h to April 11h， 2020， was recorded due to suicide. Fear of isolation or domestic violence was the reason behind these tragic incidents\\[23\\]. This noticeably indicates that not only economic issues， social health， and mental issues were also key aspects due to the prolonged lockdown period.**\n\n【24】**The air quality of India is always in bad shape which got an immensely positive impact due to last year’s COVID-19 lockdown. In India， mainly major urban places and cities have poor air quality. Because of the lockdown transport， industries were closed which limited the emission ofharmful gases. Compared with the immediate Pre-Lockdown period (PL3)， the average PM2.5 and PM10 reduced by up to 51% and 47% respectively during the lockdown periods \\[24-26\\].**\n\n【25】**Second Wave in India**\n\n【26】**In mid-September， India had a peak of 93，000 cases per day， which started declining， and the Indian government， policymakers， media； politicians thought In dia is free from COVID-19. Restrictions were less and elections campaigns for five states were announced for186 million people to cast their vote. In January 2021 Indian started its vaccine diplomacy by shipping vaccines to foreign countries. Interestingly last year， a research study from MIT suggested that without proper treatment or vaccination， India can surge up to0.287 million cases by early 2021. India reported more than 100，000new cases on April 04h， 2021，and a new record for the country was observed， a level not seen in its first wave. On April 15h， 2021， new COVID-19 infected cases were 0.2 million in India. On May 4h， COVID-19 cases were more than 20.2 million. The western state of Maharashtra， which has been India’s COVID ground zero from the start of the pandemic， is back at the top after briefly reporting a drop in cases. This state， among India， the richest and home to its financial hub， Mumbai， confirmed more than 66，000 cases last night. It is widely agreed among experts that both cases and deaths are being under-reported in India right now. The Lancet COVID-19commission warned that India could experience recording more than2，300 deaths every day by the first week of June.**\n\n【27】**To understand the COVID-19 cases two factors can be considered： (a) Test Positivity Rate (TPR=total infection/total cases)；(b) Case Fatality Rate (CFR= total deaths/total infections). The Test positivity rate shows whether testing is enough to limit the virus spread by employing quarantine and isolation. According to WHO， TPR below 5% is good which indicates the health care program is working sufficiently. India had over 5% TPR during the first wave and started declining from August 2020. On April 14， 2021，TPR was**\n\n【28】**Table 1： State-wise TPR and CFR in India on April 15m， 2021\\[271.**\n\n| **State**  | **CFR**  | **TPR**  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Maharashtra**  | **1.6**  | **15.7**  |\n| **Nagaland**  | **0.7**  | **8.9**  |\n| **Kerala**  | **0.4**  | **8.5**  |\n| **Chhattisgarh**  | **1.1**  | **7.6**  |\n| **West Bengal**  | **1.7**  | **6.5**  |\n| **Andhra Pradesh**  | **0.8**  | **6**  |\n| **Madhya Pradesh**  | **1.2**  | **5.3**  |\n| **Tripura**  | **1.2**  | **5.1**  |\n| **Rajasthan**  | **0.8**  | **5.1**  |\n\n【30】**5.4%. State-wise TPR also varied. Maharashtra had a very high TPR of15.7% indicating very high transmission. State-wise transmission on April 15h， 2021 is listed in Table 1. As of 11th May India has tested more than 305 M samples. Tests include both， RT-PCR and Rapid Antigen. India’s current test positivity rate (7DMA) is 22%.

Emergency Use Listing (EULs) for COVID-19 vaccine was issued by WHO. On December 31， 2020 Pfizer， on February 15h， 2021， two versions of the AstraZeneca/Oxford， (manufactured by the Serum Institute of India and SKBio)， and on March 12h， 2021， Ad26.COV2.S， (Johnson& Johnson) were EUL listed by WHO. According to WHO， the vaccine should be taken if possible and even if you experienced COVID-19.However， it is too early to predict how these vaccines will work and protect and research is continued. It is still advised to take a vaccine because it will develop immunity inside the human body and will probably reduce the risk of illness development. In general vaccine development goes several stages which include pre-clinical(vaccine development in the lab)， Phase 1 Clinical trial (8 participants to 10 participants； for vaccine testing safety)； Phase 2 clinical trial (50participants to 100 participants； for testing vaccine immunogenicity i.e. production of antibodies against virus)； Phase 3 clinical trial (30k participants to 50k participants； for testing actual protection offered by the vaccine) \\[28\\]. However， this COVID-19's dreadful impact forced to development of a vaccine within a vear compared to other previous diseases \\[29\\]. For example， the development of the polio vaccine took 40 years， 5 years for Ebola， and an average of 15 years for most of the vaccine development \\[30\\]. To understand how vaccines are working properly， efficacy is useful term. Efficacy is a degree of relative lessening in threat. To understand it in bete way； if someone has cloned of him/herself which having one version fully vaccinated and other version is not then the vaccinated one will have 95% less risk to get risk. In reality cloning of human being is not possible hence in the lab randomization is employed \\[31\\]. According to WHO， vaccine will only is allowed in the market if it has at least 50% efficacy and higher is better \\[32\\]. Table 3 lists the vaccines and their efficacy.**\n\n【39】**India targeted to vaccinate 300 million people by August 2021， and by February 8h， 2021， India was able to vaccinate 6 million beneficiaries countrywide \\[40\\]. In India， two different vaccines are available which include Covishield and Covaxin. Covishield vaccine is the same patent technology developed by the AstraZeneca vaccine and manufactured by the Serum Institute of India. According to the Indian Government website， the choice of vaccine is not an option of public， though it will be made available in various parts of India. The first group includes healthcare and frontline workers. The second group to receive the COVID-19 vaccine will be persons over 60 years**\n\n【40】**of age and persons between 45 and 59 years of age with comorbid conditions. Vaccines are mostly liquid products.

Serum institute decided to sell shots at 150 rupees to central， 300 rupees ($4) to state， and the private hospital for 600 rupees ($8). Bharat Biotech decided to charge 150 rupees to central， 400 rupees ($5.50) and private hospital for 1200 rupees ($16) \\[42\\]. European Union paid $2.15 per dose for the AstraZeneca vaccine. According to them， the price reduction is because of the EU's contribution to vaccine development. This high price for Covaxin is shocking as it is made by an Indian company.On the other hand， Covaxin didn't publish yet its phase 3 clinical trial data in a peer-reviewed scientific journal， and has only announced its interim efficacy data-claimed to be around 80% through a press release. Now Sputnik V vaccines got a green signal to be used and at the first phase， 125 million doses will be distributed. Details of the present two vaccines are listed in Table 4 and Table 5， which show the other vaccines that are under process.**\n\n【42】**However， there is still doubt that the vaccination plan will not work properly as the COVID-19 virus is mutating and new variants as listed in Table 6. WHO has been tracking mutations and variants since the start of the COVID-19 outbreak. Currently， there is no agreed international naming system for variants. In India， the active variants are B.1.617 and B.1.1.7.3.2.**\n\n【43】**Current issues in India**\n\n【44】**COVID-19patients with severe conditions suffer from respiratory distress \\[44\\].

However， the director of Inox Air Products， which supplies 50% of the oxygen demands in the country， claims that India has sufficient oxygen to deal with the present condition. India produces more than 7，000 metric tons of liquid oxygen per day. Uneven supply and logistical issues have led to an oxygen crisis in some states. Some other major oxygen manufacturers in India include Indian Linde India， Goyal MG Gases Pvt. Ltd.， National Oxygen Limited \\[47\\]. In India， the health care sector consumes 15% of total produced oxygen while the rest are consumed by industry. During this pandemic， 90% of oxygen is now supplied to the medical sector and still， the situation is critical. The allocated amount for health care service in India is the lowest in the world and India has insufficient doctors， nurses， and beds to tackle an unprecedented COVID-19 situation \\[48\\].**\n\n【51】**To tackle the situation， 64，000 beds were deployed using 4，000railway coaches at various railwaystations. The Indira Gandhi Athletic Stadium， in Guwahati， Delhi's Radha Soami Satsang Beas Campus， Bangalore's Koramangala In door Stadium have been converted to the COVID-19 treatment center.**\n\n【52】**To support India， globally 40 countries agreed to send oxygen support. UK sent equipment， which can generate 500 liters of oxygen per minute \\[49\\]. Singapore sent 7，511 oxygen concentrators， 516BiPAP ventilators. Ireland agreed to send 700 Oxygen concentrators. France decided to send relief in two phases.

Russia， Kuwait has also promised to provide help. Saudi Arabia will send 80 MT of liquid oxygen. 800 Oxygen concentrators from Hong Kong and four cryogenic oxygen containers from Thailand respectively.

For example， Delhi (1 till 19th April 2021and later till May 1，2021)， Maharashtra (till May 15h， 2021)， Uttar Pradesh (till May 44，2021)， Jammu Kashmir (April 30th to May 3r，2021)， Karnataka (from April 27h， 2021， 14 days)， Telangana (May84，2021)， Jharkhand (May 64，2021)， Goa (May 3m， 2021)， Haryana(May 31， 2021)， Gujarat (29 cities till May 54， 2021)； Kerala ( from April 20h，2021)，Bihar (May 15h， 2021)， West Bengal (start from May6，2021) already have imposed such restriction.**\n\n【55】**From May 1India had a plan to start vaccinating the entire adult which could be around 660 million people.However， vaccine shortage is now prominent and only 12 state out of36 states including UT have enough stock to vaccinating over 18s \\[51\\]. Right now in India， three key bottlenecks for the vaccination process are the unavailability of the vaccine， efficacy of the vaccine， and penetration (registration).

When there was a plan to school student’s returning to school， this second wave created and made the plan delayed again. Indian government made announcements regarding promotion of student to the next classes without any examination，based on their assessments， class tests and projects. Additionally， various states cancelled their state board examinations during serious pandemic situation， directly and severely affecting the education system and standards \\[52\\]. It's unclear when situation will be clear again. Because of the closure of education sector， approximately 320 million students have been affected. It can be argued why India didn’t move towards digital education. For 2017-18 years， National Sample Survey office reported that only 23.8% Indians have internet access with 42% in urban and14.9% in rural. According to economic times， during lockdown one in four students in India can’t use the online study because they don’t have laptop or desktop. Thus， in quality and inconsistency of education in digital medium is evident. Even developed country like USA faced challenges to offer equal online education because of the presence of black，Hispanic and low income family student. On other hand， it is also evident that the way students learn in school (offline education)， it is not possible to achieve through online because online education can't replace the interpersonal interactions， essential social skills for holistic growth and development.**\n\n【60】**Discussion**\n\n【61】**Totackle this COVID-19 situation， no medication is available now and no one knows fully how to deal with this. Isolation probably one of the best ways to limit at least the spreading of this virus. Lockdown probably the best way to limit transmission \\[53\\]. According to WHO， to lift the lockdown， proper health system capacities for testing， trace every contact and isolate and treat every case； maintain social distancing at schools and other essential places， workplaces； minimizing importation of new cases from countries or areas that have not yet contained the outbreak； community willingness to continue social distancing wherever possible and community engagement in all measures are required. It is evident that the lockdown for the first wave in India did not stop the spread of COVID-19 and the economy suffered a lot. However， now the COVID-19 Task Force (set up by the government) and the Supreme Court asked the Indian government to impose again nationwide lockdown to break the transmission. Probably from last year’s experience， the Government is trying to use all efforts and keep the lockdown for the last option. However， according to the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy， this localized lockdown already created a job loss which is around 70 lakhs in various states across the country. Though it is not announced，but， from May 2021， 98% of Indians are under some kind of restriction to break the COVID-19 second wave transmission.**\n\n【62】**India is dealing with a huge vaccination program for COVID-19and many people even in rural areas were able to have those doses free of cost. However， it has to be remembered that temperature control is essential for the safety and efficacy of the vaccine. Even unwillingly or due to lack of infrastructure， if vaccines are kept at different temperatures， they will be deadly \\[54，55\\]. The first wave of COVID-19 affected hugely in urban areas and also for the second wave it is evident that hotspots (and the emerging hotspots) are everywhere in urban areas \\[56，57\\]. To have the better result from vaccination it could be the strategy to vaccinate urban areas first and then rural areas or areas where population density is less. However， now there is no scope as COVID-19 second wave also covered the smalltowns and rural areas in India.**\n\n【63】**It is heartbreaking to see that when India facing this tragic pandemic and suffering from the second wave； pharmaceutical companies are charging a price for vaccines. Indian government failed to stockpile vaccine at an early stage while other countries such as the USA， UK， and Israel started this measure in back September2020. India first purchased 15 million doses and later administered over 140 million doses. However， it is not officially revealed how it will be fulfilled. On February 15， India's finance minister announced Rs 35，000 crores ($4.69 billion) for COVID-19 vaccines. Without a free vaccine， India may move towards another economic downtown if lockdown possess again. Increase COVID-19 cases can create a situation again which requires the forced shutdown， closure of industry which will derail the economy again. Economist believes that Indian government could support the free vaccination scheme， which could only take 0.3% of GDP. By simple calculation， it can be shown that 966 million people should be vaccinated twice which indicates the requirement of 1.93 billion doses. If dose cost Rs 150total cost will be Rs 28，980 crores ( close to 0.14%GDP) and if the cost is Rs 400； total cost will be Rs 77，280 crores (close to 0.38%GDP)\\[58\\].**\n\n【64】**It is evident that India's claim ofbeating the epidemic and younger population are free from this disease， immunity has been developed， and overall victory on the COVID-19 is fully hogwash. Currently， administrative arrogance， lack of doses， hyper-nationalism， and population created a grave burning issue \\[59\\]. Probably it can be said that the people of Indian are also equally liable for the occurrence of the second wave. Early letting down the protection (use of mask； sanitization； maintaining social distancing)； started attending weddings and socializing，religious gathering， and no strict restriction norms from government； all added the fuel in this situation. It seems like Indians were in a parallel universe while the rest of the world was experiencing a second wave. As the infection rate waslow， people were not in the mood to take the vaccine. India could slow down the rate by imposing strict vaccination rules， maintaining social distancing， and follow strict COVID-19 restriction measures set by WHO. The government had one-year time to increase the health sector capacity and a complete failure is visible now. People are paying thousands and lakhs of money in the health sector if they are lucky enough to be admitted to hospital. According to the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation， by August 1， India can experience a staggering1 million deaths from COVID-19 \\[60\\]. To avail herd immunity， India should implement safe， effective， and robust vaccination \\[61\\]. Currently population of India is 135 crore. 94.5 crore people must be vaccinated to obtain herd immunity which is only possible if 189crore vaccine doses are available. With India's current vaccination rate，herd immunity is feasible only in 3.5 years.**\n\n【65】**Conclusion**\n\n【66】**The second wave of COVID-19 infection was under the radar from last year still it could not be stopped. India is facing the second wave of COVID-19 infection. In this work， how India dealt with COVID-19 first wave and now suffering from the second wave is documented. National lockdown is still not imposed. Last year lockdown could not limit the COVID-19 transmission but due to the closure of industry India faced serious economic down. Pure medical Oxygen is essential for COVID-19 patients but lack of oxygen created the scenario more complex. Vaccination programs started but the price of vaccination is a serious issue. It will take several weeks to vaccinate a large population. Free vaccination could help the Indian economy as a new national lockdown can create another economic dip. Education sector is now another large sector which suffered significantly. It is still unsure how India will manage to tackle this second wave.**\n\n【67】**References**\n\n【68】**1\\.

The common genetic factor that is associated with T2D is single nucleotide polymorphism. The aim of the present study was to assess the association between rs5219 of the KCNJ11 gene and rs11196205of the TCF7L2 gene with diabetes type 2. Total of 300 samples (150 T2DM patients and 150 non-diabetic controls) together with demographic factors were taken from public and private hospitals of the Southern Punjab. This was a case-control study and contained 150 T2D patients and 150controlled samples. To analyze the polymorphisms in KCNJ11 and TCF7L2， PCR-RFLP and Tetra-arm PCR were used. The findings of this study were that in KCNJ11 gene， homozygous AA genotype was predominant (83.33%) than the GG genotype (14%) and heterozygous genotype GA was present in very a small amount (2.66%) while in case of TCF7L2 gene， CC 28.00%， GG 27.33%and GC 44.67%. The insignificant statistical association was found between rs5219， rs11196205 and T2D as p-value of KCNJ11 (rs5219) is 0.4125 and TCF7L2 (rs11196205) is 0.6. The conclusion of this study is that rs5219 of the KCNJ11 gene and rs11196205 of TCF7L2 gene are not associated with diabetes type 2 in the Southern Punjab population.**\n\n【14】**Keywords： KCNJ11； TCF7L2； PCR-RFLP； Tetra-arm PCR； Insignificant**\n\n【15】**Introduction**\n\n【16】**Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus is a chronic multifactorial disorder described by high blood glucose level (hyperglycemia)， which is due to the resistance of insulin or lower insulin secretion \\[1\\]. Both genetic and environmental factors play a significant role in the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Environmental factors are age， obesity， lack of physical activity， hypertension， diet， and smoking \\[2\\]. International Diabetes Federation reported that in 2017， the number of patients with diabetes was 425 million and this ratio will increase to 629 million in 2045 \\[3\\]. Pakistan is South Asia Country and diabetes and obesity is more common in South Asia. 12，000 deaths are noted every year in Pakistan due to diabetes. Different studies revealed that people in urban areas are more affected by this disease due to lack of physical activity， hypertension， and intake ofhigh-calorie food \\[4\\]. For diabetes， Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) identified different susceptibility genes. Genetic factor is more involved in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus because of Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) \\[5\\]. Different studies found many genes that are associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Among these genes， the potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily J member 11 (KCNJ11) gene and TCF7L2 gene are the main candidate genes for the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus. KCNJ11 gene is situated on the human chromosome at 11p15.1 and consists of one exon with no intronic sequences \\[6\\]. Inward rectifier potassium ion channel (Kir6.2) protein is encoded by this gene. KCNJ11 gene plays a significant role in the secretion of insulin. Kir6.2 protein with Sulfonylurea Receptor 1 (SUR1)， forms K， channel \\[7\\]. In the K channel， when these two proteins are combined then it mediates the secretion of insulin \\[8\\]. When the level of glucose increases then it results in the closing ofthe K， channel and activation of voltage-gated calcium channels. The Channel of K allows the potassium ions entry. The Intracellular level of calcium ion increases when the cell membrane becomes depolarized due to the increased amount of potassium ions and result in insulin secretion \\[9\\]. Insulin production and its secretion are controlled through glucose metabolism by the K， channel. Many KCNJ11 gene SNPs have been identified and among these SNPs， rs5219 has been gaining more consideration for its association with type2 diabetes mellitus \\[10\\]. KCNJ11 gene polymorphism rs5219 is caused when at codon 23， glutamic acid is substituted into lysine amino acid \\[11\\]. In this variation， guanine is changed into adenine. The Sensitivity of the potassium channel is reduced due to this variation and this substitution caused**\n\n【17】**insulin resistance and leads to diabetes mellitus \\[12\\].**\n\n【18】**The genes which are elaborate in the cell multiplication and distinctness are regulated by the Transcription Factor 7-like 2 genes(TCF7L2) \\[13\\]. This gene contains the High Mobility Group (HMG) box and also elaborates in the Wnt signaling channel that plays the principal role in galactose stability and this gene is the master regulator of the proinsulin a nuclear receptor for B-catenin is encoded by this gene that involved in lipid metabolism. Variants of TCF7L2gene increased the risk of T2DM with an impaired insulin secretion showed a strong association \\[14\\]. Wnt wave channel is essential during normal functioning and this function is done by the same receptors in which Frizzled (Fz) and LDL receptor-related proteins are included \\[15\\]. B-catenin is also important for the activation of many genes when it binds to the TCF receptor. In which Glucagon-Like-Peptide-1(GLP-1) is also included in this way the beta-catenin level is increased and also increased the growth of beta cells. When the mutation in the TCF7L2 gene impaired the secretion glucagon-like peptide-1 due to which production of insulin is low and beta-catenin level also reduced， also disturb the beta-cell proliferation \\[16\\].**\n\n【19】**Objectives of this study was to determine the SNP association with body mass index， fasting blood glucose， random blood glucose in controlled and cases subiects. The aim of this study was to determine the correlation between rs5219 of KCNJ11 gene and rs11196205 of TCF7L2 with type 2 diabetes mellitus in the population of Southern Punjab， if any.**\n\n【20】**Materialand Method**\n\n【21】**Study participants**\n\n【22】**A total of 300 were selected for the analysis including 150 cases and 150 controlled subjects from government and private hospitals of the Southern Punjab.**\n\n【23】**Data collection**\n\n【24】**To study the epidemiological factors such as age， gender， body mass index， smoking， and personal medical history， questionnaire was conducted for this purpose.**\n\n【25】**Anthropometric and biochemical evaluation**\n\n【26】**By using a standard protocol， anthropometric measurements such as height， weight， and waist were acquired.

Missense mutation may change the ATP binding region charge and reduce the ATP channel sensitivity. The rs5219 polymorphism is because of the conversion of G to A and in many studies； this polymorphism has been shown a positive association with T2D \\[18\\]. This variation results in resistance to insulin. However， various studies did not show any association between rs5219 polymorphism and T2D \\[19\\]. The results of East Asian population exposed that mutant A allele was more frequent in control as compared to cases \\[20\\]. This polymorphism was associated with T2D in Tunisia population although in Ghanaian population，**\n\n【64】**the mutant A allele was 99.9% predominant so this rs5219 variant did not exhibit any association with T2D \\[21\\]. In this current study， there was majority of AA genotype and mutant allele A in both non-diabetic and diabetic patients thus，rs5219 (E23K)polymorphism was insignificantly associated with T2D. The difference between KCNJ11genotypes in two groups was found statistically insignificant as p value is 0.415. Our results of KCNJ11 gene were similar with other studies such as Iranian， Ghanian and Nigerian population which confirmed the non-significant association of KCNJ11 polymorphism with T2DM. On the other hand， these findings were found to be inconsistent with many studies like Korean and Mexican population. This difference may be due to the diversity of ethnicity， sample size and geographicallocation.**\n\n【65】**Based on the results ofthis study， the high significance of BMI was shown with the polymorphism of the KCNJ11 gene which conforms with the findings of the Euro-Brazilian population \\[22\\].

Allele consisting of lysine in KCNJ11 gene is not responsible for affecting the K， channel activity and thus not related to diabetes. Our research work manifests that transcription factor 7 like 2 rs11196205polymorphisms are not linked along with a risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus.

In addition to autoantibodies， Helicobacter pylori or Hepatitis C may be the cause of ITP. These illnesses are accompanied by co-existing antibodies that may have an impact on the antiphospholipid antibodies， and coexisting immune dysfunctions and molecular mimicry \\[2\\]. Ayurveda， yoga therapy， and nutrition modification can all be used as integral part of an integrated treatment plan for a variety of illnesses.**\n\n【17】**Case Presentation**\n\n【18】**The patient， a 10-year-old girl， was identified having Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura(ITP) in 2019. She was admitted in the hospital due to symptoms that included an unremarkable peripheral smear， a physical exam that only indicated minor signs of bleeding linked to the low platelet count. The doctor suggested repeated hospital stays in addition to typical conventional medical therapy. Romiplostim 500 mcg Sc/once weekly， Pantop 40 mg/daily， Folvite 5 mg once daily， Tab. Tranexamic acid 1 g when bleeding occurs， and Tab. Shelcal 500 were normally administered to the patient as part of the standard care. Till June 16\"， 2023， these said medications were still being used. On the same day， the girl was brought to a clinical set up having the facility of complementary and alternative medicine near Betnoti，Odisha， East India. In addition to having an abnormal differential leukocyte count (Neutrophilic leukocytosis with myeloid left shift， Dc：Myelocyte + metamyelocyte=16%， Stab Segmented=67%，Lymphocytes =15%， Monocytes =02%)， the patient also had a lower platelet count (68，000/mm’of blood) and a higher white blood count(18100/mm’of blood). Additionally， the patients complained of excruciating bodily pain， weakness， and excessive menstrual flow. The patient additionally underwent yoga and ayurvedic therapy in addition to normal medical care. The patient asked to en gage in yoga meditation， Yoga Nidra (longer version of yoga induced relaxation)， and Sukshma Vyayam (subtle light intensity yoga techniques). Two turmeric tablets， two Giloy tablets， one table spoon of Triphala churna (a blend of Emblica _officinalis， Terminalia bellerica， and Terminalia chebula)， and one teaspoon of Chirata powder_ (Swertia chirayita) each day was recommended. Four tablespoons of each of two different plant leaf juices were taken by the patients on an empty stomach. For a week， the following plants were _utilized to make a chart： Syzygium cumini L， Carica papaya， Triticum aestivum， Dalbergia sissoo，_ _Murraya koenigii， Mangifera indica， and Psidium guajava L are some examples of related plants._ Any two-plant leaf that is prepared as leaf juice on a rotating basis. For preparation of leaf juice， healthy young plant leaves were frequently selected and crushed in a stone grinder. Additionally， the patient was told to have a vegetarian diet composed of 50% raw food and50% cooked food. The dish was cooked with Indian indigenous ghee. For detoxification， the patient was instructed to consume one bowl of papaya and one bowl of guava.**\n\n【19】**After undergoing additional treatment for 21 days， the patient significantly improved. The platelet count (342000/mm’ of blood)， hemoglobin concentration， and RBC count increased markedly.Neutrophil by 69.2%， Lymphocytes 25%， Eosinophil 3%，Monocytes 0.5%， Basophils 0.7%were the normal differential leukocyte counts， and the total WBC count (11725/mm’of blood) was reduced to a normal level. The patient reports feeling better， having less physical discomfort， and having fewer blood stains on their skin after receiving the Yoga and Ayurveda treatment module.**\n\n【20】**Discussion**\n\n【21】**In general， yoga practice improved mental stability， happiness， and mental calmness， as well as overall life quality. Moreover， a study reported that pregnant women who practiced yoga for three months had higher platelet counts than the control group \\[3\\]. This is in response to the patient's requesttoincorporate yoga to their treatment regimen. ILP is mostly caused by autoantibodies， and a study found that doing yoga for 8 weeks couldreducethe symptoms ofautoimmune disease \\[4\\]. In addition， the patient was instructed to take several Ayurvedic drug combinations， which were primarily composed of plant extracts. In dengue patients， platelet counts increased by taking extracts of the leaves of the giloy (Tinospora cordifolia) plant \\[5\\]. The herb giloy has an immunomodulatory effect， improves cellular immunity， encourages the formation ofantibodies， and also improves lysosome activity and antibody responses \\[6-8\\]. In a mouse model， a methanolic extract of Syzygium cumini L dramatically increased both the platelet and leukocyte counts \\[9\\]. Moreover， a study with Busulfan-treated mouse models， demonstrated that administering nanocurcumin (curcumin derivatives) could retain bone marrow integrity and enhance the quantity of circulating platelets while the patient is receiving treatment with turmeric tablets \\[10\\]. To boost immunity against autoantibodies and raise platelet count， patient was instructed to take various leaf extracts. The platelet count in dengue patient markedly elevated with the juice of Carica papaya leaves \\[11\\]. Mango leaf was shown to considerably boost RBC count in normal albino rats \\[12\\]. Patients with thrombocytopenia caused by alcohol-induced liver cirrhosis， Carica papaya and Tinospora cordifolia phytoextracts increased platelet count within 15 days and return it to normal within 90 days of treatment \\[6\\]. However， a study reported that giving a patient one tea spoon of Chirata (Swertia chirata) powder dramatically increased the platelet count in healthy rats when given at high doses \\[7\\]. Murraya koenigii is a rich source of phenolic chemicals， alkaloids， flavonoids， and steroids. According to one study， Murraya Koenigii semi-solid plant extract ingestion increased blood count in phenylhydrazine-induced anemic rats \\[13\\]. An excellent source of phenolic acid and flavonoid content is wheat grass (Triticum aestivum) and it was reported in thrombocytopenic rats that wheat grass (Triticum aestivum) considerably lowered bleeding and clotting times and raised platelet counts \\[14\\]. As the patient was advised to consume papaya fruits and leaves，possibly the polyphenolic chemical present in papaya fruit， leaves， and seeds had improved the formation of RBC and platelets \\[15\\]. It was accepted with the fact that the immune system was made more tolerable by a number of plant extracts， which prevented autoimmune diseases. WBC count， cellular immune response， and humoral immune responses were enhanced by Dalbergia Sissoo \\[16\\]. The patient was instructed to consume Triphala powder because it has a positive effect on the immune system. According to a study， Triphala demonstrated immunomodulatory effect by changing neutrophil activities in albino rats， including phagocytosis， adhesion， and NBT reduction \\[17\\]. In a dose-dependent manner， Triphala treatment demonstrated a considerable suppression of complement activity， HMI， CMI， and mitogen-induced T-lymphocyte proliferation. These findings indicated that Thiphala inhibited the experimentally generated inflammation， demonstrating its potency in the management of autoimmune illness and inflammation \\[18\\]. Currently it is very clear with the fact that combining yoga treatment with Ayurveda improved cell-mediated immunity and platelet count in ITP.**\n\n【22】**Conclusion**\n\n【23】**In the patient with Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura(ITP)， the platelet count considerably rises after doing yoga and an ayurvedic module， and the differential leukocyte count returns to normal. Numerous studies demonstrated that the plant extracts used in Ayurveda increased platelet count， while its mechanism of action remains unclear. Yoga also boosts the immunity and enhances the production of blood cell. Precisely we can conclude that Yoga and Ayurveda module improved the quality of life by improving the physicaland mental health. Since there have been very few studies on Ayurveda and Yoga therapy， it is exceedingly challenging to pinpoint the exact mechanism by which the platelet count rises in ITP. Future researches may be carried out to understand its mechanism more appropriately.**\n\n【24】**Acknowledgem ent**\n\n【25】**We sincerely acknowledge Baidaraj Jogendra Achrya for formulating and combining several medicinal plants for the treatment of ITP patients.

From her medical history， we highlight a syndrome of generalized congenital lipodystrophy (Berardinelli-Seip syndrome). This consists of an absence of adipose tissue alongside an alteration in the metabolism of fats and carbohydrates \\[1\\]. The patient presented a long time， velvety pigmentation on the neck and armpits that had been classified as acanthosis nigricans related to her genetic disease (Figure 1). However， on her annual clinical assessment， she complained about the appearance of new asymptomatic， hyperpigmented， confluent skin lesions with reticulated edges. It develops progressively in a couple of months， starting with the pectoral region and upper back (Figure 2). No response to any topical depigmentation was observed.**\n\n【11】**Wood's light examination and direct Potassium Hydroxide (KOH) examination were negative. A biopsy of the cervical region was performed， which revealed epidermal papillomatosis with orthokeratosishyperkeratosiswithout acantholysis， associated withbasal melaninhyperpigmentation(Figure 3). After a treatment with topical retinoids and oral Josamycin 500 mg/24 h for 3 months， the lesions showed an evident improvement.**\n\n【12】**Diagnosis**\n\n【13】**Confluent and Reticulated Papillomatosis (CRP)**\n\n【14】**CRP is a not very well-known dermatosis that usually begins in adolescence. It is more frequent in women and in dark-skinned patients， as in our case. Some theories have been proposed to explain its etiopathogenesis： Genetic or acquired keratinization abnormalities， photosensitivity or underlying endocrine disorders such as obesity， diabetes or thyroid dysfunction. These ones would cause an abnormal-epithelialization related to the excess of certain hormones \\[2\\]. In our patient， due to the genetic lipodystrophy syndrome， we are led to consider the possible relationship with endocrine disorders.**\n\n【15】**In order to make a diagnosis， Lee et al. \\[3\\] defined three main criteria needed， which include：Hyperpigmented plaques in the centre of the chest or back with a reticulated pattern on the edge. Negativity for fungi in the KOH stain or the absence of hypha in the biopsy. Histology showing papillomatosis， hyperkeratosis and acanthosis with hypogranulosis.**\n\n**As a topical treatment， good results have been observed with selenium sulphide， vitamin D derivatives and topical retinoids \\[4\\]. Oral isotretinoin at doses of 1 mg/kg/day to 2 mg/kg/day has also been used with favorable responses \\[3\\]. Oral doxycycline presents a sccess rate of over70% at doses of 100 mg/day and lead， as in our patient， to rapid resolution of the lesions in 1 or 2months (Figure 4). It is believed that its antiproliferative and anti-inflammatory action could play an important role 5|.**\n\n【17】**Acanthosis Nigrans (AN)： It is one of the main differential diagnoses， with a similar histology， but different clinical features. In AN， the lesions are thicker with a velvety hyperpigmentation and are mainly located on the flexures \\[6\\] (Figure 1). The onset- aged is earlier and it is more frequently related to endocrine disorders. On rare occasions， as in our case， both entities can coexist.**\n\n【18】**Pitriasis Versicolor： It is a superficial fungal infection caused by Malassezia yeasts.

This syndrome can lead patients to acute settings. Patients can develop severe emotional distress that can induce stress cardiomyopathy \\[6-8\\]. The pathogenesis is still unknown， but the mediators as catecholamines， histamines and cytokines have a role in coronary artery spasm， microvascular dysfunction， or toxicity (Figure 1)\\[9，10\\].**\n\n【30】**The clinical presentation of patients with stress-induced cardiomyopathy includes chest pain at rest， shortness of breath， pulmonary edema LV dysfunction， cardiac biomarkers elevated，and ECG abnormalities (Figure 2) \\[11-14\\]. The Takotsubo syndrome could mimic Myocardial Infarction (MI). Acute pulmonary embolism could be considered in the differential diagnosis. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) must be excluded by coronary angiography \\[15\\].**\n\n【31】**Moreover， stress-induced cardiomyopathy is most difficult to characterize from myocarditis， but typical myocardial contractility patterns， angiography findings， and rapidly improving clinical conditions can help to distinguish Takotsubo from MI or myocarditis(Figure 3)\\[16\\].**\n\n【32】**However， most of patients with Takotsubo syndrome recover cardiac function within three-six months.**\n\n【33】**Takotsubo reverse is a variant of classic form characterized edema in the mid-basal segments， but the mean age target is lower than classic form. In younger patients， the high density of adrenoreceptors at the base of the heart can explain this cardiomyopathy variant. Reverse Takotsubo is associated with less pulmonary edema， dyspnea， and shock than classic Takotsubo (Figure 4).**\n\n【34】**Cardiac Magnetic Resonance plays an important role in the differential diagnosis between Takotsubo and myocardial infarction or myocarditis and provides more details on right and left ventricular function. The transmural edema corresponds to the akinetic areas in the wall in contrast to MI， in who the edema matches with coronary region.**\n\n【35】**A limitation of this technique for acute settings is its availability**\n\n【36】Figure 4： Delayed Enhanced Short axis (a)， long axis 4 chambers (b) and 3 chambers (c) shows the absence of fibrasis areas or infarction areas.\n\n【37】**and well-trained operators.**\n\n【38】**In this clinical case MRI allowed to achieve a diagnosis in a reasonable time and helps us in differential diagnosis. Reverse Takotsubo is rare， and its pathophysiological cause is similar at classic form， but his identification is important because it tend to be not recognizable as the traditional presentation， nevertheless both types of Takotsubo have same clinical course.**\n\n【39】**References**\n\n【40】**1\\.

One-fifth of all gallbladder cancer cases are reported only from northern part of India. The cases are more prominent in females than males. There were many risk factors associated with gallbladder cancer， but the heavy metals are play crucial roles in induction of gallbladder cancer. Heavy metal may interfere with molecular mechanism and activate mTOR，MAPK，and transcription factor. Hyper activation of cysteine due to arsenic exposure interfere with the function of the mTOR signaling pathway and taurine pathway that causes activation of c-fos，c-myc， and ELK-1leading to enhance cell division causing gallbladder cancer. Lead， Nickel， Zinc， and chromium activate cholic acid which causes formation of gallstones through activated taurine pathway leading to inflammatory gallbladder disease and formation of gall stones. Prolonged inflammation and stones formation in gall bladder may cause loss of contact inhibition in gall bladder cells leading to gall bladder cancer. The combined mechanism of heavy metals activates different pathway leading to gallbladder cancer through activating cell cycle and angiogenesis， it also inhibits tumor- suppressing genes. It was evident that gallbladder cancer is associated with high levels of heavy metal exposure. Differential mechanism associated with different heavy metal leads to gall bladder cancer.**\n\n【16】**Keywords： mTOR； MAPK； Taurine； Gall stone； Inflammation**\n\n【17】**Introduction**\n\n【18】**GBC (Gallbladder Cancer) is the sixth most frequent cancer among all gastrointestinal tract malignancies \\[1\\]. GBC have high mortality rate； it accounts for 20h position for death rate among all type of cancers. Mortality rate are very high for gall bladder cancer. In 2020， 115，949 new cases of GBC were reported worldwide， which was 0.6% of overall cancer incidence rate \\[2\\]. Differences in GBC incidence rate have been observed in different geographical areas \\[3\\]. Asia represents 70.8% of the total gallbladder cancer incidence followed by Europe 10.8%， Latin America and the Caribbean8.6%， Africa 4.7%， and Northern America 4.5% from. 10% of the global burden of GBC contributed by only India \\[4\\]. The 10% to 22% of India’s total GBC burden has been contributed by north-east region \\[5\\]. In 2020 because of GBC total of 84，695 deaths were reported worldwide including73.6% of the total mortality from Asia， 10.3% from Europe， 7.6% from Latin America and 5% from Caribbean， and 3.1% from Northern America \\[2\\]. These variations observed due to dissimilarity in genetic propensity and environmental exposure as well as other conditions such as gallstones， obesity， gender， bacterial infection associated with chronic inflammation that increase the potential for carcinogenesis， as known risk factors \\[6\\].**\n\n【19】**Heavy metal and gallbladder cancer incidence**\n\n【20】**Heavy metal as well as trace metal was observed in bile of gall bladder cancer patients \\[7\\]. The amount of some heavy metals like Lead (Pb)， Chromium (Cr)， and Cadmium (Cd) was found significantlyhigher in patients diagnosed with GBC \\[8\\]. The study conducted in the Gangetic plains of Bihar by Kumar et al.， \\[9\\] found a remarkably high concentration of arsenic (>15 ugL) in the blood of 53.6% of patients with gallbladder cancer. High concentration of Copper (Cu) and Nickel(Ni) were found in serum， Cd and Ni were found in bile and high concentration of Cr was found in gallbladder tissues. While Zinc (Zn) and Selenium (Se) have also been detected in low concentration in gall bladder tissues \\[10\\]. Role of heavy metal in induction of biological pathways were shown in Figure 1. It gives detailed idea about tumorigenesis in gall bladder and heavy metal incidence.**\n\n【21】**Molecular mechanism involved in gallbladder cancer due to heavy metals**\n\n【22】**Mondal et al.， \\[11\\] conducted a study that provides concrete pieces of evidence in support of heavy metals-induced premalignant and malignant development in gallbladder. It has been reported that the deregulation in antioxidant system plays a major role in carcinogenesis \\[12\\]. Heavy metals induce cancer through the generation of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS)， which leads to DNA damage through redox imbalance and by interrupting the repair pathway of damaged DNA \\[13\\]. The strong affinity of heavy metals for free sulfhydryl group makes it capable to disturb the metabolism and physiological function of several proteins \\[14\\]. Heavy metal exposure such as As， Hg， Cd and Pb compromises with cysteine status， which significantly took a part in the inducible endogenous detoxification system of body \\[6\\] and heavy metal also associated with alteration in function of enzyme involved in antioxidant system， lead to malignancy by DNA damage \\[15\\].**\n\n【23】**Heavy metal binding with cysteine & its metabolites leading to gallbladder cancer： The semi-essential sulfur-containing amino acid cysteine is carried from extracellular space by a catalytic subunit of the transport system called xCT in exchange for glutamate \\[16\\]. In the liver， cysteine decomposed into GSH (glutathione)by hepatic enzyme Y-Glutamyl Cysteine Synthetase (GCS) and disintegrates to cysteine sulfate by another hepatic enzyme Cysteine Dioxygenase (CDO)， cysteine sulfate further catabolized to hypo taurine by the action of enzyme Cysteine Sulfinate Decarboxylase (CSDC)， which later on oxidized to taurine \\[17\\]. The free sulfhydryl group of Cysteine binds with heavy metal such as arenite resulting in metabolic alteration and decrease cysteine concentration in intercellular space \\[18\\]. Cysteine transportation could also limit by phosphorylation of serine26 present on the cytosolic N terminus of the cystine-glutamate antiporter xCT by mTOR signaling \\[19\\]. Decreased level of cysteine leads to disturbance in its physiological role such as protection against inflammatory response and oxidative stress by deregulating GSH synthesis \\[20\\]. According to Lewerenz et al. \\[21\\]， the SLC7A11transporter is expressed in the number of malignancies where transporter-assisteddglutathione production decreases oxidative damage and protect cancer cell from death (Figure 2).**\n\n【24】**Role of GSH and its contribution to GBC due to heavy metal exposure： GSH protects the intracellular environment from oxidative stress and detoxifies cells by acting as a scavenger \\[22\\]. GSH reduces the oxidative level through binding its thiol group directly with free radicals， it also functions as a cofactor for enzyme peroxidase， which metabolized H，O， and lipid peroxide \\[23\\]. The high affinity of heavy metal for GSH leads to a reduction in intracellular concentration of glutathione by suppressing the action of essential enzyme Y-glutamyl cysteine synthetase required for GSH synthesis \\[24\\]. Decreased levels of glutathione lead to elevation in redox imbalance which increases the frequency of damaged DNA \\[25\\] by modifying methylation of DNA or by interfering in the mechanism of DNA repair (Figure 2). Mutated DNA gets accumulated and eventually causes cancer \\[26\\]. It has been observed that when ROS generation is high， the antioxidant system loses its ability to maintain equilibrium and results in oxidative stress 27\\].**\n\n【25】**Effect of heavy metal induced oxidative tension on DNA：High oxidative stress could induce either through mitochondrial dysfunction or malfunctioning of the ROS elimination system，heavy metal limits the function of MRCC1 and MRCC2 mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes which enhance the oxidative stress\\[28\\]. Free radicals also produced either by stimulation of H.O， production through heavy metal toxicity or feedback inhibition of amino-levulinic acid synthase， which leads to an elevated level of heme precursor Amino-Levulinic Acid (ALA)， enolization of ALA followed by autoxidation generated free radicals \\[29\\]. Increased level of free radical by inhibition of antioxidant system has been observed in fishes when exposed to metal toxicity by Zheng et al. \\[30\\]. Effects of increased oxidative stress on DNA impairment is complex and pleomorphic. Increased oxidative stress caused by heavy metal leads to DNA damage and it can initiate cancer processes as well as participate in its progression \\[31\\]. Oxidative DNA damage has also been identified in the lymphocytes of the person exposed to the heavy metal environment \\[32\\]. Chromosomal aberration and DNA strand break has been well demonstrated in cultured mammalian cells even at the minute deposition of heavy metal \\[33\\]. Simultaneously ROS causes DNA damage by oxidizing nucleoside bases such as8-oxoguanine， which if left unpaired， it may cause G-T and G-A transversion \\[34\\]. Moreover， heavy metal exposure can produce**\n\n【26】**Figure 2： Showing molecular mechanism altered by heavy metal leads to gallbladder cancer through different pathways； 1) Arsenite (trivalent arsenic) binds to cysteine and decreases the level of the precursar of glutathione， consequence inta accelerate oxidative tension which leads to modification in DNA through methylation and damage result into the accumulation of mutation which finally leads ta cancer. 2) Metabolite of cysteine， cysteine sulfinate converts inta taurine in multistep through enzymatic actions. Association of heavy metals like Mercury and Cadmium with taurine leads to the depletion of taurine which prevents the conjugation of primary bile acid by suppressing the expression of CYP27A1 gene encading for steral-27-hydroxylase due ta madified taurine component of mt-tRNAs. Later on， it leads to gallstone formation by the accumulation of non-conjugated bile acid and bilirubin secretion enhanced by chromium， nickel， zinc， and lead. Prolonged gallstones deposition causes inflammation， which culminates in carcinoma of the gallbladder over time.3) Hypoxia， DNA damage， and oxidative stress induced through heavy metal toxicity up-regulate mTOR signaling & MAPK signaling pathways， which stimulate downstream signaling of different prateins including transcription factors and regulate target gene expressian. mTOR signaling up-regulates translational factors such as elF4E and phasphakinase p70S6K， which encaded for angiagenesis and cell migration respectively. MAPK signaling activate ELK-1 transcription factor via regulating different downstream proteins which further expressed AP-1 transcription element site present at DNA which leads ta proliferation.**\n\n【27】**intrastrand bifunctional adducts through covalent binding with the N-atom of guanine and adenine present at 7th position of DNA residue leading to the destabilization of the DNA helix \\[35\\].**\n\n【28】**Suppression of DNA repair mechanism and genotoxicity due to oxidative stress caused by heavy metal： Giaginis et al. \\[36\\] has reported about suppression of mismatch repair， nucleotide excision， and base excision DNA repairs mechanisms due to heavy metal toxicity， either by binding to residues of negatively charged surface on DNA repair protein or by replacing Zn-atom in their Zn finger motif. Inhibition of repair mechanism result into conformational changes and disturbance in DNA protein interaction required for DNA repair process and preservation of genomic integrity. Substantiation of aberration in chromosome， micronuclei， and high sister chromatids exchange due to heavy metal has observed by Valverde et al.， \\[37\\] in person exposed to heavy metal environment. Heavy metal compounds alter expression of tumor suppressor gene and oncogene through deregulation in DNA methylation pattern \\[38\\]. Which may be cause hypomethylation leading to oncogene activation through suppression of DNA methyl transferase \\[39\\] or transcriptional inactivation due to**\n\n【29】**hypermethylation of the p53 gene at the promoter region by heavy metal \\[40\\]. Heavy metal also reduces the levels of S-Adenosyl-L-Methionine (SAM) and methyltransferase gene which encode for enzyme that transfer a methyl group to nucleotides residue of DNA. Dysregulation in methylation processes due to heavy metal exposure has also observed in rats model \\[41\\]. Methylation at promoter region of tumors suppressor gene family CDH1，CDKN2A， p16 and REpRIMO is responsible for apoptosis and inhibition of angiogenesis in gallbladder malignancy. Methylation of p73， MGMT， DCL1 were also observed in cell of gallbladder malignancy \\[42\\]. Modification in promoter region and remodeling in process of methylation of DNA have a tumor-encouraging effect and enhance the up regulation of the proto-oncogene pool out-turn into mutation and accumulated mutation with time results in tumor formation.**\n\n【30】**Role of heavy metals on the physiological role of taurine responsible for galbladdertumorigenesis： Cysteine derived Taurine(2-aminoethane sulphonic acid) freely present in intracellular space play a key role in the reduction of oxidative tension induced by heavy metal toxicity \\[43\\]. It has been observed that taurine reduces**\n\n【31】**Figure 3： mTOR component comprises two separate mTORC1 and mTORC2 multi protein complexes， which regulate complicated signaling， involved in cell growth and praliferation by influencing a variety of key cellular functions like cell migratian and protein synthesis.mTORC1 interacts with four additional proteins：mammalian lethal with SEC 13 protein eight (mLST8)， rapTOR (mTOR regulatary protein)， PRAS40 (praline-rich AKT substrate)， and DEP-domain containing mTOR-interacting protein. S6Kinase (S6K) and 4E-BPs (eukaryotic translation initiation factar-binding proteins) are substrates for mTORC1. 4E-BPs governs translation initiation by binding eukaryatic translation initiation factor elF4E required for pratein synthesis， P70S6K activate Rac1/cdc42， which help in cell migration.**\n\n【32】**superoxide synthesis by elevating electron transport chain activity of mitochondria \\[44\\]. Toxicity of heavy metal leads to a consequential reduction in taurine accumulation and falloff of the membrane protected by taurine \\[45\\]. Taurine is critical for gallstone formation， which induces inflammation in inner lining of gallbladder tissues and eventually turns into a malignant mass of cells through mutation \\[1\\]. Taurine also has been spotted in mt-tRNAs as a modified component of 5-taurine methyluridine and 5-taurine methyl-2-thiouridine \\[46\\]. Increased ROS level due to reduction in GSHleads to enlargement and malfunctioning of mitochondria \\[47\\]. Mitochondrial malfunctioning and high susceptibility of mt-DNA to ROS leads to alteration in mt-tRNA \\[48\\]， and mutated mt-tRNAs leads to several metabolic diseases as well as cancer \\[49\\].Disintegration of the inner membrane of mitochondria by modified mt-tRNA results in a remarkable reduction in CYP27A1 protein expression in taurine-depleted liver \\[50\\]， which further inhibits bile acid formation in addition to deterioration in the flow of bile， results in reduction of conjugation of taurine with bile acid \\[51\\]. Accumulation of un-conjugated bile acid leads to the formation of gallstones， which cause irritation and turn into cancer in the long run. Modification due to heavy metals in MDR3， a gene involved in bile formation， and CYP27A regulates cholesterol metabolism in the liver， play critical role in gallstone formation 52\\].**\n\n【33】**Signaling expressed in gallbladder carcinoma**\n\n【34】**Cell signaling is necessary for sustaining critical cellular functions like development， differentiation， migration， and cell growth. Activation of ERK/MAPK \\[53\\] and mTOR signaling pathways \\[54\\] due to heavy metal toxicityhas been reported in gallbladder cell lines， which incite circumstances that fuel cancer progression (Figure 2).**\n\n【35】**MAPK signaling pathway activation in gall bladder cancer due to heavy metal exposure： Activation of the MAPK signaling pathway in presence of excess heavy metal through generation of ROS was extensively studied \\[55\\]. Nanomolar concentration of Cd**\n\n【36】**also activates MAPK signaling \\[56\\]. MAP kinase activates different downstream substrate such as transcription factors Elk-1， c-jun， c-fos， c-myc， stress-activated protein kinase (MSK) and Ribosomal S6 Kinase 1 (RSK1) in gallbladder carcinoma \\[57\\]. Which stimulate cancer regulatory processes： Angiogenesis， cell proliferation \\[58\\]， cell differentiation \\[59\\]， cell cycle progression \\[60\\]， growth， metastasis\\[61\\]， invasiveness \\[62\\] in GBC celllines \\[63\\].**\n\n【37】**Role of heavy metals in mTOR activation leading to gallbladder cancer： mTOR activation occurs early in the development of GBC\\[64\\]. Activation of PI3K kinase， which stimulate mTOR pathway and phosphorylation of mTOR， S6K1 and 4E-BP1 by heavy metal has reported in GBC \\[48\\]. The PI3K/AKT signaling pathway activate mTOR by phosphorylate Ser 2448， which further activates the eukaryotic Translation Factor 4E (eIF4E) by inactivating its inhibitor 4E-BP1.35 \\[65\\]. An element PI3K of the mTOR signaling pathway stimulates different tumorigenic cellular processes such as angiogenesis， cell survival， cell proliferation， adhesion， and motility\\[66\\]. Riener et al. \\[67\\] found a missense mutation in PI3KCA，which contributes to gallbladder carcinogenesis (Figure 3). Outcomes of immunohistochemical analysis of phosphorylated p70S6K has been shown a high prevalence (>80%) of up-regulated p70S6K in gallbladder cell lines \\[64\\]， which have the potential to rearrange the actin cytoskeleton through its actin filament cross-linking Rac1/cdc42 and leads to cell migration \\[68\\].**\n\n【38】**Other transcription factors up-regulated by heavy metal in gall bladder cancer： Besides mTOR and MAPK signaling hyper activation of other transcription factors MTF1 (Metal Regulatory Transcriptional Factor1)， USF (Upstream Stimulator Factor)， Nuclear Factor kB (NF-KB) and NF-E2 Related Factor (NRF2) has also been observed in gallbladder carcinoma which is stimulated by heavy metals as well \\[69\\]. Cd-induced tumorigenesis demonstrated through differential display analysis of transformed BALB/C-3T3cells due to CdCl2 exposure shows over expression of translation**\n\n【39】**initiation factor-3 and translation elimination factor 1 delta \\[70\\]. All these factors induced cellproliferation and cell survival， which is a key step in tumor formation. Nuclear Factor NF-kB regulate downstream target， modulate viability， and boost cell division of gallbladder cancer cells during chemotherapy \\[71\\]. The result of an experimental study by Shibata et al. \\[72\\]， supports the regulation of NrF2 activity by alters the inhibitory function of Keaplgene in gallbladder cancer cell lines \\[391.**\n\n【40】**Conclusion**\n\n【41】**It was evident that gall bladder cancer is multistep process induced by activation of cascades of genes. Heavy metal enhances formation of gall stones which may be converted into gall bladder cancer with time. Taurine-cysteine pathway regulates formation of gall stones on activation due to increased concentration of heavy metal. MAPK， mTOR and transcription factor activation through different heavy metal finally leads to gall bladder malignancy through different pathways. NF kB， Rac1， elF4E and Cdc42 play critical role in cell migration and excessive protein synthesis required for proliferating gall bladder cells. Heavy metal toxicity causes increased chances of gall stone formation and gall bladder cancer through alteration of regulatory genes.**\n\n【42】**Acknowledgment**\n\n【43】**Authors are thankful to the Central University of Himachal Pradesh for providing infrastructural support during their study.

We report a 52-year-old woman who presented with persistent shoulder and back pain accompanied by muscular atrophy of the left upper limb， intermittent headache， and with gradual aggravation for one year. The preoperative diagnosis was difficult and the final postoperative pathological diagnosis was FVPTC. After locoregional and systemic treatments， brain metastasis initialy gradualy shrank and disappeared， but lung， bone， and brain metastases finally enlarged. Eventually， she died of malnutrition and cachexia. FVPTC always shows benign sonographic features and atypical histological and cytologic characteristics. It is easy to misdiagnose. I-131 ablation may be insufficient in patients with FVPTC at high risk， but can alleviate clinical symptoms， reduce metastasis， improve quality of life， and prolong survival.**\n\n【13】**Keywords： Follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma； FVPTC； Multiple metastases； I-131 treatment； survival； Papillary thyroid carcinoma**\n\n【14】**Introduction**\n\n【15】**Follicular Variant of Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma (FVPTC) accounts for 23% to 41% of PTC \\[1-3\\]. FVPTC was first described by Dailey et al. \\[4-6\\] in 1950， who characterized FVPTC as having the nuclear features of conventional PTC but with a follicular growth pattern. A definitive preoperative diagnosis of FVPTC based on fine-needle aspiration cytology is not possible， because signs of malignancy depend on the typical nuclear features of conventional PTC \\[7-9\\]. In addition， the features of benign and other neoplastic follicular lesions overlap， which can be affected by inter observer variability \\[10-12\\].**\n\n【16】**Patients with FVPTC or conventional PTC are treated similarly. The standard recommendation has been radioactive Iodine (I-131) ablation for all tumors 21 cm in diameter， and then thyroid stimulating hormone suppression and close follow-up \\[1，13，14\\]. FVPTC is noted as being less aggressive， with a lower incidence of thyroid capsule invasion， extra thyroidal extension， and lymph node metastases \\[3，15-17\\]. However， other studies found that FVPTC tended to have a higher rate of distant metastasis compared with conventional PTC \\[3，18-20\\]， a higher rate of histologic vascular invasion， and during follow-up a higher rate of recurrence \\[18，21，22\\]. FVPTC patients with distant metastasis have a relatively poor outcome 23.**\n\n【17】**Here in， we report a case of FVPTC with several unique features including wide spread metastasis and difficult preoperative diagnosis. We also describe the comprehensive management of this patient.**\n\n【18】**Case Presentation**\n\n【19】**In early 2013， a52-year-old woman presented with first symptoms ofpersistent shoulder and back pain accompanied by muscular atrophy of the left upper limb and intermittent headache. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) showed space-occupying lesions in the seventh cervical vertebrae，the first thoracic and left frontal lobe. Bone and brain metastases were considered. In July 2013， the patient underwent resection of the space-occupying lesion in the spinal canal. Postoperative pathology suggested intraspinal metastatic moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma， approximately**\n\n【20】**Figure 1： Pathological report showed spinalcanalspace-occupying， moderately ditterentiated adenocarcinoma.**\n\n【21】Figure 2： Color Doppler ultrasound of thyroid and cervical lymph nodes revealed： (1) Cystic and solid nodules in the left lobe of thyroid. (2) Hypoechoic nodules in the right lobe of the thyroid.\n\n【22】**originating from the lung or thyroid(Figure 1). Computed Tomography (CT) scan showed multiple nodules in both lungs. The thyroid ultrasound displayed a hypoechoic nodule in her right lobe and a nodule with cystic and solid components in her left lobe，and no obvious malignant features of the thyroid nodules. Positron Emission Tomography (PET)-CT revealed multiple pulmonary， skeletal， and intracranial metastases from an unknown primary focus. After radiotherapy for cervical spine and brain metastases with a dose of40G/20F in August 2013， she still suffered intermittent headache. In November 2013， pathology indicated an intraspinal mass and metastatic thyroid carcinoma (follicular subtype).**\n\n【23】**Figure 4： High metabolism of thyroid nodules in the right lobe， multiple metastases in both lungs， multiple bone metastases， and left parietal lobe brain metastases were found on a Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET/CT scan.**\n\n【24】**Figure 5： Pathological report was follicular subtype of papillary thyroid carcinoma.**\n\n【25】**In November 2013 the patient complained of intermittent headache， nausea， and vomiting and was admitted to our hospital. The physical examination found muscle atrophy of the left upper arm， fore arm and left dorsal with muscle strength； volar contracture of the ring finger and with inextensible and normal muscle strength of the lower limbs. The preliminary questionable diagnosis was thyroid cancer， lung cancer， or other malignancy. Thyroid color Doppler ultrasound examination showed a suspicious cystic solid thyroid nodule in the left lobe that might be benign； and a right lobe thyroid hypoechoic nodule that might be cancer (Figure 2).**\n\n【26】**A lymph node examined by color Doppler ultrasound showed no definite abnormality. Ultrasound-guided core needle biopsies**\n\n【27】**Figure 6： Head CT scans showed brain metastases initially gradually shrank and disappeared. (A) 17 January 2014； (B)3 July 2014；(C) 15 January 2015；(D)6 May 2016.**\n\n【28】**of thyroid nodules were performed. The pathological report was benign thyroid follicles and fibro-muscular tissue (Figure 3). This was a clinical contradictory conclusion-the intraspinal metastasis was considered PTC metastasis by the pathological report， but no malignant figures were found in the ultrasonography and biopsy specimen. Laboratory tests revealed normal thyroid function and elevated Thyroglobulin (Tg)： Thyroglobulin (Tg) >475 ng/mL (3.5ng/mL to 77 ng/mL). The PET-CT scan showed high metabolism in the right thyroid lobe， multiple metastases in both sides of the lung， multiple bone metastases， and metastasis in the parietal lobe of the left brain (Figure 4). In December 2013， the patient underwent total thyroidectomy； the pathological report was papillary thyroid carcinoma of the right lobe thyroid， follicular subtype， invasion of capsule， and gross tumor size 1.5 cm x1.3 cmx 1.2 cm (Figure 5).**\n\n【29】**In August 2014， the patient was given cervical and cranial radiotherapy. I-131 treatment (200 mCi) was administered 4 times during January 2014 and November 2015. In addition， the patient received the following： Thyroid stimulating hormone inhibition therapy； targeted therapy (oral administration of sorafenib mesylate)； surgicaltreatment for bone metastases； mannitolandhormone for the treatment of brain edema；pain relief； and other supportive treatments. Brain metastases initially gradually shrank and disappeared (Figure6)， and headache and vomiting were alleviated. However， the lung， bone and brain metastases were enlarged at last in November 2015(Figure 7). She died of malnutrition and cachexia in early June 2016.**\n\n【30】**Discussion**\n\n【31】**FVPTC is composed of cells with nuclear features ofconventional PTC with a follicular architecture \\[24-28\\]. Three clinicopathological entities have been recognized in FVPTC： Encapsulated/Non-Invasive(E/NI)-FVPTC with a more indolent behavior； infiltrative FVPTC， whose behavior is closer to conventional PTC； and a multinodular/diffuse form characterized by aggressive clinical behavior， giving rise to nodal and distant metastases \\[29，30\\]. In the present case， the ultrasonic manifestations of thyroid were like that of E/NI-FVPTC， but the biological behaviors were closer to the multinodular/diffuse form of FVPTC with lung， bone， and brain metastases. However， there was no cervicallymph node metastasis in this case. A verylarge proportion of FVPTCs are histologically difficult to distinguish from benign follicularlesions such as follicular adenoma， especially by fine-**\n\n【32】**metastasis and right pelvic bone metastasis was enlarged.**\n\n【33】**needle aspiration biopsy \\[8，31\\]. This was also seen in the present case. Tg is an independent predictor of malignancy， and in patients with thyroid nodules， Tg should be determined before surgery， especially when cytology is indeterminate \\[32，33\\]. The level of Tg in our patient increased significantly before thyroidectomy， which signaled thyroid malignancy. In addition， immunohistochemical examination combined with genetic tests can improve the diagnostic rate \\[34\\].**\n\n【34】**For the treatment of metastasis， we reviewed the guidelines for radio iodine therapy of differentiated thyroid cancer recommended by the Chinese Society of Nuclear Medicine (2021 edition) \\[35\\]. For lung metastases， I-131 treatment is the first choice. Although I-131treatment may not cure bone metastases with large bone destruction， it can often significantly reduce serum Tg level， relieve pain， improve quality oflife， and prolong survival. Brain metastasis is more common in advanced elderly patients， with poor prognosis. Surgical treatment or external beam radiation therapy should be considered first. I-131treatment is an adjunct to surgeryor radiotherapy for brain metastases. In severe cases， brain hernia and other life-threatening reactions may occur. Therefore， I-131 treatment should be accompanied by glucocorticoid therapy， and patients must be closely observed. In the present case， mannitol treatment for high intracranial pressure and dexamethasone for infective brain edema were used before and after I-131. The brain metastases initially gradually shrank and disappeared and the headache and vomiting symptoms were alleviated.**\n\n【35】**After multiple I-131 treatments， some iodine-uptake metastases still showed disease progression within one year， including gradual growth of the lesions， emergence of new lesions， and continuous increase of Tg in serum， despite maintaining iodine-uptake ability. This is called Radioactive Iodine-Refractory (RAIR)-Differentiated Thyroid Cancer (DTC) \\[36，37\\]. Lenvatinib and sorafenib have been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration， and many other drugs are in trials for the treatment of advanced metastatic RAIR-DTC \\[38\\]. Unfortunately， the efficacy of tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment is limited due to the lack of strong cytotoxic action， fast development of resistance， and side effects \\[39\\]. Immunotherapy is also a promising alternative option for RAIR-DTC. The anti-tumor activity of the anti-PDL1 monoclonal antibody pembrolizumab has been evaluated in advanced PD-L1-positive DTC with promising results \\[40\\]. However， very few clinical trials have been accomplished.**\n\n【36】**Conclusion**\n\n【37】**The available options for patients with metastasizing FVPTC include surgical resection， radio iodine， thyroid stimulating hormone-suppression， locoregional and adjuvant/adjunctive and targeted treatments， immunotherapy， and other novel approaches. None of these are adequate， but the immediate and long-term prospects of individualized targeted therapy look bright.**\n\n【38】**References**\n\n【39】1\\.

The Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the main host cell receptor of human pathogenic SARS-CoV-2 and it plays a crucial role in the entry of the virus into the cell to cause and finally COVID-19 infection. We review the possible association of ACE2 gene polymorphisms in COVID-19 along with the risk of cardiovascular disease. From the year 2020 onwards number of researchers reported ACE2 main functional role in simulations has indicated several of these polymorphisms could affect interactions of SARS-CoV-2 and explained the concept of partial explanation for the regional differences and the disease severity. Here， we discuss the potential effect of polymorphisms of the ACE2 gene in the main function of plasma ACE2 activity in myocardial infarction， ischemic heart disease， and hypertension. Furthermore， we speculate on the potential role of ACE2 gene polymorphisms of rs2285666 as a common genetic locus and susceptibility marker for the COVID-19 infection that might be associated with cardiovascular disease risk.**\n\n【16】**Keywords： ACE2 polymorphism； Cardiovascular risk； COVID-19； Genetic susceptibility**\n\n【17】**Introduction**\n\n【18】**Critical pathways for hypertension control and kidney functions are attributed to Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE). ACE-2 is one of the members of the ACE family protease and is attached to the cell membrane of (mACE2) in the kidney， heart， intestines， testis， and a soluble form in gallbladder (sACE2) \\[1，2\\]. The sACE2 lowers blood pressure by catalyzing the hydrolysis of angiotensin II into angiotensin \\[1-7\\]. Which in turn binds to MasR receptors creating the vasodilation and decreasing the blood pressure \\[7\\]? Cardiovascular and hypertension patients are mostly affected by blood pressure and making the entire processes a promising drug target \\[8\\]. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2， which was first discovered in December 2019， has subsequently， spread rapidly through global trade and travels \\[9\\]. The Coronaviruses (CoVs) are positive-sense single-stranded RNA， with the capacity to environmentally get rapidly mutated and recombination.COVID-19 is well-known to cause human respiratoryand intestinal infections. The risk of serious illness of COVID-19 is mostly affected by older aged people， cardiovascular disease， diabetes， chronic respiratory disease， and cancer patients. Globally， in May 2021， there have been 51，39，55，910 confirmed cases of COVID-19， including 62，49，700 deaths， as reported by WHO. (WHO， COVID-19 daily reports， April-2022) \\[10\\]. The SARS-CoV-2 has affected humans and worldwide deaths ratio of 4.5 million \\[11\\]. In India， as on May 2022， a total of 4，30，94，938confirmed positive cases of COVID-19 with 5，24，002 deaths as reported by WHO (WHO， May2022) \\[12\\]. The review work was planned to investigate the high-risk genetic variants of ACE2gene SNPs in COVID-19 infection and their association with Cardiovascular Diseases (CVD). COVID-19 is discovered in December-2019， however， before the COVID-19 infection，ACE2 gene polymorphisms were identified as susceptibility molecules in CVD. A recently higher number of new genetic variants were identified in the ACE2 gene as the reason for COVID-19 infection. The cured COVID-19 infected persons with ACE2 polymorphisms are at a higher risk of cardiovascular disease.**\n\n【19】**Methods**\n\n【20】An extensive search was performed for literature collection from the ACE2 gene polymorphisms in COVID-19 and cardiovascular disease utilizing PubMed，and other scholarly searchbibliographic\n\n【21】**databases with a variety of terms that included， rennin-angiotensin system， pulmonary hypertension， and rs2285666 susceptibility in COVID-19 or cardiovascular disease.**\n\n【22】**ACE2 Gene Structure and Function**\n\n【23】**Activation of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) plays an important role in the development and progression of cardiovascular complications. One of the pivotal components of renin-angiotensin system is ACE， which mediates various systemic and local regulations in the cardiovascular system and kidney and blockade of the RAS by Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and Angiotensin(Ang) II receptor blockers have been shown to reduce Blood Pressure(BP) and the cardiac and renal complications of diabetes. The ACE exists in two isoforms， a somatic ACE，and testis-specific ACE (tACE). In 2000， two independent research groups discovered ACE2， one of the ACE family metalloprotease， unlike ACE， ACE2 removes the carboxy-terminal phenylalanine in Ang-II to form the heptapeptide angiotensin-(1-7)\\[13，14\\]. The chromosome location of the ACE2gene is at Xp22 and the size is 39.98 kb， containing 18 exons and 20introns \\[7\\]. The ACE2 is identified as a functional receptor for the SARS Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) \\[8，15\\]. Serves as a main entry point in to the cell for coronaviruses such as HCoV-NL63，SARS-CoV，and SARS-CoV-2 \\[16，17\\]. ACE2 is expressed specifically in heart and kidney and capable of cleaving Ang I and Ang-II into angiotensin 1-7and angiotensin 1-9 respectively and other key vasoactive peptides， thus provides additional possibilities for the development of novel therapeutics \\[13\\].**\n\n【24】**The ACE2 Gene Role in COVID-19**\n\n【25】**The ACE2 contributes a central role in cardiac pathophysiology. Original SARS-CoV give rise to SARS-CoV-2 which differs from the original by 380 amino acid substitutions， and renders a difference in the receptor-binding domain between the viral spike (S) protein with surface expressed human ACE2 \\[18\\]. This viral spike protein is target for therapeutic and vaccine development. The viral spike glycoprotein， synthesized as an inactive protein， is cleaved by the furin protease plasmin at furin cleavage site of spike protein， which is absent in SARS-CoV， thereby enhancing and increasing the cellular uptake of viral particles \\[19\\] by membrane fusion. Once the virus enter in to the host cell， the viral RNA is released and the host cell's cellular programs are utilized for viral replication of the host. The viral mediators down regulates ACE2 and induce the ADAM Metallopeptidase domain 17 (ADAM-17) \\[20，21\\]， latter cleaves ACE2， and directly pointing towards its direct involvement in COVID-19 and the RAAS system. Silhol et al.\\[22\\] proposed low ACE2 level and a decrease in angiotensin 1-9 were correlated with a poor prognosis in acute respiratory distress syndrome. Similarly， COVID-19 viral mediated down regulation of ACE2 and its product can also be correlated with a poor prognosis in COVID-19\\[22\\].**\n\n【26】**ACE2 Gene PolymorphismsSasSaRisk in Cardiovascular Disease**\n\n【27】**CVD is the leading cause of mortality ratio in worldwide， representing 32% and 17.9 million people died in 2019， WHO，June，2021 \\[11\\]. China had the highest number of heart disease deaths in2018， followed by accounts in India， Russia， the United States， and Indonesia (Robert Preidt， Health Day Reporter， WEDNESDAY， December 10\"， 2020 (Health Day News) \\[23\\]. It has been reported that COVID-19 can cause heart injury， even in people without underlying heart issues. The most frequently reported cardiovascular**\n\n【28】**malfunction in COVID-19 is acute cardiac injury and it occurred in ~8% to 12% of all COVID patients. A unique interplay between SARS-CoV-2 and CVDs has been reported. Patel et al. reported that genetic variation of ACE2 is associated in Caucasians with diabetic hypertension \\[24\\]. Lu et al. reported the ACE2 gene G8790A variants are more significantly associated with essential hypertension in Chinese patients \\[25\\]. These studies demonstrate that the A allele of the rs2285666 polymorphism in the ACE2 gene influences the risk of fatal CVD events to be a potential risk factor for males and females\\[26-31\\]. Cheng et al. \\[32\\] reported the ACE2 SNP rs879922 may be common genetic loci and genetic susceptibility marker for T2D and T2D-related cardiovascular risks in Uygurs \\[32\\]. The SNP rs2285666in ACE2 has been reported as a risk factor for hypertension and heart failure \\[33-35\\]. Table 1 shows the ACE2 gene polymorphisms that are possibly more vulnerable to COVID-19 and the risk of CVD. Cross-sectional human studies from Sheila et al. reported that the circulating ACE2 gene is a genetic marker of cardiovascular disease. Paramasivam et al. \\[36\\] reported that understanding the underlying mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 causes CVD is of greatest importance， and cardiovascular protection should be taken into consideration during treatment for COVID-19 \\[36\\]. All the above observations strongly suggested the importance of ACE2 and its regulation in cardiovascular disease and COVID-19.**\n\n【29】**ACE2 Gene Polymorphisms asaRisk in COVID-19**\n\n【30】**The ACE2 gene polymorphisms are linked to several diseases， which also play a main role in COVID-19 infection and its severity\\[24\\]. There are four SNPs in the ACE2 gene， reported to be involved in modulating cardiac structure and function. One of the SNPs rs2285666 was reported to be involved in left ventricle mass in additional other three SNPs RS1978124， rs4646179. Srivastava et al. ascertained a significant positive correlation for SNP rs2285666with COVID-19 infection susceptibility and fatality rate among the Indian population. In addition to TMPRSS2 rs2329760 SNP， ACE2rs2285666 SNP is one of the predictors of COVID-19 disease severity has been shown in the Egypt population. Kushal et al. \\[37\\] reported the soluble ACE2 K26R and T92I mutants were more effective in blocking the entry of the virus suggesting that ACE2 variants can modulate susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 \\[37\\]. Earlier evidence reports of the C/C genotype of rs2106809 and the allele A of rs2285666 in ACE2 are risk factors in patients with COVID19. The different SNPs of ACE2 and rs5183 AGTR1 showed an association with severity and death in patients with COVID-19 and comorbidities \\[38-431. Mayan et al. first reported a miRNA candidate that can target ACE2in cardiomyocytes and thus may be exploited as a therapeutic target for cardiovascular complications and COVID-19 \\[44\\]. The review finds that COVID-19 patients with severe symptoms also seem to suffer from various other health conditions including Cardiovascular**\n\n【31】**Table 1： Show the ACE2 gene rs2285666 polymorphisms are susceptibility in Covid-19 and Cardiovascular disease.**\n\n| **S.Nos**  | **COVD-19**  | **Country**  | **Cardiovascular** **Disease**  | **County**  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **1**  | **Maria et al. \\[43\\]**  | **Spain**  | **Zhong et al. \\[31\\]**  | **China**  |\n| **2**  | **Srivastava et al.\\[44\\]**  | **Incia**  | **Lieb et al.\\[32\\]**  | **Germany**  |\n| **3**  | **Nahid et al.\\[45\\]**  | **Iran**  | **Huang et al.\\[33\\]**  | **China**  |\n| **4**  | **Birte et al. \\[46\\]**  | **Germany**  | **Ciara et al. \\[34\\]**  | **Ireland**  |\n| **5**  | **Abdelsattar et al.\\[47\\]**  | **Egypt**  | **Chaoxin et al. \\[35\\]**  | **China**  |\n| **6**  | **Asselta et al. \\[48\\]**  | **Italy**  | **Cheng et al. \\[36\\]**  | **South African**  |\n\n【33】**Disease (CVD)， hypertension， and diabetes \\[45\\]. Screening for the novel SNPs by focusing on recently identified SNPs in critical regions of ACE2 can be targeted to monitor susceptibility markers for COVID-19 infection \\[20\\]. The review reports strong evidence of ACE2 gene polymorphisms as a risk in COVID-19.**\n\n【34】**Conclusion**\n\n【35】**The ACE2 gene rs2285666 polymorphisms， as seen in COVID-19disease， correlated with the severity and susceptibility of COVID-19. ACE2 gene SNP rs2285666 is also seen in CVD. Correlating， ACE2gene rs2285666 polymorphisms， with CVDand COVID-19infection. We strongly believe that those who are infected with COVID-19 are more susceptible to getting CVD in near future.**\n\n【36】**Acknowledgment**\n\n【37】**This work was supported by grants from the UGC， Dr. DS.

The Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) with staff nurses and the In-Depth Interviews (IDIs) with the head consultants and assessors were conducted to explore their experiences and perceptions of the Manyata training program and data was analyzed through thematic analysis.**\n\n【14】**Results： The statistical analysis of pre- and post-training scores suggests a significant improvement in the knowledge and skills of all the staff nurses from four states (Bihar， Tamil Nadu， Maharashtra， and Punjab). The mean percentage of correct answers (for all questions and states combined) increased from 42.5% before training to 82.9% after training with a mean difference of 40.4%. The qualitative data analysis demonstrates an improved motivation of staff nurses to upgrade themselves and others， their enhanced practical knowledge and skills， an increased sense of recognition and self-worth， respectful maternity care， and overall improved maternal outcomes.**\n\n【15】**Conclusion： Our study suggests that staff nurses' practical knowledge and skills， their adherence to clinical standards on antenatal care， and their overall professional behavior improved significantly post-Manyata training program. This FOGSI initiative is a promising intervention to build the capacity of healthcare providers， however， continuous and concerted efforts are needed at their workplaces to make the learning process sustainable.**\n\n【16】**Keywords： FOGSI； Manyata skill transfer training； Frontline healthcare provider； Capacity building； Maternal care； Mixed-method； Kahoot**\n\n【17】**Introduction**\n\n【18】**Improving the quality of antenatal care will not only reduce the global burden of maternal complications and deaths but also provide all women with a positive pregnancy experience \\[1\\]. Since staff nurses are at the forefront of clinical care and have maximum interaction time with the women at a healthcare facility， it is imperative to strengthen their knowledge and skills to ensure the provision of quality， safe and respectful maternity care.**\n\n【19】**The Maternal Health Quality of Care(MHQoC) strategy-funded National Program Management Unit of FOGSI has trained the staff nurses and certified facilities on the Manyata safe delivery standards. Though Manyata clinical standards are meant for private facilities， they are aligned with the government's requirements for the delivery of optimum care. The 16 clinical standards targeted for implementation cover： Antenatal care (one standard)，intrapartum care (13 standards)， postpartum care (one standard)， and caesarean section (one standard)， including the standards on identification and management of Postpartum Hemorrhage (PPH) and Pre-Eclampsia/Eclampsia(PE/E)\\[2-4\\].**\n\n【20】**Bengaluru-based ARTIST (Asian Research and Training Institute for skill Transfer) Skill Gurukool， which is a premier institute for learning， is gearing up to ensure the improvement in capabilities and competencies of Obstetricians & Gynecologists (ObGyn) and healthcare providers in India. Through FOGSI approved Manyata skill development training program， the institute aims to create a lasting impact on the quality of training and scale up of Manyata's reach，taking advantage of both the onsite teaching at Skill Gurukool and blended skill transfer programs through digital platforms and other innovative means.**\n\n【21】**In our previous study， we documented the impact of Manyata training on the effective management of pregnancy and childbirth-related complications， PPH， and PE/E. Since the staff nurses of private healthcare facilities are the key beneficiaries， their experiences and perceptions of the Manyata training program， along with their head consultants and assessors， were gathered and documented. All the beneficiaries strongly valued the Manyata training program for building their capacity for complications management \\[5\\].However， this program is not just committed to reducing preventable maternal complications and mortality but also to improving the overall quality of maternal and child health care.**\n\n【22】**We believe that a comprehensive understanding of the overall development of the clinical skills and professional behaviors of staff nurses will provide a holistic impact of the Manyata training program. Therefore， this study demonstrates how the knowledge and skills of staff nurses have improved from pre- to post-training implementation and how well the beneficiaries have received the Manyata training program as evaluated through their pre- and post-training scores for some of the important standards covered， and their in-depth feedback data analysis.**\n\n【23】**Methods**\n\n【24】**Study design**\n\n【25】**This is a mixed-method study done to achieve greater insight into the impact of the Manyata training program on ensuring quality， safe and respectful maternity care in private healthcare facilities.**\n\n【26】**Study setting and duration**\n\n【27】**Bengaluru-based ARTIST institute， through its FOGSI-Manyata skill transfer training initiative， has covered over 200 private healthcare facilities from different states in India. The staff from these facilities was oriented on the 16 Manyata clinical standards through the presentation， practical demonstrations， and role plays on digital platforms (Figure 1). The facilities were then assessed by FOGSI lead assessors and received a quality-of-care seal by FOGSI-Manyata if they had compliance with more than 85% of clinical standards.**\n\n【28】**Study participants**\n\n【29】**A cluster of 10 private healthcare facilities from one state in each geographical region， North， West， South， and East (Punjab， Maharashtra，TamilNadu，Bihar)， who enrolled for Manyata training， were included. A group of 4 nurses from each hospital participated in the Kahoot! quiz.**\n\n【30】**For the qualitative part of the study， 22 to 24 staff nurses， and9 head consultants were selected from these private facilities for focus group discussions and in-depth interviews， respectively. Five assessors were also included for in-depth interviews. The participants were selected using a purposive sampling approach in steps that are described in detail in our previous study \\[5\\].**\n\n【31】**Data collection and analysis**\n\n【32】**Kahoot! a game-based learning platform that was launched in2013， was used to assess the proportion of participants with correct answers for questions based on certain clinical care standards. The pre- and post-training responses for four important questions are focused upon in this study. These are Q1： Glucose test in pregnancy has to be done for all women in non-fasting； Q2： AMTSL for all cases； Q3： Diazepam is the choice for eclampsia management； Q4： Plotting of partograph should be started from 4 cm dilatation of the cervix The pre- and post-training responses of participants were recorded electronically. Data appeared as a report on an excel sheet with the collective percentage (%) of scores for that region. The data analysis was done using STATA/SE 15.1 software and Microsoft Excel. The results were analyzed for the mean difference in the percentage of the correct answer before and after training and statistical significance was calculated using paired t-test.**\n\n【33】**In addition， their overall professional behavior change was explored through Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) with them and In-Depth Interviews (IDIs) with their head consultants and assessors. The interview transcripts were analyzed manually using qualitative thematic analysis. The qualitative data collection and analysis are described in detail in our previous study \\[5\\].**\n\n【34】**Ethical approval**\n\n【35】**Ethical approval for the study was taken from the Institutional Ethics Committee (IEC). All the necessary and relevant documents were submitted to the Ethics Committee. Verbal consent for participation was requested after explaining that participation in the study was entirely voluntary， and confidentiality and anonymity would be strictly maintained. Written consent from the study participants was also obtained through Google forms**\n\n【36】**Results Quantitative analysis**\n\n【37】**Improvement in knowledge as highlighted by Kahoot reports：The pre- and post-training scores represent the percentage of correct answers before and after the training， respectively.**\n\n【38】**As shown in Figures 2， the proportion of participants with correct answers for all questions (representing important clinical standards) has increased post-training in all four states. The pre-training scores of Bihar and Puniab were much lower as compared to the other two states (Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu)， particularly for question related to glucose testing for pregnant women. The proportion of participants with correct answers was as low as 16.7% before training which increased to 89.4% post-training for Q1 in Bihar (Figure 2a). The maximum percentage increase was observed in Bihar which was437%， 99%， and 222%， for questions 1， 2 and 4 respectively. Of all the states， Tamil Nadu had reported the highest pre-training scores for most of the standards studied， which further improved to 100%post-training for the standards related to glucose testing and plotting ofpartograph for pregnant women (Figure 2a-2d).**\n\n【39】**As shown in Figure 3， the statistical hypotheses were tested to determine whether the results were statistically significant using paired t-tests.**\n\n【40】**The analysis of pre- and post-training results of all participants for all questions revealed a significant improvement in the mean percentage of correct answers from 42.5% before training to 82.9%after training with a mean difference of 40.4% with p<0.001 (Figure**\n\n【41】**Figure 1： FOGSI-Manyata clinical standards.**\n\n【42】**3a). Similarly， the difference in the mean percentage of correct answers before and after training was found to be statistically significant with p value <0.05 for each state independently.**\n\n【43】**These results demonstrate a significant improvement in the knowledge and skills of the participants from all the states in different geographical regions for all standards covered in the Manyata training program.**\n\n【44】**Qualitative analysis**\n\n【45】**Positive impact on overall functioning as explored by qualitative data analysis： In alignment with the findings from the pre- and post-test scores of the participant， the qualitative analysis of FGDs with staff nurses， and IDIs with head consultants and assessors also highlighted a strong positive impact of the training program on the beneficiaries.**\n\n【46】**The themes that have emerged out of our qualitative data demonstrate the most significant effects of training on staff nurses and their clinical practice can be summed up as improved motivation to upgrade themselves and others， enhanced practical knowledge and skills， an increased sense of recognition and self-worth， respectful maternity care， overall improved maternal outcomes (Figure 4).**\n\n【47】**Motivated to upgrade themselves and other**\n\n【48】**As perone ofthe assessors， one big challenge influencing maternal outcomes is the motivation of the head of the facility who can， in turn， motivate the staff to learn and improve by taking up training and make the learning a continuous process. The perception of the relevance of training to overcome competency-related challenges is a key motivating factor that can make a difference.**\n\n【49】**“The motivation of the center head that is he or she has to be really motivated so that they allow these girls， the students to attend the training sessions correctly and then they have to have a recap in their own spare facility so that these girls actually understand the practical aspects of that. And it’s basically not a one-day teaching， it has to be like ongoing(Assessor 2).**\n\n【50】**Now， they realized the importance of plotting a partogram and were able to keep a check on the progress of labor through it. They felt more competent and alert than before in diagnosing and managing complicated stages at an early stage.**\n\n【51】**“Partogram has been very useful to us. By plotting partogram， we come to know about the complete situation of the patient and this has helped us a lot. (Nurse 1 FGD1).**\n\n【52】**Sense of recognition and self-worth**\n\n【53】**All the staff nurses stated that their sense of involvement and responsibility had increased manifold which helped them in carrying out their roles and duties effectively. They acknowledged the recognition they received as they applied their learnings from the course to their practice. They not only upskilled themselves but also trained their junior/new staff that offered a huge boost to their sense of self-worth.**\n\n【54】**“Post training， we do whatever we have learnt during the training and after that we inform the madam. We do all the preparations in advance.\"(N3，FGD 1).**\n\n【55】**Respectful maternity care**\n\n【56】**Respectful maternity care during pregnancy and childbirth is not only an important component of quality of care but also every woman has a right to receive it. Head consultants have noticed an improvement in the communication skills of their staff nurses and were elated about the fact that their staff now regularly practiced respectful maternity care and engaged in clinical counseling with the patients.**\n\n【57】**“Sometimes it happens， no， the patient attendant is not very patient， they try to impose “so there they used to get aggressive\". But after this training， most of the time I see that they try to make them understand. They do whatever the attendants are wanting， they dont just blast on them， and the behavior has become very different. When the mother (or a companion) wants to stay with the patient and all those things， they try to console them\". (HC 6).**\n\n【58】**Improved maternal outcomes**\n\n【59】**While most of the head consultants reported that the overall upgraded functioning of their health facilities has received more positive responses from the patients， two of them also highlighted a significant improvement in maternal morbidity and mortality， since the inception of Manyata training.**\n\n【60】**“The morbidity is reduced and undoubtedly you can see the result， the mortality in the whole country and also in our own region， has come down significantly since this Manyata (training) has been rolled in\". (HC 3).**\n\n【61】**Discussion**\n\n【62】**Every human has the right to the highest achievable standard of healthcare. In one of the previous studies， Tripathi et al. documented the poor quality of maternal care， particularly in complications management， in private healthcare facilities analyzed for baseline assessments conducted for the Manyata training in three states of India. Nearly half (47.1%) of all staff nurses in maternity care services at these private medical facilities were found to be underqualified in the baseline assessment \\[4\\]. However， research conducted on the quality of maternal and child care in private medical facilities in India is limited. It becomes imperative to identify and address the quality gaps in maternity care in the private sector as well， in order to significantly improve maternal and perinatal survival and overall health.**\n\n【63】**Upskilling of healthcare staff， and improving their competence through training is essential for not only strengthening the quality of antenatal care but also improving maternal outcomes \\[6\\]. Magnesium Sulphate (MgSO) is an anticonvulsant which is recommended for use to prevent and treat pre-eclampsia/eclampsia， but is being underutilized and not widely adopted in practice， mostly in Low-and Middle-Income Countries (LMIC). The provider competence and confidence in administering MgSO， is one of the major factors limiting its use for PE/E prevention as well as treatment \\[7\\]. Active Management of the Third Stage of Labor (AMTSL)， which includes administration ofuterotonics (preferred oxytocin) just after delivery， is of utmost importance for the prevention of complications \\[8，9\\]. A recent study has reported low skills of healthcare providers as compared to their knowledge on Active Management of Third Stage of Labor (AMTSL) and has recommended continous in-service training for them \\[10\\].**\n\n【64】**In our study， the knowledge and competency of staff nurses**\n\n【65】**around basic aspects of maternal clinical care such as appropriate blood pressure measurement， the glucose test， and plotting of partograph， which are known to be associated with better outcomes， was found to be poor as suggested by their pre-training knowledge assessment scores. Manyata training program has provided one such opportunity for these staff nurses to enhance their knowledge as well as skills on 16 clinical standards， ensuring the provision of quality and safe maternity care services. Based on the pre- and post-training scores captured for four standards from four different geographical areas， the knowledge and skills of staff nurses have improved significantly after the implementation of the Manyata training program. As shown in Figure 2， there is a significant increase in the proportion of participants with correct answers post-training in all four states， however， the impact varied from state to state. The maximum percentage increase was observed in Bihar for questions1， 2， and 4 which are focused on standards related to glucose testing， practicing AMTSL， and plotting partograph for all pregnant cases， respectively. It was observed that the proportion of participants with correct answers was as low as 16.7% before training which increased to 89.4% post-training for one of these standards， which explains the highest percentage increase in Bihar of all the states. On the other hand， Tamil Nadu had the highest proportion of participants giving the correct answers during both pre- and post-training assessments， leading to a 100% result post-training for some of the questions(Figure 2). Our data is aligned with the previous findings which suggest that there is a vast disparity in the key health indicators and the outcomes across the states in India， with Bihar among the worst and Tamil Nadu as one of the best-performing states in terms of maternal and child health indicators \\[11，12\\]. However， our results demonstrate that the Manyata training program has been a game changer in terms of improving the knowledge and skills of all the participants， irrespective of the states and geographical regions they belong to (Figure 3).**\n\n【66】**Ourqualitative analysisSalso suggests their strengthened professionalism in overall functioning at the workplace. The impact of the Manyata training program was found to be positively associated with the motivation levels of head consultants and nurses， to upskill themselves and their team members. Their motivation， in turn， led to improved practical knowledge and skills which helped them with in performing their duties effectively. Their enhanced confidence helped them develop a sense of self-worth and belonging at the workplace which also developed a positive outlook and encouraged cooperative behavior with their patients， enabling the provision of respectful and quality maternity care to them，ultimatelyleading to overall improved maternal outcomes (Figure 4).**\n\n【67】**Conclusion**\n\n【68】**The practical knowledge and competency of staff nurses related to basic aspects of antenatal care such as appropriate blood pressure measurement， the glucose test， and plotting of partograph were found to be suboptimal before training. Our study demonstrates that the Manyata training program has led to a significant improvement in the knowledge and skills of all the participants， irrespective of the states and geographical regions they belong to. The collective learning through these interactive sessions on a digital platform that connected nurses from different facilities， not only made it an interesting process but also provided a competitive environment that motivated them further to outperform. While a few head consultants also emphasized on the need for refresher training and some face-**\n\n【69】**to-face sessions for their staff， there are others who have taken the initiative of training their staff to ensure that the skills acquired from the training are effectively applied at the workplace.**\n\n【70】**Authors'Contribution**\n\n【71】**RM， GVD， SJ， BK， PN， RS and HD conceived and designed the study.

Careful and meticulous examination is crucial before embarking on any surgical interventions. Numerous differential diagnoses is possible for any neck mass and it differs between adult and pediatric patient. The final diagnosis will depend on the patient’s age， the location of the mass， the detail characteristic of the mass as well as the associated symptoms exhibited by the patients. We describe a case of suspicious of branchial cyst which turn out to be a recurrent thyroid tumor.**\n\n【16】**Keywords： Neck mass； Thyroid tumor； Branchial cyst**\n\n【17】**Introduction**\n\n【18】**Neck masses are frequently encountered by surgeons. They are subdivided into midline and lateral neck masses. Cystic neck lesion in adults has to be carefully evaluated to obtain accurate diagnosis and to offer the correct treatment. The commonest midline neck mass in adults is of thyroid gland origin. Thyroid masses are under the subdivision of lower midline neck masses. Examples of thyroid masses are solitary thyroid nodules， multinodular goitre and diffuse thyroid masses. Ultrasound is an excellent technique for imaging the thyroid gland. Solid and cystic lumps can be distinguished and nodules can be characterized with a high degree of accuracy \\[1\\].**\n\n【19】**Branchial Cyst (BC) is one of the commonest examples oflateral cystic neck lesion. It appears as a developmental failure of the branchial apparatus. They often manifest in young adults with an incidence peak in the third decade. Few theories have been suggested to explain the origin of BC， such as the inclusion theory and the branchial apparatus theory. Inclusion theory postulates that BC is epithelial inclusions within a lymph node. This theory is supported by the fact that most BC has lymphoid tissue in their wall. Branchial apparatus theory suggests that branchial cysts represent the remains of pharyngeal pouches or branchial cysts or both and that cysts should be present at birth with peak incidence at the second to third decades \\[2\\]. BC mostly， about 60% located in the upper third of the neck at the anterior margin of the Sternocleidomastoid (SCM) muscle. It is usually persistent and 70% are clinically cystic. Ultrasonography is the modality of choice in cysts \\[3\\].**\n\n【20】**We would like to share our experience of managing a patient presented with left sided neck mass， clinically appeared as branchial cyst but further investigations and final histopathological result was ofthyroid nodular hyperplasia.**\n\n【21】**Case Presentation**\n\n【22】**A 33-year old， Malay lady with history thyroid surgery 20 years ago for multinodular goitre， presented to Otorhinolaryngology clinic in September 2017 with complaints of a left anterolateral neck swelling. The swelling is painless and gradually creasing in size for more than 14 years of duration. The patient was asymptomatic. She had no obstructive symptoms， voice changes， hypo or hyperthyroid symptoms or any constitutional symptoms.**\n\n【23】**Examination of neck revealed a huge left anterolateral cystic lesion， measuring about 15.0cm x 10.0 cm， extending superiorly to the lower border of the left mandible， inferiorly to just above the clavicle (Figure 1). Laterally， the mass extends up to the posterior border of the left sternocleidomastoid muscle and medially， it encroaching the midline. There was also surgical scar which most probably could be due to previous thyroidectomy scar. Nasal， ear， laryngeal， cranial nerves and other systemic examinations were unremarkable.**\n\n【24】**The patient was treated as having branchial cysts until the Fine Needle Aspiration and Cytology(FNAC) findings were reported as colloid nodule with cystic degeneration.Ultrasonography of neck**\n\n【25】**Figure 1： Huge left neck mass overlying the sternomastoid muscle which was cystic and fluctuant on clinical examination.**\n\n【26】Figure 2： Enlarged thyraid gland with multiple well defined cystic and solid lesions， which displaced and compressed the trachea to the right (red arrow).\n\n【27】**interpreted that features are of multinodular goitre. Blood tests such as the thyroid function test and the serum calcium levels were within normal range. Patient was then planned for computer tomography in order to ascertain the origin of the mass and to rule out features of malignancy in view of it is long standing nature. The CT scan reported as the thyroid gland was grossly enlarged with multiple well defined cystic and solid lesions， predominantly cystic lesions. The largest lesion was in the left thyroid gland， measuring 9.1 cmx9.1 cm x8.8 cm without retrosternal extension. The lesion caused mass effect to the airway where it compressed and displaced the trachea postero-laterally， and the surrounding structures involving supraglottic， glottic and subglottic region， seen at the level of C2/C3 cervical body till T1/T2 level (Figure 2).**\n\n【28】**Subsequently， she underwent completion thyroidectomy in January 2018 which revealed a cystic mass overlying the carotid sheath (Figure 3). The mass was excised leaving the carotid sheath content intact (Figure 4). Her histopathological report was nodular hyperplasia of thyroid. Eight months postoperative，the patient is well with no complication and she was pleased with the surgery as her aesthetic has significantly improved.**\n\n【29】**Discussion**\n\n【30】**The aim of presenting this case is to show the diversity of the differential diagnosis of the neck mass in our patient. Initially with the location and examination of neck mass， a provisional diagnosis of branchial cyst was speculated but after further investigation like FNAC， ultrasonography and CT scan of the neck， the provisional diagnosis was directed towards multinodular goitre. The location of neck mass and imaging appearances gives surgeon the gross**\n\n【31】**Figure 3： Intraoperatively， the mass was cystic and intimately lies on the carotid sheath (carotid artery， vagal nerve and internal jugular vein).**\n\n【32】**Figure 4： The mass was removed in total，leaving the vagal nerve intact. The mass measured 15.0 cm x11.0cm.**\n\n【33】**idea on the provisional and differential diagnosis. The initial examination of this patient which revealed a very cystic and fluctuant mass giving the impression it could be a branchial cyst. This were supported by its typical location at lateral neck region overlying the sternocleidomastoid， the patient's age as well as presence of extensive surgical scar which could be due to total thyroidectomy.**\n\n【34】**A differential diagnosis of midline neck masses are numerous and includes subcutaneous lesions (epidermoid cysts， dermoid cysts， teratoid cysts and lipoma)， thyroglossal ducts cysts， lymph nodes and thyroid masses. Differential diagnosis for lateral neck masses on the other hand， is divided into skin and subcutaneous lesions (epidermoid cysts， dermoid cysts， teratoid cysts and lipoma)， developmental masses (lymphangiomas and branchial cysts)， lymph nodes (infectious， inflammatory and neoplastic)， neurogenic tumors(neurofibromas and schwannomas)， vascular tumors (carotid body tumors) and salivary glands.**\n\n【35】**In view of wide differential diagnoses， meticulous examination and complete work up is necessary in managing any patients who presented with neck mass. This is crucial in order to come to a correct final diagnosis and proper treatment can be instituted. Sixty percent of BC is located in the upper third of the neck， anterior to the sternocleidomastoid muscle， but they may appear anywhere in neck or even in the parotid gland. Detection of a cystic mass in the lateral neck region should always raise a possibility of thyroid nodule\\[4\\]. Seventy percent are cystic， although up to 30% may be solid. Regional lymph node metastasis from the Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC) of the upper aerodigestive tract might mimic BC in imaging if it undergoes cystic degeneration. Cystic degeneration in cervical metastasis from Waldeyer’s ring is estimated to be 33% to 62%\\[5\\].**\n\n【36】**Imaging commonly used for neck masses are Ultrasound (US)， Computer Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging(MRI). US is the initial method of imaging， as it is relatively cheap，**\n\n【37】**well tolerated， absence of ionizing radiation and provides excellent resolution and contrast of the extra cranial head and neck \\[6\\]. US is very useful in cases where Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology (FNAC) is needed and it displays the intracystic architecture and vascularity. In older patients with cystic lateral neck lesions， ultrasound with CT or MRI is the best investigation modality \\[7\\].**\n\n【38】**In BC， US display various echogenicities without intrinsic vascularity on color Doppler. The typical snowstorm' appearance is seen on pressing the transducer against the tissue. This is due to the movement of the cholesterol crystals \\[8\\]. The role of US-guided FNAC is questionable when assessing cystic lesions because FNAC has a high false-negative rate (38% to 63%) \\[9\\]. However， BC is differentiated from HNSCC metastasis by evaluating the cell ploidy using flow cytometry DNA analysis of the FNAC samples \\[10\\]. The simple cyst depicts thin， smooth rim and mucoid content of low density in CT， whereas in MRI， uncomplicated BC has low T1-Weighted (T1W) and high T2W signal intensity. An infected cyst will possess thick， irregular， enhancing and maybe septated rim in CT. In MRI an infected cyst will show high signal intensity in both T1W and T2W images. Contrasted images will display an enhanced cystic wall\\[71.**\n\n【39】**The commonest midline neck lump in adult is of thyroid gland origin. Thyroid cysts commonly appear as a solitary thyroid nodule of variable size， are painless unless have a hemorrhagic component within. Thyroid cysts usually are fluctuant or tense and on the contrary， adenomas are usually solid. True epithelial thyroid cysts are rare. Cystic thyroid lesions are mostly due to haemorrhage or degeneration within a hyperplastic nodule (part of a multinodular goitre). Toxic and non-toxic multinodular goitres are painless too and have multiple nodules of variable size and shape. In cases of thyroid masses， ultrasound is an excellent choice ofimaging and they appear as well-defined，heterogeneous nodules with cystic component and internal septa. The comet tail sign is occasionally seen and it suggests the presence of colloid within \\[11\\]. Multinodular thyroid is diagnosed when multiple cystic nodules are present. Ultrasound with fine-needle aspiration cytology is the first-line investigation in cases with solitary thyroid nodule. The presence of punctuate calcifications and chaotic intranodular vascularity on Doppler will raise suspicion of malignancy， hence ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration is advocated \\[12\\]. CT scan is usually performed in thyroid mass to look for the retrosternal extension， to assess any compression on adjacent structures like the trachea and the major neck vessels (internal and external carotid artery and internal jugular vein) as well as suspicious features of malignancy such as presence of metastatic lymph nodes and area of central necrosis.**\n\n【40】**Conclusion**\n\n【41】**It is imperative to investigate for a correct diagnosis of any neck mass as the subsequent surgical plan will depends on the final pathology diagnosis. This will avoid unnecessary surgical morbidities and improve patient's post-operative outcomes.**\n\n【42】**References**\n\n【43】**1\\. Prakash PK， Hanna FW.

In the current study we analyzed the level of seminal zinc concentration in various group of infertile males and to link it with sperm concentrations， inactive， active and immotile fractions of seminal constraints， with an obiective to begin the role of zinc. The present five years descriptive study was conceded in the Public Health Laboratory， Department of Reproductive Health， National Institute of Health， and Islamabad， Pakistan from 2006 to2010. Outcomes of our study showed that semen zinc was several folds higher in polyzoospermic as compared to other group while lower in Azoo， oligo and oligoasthenozoospermia group. Concentrations of seminal zinc were 598.48±12.95，617.54±9.55，702.92±10.60，710.36±7.87 and762.06±8.99 in oligozoospermic， asthenozoospermic， azoospermic，teratozoospermic and proven father group respectively. The level of semen zinc varied and non-significantly (p>0.05) in proven father with polyzoospermic. This study concluded that decreased concentration of seminal plasma zinc affect the numbers of sperms count while increased level causes decreased sperm motility.**\n\n【14】**Keywords： Seminal zinc； Infertile male； Islamabad**\n\n【15】**Introduction**\n\n【16】**Infertility of males and females is defined as deficiency to reproduce， while fertility is the capacity to reproduce \\[1\\].

The level of semen zinc varied and non-significantly (p>0.05) in proven father with polyzoospermic.**\n\n【26】**Discussion**\n\n【27】**Zinc element is considerably influenced the sperm motility. Hardening of the outer dense fibers by development of Disulfide Bridge through epididymis sperm maturation appears to be an important physiologic phase for the generation of sperm motility particularly progressive motility \\[9\\].Male sterilityand sub sterility has been associated with zinc deficiency. Mc-Graw reported that sperm counts dropped from a mean of 283 million/ml to 45 million/ml with2 to 14 months in zinc limited diet in five middle aged men \\[10\\]. Male infertility made by zinc limited diet is not yet fully understood because of complexity of its mechanism， however， zinc is believed to be involved in several assimilated processes linked with reproduction and has been stated seminal zinc concentration was lower in patients with idiopathic sub fertility than in normal control \\[11\\].**\n\n【28】**In another study， it has been observed that geometric means of the seminal plasma zinc concentration was found to be significantly lower (p<0.05) in the infertile group compared with those in the fertile group \\[12\\]. In contrast， other authors had reported normal and even increased seminal plasma zinc levels in infertile males， but such studies are very low in magnitude. The probable explanation could be that zinc in semen is responsible for motility， therefore， it may not effect in both oligozoospermic and azoospermic groups\\[13，14\\]. We also found decrease level of semen zinc in azoospermic， oligozoospermic， asthenozoospermic and oligozoospermic groups.**\n\n【29】**High zinc content had also been reported in seminal plasma and has been associated with a high degree of sperm cell motility \\[15\\]， it has also been reported that extra cellular zinc performances as an inhibitor of human sperm motility and acrosome reaction \\[16\\]. In other study found that zinc content in seminal plasma was associated negatively with progressive sperm motility \\[17\\]， while in contrast to this study others reported no significant correlation of seminal plasma zinc with motility of sperms in oligozoospermic males \\[13，18\\]. Whereas， we in our study found that seminal plasma zinc in those subjects having more than 50% of motility had significant increased concentration than those having decrease (<50%) of motility.**\n\n【30】**In the present study， we observed significant decrease in seminal plasma zinc level in asthenozoospermic group. These results are in consistent with earlier studies \\[19\\]. Our results deferred from another study， who had reported normal and even increased seminal plasma zinc level in oligozoospermic and azoospermic males respectively\\[14\\].**\n\n【31】**Conclusion**\n\n【32】**We observed that decreased concentration of seminal plasma zinc do affect the sperm count and sperm motility. So it is important that carefully administration of zinc should be in those patients who have normal sperm motility but having low sperm count. In such cases seminal plasma zinclevel should be measured before treatment， since adequate seminal plasma content of zinc is required for normal sperm function.**\n\n【33】**References**\n\n【34】**1\\.

In addition， a higher level of multiple micronutrient deficiency and exposure to heavy metals through environment priming the health issue. The etiology of anemia is multi-factorial， among physiological iron deficiency and hemopoietic toxicity caused by Lead (Pb) are considered as important. Current study aimed to unveil serum essential element (Fe， Zn， Cu， Mg and Ca)， blood Pb and Cd levels among anemic (Group-A； n=77) and non-anemic children (Group-B， n=77). Blood Pb， Cd and serum elements were quantified by Graphite Furnace and Flame Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy， respectively. Hemoglobin， reticulocyte count and 8-Aminolevulenic Acid Dehydratase (8-ALAD) activity were also assessed. Mean Hb， serum Fe and 8-ALAD activity was significantly (p<0.01) lower in Group-A compared to Group-B. Blood Cd levels were non-detectable， whereas mean Pb levels were higher among Group-A compared to Group-B but in prescribed safe limits (<10ug/dL). Group-A children's serum Fe levels correlated positively with ALADactivity(p<0.05)，serum Zn and Ca levels (p<0.01)； whereas a significant (p<0.01) inverse correlation was noted between Hb levels and serum Zn levels.Elevation of 8-ALAD activity is presumed under IDA to meet the physiological requirement of Hb， but in the current study despite severe anemia in Group-A no such observation was noted. In conclusion， anemia among Group-A children may be iron deficient rather induced by hematopoietic toxicity. Further， Zn deficiency is more prevalent in children of both the groups， which need intervention strategies. Dual deficiency effect of Fe and Zn on physiological levels and function of 8-ALAD activity needs to be elucidated.**\n\n【11】**Keywords： Iron deficiency anemia； Blood Pb levels； 6-ALAD； Seru essential elements**\n\n【12】**Introduction**\n\n【13】**Anemia is a condition in which the number of red blood cells is insufficient to meet the body's physiologic needs. It is a widespread public health problem associated with an increased risk of morbidity and mortality， especially in pregnant women and young children \\[1\\]. The etiology for anemia is a multi-factorial classified as nutritional such as vitamin and mineral deficiencies as well as non-nutritional such as infection and hemoglobinopathies. It is well documented that nutritional anemia is the most prevalent condition compared to non-nutritional anemia； further about 50% of the anemia is due to iron deficiency， and the remainder due to other causes \\[1\\]. The prevalence of anemia is particularly high in developing countries， where 39% of children under five years old， 48%of 5 to 14 year old children， 42% of all women and 52% of pregnant women are anemic \\[1\\].**\n\n【14】**The diagnostic procedures to determine anemia involves a number of tests such as physical examination of conjunctiva， tongue and laboratory tests such as estimation of hemoglobin， reticulocyte count， complete blood picture， peripheral smear for shape and size of RBCs， serum iron and ferritin levels. A set of any of these tests may give an indication of type of anemia. A normal Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV) associated with an increased reticulocyte count suggest rapid RBC loss， as in hemolysis or acute blood volume loss \\[2\\]. Multiple micronutrient deficiencies often coexist in populations in developing countries. A deficiency of one micronutrient may influence the absorption， metabolism and/or excretion of another micronutrient \\[1\\]. Moreover， excess zinc ingestion is a cause of copper deficiency \\[3\\].**\n\n【15】**On the other hand， the heavy metals such as Lead (Pb)， Cadmium (Cd)， Mercury (Hg) and**\n\n【16】**Arsenic (As) are known as potential environmental contaminants and pose public health problem. Further， due to vast industrial applications of Pb， lack of enforcement strategies coupled with awareness， the population of developing countries are more prone to exposure \\[4\\]. The recent studies suggested a higher prevalence of blood lead levels(BLL) among the children residing in the industrial area compared to urban； whereas the children from rural background had no exposure to Pb. Similarly the accumulation of Cd has raised concern recently due to its vast industrial and agricultural practices \\[5\\]. It was proposed that Pb and Cd are similar to trace element， and may enter in to blood stream through “Divalent Metal Ion Transporter-1'(DMT-1). The recent studies suggest that iron deficiency further increases absorption per se of Pb \\[6\\]. Exposure to Pb affects many organs， primarily hemopoietic， renal and central nervous systems， especially in growing children and pregnant women. The recent reports suggest that subclinical Pb toxicity affects the heme synthesis by inhibiting the 6-Aminolevulenic Acid Dehydratase activity (6-ALAD)， which is one of the key enzymes in heme synthesis \\[7，8\\]. It is well established fact that inhibited 8-ALAD activity' has been considered as a hallmark of“Pb toxicity， whereas in iron deficiency this enzyme levels were also altered. Our studies on induction of iron deficiencyin laboratory animals through dietary restriction have shown the elevated levels of 8-ALAD activity to meet the physiological levels of hemoglobin \\[9\\].**\n\n【17】**In view of the given background， current study aimed to determine the serum essential element levels (Fe，Zn， Cu， Mg & Ca)， blood Pb and Cd levels as well as their interactions， if any， in anemic children undergoing blood transfusion.**\n\n【18】**Methods Study design and selection of subjects**\n\n【19】**A cross sectional case-control study was conducted among children from ‘Pediatric division of Niloufer Hospital， Hyderabad， India. The National Family Health Survey-4， India (NFHS-4： 2015-16) reported prevalence of moderate and severe anemia were 30%and 2% respectively among children. Therefore， considering total prevalence as 32%， an odds ratio 2.6 and power 90， a sample size of154 was arrived.**\n\n【20】**Anemic children (Group-A； n=77) admitted in the pediatric in-patient ward of Niloufer Hospital for ‘Blood Transfusion’ were enrolled as study subjects. The children with moderate (Hb： 8.00%g to 9.99% g) to severe (Hb<8.00% g) anemia was included in the study (WHO Criteria). Children aged between 1.6 to 11.0 years， with no history of previous blood transfusion were included in the study. Similarly age and sex matched non-anemic’ children (Group-B； n=77) admitted in the same in-patient ward suffering from ‘other than anemia'were selected as control subjects. The children who have the history of blood transfusion， evidence of hemolysis/blood loss， hemotological malignancy and chronic diseases were excluded from the study.**\n\n【21】**The information on age， height， weight， clinical signs and symptoms’ forr anemia， heavy metal toxicity andd nutritional deficiencies were collected using a pre-tested questionnaire. In addition the information on dietary habits and cooking practices was alsocollected from the attendants of subjects. The studyandprocedures were approved by Institutional Review Board (Institutional Ethics Committee for Human Studies) of the ICMR-National Institute of Nutrition， Hyderabad， India. As per the recommendations of IRB， written consent was obtained from the participants or their parents.**\n\n【22】**Sample collection**\n\n【23】**Approximately 3.0 mL of blood was collected by venipuncture from all the children. Two aliquots of blood samples were prepared using vacutainer tubes， one for whole blood and other aliquot was used for serum. The blood samples from Group-A children were collected before the blood transfusion. Peripheral blood smear was prepared for examination of abnormalities in RBC， WBC and platelets. Reticount was performed to determine the percentage of reticulocytes.**\n\n【24】**Laboratory Analysis**\n\n【25】**Estimation of serum albumin and hemoglobin levels**\n\n【26】**Serum albumin levels were estimated as described by Doumas &Biggs. \\[10\\]， based on increase in absorbance of Bromocresol Green(BCG) at 630 nm. Binding of the dye to serum albumin at pH 4.2 is directly proportional to the concentration of albumin estimated using Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) as standard. The Hemoglobin (Hb%) levels were determined by cyanmethemoglobin method， briefly， 20uL of blood was mixed with 5.0 mL of‘Drabkins reagent'(Potassium Ferric Cyanide Solution) and allowed to stand for 5 min to develop color. The color intensity was measured at 540 nm against known standard using Spectrophotometer (UNICAM-UV 300， Thermo， Cambridge，UK).

In brief， aliquots of 50 uL heparinized whole blood were added to Saponin buffer with and without aminolevulenic acid' as substrate and each was incubated at 37°C for 1 h. After termination of the reaction by addition of 50 uL trichloroacetic acid-HgCl2 solution， the samples were centrifuged (1000 × g， 5 min， 25°C). The resulting supernatant was isolated and combined with an equal volume of freshly-prepared modified Ehrlich reagent. After 10 min at 25°C， the absorbance of the mixture was determined at 553 nm using the UV300 spectrophotometer. ALAD activity (as nM/hr/mL blood) in each sample was calculated as=(OD553×1378).**\n\n【33】**Prevalence of deficiency/toxicity and interactions**\n\n【34】**The WHO criteria followed for categorization of anemia in to moderate (Hb： 8.00% g to 9.99% g) to severe (Hb： <8% g). The prevalence of micronutrient deficiencies was computed considering the cut-off values of serum Fe (<70 ug/dL)， Zn (<70 ug/dL)， Cu (<80hg/dL)，Mg (<1.8 mg/dL) and Ca (<8.0 mg/dL). The safe cut offlimits for blood Pb and Cd levels were considered as <10.0 ug/dL and <0.12ug/dL in children (CDC， Atlanta). The interactions/associations between essential elements and Pb， ALAD activity was assessed using statistical method of \"Pearson’s correlation co-efficiency.**\n\n【35】**Statistical analysis**\n\n【36】**Mean and Standard Deviation (SD) were calculated for all the variables. The student t-test was applied to assess the statistical difference in mean levels of various parameters between two groups.

Serum mean Mg levels were significantly (p<0.01) higher in Group-A children compared to their counterparts (Figure 2). Group-A children serum Ca levels ranged from 4.8 mg/dL to 15.3 mg/dL， whereas in Group-B it ranged from 9.6 mg/dL to 14.2 mg/dL. A significant (p<0.01) low levels of serum Ca was noted in Group-A children compared to their counterpart children (Figure 2).**\n\n【58】**Blood Pb， Cd levels and ALAD activ ity**\n\n【59】**Blood cadmium levels were below the detection limits (0.1 ppb) in children of both the groups. While， the Blood Lead Levels (BLL) varied widely among Group-A children. The BLLs were ranging from0.15 ug/dL to 39.81 ug/dL in Group-A， whereas in Group-B children were 0.18 ug/dL to 8.14 ug/dL (Figure 1). The mean BLL were 4.9±7.45 ug/dL and 2.4±2.12 ug/dL in Group-A and Group-B children， respectively. Though the mean BLL of Group-A children were significantly (p<0.05) higher than Group-B， they were within the cut-off limits specified (<10 ug/dL) by CDC， Atlanta. The ALAD activity of the Group-A and Group-B children were ranged from 52.0 nM/mL to 841.0 nM/mL and 267 nM/mL to 909nM/mL erythrocytes/hr， respectively. The mean ALAD activity of Group-A children (437.8±215.93 nM/mL erythrocytes/h) was significantly (p<0.01) lower than counterparts (583.0±142.07nM/mL erythrocytes/h)(Figure 1).**\n\n【60】**Prevalence of deficiency and toxicity**\n\n【61】**Among Group-A children， moderate anemia was noted in 55%children， whereas， severe anemia in 45% suggesting the need to undergo the blood transfusion.

About 12% of the children from both the categories were deficient for serum Cu levels. The serum Mg levels were deficient in 4% and 18%of the children from Group-A and Group-B， respectively. Whereas， serum Ca levels were deficient in 7% of children from Group-A， but no such deficiency was observed in their counterpart children.**\n\n【62】**Ten percent of Group-A children had BLL above 10 pg/dL， the safe cut-off limits set by Centre for Disease Control and Prevention， Atlanta， USA.

Blood Pb levels didn't correlated either with Hb levels， ALAD activity and serum elementallevels except with serum Caand albumin levels in Group-A. However， Group-A children's serum Fe levels correlated positively with ALAD activity (p<0.05)， serum Zn and Ca levels (p<0.01)(Figure 3). Whereas， a significant (p<0.01) inverse correlations was noted between Hb levels and serum Zn levels among Group-A children (Table 4).**\n\n【66】**Blood Pb levels of Group-B children correlate inversely with serum Zn (p<0.01)andMg(p<0.05)levels (Table 4). Nonetheless， the ALAD activity was correlated positively with serum Zn (p<0.01) and Mg (p<0.05) levels in Group-B children. Whereas， neither Hb nor serum Fe levels have shown correlations with either BLL or serum elemental levels among Group-B children.**\n\n【67】**Discussion**\n\n【68】**Iron Deficient Anemia (IDA) is still a devastating public health issue in the third world countries like India. It is well established that the etiology for anemia is a multi-factorial and classified as nutritional deficiencies such as vitamin and minerals， as well as non-nutritional such as infection and hemoglobinopathies. It is noteworthy to mention that the predominant cause of anemia is due to iron deficiency， which could be attributed to inadequate dietary intake or consumption of foods with low amounts of bio-available Fe along with presence of inhibitors such as phytic acid and low intake of animal foods \\[1，12\\].**\n\n【69】**Physicians relies on pale conjunctiva and bald tongue’ as characteristic ‘sign and symptom’of anemia. In the current study， Group-A children were moderate to severe anemic and were undergoing for blood transfusion. Majority of children from Group-A had characteristic feature of pale conjunctiva (>98%) and bald tongue. In addition， significantly lower levels of Hb， serum Fe and albumin levels among the anemic children suggests the magnitude of Iron Deficiency Anemia’ among Group-A children. As per the WHO criteria of anemia categorization， severe anemia was noted among 45% of children and moderated anemia was55% in the anemic children.

This was further corroborated with a 2 fold increase in reticulocyte count (above 1.0%) and ‘microcytic hypochromic condition'among anemic children compared to non-anemic children suggest a rapid turnover of the reticulocytes. It is well established fact that a high reticulocyte percentage or count reflects a marrow that is attempting to compensate for red cell destruction， or recovering from anemia\\[13\\]. It is noteworthy to mention that， neither the metal toxicity nor other nutritional deficiency ‘signs and symptoms' were noted among children of either of the groups.**\n\n【75】**Recently thegrowing evidence suggests the association/relationship _中_ existbetween‘multiplemicronutrients'， further deficiency of one micronutrient may influence the levels of other micronutrients \\[8，14，15\\]. In the current study， the serum Fe levels were deficient in the anemic children； in addition to this， they were deficient for other essential elements such as serum Zn， Cu， Mg and Ca levels. A decade of studies conducted by ICMR-NIN， Hyderabad in different vulnerable groups such as children， pregnant/postpartum women and livestock suggest an inter-relationship exist between Fe and Zn along with other essential elements \\[8，16，17\\]. Further， it is alarming to note that Zn deficiency is more rampant in this population as compared to Fe deficiency. Trace mineral deficiencies usually occur when dietary intake is inadequate or result from metabolic imbalances produced by antagonistic or synergistic interactions among metals \\[3\\].**\n\n【76】**Plethora of literature suggests that Pb exposure results in hemopoietic toxicity \\[6，8\\]. In the current study though the mean BLLs of anemic children were higher compared to non-anemic children， but within specified limits (<10 ug/dL) of CDC， Atlanta. So the anemia among Group-A children could be due to nutritional deficiency. Further， higher mean of BLL in anemic children compared to controls could be due to increased absorption per se of Pb under essential elemental deficiency， which could be mediated through Divalent Metal ion Transporter-1(DMT-1) at the mucosal surface \\[1，8\\]. Our previous studies of dietary iron restriction followed by Pb exposure have shown significantly higher BLL suggesting the increased absorption through GI tract under Fe deficient condition \\[9\\].**\n\n【77】**The associations between BLLs， ALAD activity， Hb and serum essential element levels have been considered to illustrate the relationship between different functional parameters \\[6\\]. Serum albuminlevelsarelongbeenconsidered asan index ofhealthand disease status. In the current study anemic children had hypoalbuminism， which could be malnutrition/altered nutrition or low protein intake by the children. In addition， significant positive correlations were**\n\n【78】**noted between serum albumin levels with serum Cu， Mg， Ca and Pb. It is well established fact that albumin acts as buffering agent and involved in transportation of a variety of substances (ligands) include endogenous substances such as bilirubin and fatty acids， metals and other ions， hormones， as well as exogenous substances such as folic acid and drugs \\[18，19\\]. The positive association between albumin and Pb could be to attributed to presence of -thiol’group containing amino acids in albumin， which has higher affinitytowards Pb， and deficiency of essential elementals might have increased the Pb absorption per se \\[8，14\\]. In addition， significant inverse relationship between Zn & Hb and positive association of Fe with ALAD and Zn suggests the importance of co-factors’ for heme synthesis. Similarly， complex interactions were noted between different essential elements in both anemic and non-anemic children infers the interdependency of various elements to perform physiological function. Lack of data on serum ferritin/transferrin levels and MCV are the limitations of current study， whereas the strengths are quantification of various essential elements and heavy metals and assessing their interactions.**\n\n【79】**Conclusion**\n\n【80】**The results of present study conclude that anemia among the Group-A children may be iron deficient rather heavy metal induced hematopoietic toxicity. Further， Zn deficiency is more prevalent in children of both the groups， which need intervention strategies. Dual deficiency effect of Fe and Zn on physiological levels and function of8-ALAD activity needs to be elucidated.**\n\n【81】**Acknowledgment**\n\n【82】**We thank Head - Pediatrics Division， Niloufer Hospital and Dr. B.

However， this link of causality is not clearly established for peritoneal mesothelioma.**\n\n【15】**Case report： We present the case of a 47 year-old man， versatile worker in a craft brickyard. He was exposed to asbestos fibers emitted of an oven used forthepreparation ofbricks. The patient presented abdominal pains and decreased sense of general state. An abdominal scanning was realized showing a diffuse infiltration in peritoneal fat and an effusion of the vesical wall. The histological examination showed a peritoneal mesothelioma associated with a vesical tumor.**\n\n【16】**Occupational origin of the peritoneal mesothelioma was held in front of the chronic exposure to the asbestos. Thus， a statement of occupational disease in conformance with the legislation in force was made**\n\n【17】**Conclusion： In this case， the chronic and important asbestos exposures as well as the absence ofother risk factors are towards the incrimination of this fiber in the emergence of peritoneal mesothelioma.**\n\n【18】**Keywords： Peritoneum； Mesothelioma； Asbestos； Profession**\n\n【19】**Introduction**\n\n【20】**Mesothelioma is a rare tumor that affects the cells of the mesothelium， a protective membrane that covers most internal organs of the body including the pleura， peritoneum and pericardium \\[1\\].**\n\n【21】**Several agents likely to induce this mesothelioma were reported such as exposure to erionitis， viral infections， vaccine products and/or genetic susceptibility \\[2，3\\]. Although the causal link between pleural mesothelioma and asbestos exposure is well established， this relationship is still controversial for peritoneal mesothelioma. Thus， we report a case of peritoneal mesothelioma observed in a worker who has an occupational exposure to asbestos.**\n\n【22】**Case Presentation**\n\n【23】**The patient was a 48-year-old， active smoker at 45 packages/year， without significant pathological history. He had worked as a versatile worker in craft brickyard for 19 years. His duties included mixing raw materials intended to be placed in an oven containing friable asbestos used as a thermal insulator. This oven was old and worn， which could emit asbestos fibers under the effect of shock and air movements. Then， the patient was responsible for molding， drying and waiting for the cooling of these bricks to take them out of the oven. At the end of the shift， he was cleaning the oven with a brush that contained asbestos dust.**\n\n【24】**However， the patient reported bad industrial hygiene conditions， and lack of protective respiratory devices. Also， no medical supervision in the context of occupational medicine was provided to him. Besides smoking and asbestos， anamnesis did not disclose other significant exposures to occupational or environmental carcinogens.**\n\n【25】**The history of the disease was marked by a gradual onset of abdominal pain and distension associated with anorexia， asthenia and weight loss. Physical examination found an abdominal distension without a palpable mass. The patient was investigated with thoraco-abdominopelvic Computed Tomography (CT) which revealed a diffuse in filtration of peritoneal fat with an important intra-peritoneal effusion and focal effusion of the left and lateral wall of the bladder.**\n\n【26】**However， radiological investigations of the thorax did not reveal any signs of asbestos impregnation. Histopathological examination of bioptic samples performed on peritoneal and bladder lesions led to a diagnosis of malignant peritoneal mesothelioma of the epitheloid type associated with urothelial bladder carcinoma. The patient was treated with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy and six sessions of systemic chemotherapy and endoscopic treatment of his bladder tumor. The initial evolution was marked by a partial improvement of its general state. In the absence of medical coverage at work， the patient resumed his usual professional activity. Approximately three years later， the patient was hospitalized for continuous， slowly worsening abdominal pain. Total body Positron Emission Tomography (PET) showed diffuse epiploic mesenteric infiltration associated with peritoneal thickening and an important ascites evoking a recurrence of peritoneal mesothelioma. No signs of recurrence of the bladder tumor were objectified. The patient was referred to a department of occupational pathologies to study the accountability of this illness to his profession. The occupational origin of this peritoneal mesothelioma was found in front of the chronic asbestos exposure present in the ovens of the brick factory， objectified by a post office study carried out by the occupational doctor. Tunisian Judicial Authority recognized the occupational origin of mesothelioma.**\n\n【27】**Discussion**\n\n【28】**Malignant Peritoneal Mesothelioma (MPL) is a rare disease whose spontaneous evolution remains fatal \\[4\\]. Its epidemiology is complicated because of the possible geographical and temporal variations. In all mesotheliomas， peritoneal mesothelioma occurs， in order of frequency， the second place after pleural localization.**\n\n【29】**In addition， peritoneal malignant mesothelioma accounts for10% to 30% of malignant mesotheliomas with an annual incidence estimated at 1 in 500000 in France and 1 in 200000 in certain regions of Europe (Italy) \\[5\\]. It occurs preferentially in the elderly with an average age ranging from 47 years to 60.5 years \\[6\\]. Three forms of mesothelioma are described with different physiopathology， morphology， anc prognosis： diffuse malignant mesothelioma， well-differentiated papillarymesothelioma， and multi-cystic mesothelioma. Among the malignant mesotheliomas， three types areindividualized： The diffuse epithelioidmesothelioma (the most common) and which was observed in our case， sarcomatoid mesothelioma and biphasic mesothelioma \\[6\\]. Exposure to asbestos is the main risk factor for pleural mesothelioma. However， this causality is not clearly established for peritoneal mesothelioma and the debate concerning the mechanism of exposure of peritoneal cells to asbestos remains open. On the other hand， several studies have established a relationship between asbestos exposure and the occurrence of peritoneal mesothelioma \\[7\\].**\n\n【30】**The latter appears， usually as a tumor secondary to a primary source of malignancy， which is pleural mesothelioma. Inhaled asbestos fibers in the lungs would be transported by the lymphatic system to the abdominal cavity， or enter directly into the digestive tract after ingestion. Cancer cells from the primary source could also become mobile and spread through the lymphatic system to other areas， causing metastases 8\\].**\n\n【31】**In our patient， pleuropulmonary lesions were not observed in thoracic radiological investigations， which could be related to a direct mechanism of exposure to asbestos fibers. The link between peritoneal mesothelioma and asbestos exposure has been described**\n\n【32】**previously among workers in different jobs. In the literature， the age of patients ranged from 45 years to 75 years. Job tenure ranged from 7years \\[9\\] to 40 years \\[10\\]. Our patient was working for 19 years before the onset of his illness. The main occupations were： A hairdresser using hair dryers emitting asbestos dust \\[11\\]， a mine worker \\[10\\]， a former soldier \\[12\\] and a worker in buildings handling asbestos cement \\[9\\]. Besides asbestos exposure， these patients with peritoneal mesothelioma had no other risk factors.**\n\n【33】**Thedevelopment of bladdercarcinomaandperitoneal mesothelioma in the same patient is utterly exceptional. Another case was previously observed in a 75-year-old man with significant occupational exposure to asbestos \\[12\\]. Bladder cancer preceded five-year peritoneal mesothelioma. In our case， the diagnosis of urothelial carcinoma was concomitant with that of peritoneal mesothelioma. This association could signal a possible relationship between exposure to asbestos classified as a certain carcinogen for humans by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC)\\[13\\] and bladder cancer. Nevertheless， the histological type， which is different from the two tumors， eliminates the hypothesis of peritoneal mesothelioma metastasized in the bladder. Similarly， the presence of active smoking in our patient would be the most implicated etiological factor in bladder cancer. Another association with renal carcinoma with clear cells has been described by Candura et al. \\[8\\] in 2016. The modalities of expression of the disease were abdominal pain as was the case for our patient， hemorrhagic ascites， \\[14\\] a cutaneous nodule\\[12\\] or a fortuitous finding \\[15\\]. Chrysotile was the form of asbestos most implicated in the occurrence ofperitoneal mesothelioma. There was no documented exposure to products containing amphiboles\\[16\\]. About the histological type， diffuse malignant mesothelioma of the epitheloid type was the most common type and no case of pure Sarcomatoid mesothelioma was reported \\[16\\]. Nevertheless， two cases of biphasic mesothelioma were reported by Candura et al. \\[8\\] and Cabibi et al. \\[16\\] respectively.**\n\n【34】**Finally， our observation is similar to the cases described in the literature from standpoint of exposure to asbestos， the time of onset of the disease， the absence of other risk factors and the histological type revealed. Regarding occupational origin， peritoneal mesothelioma is recognized in our country by our system of compensation as an occupational disease， once the criteria for recognition are established.**\n\n【35】**Conclusion**\n\n【36】**Peritoneal malignant mesothelioma is a rare tumor， for which the etiological role of asbestos exposure is very likely**\n\n【37】**Thus， and given the rapidly evolving nature of this tumor making early detection difficult， setting up technical protection means with monitoring facilities containing asbestos proves essential.**\n\n【38】**References**\n\n【39】**1\\.

No significant changes were noted on the electrocardiogram， and TTE showed no signs of right ventricular pressure overload. Despite high suspicion of pulmonary embolism， computed tomography pulmonary angiography was not performed due to the patient’s refusal. On the second day， increased CTNI levels of 0.576 ng/ml were detected (normal range： 0-0.034 ng/ml) (Figure 2). The patient no longer had symptoms of hemoptysis， and the warfarin continued to be adjusted to make the International Normalized Ratio (INR)**\n\n【48】**Follow-up and outcomes**\n\n【49】**Subsequently， the patient was transported to the catheterization laboratory. Coronary angiography demonstrated 100% occlusive thrombosis in the proximal Left Anterior Descending artery (LAD)(Figure3)，adrug-elutingstentwasimplanted.Serialechocardiographic assessments were performed， and the thrombi gradually decreased in size at five days after adequate anticoagulation and disappeared at 12days after INR reach 2-3 (Figure 1， Supplementary Figure 1).**\n\n【50】**Discussion**\n\n【51】**Biventricular Thrombosis (BT) is a rare but extremely dangerous**\n\n【52】**disease whose epidemiological， etiological and clinical features have not been thoroughly studied. Despite the high prevalence of myocardial infarction， our literature analysis revealed that only 7 case reports of BT associated with MI were available in full.**\n\n【53】**Epidemiology**\n\n【54】**Since the number of BT cases due to MI is extremely rare， we refer to published knowledge on the epidemiology of left ventricular thrombus in myocardial infarction. The incidence of Left Ventricular (LV) thrombus was 6.3% to 15% in patients with ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI)， and 19.2% in those with anterior STEMI and LVEF less than 50%， after the widespread use of Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) \\[1，2\\]. This indicates that BT maybe more common in patients with anterior STEMI and lower LVEF after PCI， just as what we found in our case. Considering the high prevalence of MI， it is possible that the incidence of BT is underestimated. Among seven reported cases associated with BT，3cases were old myocardial infarction and 5 cases of acute MI， and the features of them were list (Table 1).**\n\n【55】**Pathophysiology**\n\n【56】**Thrombus formationinvolyesLthe threecomponentsCof Virchow's triad， which include blood stasis， endothelial injury， and hypercoagulability. Myocardial infarction has acute endothelial exposure with associated loss of myocardial contractility， and particularly anterior myocardial infarction with low LVEF， often involves the apex and can lead to blood stasis and endothelial injury \\[1\\]. Blood stasis can be triggered by myocardial akinesis or dyskinesis， while endothelial injury can cause inflammation and hypercoagulability by exposing subendothelial tissue and collagen to the circulating blood， leading to the formation of thrombus\\[11\\]. A 32-year-old male was reported to have an acute myocardial infarction combined with thrombosis that occurred after cocaine ingestion \\[5\\]. The mechanisms of cocaine-induced myocardial infarction include coronary artery spasm and unstable plaques \\[12\\]. Myocardialinfarction occurs when fragile， but not necessarily narrow atherosclerotic plaques are disrupted under hemodynamic stress \\[13\\]. In our cases， as seen in the literature， anterior myocardial infarction with low LVEF supported the formation of BT.**\n\n【57】**Acquired and hereditary risk factorsSoften trigger hypercoagulability， accelerating thrombosis and embolism， such as Factor V Leiden mutation， antiphospholipid antibody syndrome， heparin-induced thrombocytopenia， anddanticoagulant protein deficiency. There has been one reported case of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) complicating anterior wall MI leading to BT formation， where COVID-19-induced hypercoagulability has been widely discussed \\[14\\]. Our patient had no history of long-term medication use and showed no evidence of hereditary hypercoagulability，suggesting that decreasedventricular wall contraction caused by myocardial infarction was the key factor in thrombus formation.**\n\n【58】**Diagnosis**\n\n【59】**Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) is considered the gold standard for diagnosing intracardiac thrombi， but it's not commonly used in clinical practice. Instead， BT is usually found incidentally during routine TTE. Out of the seven cases reported，only one was diagnosed with BT through CMI \\[6\\]， while the others were diagnosed through TTE. This patient underwent a comprehensive evaluation at a community hospital， but incomplete testing may have led to**\n\n【60】**missed diagnoses. During the further TTE exam， low echogenicity intracardiac masses were observed， along with a decreased Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) and weakened ventricular wall contraction. This finding is consistent with the five other cases reported where Myocardial Infarction (MI) was associated with BT. All of these patients had a significant drop in LVEF， with four of them having an LVEF below 30% (excluding the three cases where LVEF was not mentioned) (Table 1). This supports the idea that decreased ventricular wall contraction resulting from MI is one of the key factors in BT formation， caused by slow blood flow and stasis.**\n\n【61】**Anterior STEMI， proximal LAD infarction， and LVEF below 30%are strong predictors of LV thrombus. However，thrombus formation can also occur in patients with an LVEF greater than 30% or in those with diabetes， which is a major cause of asymptomatic myocardial infarction. Therefore， health education should remind patients to watch their juice intake， as consuming more than 100% of daily recommended fruit juice intake can increase the risk of developing diabetes \\[15\\].**\n\n【62】**Therapy**\n\n【63】**Anticoagulant therapy remains the cornerstone of treatment for thrombotic diseases. According to the 2021 American Heart Association/AmericanStrokeAssociation stroke prevention guidelines， in patients with stroke or transient ischemic attack and LV thrombus， systemic antagonists， such as vitamin K antagonists， are recommended for treating left ventricular thrombus after MI for three months (Class I)， with a target INR value of 2 to 2.5 \\[16\\]. In our case treatment， we used bridging low-molecular- weight heparin anticoagulation with warfarin， and achieved good results. Currently， new oral anticoagulant drugs are started to be use in the treatment of left ventricular thrombus \\[17\\]， and their efficacy in BT may need to be verified in left ventricular thrombus before they can be widely promoted.**\n\n【64】**Prognosis**\n\n【65】**The characteristics of thrombus mobility， including thrombus mobility and protrusion， have been used to identify patients at high risk of embolism. Among seven patients with myocardial infarction， three described thrombus mobility， and there were seven cases of pulmonary or systemic embolism， with four cases of residual thrombus and three deaths after the follow-up period ended (Table1). We reported that the patient's thrombus was resolved after 12 days of full anticoagulation with warfarin， with no evidence of embolism and a good prognosis.**\n\n【66】**Conclusion**\n\n【67】**Currently， the risk of BT in patients with myocardial infarction may be underestimated，especially in those with painless myocardial infarction. Clinicians should focus on high-risk populations， such as anterior wall myocardial infarction combined with low LVEF.**\n\n【68】**Funding**\n\n【69】**Shenzhen Science and technology _program：_ JCYJ20210324110004012 and JCYJ20220531094006013.

One of the most cutting-edge fields that show these changes is the interdisciplinary science of medical image processing. Approaches in this rapidly evolving field enable the entire data flow in modern medical imaging systems， from raw data collecting to digital image transfer. These systems now offer ever-increasing spatial and intensity resolutions as well as faster collecting times， resulting in a vast volume of high-quality raw image data that must be carefully processed and reviewed for correct diagnostic results.**\n\n【12】**Imaging in medicine has improved the quality of life for an uncountable number of people， and this trend is only going to continue. It is extremely important to recognize diseases in their early stages. If have reason to feel that something is wrong with the body， must undergo the diagnostic scans to find out whether or not there is cause for concern. It could very well end up saving our life.**\n\n【13】**Medical imaging techniques are incredibly useful for the diagnosis of many of the cancers such as cervical， brain， breast， leukemia blood cells etc. To increase a patient’s chances of surviving such a dreadful disease， it is crucial that they receive a diagnosis at the earliest feasible time. Medical imaging techniques enable the diagnosis of tumors at progressively earlier stages.**\n\n【14】**Currently， in the field of medical area nanotechnology has evolved rigorous applications and it is being applied to the development of novel imaging techniques for medical purposes. It is highly probable that the development of nano-scale imaging will advance medicine by enabling the creation of more comprehensive images of the activities of cellular components. The capabilities of currently existing medical imaging equipment are being enhanced so that they can be utilized at the nanoscale more effectively. In addition， contrast agents are being developed to facilitate the monitoring of implanted nanoparticles throughout the body. Especially， nanoparticle implantation helps in cancer like diseases to cure the particular area proliferated in the body instead of affecting other parts through the oral medicines. It can also apply in the process of protein detection， optical coding and cell manipulation etc.**\n\n【15】**_COm_**\n\n【16】**Molecular imaging agents based on nanoparticles are currently being manufactured. These nanoparticles will reveal whether there are mutations in cancer-causing genes or how tumor cell's function. It has been demonstrated that nanoparticles can be emploved therapeutically as anatomical structural contrast agents. This information can be used to suggest a treatment plan or modify an existing one. By altering their properties in response to biological stimuli or processes，bioactivatable nanoparticles serve as dynamic recorders of in vivo conditions， revealing how diseases evolve and the efficacy oftreatments.**\n\n【17】**In the fight against cancer， early detection is tantamount to gaining a decisive advantage. The development of new molecular contrast agents and materials， made feasible by nanotechnology， offers the path for an earlier and more accurate initial cancer diagnosis as well as continuous monitoring of cancer treatment. There are already a number of nanoparticle-based medical screenings and diagnostics available on the market. The most prevalent usage of nanoparticles， however， is in thetreatment of a wide range of medical conditions， including stomach and intestinal diseases， nerve and intestine obstructions， and many more can be captured by the capsule cameras.**\n\n【18】**For cancer prevention， nanodevices designed to capture blood-borne biomarkers are being explored. Biomarkers include cancer-associated proteins， spread around the tumor cells， tumor DNA， and exosomes produced by the tumor. Sensors enabled by nanotechnology are capable of readings with high sensitivity， specificity， and multiplexing. The next generation of diagnostic**\n\n【19】**technologies combines sample collection with genetic analysis to improve understanding of a patient's cancer， potential treatments， and disease progression.**\n\n【20】**In the field of image acquisition，hardware advances that improve the quality of raw data and increase its informational value are favorable. Integrated front-end solutions offer quicker scan times， higher resolutions， and unique structures， such as CT/PET/X-ray， ultrasound/mammography，and PET/MRI combination systems. An accurate automatic prediction based on the image processing faces many challenges like time consumption，efficiencythrough numerous trending technologies such as machine learning algorithms like naive Bayes， KNN， SVM etc. and deep learning algorithms such as CNN， RNN，LSTM，GAN (Generative Adversarial Networks)，RBFN(Radial Basis Function Networks)，SOM (SelfOrganizing Maps) are working in a way. This process involves particular steps like pre-processing， feature extraction， segmentation classification etc. Similarly， visual images face， expressions etc. and other images like EEG plays an imperative role in the fields of cognitive science and neuroscience to predict the behavior of the people. It is an admitted fact that despite giving good results， still we are unable to introduce fully in real-time applications as giving challenges in many aspects.**\n\n【21】**The most trending technologies like quantum computing and cloud storage can address the challenges which are given by existing systems over the year in terms of time complexity and massive storage. In fact， the results in some cases that take few years will be made in seconds. The imagery which is captured through the edge cutting technologies can be stored in the cloud. Due to these unparalleled services of aforementioned technologies on image processing brings the quality life nearer to the human life with the faster and pure services. Most of the largest countries are making the massive investments in the fields of above to solve the challenges towards the many fields in the society such as health care， finance， security， technology， forecasting etc.**", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

Research in patients with cerebral palsy undergoing cell therapy has shown improvements in the functionality and quality of life of patients. Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is an essential tool that may objectively evaluate the morphological changes in the cerebral tracts after this kind of intervention.**\n\n【18】**Description of Cases： Three children with a medical history of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy were presented. These patients were treated with intrathecalautologous bone marrow total nucleated cells. All three patients demonstrated clinical improvements in their neurological functions. Additionally， fMRI was performed 6， 9， and 10 months， respectively， after the intervention. An increase in anisotropy fraction was observed when evaluated by specialized MRI radiologists， which correlated with their improvements.**\n\n【19】**Discussion： It has been demonstrated that hematopoietic progenitor cells promote neurogenesis and angiogenesis in brain tissue affected by hypoxic-ischemic injury. This report seeks to add the idea of using fMRI to evaluate improvements after interventions where stem cells are used. However， it is necessary to extend the number of patients to determine if it is the best objective evaluation method for these patients.**\n\n【20】**Keywords： Functional MRI； Cerebral palsy； Stem cell therapy； Clinical improvement**\n\n【21】**Introduction**\n\n【22】**Cerebral Palsy (CP) is a non-progressive condition secondary to an insult to the central nervous system during its development. It is characterized by abnormal muscle tone that leads to posture and movement. The incidence is estimated at 2-3 per 1，000 births \\[1\\].**\n\n【23】**At present， the use of hematopoietic stem cells has generated interest in medical practice due to their regenerative， reparative， and plastic properties \\[2\\]， mainly when used in patients with permanent organ damage， such as in CP \\[3\\].**\n\n【24】**Evidence supports that brain functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is valuable and may evaluate the improvement of patients with CP after different treatments with SC，specifically the white matter， which can be demonstrated with the anisotropy fraction of fMRI\\[4\\].**\n\n【25】**Objective**\n\n【26】**To describe fMRI as an objective evaluation tool for patients with CP after administering Intrathecal (IT) autologous Bone Marrow Nucleated Cells (BM-TNC).**\n\n【27】**Case Description**\n\n【28】**We present three pediatric patients with neurological deficits due to hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. They received intrathecal autologous BM-TNCs after three days of Bone Marrow(BM) stimulation with Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor (G-CSF).

He was not able to achieve cephalic and body trunk support， neither to feed on his own， did not communicate or interact with the environment， and was unable to follow objects with his eyes.**\n\n【32】**An fMRI was performed before the procedure. BM was stimulated with G-CSF at a subcutaneous dose of 10 ug/kg/day for 3 consecutive days. On the 4h day， a BM collection was performed under sedation in both posterosuperior-superior iliac crests. A volume of 8 ml/kg of weight was aspirated. The BM was centrifuged， and the buffy coat was isolated and administered IT \\[5\\]. The number of BM-TNC cells infused was 89.76×10°CD34+ cells， as measured by flow cytometry.**\n\n【33】**Ten months after the therapy， he has full head and trunk support， crawling with limb support， executes simple orders， takes objects with both hands， with a predominance of the right hand， babbling， socializing， and interacting with their surroundings.**\n\n【34】**Baseline and control MRI comparison showed characteristics of periventricular leukomalacia secondary to a hypoxic-ischemic event， with no significant changes between the two studies. The first fMRI showed intact corticospinal tracts， with decreased thickness and size at the corona radiata level， without evident changes when comparing both studies. However， an increased anisotropy was documented in the fMRI， which was more evident in the left corona radiata. These findings correlate with the clinical improvements observed in the patient.**\n\n【35】**Case 2**\n\n【36】**A 30-month-old female，31 weeks of gestational age， 1，800 grams of weight， Apgar score 5/7 at 1/5 min； neonatal respiratory distress**\n\n【37】**syndrome was treated with CPAP.**\n\n【38】**TUS and MRI： Cortical and coronal decrease of the corpus callosum， intraventricular hemorrhage， and enlargement of the subarachnoid spacein the frontallobes.

In addition， DTI was performed， comparing the anisotropy fraction， demonstrating an increase in the values of the 2nd study， which is more evident at the left posterior limb of the internal capsule level. Like the first patient， these findings correlated with the clinical improvement she presented.**\n\n【42】**Case 3**\n\n【43】**A 22-month-old female， born at 41 weeks， 3，850 grams ofweight， Apgar score of 2/4 at 1/5 min， 5/7 at 10/15 min.

Clinically， without head and trunk support， poor management of respiratory secretions， feed by gastrostomy， absence of communication abilities， neither interaction with the environment， and inability to follow obiects.**\n\n【45】**Figure 1： Comparison of the magnetic resonances obtained in clinical case 1.**\n\n【46】**Autologous BM TNCs were delivered IT the same way as the patients described above. The total amount of BM TNCs infused was11.76×10° ofCD34+ cells， as measured by flow cytometry.**\n\n【47】**Six months later， the patient could reduce the anticonvulsant dose per kilo of weight， interact with the environment， and has a social smile.**\n\n【48】**Discussion**\n\n【49】**TNCs have a minimal capacity for transdifferentiation into neurons compared with other progenitor cells. So， how can we explain the improvement of patients with therapy? Evidence suggests that the benefits obtained through treatments such as this one is due to immunomodulatory effects since they migrate to sites where there is inflammation and cell damage and have a chemotactic impact \\[6\\]， secrete many bioactive molecules that promote cell regeneration \\[4\\] and angiogenesis \\[7\\].**\n\n【50】**This has been evidenced by the fact that this type of cell has been used successfully in therapies of another nature， where the damaged tissue is not of the hematopoietic lineage， such as neurons \\[8\\]， skeletal muscles， and kidneys \\[9\\].**\n\n【51】**Conventional imaging methods have not proved to be useful for objectively measuring improvements in patients with CP. The fMRI is a more sensitive and invaluable tool that can impartially dimension the changes and improvements after stem cell therapy. In addition， this can give us better evidence of neurogenesis and angiogenesis.**\n\n【52】**Because CP does not have a conventional or specific treatment owing to its complexity and does not boost regardless of standard treatments， as rehabilitation， stem cell therapy could be a therapeutic option to improve the quality of life of these patients and their families.**\n\n【53】**We decided to use the IT route as the route of administration for several reasons. Although the IV route is better in terms of safety，**\n\n【54】**the number of cells administered IV that can cross the blood-brain barrier still needs to be clarified. In addition， it must be considered a loss of cells distributed in other organs (e.g.， liver， lung， etc.) \\[10\\]. When cells are administered IT， more of these cells are concentrated in the hypoxic areas \\[11\\]. The IT route has proven to be safe and tolerated， with side effects such as fever， headache，nausea， vomiting， and stiffness of the neck， which do not last for more than six days5，12.**\n\n【55】**fMRI is a tool that can objectively identify changes and improvements after cell therapy， as in the 3 patients mentioned above(Table 1). Unfortunately， conventional imaging methods have not proven to be very useful since the size of ischemia or edema reduction does not directly correlate with the clinical improvements observed in patients \\[13\\]. Currently， more sophisticated methods such as fMRI， which， through anisotropy， is more sensitive and allows analysis of the restructuration of the white matter and its fascicles，provide more evidence of neurogenesis and angiogenesis \\[14\\]. Although that brain fMRI did not show evidence of morphological changes， an increase in the anisotropy fraction of the cortical tract was found compared to the study performed before treatment (Figure 1). Furthermore， it was also observed an increase in white matter formation.**\n\n【56】**Conclusion**\n\n【57】**CP is a condition that does not improve despite current treatments. The application of BM-TNC can enhance neurogenesis and angiogenesis in affected hypoxic-ischemic brain tissue， which could result in an alternative treatment for patients with this condition. This was demonstrated by fMRI in the cases above and can become a powerful tool to obiectively evaluate changes in the central nervous system， specifically in the white matter tracts. However， this must be confirmed in large， comparative， randomized， blinded studies.**\n\n【58】**Acknowledgement**\n\n【59】**The information contained in this manuscript was partially**\n\n【60】**presented as a poster at the annual meeting of the ISCT (International** Society of Cellular Therapy) 2019 in Melbourne， Australia.\n\n【61】**References**\n\n【62】**1\\.

Neurological complications after an uneventful spinal anesthesia and surgery are infrequent and dangerous. One such complication is meningitis or meningoencephalitis， which may be infectious or non-infectious in etiology. One subset of non-infectious meningitis is Drug-Induced Aseptic Meningitis (DIAM). DIAM may be difficult to distinguish from bacterial meningitis by clinical picture (fever， nuchal rigidity， headache， disorientation) and laboratory investigations. CSF analysis may show polymorphic picture on cytology with increased protein levels and normal to decreased glucose levels. CSF cultures are invariable negative in DIAM. Antibiotics， if started empirically， may be stopped after a diagnosis of DIAM has been made. Bupivacaine has been frequently implicated as a causative agent for post-spinal anesthesia DIAM.

Similar to that in general population， post-spinal meningitis may be caused by bacterial and aseptic reasons. The latter comprises of infection by viruses， meningeal involvement in autoimmune and neoplastic diseases， and Drug-Induced Aseptic Meningitis (DIAM). DIAM may in turn be caused by two mechanisms -direct chemicalirritation ofthe meningesbyintrathecaladministration ofanesthetic and chemotherapeutic drugs or systemic immunological hypersensitivity (antibiotics， non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs， intravenous immunoglobulin) \\[2\\]. When associated with spinal anesthesia， it generally has an acute onset within 24 h of dural puncture， and a self-limiting and benign course. Multiple authors have reported DIAM following bupivacaine spinal anesthesia. We present a case of likely DIAM， subsequent to bupivacaine subarachnoid block for elective arthroscopic surgery， posing a diagnostic dilemma for the involved surgeons， anesthetists and intensivists. Informed consent was taken from the patient before reporting this case.**\n\n【20】**Case Summary**\n\n【21】**A 36-year-old male patient presented with history of injury to the right knee， resulting in multiple locking episodes and joint instability. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) showed partial ACL tear. The patient was posted for arthroscopic right anterior cruciate ligament repair with partial medial meniscectomy under subarachnoid block. Pre-anesthetic check-up was completely normal， and the patient was declared ASA (American Society of Anesthesiologists) grade I. On the day of elective surgery， subarachnoid injection was given with 2.4ml of 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine with 20 mcg fentanyl as additive. Cleaning and draping were performed as per departmental protocol and the spinal was given at L3-L4 level using 25 Gauge Quincke needle after local anesthetic injection. Patient was positioned and surgery was started after achieving a sensory level of T8. Surgerylasted for less than an hour and patient was shifted to the Post-operative Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU) with stable vitals. From here， the patient was transferred to admitting ward when level of sensory block receded to L1 level. Four hours after shifting to ward， patient started complaining of severe headache for which injection diclofenac 75 mg was given. This was followed by 2 episodes of vomiting， tachypnea and disorientation to time， place， and person. The surgeon and anesthetist on duty decided to shift patient to Intensive Care Unit(ICU) for further evaluation and management.**\n\n【22】**The patient arrived in ICU with a low GCS (Glasgow Coma Scale) score of E2V2M3 and dyspnea， necessitating tracheal intubation and assisted ventilation. Neck rigidity was observed but there was no fever. Bilateral pupils were normal in size and reaction. Blood investigations revealed a White Cell Count (WBCs) of 12，300/cumm and neutrophilia (89%) on differential count. Serum procalcitonin level was 4.1 ng/ml. A working diagnosis of bacterial meningitis was made， and neurology consultation was sought. Ceftriaxone， vancomycin， phenytoin， and dexamethasone 8 mg thrice a day were started empirically， while the patient was investigated further. Non-Contrast Computed Tomography (NCCT) and MRI brain were done， which were normal. Fundus examination did not reveal any disc edema. A lumbar puncture was subsequently performed， which showed cell count of 400 cells/cumm with 60% mononuclear cells and 40% polymorphs in Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) on cytological examination. CSF biochemistry revealed a glucose level of 150 mg/dl and protein of 777 mg/dl. Gram staining and culture were found to be negative.**\n\n【23】**As per the above findings and the observation that patient never exhibited any fever， the diagnosis of bacterial meningitis seemed unlikely. We started thinking along the lines of aseptic meningitis， post-subarachnoid block. Antibiotics were de-escalated， but steroids**\n\n【24】**and phenytoin were continued. After 3 days of assisted ventilation and supportive care in ICU， the patient's GCS， blood investigations and ventilation parameters improved markedly. The patient was responsive， neck rigidity was absent and diaphragmatic excursion was normal on ultrasonography. Trachea was extubated and patient's neurological assessment， including higher mental functions were found to be normal， except for some residual amnesia about surgery and post-operative period. The patient was kept in ICU another day and then shifted to orthopedics ward for further care.**\n\n【25】**Discussion**\n\n【26】**Neurological complications after an uneventful spinal anesthesia and surgeryareinfrequent，but when they occur，theypose a diagnostic dilemma to the physicians. It is essential to differentiate DIAM from bacterial meningitis， as the latter is a potentially life-threatening condition， requiring urgent intervention and leaves the patient with neurological sequela. Additionally， establishing the diagnosis of DIAM also prevents unnecessary treatment with advanced antibiotics and hospital/ICU stay \\[3\\]. However， symptomatology and clinical findings may not help us distinguish between bacterial and aseptic meningitis， as both may present with headache， nuchal rigidity and febrile episodes \\[4，5\\]. CSF findings may also confuse the situation further， showing pleocytosis with neutrophil predominance(later， may shift to mononuclear predominance) and raised protein levels (hyperproteinorrachia). CSF glucose levels may be low(hypoglycorrachia) or normal \\[5，6\\].**\n\n【27】**Bihan et al. \\[6\\] reported in their study on 329 cases of DIAM that a clear meningeal syndrome， involving headache， neck stiffness and vomiting may be seen in only 15.5% of cases. Out of the typical symptoms of the meningeal triad， only headache is present in >2/3of DIAM cases. All other symptoms are reported in only 20% to40% of cases. Ducornet et al. \\[7\\] published certain defining criteria for diagnosis of aseptic meningitis： Time to onset of signs within 24hours after spinal anesthesia； the absence of prior antibiotic therapy； apyrexia； a WBCs in CSF similar to bacterial meningitis； high protein value in CSF； a normal glucose value in CSF； negative bacterial CSF culture； full recovery in less than 48 h Our patient met each of the above criteria.**\n\n【28】**This goes to show that DIAM is a diagnosis of exclusion and empirical antibiotics should be started initially in all cases. When negative CSF cultures are obtained， antibiotics may be stopped to prevent development of antibiotic resistance \\[5\\]. However， some clinicians favor the continuation of antibiotics till complete symptom resolution， as bacterial meningitis may masquerade as DIAM and is almost always more dangerous， leaving neurological complications. Aseptic meningitis， on the other hand， has a favorable outcome with**\n\n| **S.No.**  | **Author**  | **Year** **published**  | **Findings reported**  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **1**  | **Ducornetet al.7|**  | **2014**  | **Reported likely cause for DIAM to be bupivacaine.**  |\n| **1**  | **Ducornetet al.7|**  | **2014**  | **Gave diagnostic criteria for DIAM， as outlined in discussion.**  |\n| **2**  | **Oliveiraet al. \\[8\\]**  | **2019**  | **Reported 2 cases of DIAM post-spinal anesthesia.**  |\n| **2**  | **Oliveiraet al. \\[8\\]**  | **2019**  | **Bupivacaine was given in the first patient， who underwent an orthopedic procedure.

Antibiotics and supportive treatment may be started empirically， but may be discontinued after negative CSF cultures. Recovery is spontaneous and complete， without any neurological sequela.**\n\n【34】**References**\n\n【35】1\\. Videira RL， Ruiz-Neto PP， Brandao Neto M. Post spinal meningitis and **asepsis.

This big data is of very important for designing the new drug product but it is very difficult to extract the information manually from this huge source. Now days a new ways of data mining and processing are on focus of the scientists such as Machine Learning (ML)， Deep Learning(DL) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). Therefore， in the era of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer revolution， the conventional methods of product design seem to be irrelevant as personalized medicines are now getting more attention. Now the conventional approach of “one drug-fits all”have been replacing by the “customizable dosage forms\" based on the individual needs. So a large scale updation of pharmaceutical sector is indeed required to adopt for innovative engineering and processing methods of formulation development. Induction of computer simulation and computational approaches such as Quality by Design (QbD) concept， statistical analysis and simulation software's now shifted the paradigm from lab-based research to in-silico research where majority of the research activities related to product development are performed on the computer simulated mathematical models with high degree of accuracy covering the interaction of all the process variables. In silico approach eliminates the irrelevant sets of experiments and only provides the best suitable ones using AI based simulated model. The areas of application of AI approach in formulation development can be formulation optimization and pharmacokinetic evaluation as discussed one by one in the coming sections. The data of physicochemical properties of the different drugs， chemicals and excipients is stored in the AI enabled computer software. The AI algorhythm in the computer system find the expected results of the mutual interaction ofany given set of excipients and drug by the aid of algorhythm based mathematical calculations and predict the characteristics of the resulting formulation. Here we can optimize the formulation for the desired results as defined by the QbD tools by varying the concentrations of the excipients without performing the actual experimentation. Statistical tools such as Central Composite Design (CCD)，box-behnken design or others provide us with the different formulations with the varying concentration ranges of polymers which may have the desired and optimized formulation. Using computer algorhythm a blend of raw materials can be designed based on the physical and chemical properties ofthe drug and excipients to produce the product with desired characteristics. This saves the cost and time of research and increase the confidence on the quality of product. The customization of the dosage forms based on the individual needs is also possible through in-silico approach. The customization is done to adjust the pharmaceutical， pharmacokinetic and therapeutic characteristics of the product as per the need of the individual patients i.e.， based on the behavior of the drug in individual patients due to different genetic makeup and different body physiology. AI based evaluation of pharmacokinetics parameters is the necessary and important part of the formulation development as it reduces the attrition rate and failure of drug compounds during the clinical studies. AI based techniques predicts the ADME profile of the drug in a particular dosage form that not only help in drug optimization but also in drug repurposing. Establishing an In Vitro-In Vivo Correlation (IVIVC) predicts the pharmacokinetic behavior of the drug inside the body in earlier phase of the study before going in to the actual experimentation. In this manner a product can be designed from initial step to final optimized formulation using the computer simulated algorhythm. After validation of the final design， the product is developed in the lab and tested for its characteristics to check if these are as per the given specifications or not**", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

Ackerman described it for the first time in the Otorhinolaryngology field in 1948 \\[1\\]. Verrucous carcinoma occurs most frequently in the nasal cavity， esophagus， vulva， vagina， anorectal region， penis， and skin. It is very rare in the urinary tract \\[1，2\\]. Very few cases of verrucous carcinoma have been reported in the bladder， mainly related to schistosomiasis infection. Renal verrucous carcinoma was first reported in a horseshoe kidney by Sheaff in 1996 \\[3\\]. To our knowledge， only six cases of verrucous carcinoma of the renal pelvis have been published previously； all of them were treated by radical nephrectomy or even nephroureterectomy\\[1-5\\]. In contrast， this case presents the first verrucous carcinoma in a renal calyceal diverticulum. Moreover， it was successfully treated by nephron-sparing surgery for the first time.**\n\n【12】**Case Presentation**\n\n【13】**A 60-year-old man with a clinical history of renal lithiasis was referred to our consultation of lithiasis due to small calculus located in the left kidney (Figure 1a， 1b). He was operated on for small calculilocated in the lower calyceal diverticulum of the left kidney via Retrograde Intrarenal Surgery(RIRS) and micro-percutaneous (PNL). During the surgery， the calyceal diverticulum was accessed and multiple small calculi (2 mm to 3 mm) were removed. Methylene blue showed the existence of communication between the renal pelvis and the diverticulum， but direct endoscopic visualization was not possible. During the follow-up， a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan was performed(Figure 2a， 2b). A well-defined cystic lesion measuring 4.2 cm x 6 cm x 4.6 cm was observed in the posterior valve. The cystic lesion was mainly intrarenal with small eccentric growth. The MRI report described that the lesion could be a complicated calyceal diverticulum， without ruling out the coexistence of urothelioma or squamous tumor. After all， surgical resection of the lesion was decided. Through a subcostal incision， the left kidney was freed from the upper pole to the lower pole. The cystic tumor was identified at the posterior valve of the interpolar region. The lesion was removed without ischemia time. During the surgery， an opening of the diverticulum to the urinary tract was identified. The opening appeared to be a tubular structure communicating with the lesion with abundant cesium material coming out. The urinary tract was successfully closed. The patient had a favorable evolution at the hospital， presenting febrile peaks with negative cultures during the immediate postoperative period. He was discharged on the fifth postoperative day after a full course of antibiotics was completed.**\n\n【14】**Thepathological study confirmed the existence ofan exo-endophytic，acantholytic，papillomatous neoplasm composed of keratinizing squamous epithelium with mild atypia and expansive growth. The tumor focally invaded the medullary renal parenchyma in the form of small nests with increased cellular atypia and keratinization. The pelvic-calyceal epithelium was completely replaced. The renal parenchyma adjacent to the tumor shows signs of atrophy. The pathological diagnosis was a verrucous carcinoma with a focus on well-differentiated infiltrating squamous cell carcinoma(Figure 3). The margins were free of tumor.**\n\n【15】**Since the date of surgery， the patient has been followed up with imaging tests. A new Computed Tomography (CT) scan was performed every 3 months for the first 12 months. Then， a CT scan was done every 6 months and finally， an annual CT scan is being performed free of tumor recurrence in**\n\n【16】**Figure 1： a) A 3D reconstruction of CT image. b) An Axial image of a basal CT.

It is used to designate a specific histological appearance of well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma \\[1\\]. It also shows extensive keratinization with exophytic or papillomatous extension into the stroma and the absence of significant cellular atypia \\[4\\]. Verrucous carcinoma occurs most frequently in the nasal cavity，**\n\n【21】**Figure 3： Microscopic image of the tumor.

Post-surgical changes on the left kidney with no signs of recurrence can be appreciated.**\n\n【23】**esophagus， vulva， vagina， anorectal region， penis， and skin. It is very unusual in the urinary tract \\[1，2\\]. Some risk factors include urinary tract infections， especially bilharziasis， or chronic inflammation， due to urinary lithiasis in 40% to 80% of cases； other factors include tobacco， coffee， phenacetin， and organic solvents \\[1\\]. All this leads to chronic irritation that causes squamous metaplasia which may eventually progress to carcinoma \\[1\\]. The average age of onset of verrucous carcinoma in urinary tract is about fifty-six years old； there is no predominance of men， unlike transitional cell carcinomas\\[1\\]. The clinical symptomatology is non-specific， patients mainly present with hematuria and occasionally lumbar pain \\[1\\]. Verrucous carcinoma has a good prognosis because of its characterization of local infiltration with a slight tendency to metastasize to regional lymph nodes or distant sites， unlike epidermoid carcinoma \\[3\\]. A few cases of verrucous carcinoma have been reported in the bladder related to schistosomiasis infection， but only six cases are described in the kidney (Table 1). Due to verrucous carcinoma may present extensive adjacent squamous metaplasia and coexistence with the squamous variant of carcinoma， a radical treatment was performed in previously reported cases \\[1-5\\].**\n\n【24】**To our knowledge， only six cases of verrucous carcinoma of the renalpelvis have been previously reported in the literature. In all these six cases， lithiasis may have been the cause of chronic inflammation. The average age at diagnosis has been fifty-five years old. Reviewing the cases reported in the literature about verrucous carcinoma in the renal pelvis previously， a higher prevalence in men than women can be found. None of the patients with verrucous carcinoma presented urinary tract anomalies， apart from the first patient who had horseshoe kidney \\[3\\]. In addition， in all cases published so far in the literature， the tumor was located in the renal pelvis \\[1-5\\] and only one case in pelvis and ureter \\[5\\]. The present case is the first one**\n\n【25】**Table 1： Patients with verrucous carcinoma of the renal.**\n\n|  | **Age**  | **Sex**  | **Anomaly in tract urinary**  | **Location of lesion**  | **Treatment received**  | **Outcome**  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Sheaff et al. \\[3\\]**  | **41**  | **M**  | **\\+ (horseshoe kidney)**  | **Renal pelvis**  | **Heminephrectomy**  | **6 months， NED**  |\n| **Sellami-Boudawara et al.\\[1\\]**  | **61**  | **M**  |  | **Renal pelvis**  | **Radical nephrectomy**  | **5 years， NED**  |\n| **Sellami-Boudawara et al. \\[1\\]**  | **56**  | **M**  | **一**  | **Renal pelvis**  | **Nephroureterectomy**  | **Died**  |\n| **Kansal et al. \\[4\\]**  | **64**  | **F**  |  | **Renal pelvis**  | **Radical nephrectomy**  | **2 years， NED**  |\n| **Basekioglu et al. \\[2\\]**  | **56**  | **M**  | **一**  | **Renal pelvis**  | **Radical nephrectomy+RT+CT**  | **3 years， Died**  |\n| **Hung WH et al.\\[5\\]**  | **53**  | **M**  |  | **Renal pelvis and ureter**  | **Nephroureterectomy +RT**  | **3 months， NED**  |\n| **Present case**  | **60**  | **M**  |  | **Calyceal diverticulum**  | **Partial nephrectomy**  | **5 years， NED**  |\n\n【27】**where a verrucous carcinoma was detected in a renal diverticulum. Moreover， the present case is the first one to be successfully treated with nephron-sparing surgery. All previously reported cases of verrucous carcinoma were treated by radical nephrectomy or even nephroureterectomy \\[1-5\\].**\n\n【28】**Partial nephrectomy surgery was revealed to be as effective as radical nephrectomy in patients with verrucous carcinoma without poor prognostic data (such as usual epidermoid carcinoma， poorly differentiated tumor， and affected surgical margins). In the cases of the previous studies where the patient died， positive surgical margins or poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma were present. These two features were related to the aggressiveness of the tumor. In spite of a radical nephrectomy being performed， both patients died of metastatic disease in the next few days after surgery \\[1，2\\]. None of the remaining cases presented any evidence of poor tumor prognosis， and a simple nephrectomy was performed successfully \\[3，4\\]. The present study is included in this second group， where characteristics of poor tumor prognosis were notpresent. It shows that a partial nephrectomy can be performed rather than a radical nephrectomy if there is no evidence of verrucous carcinoma aggressiveness characteristics.**\n\n【29】**In summary， the present case is the first report of verrucous carcinoma located in a calyceal diverticulum. It is also the first report of nephron-sparing surgery performed on a patient with verrucous**\n\n【30】**carcinoma with no poor prognostic factors. The patient has been free of disease for 5 years. However，there is not enough evidence to affirm that a nephron-sparing surgery treatment can be done in patients with verrucous carcinoma and the absence of poor prognosis factors instead of radical nephrectomy. More experience is needed to affirm that.**\n\n【31】**References**\n\n【32】**1\\. Sellami-Boudawara T， Gouiaa N，Makni S， Sellami A， Bahri I， Mhiri MN，** et al.

However， the development of PET/CT system， which includes a digital PET/CT system and reconstruction algorithms， has been shown to increase the detection and visualization of internal properties for breast cancer due to its higher spatial resolution \\[4\\]. Here we report a case of breast cancer in which heterogeneous IBF-FDG accumulation demonstrated on digital PET/CT correlated with intratumoral heterogeneity histopathologically.**\n\n【19】**Case Presentation**\n\n【20】**A 56-year-old Japanese woman presented to our medical center with a palpable mass in her right breast. She had no previous or family history of breast or ovarian cancer. Elastic hard mass was palpable in her right breast. Mammography and ultrasound revealed a lobulated shaped mass in the breast and multiple enlarged lymph nodes in the right axilla suspicious of breast cancer with multiple axillary lymph node metastases. The internal echo was homogeneous on ultrasound. The MRI appearance was of a lobulated mass surrounded by slight rim and septal enhancement within the tumor. Biopsy of the lesion revealed invasive ductal carcinoma.**\n\n【21】**The patient underwent 'F-FDG PET/CT of the right breast and axillary lesions as part of the preoperative work-up. Scanning was performed using a digital PET/CT scanner (Discovery MI； GE Medical Systems， Milwaukee， WI) about 60 min after the intravenous administration of 5.49MBq/kg oflF-FDG. PET was performed from the skull base to the proximal thigh with the patient in the supine position； the patient was then moved into the prone position using a hand-made breast positioning device， and single-bed PET/CT was performed of the breast region alone. The CT and PET acquisition parameters were as follows. Non-contrast whole-body and additional regional CT scans were obtained at 120 kV with automatic dose modulation， and PET was performed with acquisition time of 2.10 min per bed position in three-dimensional mode. The PET images were then reconstructed using Q.Clear (GE Medical Systems； B=400) with attenuation correction. The**\n\n【22】**interval between the two PET/CT scans was 17 min. The images revealed marked focal IF-FDG uptake with SUVmax of 27.9 that corresponded to the breast lesion identified on other modalities. The tumor appeared heterogeneous accumulation on PET image (Figure1). No distant metastases were detected. The clinical staging was T2N1M0 Stage II. Right modified radical mastectomy was performed. Histological analysis revealed invasive ductal carcinoma， mixed type， with pleomorphic carcinoma components. The histological appearance was of a mixed tumor with solid and cystic components bounded by fibrous septa. Areas with abundant tumor cells in the lesion identified with Hematoxylin and Eosin (HE) staining and with Ki-67 staining matched the site of marked IF-FDG accumulation seen on the PET images， and fibrotic or cystic sites corresponded with areas of hypo-1F-FDG accumulation seen on the PET images(Figure 2).**\n\n【23】**Discussion**\n\n【24】**In the present case of invasive ductal carcinoma， the tumor demonstrated heterogeneous accumulation on PET that correlated to intratumoral heterogeneity histopathologically.**\n\n【25】**The role of PET/CT in breast cancer has been the pre-treatment systemic staging of locally advanced breast cancer. Several breast cancer guidelines have not recommended PET/CT for women with**\n\n【26】**apparent early-stage breast cancer or even for those with operable stage III breast cancer \\[1\\]. The use of PET/CT for imaging primary breast lesions is hampered by its low spatial resolution， which reduces its sensitivity by missing small lesions； in addition， it is less sensitive than sentinel lymph node biopsy for assessing axillary lymph node involvement. The low prevalence of distant metastases in these patients and the relatively high risk of false-positive findings are considered to detract from the usefulness of PET/CT for distant staging in these patients \\[2\\].**\n\n【27】**The development of dedicated Breast PET (dBPET) systems has enabled detailed high-resolution imaging by setting the detector close to breast lesion. An association between baseline tumor glycolytic activity and tumor biology have been reported. Masumoto et al. reported that intratumoral heterogeneity on dBPET can predict the malignancy grade of breast cancer \\[3\\]. They considered that such intratumoral heterogeneity could not be demonstrated on conventional PET/CT. However， the dBPET is specialized for breast scan， it cannot obtain whole-body image at same equipment.**\n\n【28】**Advances in PET/CT technology have improved image quality and the ability to detect small lesions. In a previous study， the quantitation and detectability of sub-centimeter spheres was higher with a digital PET/CT system compared with conventional OSEM-based reconstruction \\[4\\]. In the present case of invasive ductal carcinoma， PET/CT imaging acquired with a digital PET/CT system demonstrated heterogeneous 18F-FDG accumulation. A. marked abundance of tumor cells identified within the lesion histopathologically with HE staining matched the region of marked18F-FDG accumulation identified on the PET images， and fibrotic and cystic sites matched those of 1F-FDG hypo-accumulation. It is known that US and MRI have high tissue resolution； however， the present case shows the ability of digital PET/CT to evaluate the internal properties of tumors.**\n\n【29】**In conclusion， we report a case of invasive ductal carcinoma that demonstrated heterogeneous IF-FDG accumulation on novel digital PET/CT that correlated to histopathological intratumoral heterogeneity. Digital PET/CT imaging shows potential for evaluating the internal properties of a lesion and may enable prognostic prediction.**\n\n【30】**with Ki-67 staining (c， d) that matches areas of marked 1F-FDG accumulation on the PET images.

We present a woman with CH and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus(SLE)， whose Fertility Preservation (FP) in pregnancy-prohibitedphase may have contributed to BP control and a livebirth. A 33-vear-old woman with CH and SLE conceived twins in SLE remission， without BP control. Both SLE flare and superimposed preeclampsia occurred， and the pregnancy was terminated because of renal dysfunction at 20 weeks. She presented with depression and decreased medical adherence， resulting in prolonged hypertension and pregnancy prohibition. FP was started 40 weeks after stillbirth， and a blastocyst was preserved at the fifth oocyte retrieval. Her medical adherence improved， and her BP became 120-130/90-100 mmHg. After thawed embryo transfer， she conceived a singleton pregnancy. Her BP was 120-130/70-90 mmHg during this pregnancy. At 32 weeks， she delivered a baby due to abnormal findings in Cardiotocogram. In this case， FP may have contributed to BP control and a livebirth. To our knowledge， this is the first report of FP in a pregnancy-prohibited woman with CH or SLE.**\n\n【17】**Keywords： Autoimmune disease； Fertility preservation； Hypertension； Pregnancy； Systemic lupus erythematosus**\n\n【18】**Introduction**\n\n【19】**Pregnancy with Chronic Hypertension (CH) is a high-risk pregnancy because the incidence of Superimposed Preeclampsia (SPE)， preterm birth， Fetal Growth Restriction (FGR)， fetal/neonatal death， maternal death， and maternal cardiovascular morbidities such as heart failure， renal failure， stroke， and pulmonary edema are 3 to 10 times more frequent in patients with CH than in normotensive women \\[1\\]. It is well accepted that Blood Pressure (BP) control， before conception or since early pregnancy， is important. However， the target BP is controversial. The International Society for the Study of Hypertension in Pregnancy (ISSHP) states that the target BP should be in the range of 110-140/80-85 mmHg \\[2\\]， and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence(NICE) recommends a target BP of 135/85 mmHg \\[3\\]. In contrast， in 2019， the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommended that anti-hypertensive therapy for CH should be started when pregnant women have a BP≥160/110 mmHg， and that the target BP should be 120-159/80-109 mmHg \\[4\\]. This recommendation is based on the finding that strict control of diastolic BP did not improve maternal/fetal outcomes. In April 2022，however，ACOG revised the target BP to 140/90 mmHg \\[5\\]， based on the results of the Chronic Hypertension and Pregnancy study.**\n\n【20】**Pregnancy with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is also a high-risk pregnancy \\[6-8\\]. A study including patients with active and inactive disease at conception， showed a significantly higher incidence of hypertension， renal disease， preeclampsia， preterm delivery， cesarean delivery， FGR， and neonatal death in women with SLE than in women without SLE \\[8\\]. For women with SLE， conception is recommended after at least 6 months disease remission， which is based on reports showing that pregnancy loss is significantly higher in women who had active SLE during 6 months**\n\n【21】**before conception than in those who were in remission for >6 months before conception \\[6，7，9\\]. In Japan， the criteria for pregnancy in women with autoimmune disease are based on renal function. The estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) should be ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m. No such criteria for BP exist \\[10\\].**\n\n【22】**Here we present the case of a woman with CH and SLE who had a healthy baby after BP was controlled before pregnancy. It was suggested that embryo preservation during pregnancy-prohibited period may have contributed to improvement in depression and medical adherence， resulting in BP control and a livebirth. To our knowledge， this is the first report on the embryo preservation in pregnancy-prohibited woman with CH or SLE.**\n\n【23】**Case Presentation**\n\n【24】**A 21-year-old woman presented to our hospital with cheek erythema， oral ulcers， finger arthralgia， and thrombocytopenia； she was subsequently diagnosed with SLE at the department of rheumatology in our hospital. Her BP was normal， and her medical history was uneventful. An evaluation of the patient’s family history showed that her mother had hepatic cancer， but there was no family history of autoimmune diseases， hypertension， thrombosis， or sudden death. The patient showed positive results in autoantibody tests for anti-DNA， anti-RNP， anti-Smith， anti-SSA， anti-SSB， and Lupus Anticoagulant (LA)， and negative results for anti-cardiolipin and anti-B2 Glycoprotein I (B2-GPI). SLE flares were observed twice during the following 2 years. During the second flare， her BP was130/80 mmHg. Subsequently， she was in remission and was taking 7mg/day Prednisolone (PSL) and 4 mg/day Tacrolimus (TAC). She got married at the age of 30 years， and her disease remained in remission. She conceived spontaneously at 31 years of age， but the pregnancy resulted in a miscarriage at 7 weeks. LA and anti-B2-GPI tests were**\n\n【25】**repeated 8 weeks after the miscarriage， but both showed negative results.**\n\n【26】**The patient subsequently visited a private fertility clinic， and her BP that time was 137/89 mmHg. She conceived dichorionic diamniotictwins after intrauterine insemination in a natural ovulatory cycle at 33 years of age. At 5 weeks of gestation， her BP was 138/102mmHg. At 9 weeks， she presented with thrombocytopenia and skin erythema， and an SLE flare was diagnosed. Her PSL and TAC doses were augmented， and treatment with Hydroxychloroquine sulfate(HCQ) was initiated (Figure 1). At 13 weeks， she was referred to our Obstetrics and Gynecology (OBGY) department， a tertiary perinatal care center， and was subsequently managed in cooperation with the rheumatology department at our institute. At 13 weeks， LA test again showed negative result. Hypertension (150/110 mmHg) was observed at 13 weeks， and methyldopa， labetalol， and amlodipine were administered； however， her BP remained around 150/90mmHg. She was admitted at 17 weeks because thrombocytopenia had not improved. Although intensive immunosuppression therapy， including intravenous immunoglobulin， augmentation of PSL， and initiation of Cyclosporin A (CyA) and azathioprine， was administered for the SLE flare，the thrombocytopenia did not improve. At 20 weeks， rapid progression of renal dysfunction was observed， which was indicated by changes in the serum creatinine levels (from 0.86 mg/dL to 1.19 mg/dL) and the eGFR (from 62.0 mL/min/1.73 m² to 43.4mL/min/1.73 m). Her serum uric acid levels were also elevated (6.8 mg/dL). Because the patient's thrombocytopenia and renal dysfunction did not improve despite intensive immunosuppressive therapy， we concluded that SPE was complicated with the SLE flare， although the gestational age was only 20 weeks. Considering the gestational age， we recommended termination of pregnancy for maternal safety. After obtaining informed consent， therapeutic termination was performed**\n\n【27】**Table 1： Summary of embryo preservation trials.**\n\n| **Trial**  | **Weeks afterthe still birth**  | **Stimulation**  | **Number of** **QQcytesretrieved**  | **Number ofpreservedtrophoblasts**  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **1s1**  | **40**  | **Short**  | **4**  | **0**  |\n| **2d**  | **56**  | **CC**  | **1**  | **0**  |\n| **3d**  | **64**  | **CC**  | **2**  | **0**  |\n| **41h**  | **68**  | **CC**  | **2**  | **0**  |\n| **51h**  | **72**  | **CC**  | **2**  | **1**  |\n\n【29】CC： Clomiphene Citrate\n\n【30】**at 20+2 weeks using a cesarean section， and two babies (292 gand 272g) were delivered.**\n\n【31】**Afterthestillbirth，immunosuppression therapy was administered more intensively， including steroid pulse therapy (intravenous methylprednisolone， 1，000 mg/day for 3 days)， initiation of mycophenolate mofetil (which is contraindicated during pregnancy)， and augmentation of CyA. As a result， her serum creatinine levels decreased， and platelet counts increased. Although her hypertension was prolonged， she was discharged 28 days after stillbirth.**\n\n【32】**Following the discharge， SLE was treated with PSL， CyA， HCQ， and belimumab， and renal function test results and platelet counts were controlled within normal ranges (Figure 2). However， her BP remained around 150-160/100-110 mmHg； therefore， pregnancy was not permitted. She became depressed soon after the stillbirth； at approximately 20 weeks after stillbirth，her depression became severe， and she stopped taking prescribed medicines. She contemplated suicide， but it was avoided with the help of a psychiatrist.**\n\n【33】**As we could not predict when pregnancy would be permitted， a prenatal team of doctors suggested embryo preservation to the fertility treatment team. We proposed that the couple undergo**\n\n【34】**embryo preservation 36 weeks after the stillbirth to preserve fertility. The couple chose to proceed with the embryo preservation. Embryo preservation started 40 weeks after the stillbirth (Figure 2). The stimulation methods and outcomes are shown in Table 1. The first trial used the “short”protocol， and the following trials used administration of Clomiphene Citrate (CC). A blastocyst with good morphology was preserved for the first time at the fifth trial 72weeks after the stillbirth. Following the embryo preservation trials， the patient’s depression had ameliorated， and her adherence of medicines improved. Her BP was 120-130/90-100 mmHg， with the systolic BP falling into the normal range. SLE was in remission， and LA was negative once again. Rheumatology and OBGY doctors had a conference and permitted her pregnancy 76 weeks after the stillbirth.**\n\n【35】**After obtaining informed consent from the couple regarding the risks of pregnancy that included a possibility of twin pregnancy(2% in single blastocyst transfer)， an SLE flare， preterm birth which could result in a neonatal mortality/morbidity， and the risk of mortality/morbidity to the patient， a thawed Embryo Transfer (ET) was performed in a spontaneous ovulatory cycle 80 weeks after the stillbirth. The patient developed a singleton pregnancy. In this pregnancy， her BP was maintained around 120-130/70-90 mmHg. However， serum creatinine was elevated to 0.97 mg/mL at 32+4weeks， and she was subsequently admitted. At 32+5 weeks， elevated serum creatinine (1.06 mg/dL)， decreased eGFR (53 mL/min/1.73m’)， and abnormal findings on Cardiotocogram (loss of variability) were observed； therefore， an emergency cesarean was performed. A 1，580 g baby was delivered with a 5-min Apgar score of 9. After delivery，the serum creatinine levels became normal. Both the mother and baby were in good health 1 year after the delivery.**\n\n【36】**Discussion**\n\n【37】**We presented the case of a woman with CH and SLE whose first**\n\n【38】**pregnancy resulted in a miscarriage， the second pregnancy (without pre-conceptional BP control) resulted in therapeutic termination at20 weeks， and the third pregnancy (with pre-conceptional BP control) resulted in a livebirth.**\n\n【39】**First， we estimated that the patient's hypertension was drug-induced due to administration of PSL and TAC for approximately10 vears.**\n\n【40】**Second， we diagnosed an SLE flare and SPE during the second pregnancy. In the management of pregnancy in patients with SLE， differential diagnosis of SLE flares and Hypertensive Disorders of Pregnancy (HDP) is important because the treatment for an SLE flare is immunosuppression， while the final treatment for HDP is termination of pregnancy \\[9\\]. However， a differential diagnosis may be challenging for clinicians because both conditions present with proteinuria， hypertension， and lower-extremity edema， and may also have systemic effects \\[9\\]. In this case， we concluded that both SLE flare and SPE were present because immunosuppressive therapy did not control the disease； therefore，therapeutic termination at 20 weeks was done. A twin pregnancy is a strong possible cause of SPE at an early gestational age. Postpartum improvement of renal dysfunction and thrombocytopenia supports this diagnosis.**\n\n【41】**Third，wediscussedthesafetyofAssistedReproductiveTechnology(ART) in women with SLE. The most serious complication associated with ovarian stimulation and ovarian hyper stimulation syndrome is thrombosis \\[11，12\\]. To avoid thrombosis， selection of appropriate ovarian stimulation， a \"freeze all” strategy， and appropriate heparin administration should be performed， especially for those with Anti-Phospholipid Antibodies (APAs) \\[11，12\\]. To avoid thrombosis in thawed ET， a natural ovulatory cycle is the first choice. If hormone replacement is necessary， non-oral natural estradiol andprogesterone should be administrated \\[12\\]. Furthermore， single ET should be performed to avoid the risks associated with multifetal pregnancy\\[12\\]. ART is not indicated in the women with acute flare， poorly controlled arterial hypertension， pulmonary hypertension， advanced renal disease， severe valvular or heart diseases， or major previous thrombotic events \\[11\\]. In this case， we considered that the patient had alow risk ofthrombosis，because her anti-mullerian hormone was low (0.84 ng/mL)， her APAs were negative， and she had no previous episode of thrombosis. In addition， because her platelet count was>10×104 /uL， the risk ofovarian bleeding with Oocyte Retrieval (OR) was low. Therefore， we concluded that ovarian stimulation and OR were acceptable in this case.**\n\n【42】**Fourth， we discussed the validity of ET in this case as the patient’s BP was 120-130/90-100 mmHg with a relatively high diastolic BP. As mentioned in the introduction， the target BP is controversial in pregnancy in women with CH， with ISSHP，NICE，andACOG having different guidelines. In a retrospective analysis of 215 women with CH， Ueda et al. showed that systolic BP<130 mmHg within 14 weeks of gestation reduced the risk of developing early-onset SPE \\[13\\]. We(Kurashiki Central Hospital) participated in this study and recognized the importance of systolic BP control. In this case ET was performed in 2020 when the international guidelines for target diastolic BP ranged from 85 mmHg to 110 mmHg. Therefore， we believed ET to be acceptable in this case.**\n\n【43】**Lastly， we discussed Fertility Preservation (FP) in women with SLE， who are prohibited from getting pregnant. It is well accepted that SLE itself is not a cause of infertility \\[6，7，11，12\\]. However，**\n\n【44】**administration of Cyclophosphamide (CPA) decreases ovarian reserve， resulting in decreased fertility \\[6，7，11，12\\]. Additionally， when a woman with SLE is advised not to conceive for a long period， her fertility decreases because of a decreased ovarian reserve and oocyte ageing \\[12\\]. It is demonstrated that clinicians should give information on FP，including cryopreservation of embryos/oocytes/ovarian tissue， to the female patients with SLE who are going to be administrated with CPA， in European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology(ESHRE) guidelines \\[14\\] and American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) guidelines \\[15\\]. Accordingly， FP counseling before CPA administration is a common practice at present. In Japan， there have been reports on this issue since 2015. However， FP counseling for women with SLE who are advised not to conceive for a long period is not yet a common practice； FP counseling for these women is not present in the ESHRE or ASRM guidelines. A review by Italian doctors showed that FP should be considered for women who are advised not to conceive for a long period \\[12\\]， suggesting that FP had been practical in Italy or European nations in these cases. However， we could not find such reports in English. We believe that FP for women prohibited from pregnancy is not yet a common practice because it is undetermined whether ART in women with SLE during a pregnancy-prohibited period is safe and effective. Additionally， we could not find the reports on FP in women with CH.**\n\n【45】**In conclusion， we present a woman with CH and SLE， in whom post-stillbirth depression and medical adherence improved during embryo preservation， resulting in systolic BP control and a livebirth. We reported this case because it provides in formation on FP in women with CH or SLE during pregnancy-prohibited period. However， the safety and effectiveness on this approach is undetermined，and careful consideration is necessary on a case-by-case basis.**\n\n【46】**Ethical Consideration**\n\n【47】**We have obtained the written informed consent from the patient for the publication of this report.

However， unlike other solid organs such as kidneys and liver， only 15% to 25% oflungs from donors are transplanted \\[1\\]. Therefore， Ex Vivo Lung Perfusion (EVLP) has become an essential tool to expand the number of lung donors in recent years.**\n\n【23】**Case Presentation**\n\n【24】**A 52-year-old male with a past medical history of depression and atrial fibrillation was offered as a potential Maastricht III donor. The patient had a P/F of 320 mmHg， normal bronchoscopy， and condensation on the Right Lower Lobe (RLL) on the X-ray and CT scan (Figure 2A， 2B). Grafts were accepted for in situ evaluation. During the assessment， asystole was confirmed 45 min after withdrawal with a warm ischemic time of 30 min. After flushing and macroscopic inspection of the grafts， modest bilateral edema was discovered along with RLL atelectasis. Therefore， an Ex Vivo Evaluation (EVLP) was considered for a reconditioning and further evaluation of the organs. Miscommunication between the harvesting and implanting teams resulted in separate storage and transport of the. Nevertheless， EVLP evaluation was approved， and the organs were brought to**\n\n【25】**Figure 1： Organ in the LS-1 organ chamber during perfusion prior to ventilation， and after table surgery adjustment.**\n\n【26】Figure 2A： Donor's X-ray.

A 1/2，3/8-inch “y’connector with a piece of priming hues on the 1/2 end and a silk ligature around each dissected pulmonary artery was used to adapt the circulatory circuit (Figure 3). The same was done for the airway， a pace of hues with ventilator adapter in a 1/2 end of the y connector. While a silk ligature around the 3/8 end of the connector and the left main bronchus was enough to fitting and secure it (Figure4)， an extra maneuver was required due to a size discrepancy of the main right bronchus. The short remaining trachea was split， and a supplementary pace of hues was placed over the 3/8 end to adapt the gauge (Figure 4). Thus， securing it with a tie was possible and final reassembly of the airway was accomplished. Extra silk sutures on the edge of the bronchus were placed and tied on the 1/2 end to prevent displacement during ventilation (Figure 5). After table surgery the organs were placed in the perfusion chamber (Figure 6) and modified ex-vivo Lund protocol was followed. During 90 min of perfusion， the lungs showed steady PA pressure， PVR， proper**\n\n【29】**Figure 4： Y connector one end on the left main bronchus with silk tight.

However， as dedicated centers grapple with an ever-growing waiting list， graft shortage，approximately 10%to 13% oflung transplant candidates die waiting every year \\[2\\]. Lung utilization rate is 15% to 20% from eligible multiorgan donors \\[3\\]， the lowest of solid organs. Some alternatives such as marginal donors\\[4\\]， lobar transplantation \\[5\\]， living-related donors， Donation after Circulatory Death (DCD) donors， have been introduced to overcome this shortage. In addition， ex vivo lung perfusion is safe and effective alternative to solve donor shortage in lung transplantation.**\n\n【36】**Ex Vivo Lung Perfusion (EVLP) is an alternative to conventional approaches for donor lungassessment， reconditioning， and preservation in clinical lung transplantation. Allowing re-evaluation of questionable donor lungs before implantation and seizing the opportunity to repair injured donor lungs that are otherwise unsuitable for transplantation.**\n\n【37】**In our experience， EVLP has positively impacted our program， increasing the overall transplant activity by 14% from perfused organs with an additional 5% from lung donors assessed with EVLP**\n\n【38】**intentions that are transplanted immediately.

We hypothesized that a shortened course of antibiotics would not lead to adverse outcomes in patients who underwent surgery for uncomplicated appendicitis as compared to a longer course.**\n\n【13】**Methods： This is a retrospective analysis of 940 patients admitted to a tertiary urban hospital. We included adult patients who underwent appendicectomy for acute， uncomplicated appen dicitis and who had medical records available from at least one follow-up outpatient visit. We excluded patients who were found to have perforated appendicitis intra operatively， as well as those who had other intra-abdominal infections that may have required treatment.**\n\n【14】**Patients were divided into two groups： those who received 24 h or less of antibiotics (intravenous and oral)， and those who received more than this. Outcomes were then compared between the two groups. The primary outcome was rate of intra-abdominal collection， while secondary outcomes were rates of surgical site infection， re-admission to hospital for infectious issues and antibiotic complications.**\n\n【15】**Results and Conclusion： We found no statistically significant difference in the rate of intra-abdominal collection， or of any of the secondary outcomes between the two groups. Our data suggests that patients who have undergone appendicectomy for uncomplicated antibiotics should not receive a prolonged course of antibiotics as a routine unless other indications are present.**\n\n【16】**Introduction**\n\n【17】**Acute appendicitis is one of the most common diseases faced by general surgeons today， with an estimated annual incidence of 10 per 100，000 populations (Figure 1). The gold standard treatment of appendicitis has traditionally been surgery， although recent studies have called this into question\\[1，2\\]. The laparoscopic approach has become widely accepted in many parts of the world \\[3，4\\]， which has led to significant changes in the rate and complications encountered after surgery.**\n\n【18】**_Citation：_**\n\n【19】**It is well known that laparoscopic surgery results in alower wound infection rate than open， at the expense of an increased risk ofintra-abdominal collections. The WSES Jerusalem guidelines \\[1\\] advise against prolonging the duration of postoperative antibiotics beyond three to five days even in cases of complicated appendicitis once adequate source control is achieved. Given that most (75%to 87%) patients have non-perforated appendicitis， we hypothesized that most patients who have undergone surgery do not need a prolonged course of antibiotics**\n\n【20】**Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) is a busy urban hospital in Singapore with one of the highest numbers of emergency admissions daily. We perform over 450 appendicectomies for adults yearly， and there has been a switch from the open to the laparoscopic approach over the past 15 years. The absence of an acute care team means this surgical load is evenly distributed throughout the department，and hence some differences in clinical practice (such as antibiotic choice and duration) were present. We therefore set out to compare the outcomes of patients receiving a shorter couSe(24 h or less) of antibiotics against those who received a longer course.**\n\n【21】**Methodology**\n\n【22】**This is a retrospective study using available medical records for patients undergoing appendicectomy (both laparoscopic and open) for non-perforated appendicitis.

Out of a total of 2，247 appendicectomies performed，1，228 patients' records were screened and a further 288 patients who had defaulted their follow-up appointments were excluded as data on outcomes was not available.**\n\n【25】**Variables and Outcomes**\n\n【26】**The remaining patients were then divided into two groups， one which received 24 h or less of antibiotics (n=673 patients) and those who received a longer course (n=267 patients). This cut off was based on the WSES Jerusalem guidelines \\[4\\]. For the purposes of this study， both intravenous and oral antibiotics were considered to be equivalent.**\n\n【27】**The primary outcome was the rate of development of intra-abdominal abscess， while secondary outcomes were superficial**\n\n【28】**surgical site infections， side effects from antibiotic usage and hospital re-admission rates for any related issues. Rates of intra-abdominal abscess， readmission rate and antibiotic complication rates were compared between the two groups using Fisher’s Exact Test while superficial surgical site infection rate was compared using the Chi-Squared Test. All statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS Statistics v26.**\n\n【29】**Results**\n\n【30】**A total of 940 patients were analyzed， and they were divided into2 groups those who received 24 h or less of antibiotics while the other group received a longer course than 24 h. The demographics of the patient cohort are shown in Table 1. As expected， the majority of the patients were young with a median age of 33 and 37 years in both groups. While a difference in age was observed between the groups， we feel this is unlikely to have any clinical significance particularlyon patient outcomes.**\n\n【31】**While patients found to have perforation intra operatively were excluded from our study， a small number of patients were thought to have non perforated appendicitis whose histology returned as perforation. As Table 1 shows， a higher proportion of patients in the>24 hantibiotic group were foundtohave perforation comparedto the<24 h group (7.2% vs. 3.7%). These patients were therefore excluded from the subsequent statistical analysis to avoid contamination of the results.**\n\n【32】**On comparing the outcomes， we found the rate of intra-abdominal abscess formation was higher in the longer antibiotic group， despite it not reaching statistical significance in our study. On univariate analysis， patients who received >24 h of antibiotics were found to be more likely to be readmitted (p=0.036) although this difference disappeared on multivariate analysis. There was no difference between the two groups in the other secondary outcomes studied (Table 2，3).**\n\n| **Outcomes**  | **Patients who had received 24 hours or less ofpostoperative antibiotic therapy (n=673)**  |  | **Patients who received more than 24 hours ofpostoperative antibiotics (n=267)**  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Intra-abdominal abscesS**  | **6**  | **0.89%**  | **7**  |  | **2.62%**  |\n| **Readmission for re-infection**  | **4**  | **0.59%**  | **6**  |  | **2.25%**  |\n| **Superficial Surgical Site Infection**  | **12**  | **1.78%**  | **6**  |  | **2.25%**  |\n| **Histology showing perforation**  | **24**  | **3.56%**  | **18**  |  | **6.74%**  |\n| **Side effects of antibiotics**  | **Total：1**  | **0.14%**  | **Total：2**  |  | **0.74%**  |\n|  | **\\-Diarrhoea： 1**  |  | **\\-Diarrhoea： 1**  |  | **0.37%**  |\n|  |  |  | **\\-Oral thrush： 1**  |  | **0.37%**  |\n\n【34】**\\-Oral thrush： 1 0.37%**\n\n| **Table 3： Primary outcomes.**  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **≤24 h antibiotics(n=673)**  | **\\>24 h antibiotics(n=267)**  | **p-value**  | **OR (95%CI)**  |  |\n| **Intra-abdominal Abscess**  | **6**  | **7**  | **0.059**  | **2.993(0.996-8.990)**  |  |\n| **Superficial surgical site infection**  | **12**  | **6**  | **0.64**  | **1.266(0.470-3.409)**  |  |\n| **Hospital re-admission**  | **4**  | **6**  | **0.036**  | **3.845(1.076-13.735)**  |  |\n| **Antibiotics complication**  | **1**  | **2**  | **0.196**  | **5.072 (0.458-56.167)**  |  |\n\n【36】**Our results therefore suggest that in patients without frank intraoperative evidence of perforation or gangrene， a longer course of post-operative antibiotics did not lead to a higher rate of complications and potentially could have contributed to additional morbidity.**\n\n【37】**Discussion**\n\n【38】**Our results， while counter intuitive to historical surgical pedagogy， do fit with the findings of several previous groups \\[6，7\\]. This finding is significant because the World Health Organization \\[8\\] recently released a report advocating for the restriction of antibiotic use to rein in antibiotic resistance. Given that appendicitis is one of the most common diseases treated by general surgeons， it is crucial to restrict antibiotics to the patients who require it. This would help slow the proliferation of microbial resistance to antibiotics while also avoiding unnecessary complications from antibiotic use.**\n\n【39】**Like previous authors \\[6\\]， we found a number of patients who had surgical notes indicating no perforation (hence included in our study) although their histological reports showed perforation. This could be from recording errors (the surgeon typing the note wrongly recorded or left out perforation) or from specimen handling during transfer to the pathologist. Regardless， clinical decision making on antibiotic duration would have been based on the recorded finding in most cases， and our initial data shows that these patients did not suffer from a higher rate of infective complications (though these patients were later excluded in the final analysis).**\n\n【40】**Interestingly， the results we had showed a trend towards a higher odds ratio of complications in patients given more than 24 h of antibiotics. None were statistically significant except for the rates of readmission i.e.， patients who were given more antibiotics having a higher rate of readmissions. Some possible reasons for this include these patients being more ill and/or having baseline poorer co-morbidities to begin with， which then predisposed them to a negative outcome (For example， patients on immunosuppression， history of diabetes etc)， and developing complications in spite of being given more antibiotics.**\n\n【41】**Our study was retrospective and from a single institution， so care should be taken when generalizing to other settings. It is also possible**\n\n【42】**that other factors played a role in the managing clinician deciding to give alonger course of antibiotics， and this might not have been picked up. Even so， the lack of a difference in patient outcomes between both groups is reassuring and will hopefully lead to a change in future practice patterns. Given current evidence， it is difficult to envision prospective studies in this setting as it would not be ethical to give patients antibiotics when they have been shown to be unnecessary.**\n\n【43】**In summary， we advocate stopping antibiotics within 24 h post-surgery for patients who have uncomplicated appendicitis.**\n\n【44】**References**\n\n【45】**l.

It can be diagnosed antenatally， especially in male fetuses. Megalourethra is a cystic dilation of the anterior urethra， mainly resulting in pulmonaryhypoplasia and renal insufficiency in the neonatal period. Techniques are available (vesico-amniotic shunt， fetoscopy) to remove or overcome the obstacle and thus improve the neonatal and subsequent prognosis. It is essential to look for associated malformations， which are more common in megalourethra than in other conditions of the anterior urethra.**\n\n【13】**Introduction**\n\n【14】**Megalourethra is a cystic dilation of the urethra that can be identified antenatally. It results from an obstruction of the distal urinary tract that can affect the bladder and kidneys in the fetus and in the neonate. This condition belongs to Lower Urinary Tract Obstructions (LUTOs). It is a rare entity with few cases reported in the literature， and its descriptions have mostly been included in more general publications concerning LUTOs. Based on a case encountered in August 2021， this article is aimed at describing and better understanding this condition， providing avenues for its management， and addressing neonatal prognosis.**\n\n【15】**Clinical Case**\n\n【16】**A 31-year-old patient， G4P1 (one elective abortion， one full-term vaginal delivery of a healthy boy， one early spontaneous miscarriage)， with no relevant medical or surgical history， was referred at 19+2 Weeks of Amenorrhea (WA) for megabladder， bilateral ureterohydronephrosis， and suspected hypospadias.**\n\n【17】**The first trimester ultrasound (12+6 WA) was unremarkable and noninvasive prenatal testing was normal. A Cytomegalovirus (CMV) seroconversion was noted in the second trimester of the pregnancy.**\n\n【18】**The ultrasound performed at 19+2 WA revealed bilateral nephromegaly associated with megabladder and cystic dilation of the penis (Figures 1-3). The amniotic fluid volume was low-normal (Phelan Index： 8.7 cm) and the fetus was eutrophic. There was no evidence of fetal CMV infection on ultrasound. A first vesicocentesis was performed at 19+4 WA and a second one was scheduled at 19+6 WA to evaluate the fetal renal function. The urinary ionogram was pathological and B2-microglobulin was increased in the urine， indicating fetal renal failure. The molecular karyotype performed on the amniotic fluid was normal.**\n\n【19】**The follow-up ultrasound performed at 21+0 WA showed the same abnormalities as previously described， but with the addition of oligohydramnios (index： 5.2 cm)，and hyperechoic renal cortices.**\n\n【20】**After explanation of the situation and prognosis (see discussion) in our fetal medicine center， the couple requested medical termination of pregnancy. This request was accepted by the medical ethics committee.**\n\n【21】**The feticide (intracordal sufentanil and intracardiac potassium chloride) and expulsion (induced by mifepristone at D-2 and misoprostol) occurred at 22+0 WA. The patient gave birth to a male child， 520 g and 29 cm.**\n\n【22】**As the couple did not want an autopsy， no exhaustive post-mortem examination was performed. We noted an enlarged penis (Figure 4)， no palpable erectile body and an unremarkable abdominal wall. Macroscopically， the urinary meatus appeared permeable (Figure 5). These findings， although**\n\n【23】**Figure 1： M： Megalourethra， S： Scrotum， T： Thigh.**\n\n【24】**Figure 4： Penile Dilation.**\n\n【25】**Figure 5： Urinary Meatus.**\n\n【26】**Figure 2： B： Bladder， K： Kidney， P： Renal Pelvis.**\n\n| **Vesicocentesis**  | **19+4WA**  | **19+6WA**  | **Normal values \\[11**  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Osmolality (mOsm/L)**  | **252**  | **245**  | **<200**  |\n| **Sodium (mmol/L)**  | **122**  | **118**  | **<100**  |\n| **Potassium {mmol/L)**  | **5**  | **5**  |  |\n| **Chloride (mmol/L)**  | **98**  | **95**  | **<90**  |\n| **Calcium (mmol/L)**  | **2**  | **2**  | **<0.95**  |\n| **32-micraglabulin (mg/L)**  | **\\>4**  | **18.345**  | **<0.3**  |\n\n【28】**Table 2： Differential diagnosis.**\n\n【29】**not comprehensive， are consistent with a diagnosis of primary megalourethra (Table 1).**\n\n【30】**Discussion**\n\n| **Cystic dilation of the penis -differential diagnosis**  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Anterior urethral vave**  |  |\n| **Preputial stenosis**  |  |\n| **Urethral stenosis**  |  |\n| **Primary megalourethra**  |  |\n| **Prune-Belly syndrome**  |  |\n| **Umbilical cord loop in the pelvic region**  |  |\n\n【32】**Definition**\n\n【33】**The first clinical use of the term “megalourethra” dates from 1955and the first prenatal ultrasound diagnosis from 1989 \\[2，3\\].**\n\n【34】**enlarges， its wall thins， and the erectile bodies become progressively hypoplastic\\[6\\].Some authors describe the primary forms as fusiform， i.e. with absence of all the penile erectile bodies， and the secondary forms as scaphoid， where only the corpus spongiosum is a plastic \\[9\\]. This morphological distinction can be seen after birth \\[9-11\\].**\n\n【35】**Congenital megalourethra results from an aplasia of penile erectile tissue causing abnormal dilatation of the anterior urethra due to the lack of supporting tissue \\[4-7\\]. Urinary stasis is therefore the consequence of the swelling of the urethra that lacks support. The swelling has a valve-like effect and prevents urine from flowing out\\[2\\]. These cases can be considered as primary megalourethras \\[6，8\\]. In other so-called secondary cases， urethral dilation is related to a distal urethral obstruction that may result from a valve phenomenon or urethral or preputial stenosis \\[2，6，8\\]. As a result， the urethra**\n\n【36】**Epidemiology**\n\n【37】**Urogenital tract anomalies are the third most common non-chromosomal anomalies. It is estimated that 3.8 children out of1，000 births are affected by this type of conditions， which makes up approximately 20% of the anomalies diagnosed antenatally. Megalourethra is a rarity among these anomalies \\[12，13\\].**\n\n【38】Figure 6： Keyhole Sign； B： Bladder，： Posterior Urethra.\n\n【39】**Embryology**\n\n【40】**Congenital megalourethra is characterized by the absence of penile mesodermal tissue. The cloacal membrane is composed of two layers， theendoderm andthe ectoderm. The mesodermal mesenchyme migrates towards the cranial pole of the cloacal membrane and forms the genital tubercle between the cloacal membrane and the umbilicus. On either side of the cloacal membrane， the mesoderm forms the urogenital folds. More laterally， the labioscrotal swellings are formed. These different structures are the embryonic precursors of the male and female external genitalia.**\n\n【41】**In response to androgen production in the male fetus， the mesoderm of the genital tubercle elongates and enlarges to form the cavernous bodies and glans penis. At the same time， the urethra is formed by tubularization of the endoderm， while the skin and prepuce develop from the ectoderm. The genital swellings will fuse to form the scrotum.**\n\n【42】**In the case of secondary megalourethra， the embryological origin of the anomaly is thought to be a defect in the epithelial canalization of the glandular urethra \\[2，6，14，15\\].**\n\n【43】**Antenatal description**\n\n【44】**On ultrasound， the male fetus exhibits an ovoid dilation of the urethra extending to its distal end. LUTO signs can also be found on antenatal examination： megabladder， ureteral dilation， and possibly hydronephrosis with changes in renal echostructure and oligohydramnios \\[6，8，12，16\\]. In some cases， a posterior urethral valve with the \"keyhole sign\" Figure 6 is visible on ultrasound， reflecting dilation of the posterior urethra， and may be the consequence of a severe stenosis of the anterior urethra \\[8，12\\].**\n\n【45】**On ultrasound， cystic dilation ofthe penis should not be mistaken for a loop of the umbilical cord near the pelvic region of the fetus； the distinction is made by using color Doppler \\[7，17\\] (Table 2).**\n\n【46】**Associations**\n\n【47】**Megalourethra is a rare sign of the Prune-Belly syndrome that combines bladder hypertrophy， ureteral dilatation and abnormalities， hydronephrosis， bladder activity disorders， aplasia or hypoplasia of the muscles of the anterior abdominal wall， and cryptorchidism. Although the etiology is not clearly established， it seems that the primum movens is urethral atresia and the resulting obstruction of the distal urinary tract \\[18\\].**\n\n【48】**In their series of 10 cases， Amsalem et al. \\[8\\] described a VACTERL association； four fetuses had clubfoot and two had anal atresia. Some authors have associated megalourethra with anorectal**\n\n【49】**malformations， esophageal atresia， VATER association， trisomy21， or dental， intestinal， and musculoskeletal malformations \\[17\\]. Therefore， there might be some malformative associations to look for in case of megalourethra， while other anomalies of the anterior urethra are isolated in most cases \\[51.**\n\n【50】**Management**\n\n【51】**Vesico-amniotic shunt consists in placing a catheter between the fetal bladder and the amniotic cavity. This allows the bladder to empty， to artificially eliminate the lower urinary obstruction， and to decrease the pressure in the upper urinary tract \\[19，20\\].**\n\n【52】**It is also possible to perform a fetoscopy with cystoscopy to make the diagnosis and， if necessary， to perform a meatotomy or a valve removal，or to place a urethral stent \\[6，12，13，21\\]. While the technique is more complicated， its benefits compared to the shunt and its effectiveness cannot be ascertained due to the small number of cases\\[13，22\\].**\n\n【53】**These treatments are based on case series concerning LUTOs in general， some of which have included a few cases of megalourethra.**\n\n【54】**Neonatal consequences**\n\n【55】**The consequences of megalourethra are the same as those of LUTOs， namely： Pulmonary hypoplasia due to oligohydramnios， progressive renal failure due to vesico-ureteral reflux， micturition disorders，incontinence， recurrent urinary tract infections， and sexual dysfunction \\[2，5，16\\].**\n\n【56】**The prognosis is worse in case of bilateral ureterohydronephrosis， renal cysts，and oligo-or even anamnios. This is all the more true if the onset is early during pregnancy \\[4，12\\]. Some authors have described the primary forms as having a poorer prognosis \\[9\\].**\n\n【57】**Postnatal renal function is difficult to predict. Fetal kidney appearance does not seem to correlate with fetal urine biochemistry， and both ultrasonographic kidneyappearance and renal biochemistry should be considered in assessing fetal renal function \\[23\\]. However， fetal urine biochemistry by vesicocentesis is not unanimously accepted for assessing fetal renal function， and even less for predicting it postnatally \\[24\\].**\n\n【58】**Long-term consequences**\n\n**Studies tend to show an increase in overall survival in the case of prenatal intervention but they do not provide strong evidence of improvement in neonatal kidney function， let alone in the longer term |13，21，24，25.**\n\n【60】**Penile dysfunctions result in impotence， extensive dilation of the penis preventing correct vaginal intromission， and during micturition， urethral congestion and penile dilation. Few adult cases have been described in the literature. Surgical management is possible to obtain an acceptable aesthetic and functional result \\[26-28\\]. Antenatal removal of the obstacle allows recovery of a normal penile morphology， which would suggest that penile functions are better preserved and that reconstructive surgery is not necessary，but this could not be proven \\[9\\].**\n\n【61】**Megalourethra is a rare condition that can easily be detected in the antenatal period， although the definitive diagnosis is more akin to a diagnosis of exclusion for its primary form. In such cases， it is essential to perform a complete fetal morphological examination**\n\n【62】**in order to search for associated conditions or syndromes and repercussions on the urinary tract. As in all forms of LUTO， the neonatal prognosis depends on the severity of renal insufficiency and pulmonary hypoplasia， two parameters that are difficult to assess antenatally and even more difficult to predict postnatally. Therapeutic options exist to allow emptying of the urinary tree and hopefully preserve or improve postnatal renal and pulmonary function by maintaining sufficient diuresis and amniotic fluid volume.**\n\n【63】**References**\n\n【64】**1\\.

A late diagnosis， unplanned pregnancy course and delivery are related to a 40% to 50% maternal and fetal mortality risk. Conversely， early detection and treatment significantly reduces both to 5% to 15%. Based on a literature review and our implications for the present case report， we suggest a multidisciplinary diagnosis and management algorithm PHEO in pregnancy.**\n\n【11】**Case Report： A35-year-old primigravida at 27+1 weeks of Gestation \\[GA\\] presented with headache and previously diagnosed chronic Hypertension \\[HTN\\] aggravation. Complete evaluation ruled out pregnancy related HTN. A high suspicion level for an alternative cause for HTN was raised. Appropriate imaging studies revealed a heterogenous mass adjacent to the left adrenal 8 cm x 7cm in diameter， highly suspicious for adrenal tumor. Elevated urine catecholamines confirmed the diagnosis ofPHEO. A multidisciplinaryteam was formed and a joint decision for disease control and delayed surgery until after delivery was taken. Blood pressure control was achieved by a combined alpha and beta-adrenergic blocker approach at levels of 135-140/80-90.**\n\n【12】**Antenatal steroids for fetal lung maturation were administered with concurrent 24 h BP Holter. Her condition remained stable and at 32+0 GA a planned cesarean section delivery using a minimal intraperitoneal handling technique under neuraxial anesthesia. A male newborn of 1，960 g was delivered， 1'/5'Apgar score 6/9. The medical therapy was continued with lower BP goals and a planned laparoscopic adrenalectomy performed after 2 weeks of postpartum recovery. The mother and child were discharged in good condition.**\n\n【13】**Conclusion： The maternal and fetal lethal consequences of PHEO during pregnancy may be prevented by a high index of suspicion for the diagnosis and following a multidisciplinary algorithm of management， adapted to the individual patient， mainly based on achievement of BP control and the gestational age.**\n\n【14】**Case Presentation**\n\n【15】**35-year-oldprimigravida at 27+1 weeks of Gestation \\[GA\\]，work immigrant from the Philippines， was referred to our center with a diagnosis of severe aggravation of chronic Hypertension \\[HTN\\].**\n\n【16】**Her medical history was positive for a HTN disease diagnosed four years prior to referral and diagnosed as essential； treated with TRITACE (5 mg/25 mg ramipril and hydrochlorothiazide 5mg) tid. Her family history was positive for chronic HTN (mother and maternal grandmother). Additionally， she was diagnosed with Diabetes Mellitus type 2 \\[DM2\\] and treated with Metformin850 mg/daily with no regular control of glucose levels.**\n\n【17】**Her pregnancy was spontaneously conceived while a HbA1C % level of 6.5%. Genetic screening consisted of nuchal translucency， biochemical 1 and 2n trimester screening as well as fetal anatomy Ultrasound \\[US\\] evaluation； all reported within normallimits. During the 1trimester she reported intractable headache and Blood Pressure \\[BP\\] values registered as high as 240/125. At the time the patient denied flushing， palpitations， and sweating. Labetalol 200 MG tid was then added.**\n\n【18】**She was referred to the emergency department at 27+1 GA because of headache. The initial examination the BP measured 198/119， with no skin or vasomotor changes. The laboratory workup was within normal limits； hemoglobin percentage 13.6 g %， platelet count 413K， normal liver function and Protein Creatinine Ration \\[PCR\\] of 0.14. The uterine fundal height corresponded to the GA and the fetal biophysical profile was 10/10. A diagnosis of aggravated chronic HTN**\n\n【19】**prompted treatment with intravenous hydralazine and magnesium sulfate and admission to the maternal fetal medicine ward.**\n\n【20】**Figure 2： Magnetic Resonance Image \\[MRI\\] of the abdomen (axial and coronal planes) showing around heterogenous mass T2 hyperintensity measured 8.7 cm x 7 cm (M)， the posterior part of it located near the left Kidney (K).**\n\n【21】**Due to the sustained high BP the differential diagnosis was extended from superimposed Preeclampsia \\[PET\\] spectrum other chronic HTN causes (endocrinopathies， renal artery stenosis etc.). Further examination included ophthalmologic examination， echocardiography， renal artery Doppler studies； all within normal range. Abdominal Sonography revealed a heterogenousmass adjacent to her left adrenal measured 8 cm × 7 cm (Figure 1). A subsequent Magnetic Resonance Imaging \\[MRI\\] showed a T2hyperintensity space occupying lesion， without hyper vascularization and neither lymphadenopathy (Figure 2). A differential diagnosis of Pheochromocytoma \\[PHEO\\] versus Adreno-Cortico-Carcinoma\\[ACC\\] was raised. A 24 h urine with a metanephrine level of 94.9mcg/24 h \\[range 39 to 256\\] nor-metanephrine 14777.7 mcg/24 h\\[range 92-604\\] confirmed a diagnosis of PHEO.**\n\n【22】**A multidisciplinaryteam Of maternal-fetal medicine， neonatology， endocrinology， anesthesiologists， and general surgery**\n\n【23】**was formed. The midpoint of the discussion was the balance upon the immediate surgical tumor removal in the presence of pregnancy induced cardiovascular changesand a 28 weeks uterus and subsequent delivery or deferral of the adrenal surgery until fetal maturity. After consideration of the data and previous surgical experience and a joint consult with the mother a decision was made for continuous hospitalization aimed towards the utmost conservative approach regarding the pregnancy. The aim was set for a Cesarean Delivery\\[CD\\] at 32 weeks to be followed by the adrenal surgery. A combined antihypertensive therapy was started consisting of Labetalol 400 mg tid， Amlodipine 10 mg tid and Doxazosin 7 mg bid； with a therapeutic goal of BP of 130/80； a dose of corticosteroids for fetal lung maturation under Holter monitoring of BP. Within a week of the medical therapy the BP goal was achieved. In parallel insulin therapy was started and glucose control reached. The fetal growth was appropriate and daily**\n\n【24】**Figure 3： Left adrenalectomy surgical specimen.**\n\n【25】**fetal wellbeing assessment (US BPP and NST) were reassuring.**\n\n【26】**At 32+0 weeks of gestation the mother was prepared for a minimal intraperitoneal handling technique of cesarean delivery with neuraxial anesthesia.**\n\n【27】**Upon entering the surgical suite， the patient was connected to a non-invasive BP monitor， administrated Midazolam (1 mg) and Esmolol (10 mg)； to meet the anxiety and related hypertension during the preparations. A radial arterial line was then placed (local anesthesia) towards a Combined Spinal Epidural anesthesia (CSE)， the patient received a spinal shot of hyperbaric Bupivacaine (5 mg)， Fentanyl (20 mcg) and Morphine (0.15 mg)， followed by Lidocaine2%(4 ml) injected into the epidural catheter， sensory T6 level block was diagnosed by pinprick.**\n\n【28】**with the umbilical cord 3 times around neck and a true knot. The placenta was sent for pathological assessment and later reported to be normal and adequate to the GA. Intravenous oxytocin was during surgery continued with administered， a low dose of Oxytocin drip (1unit/h) 24 h postoperative. The postoperative course was normal. The medical therapy was continued after the CD surgery for an additional two weeks in hospital. Thereafter， a planned for laparoscopic adrenalectomy under general anesthesia was preformed following a rigorous pharmaceutical preparation； a large highly vascular adrenal mass measured 8 cm in diameter was removed， no signs of macroscopic metastatic disease (Figure 3). The antihypertensive medication was limited to Labetalol 200 mg twice bid. The pathologic assessment ofthe adrenal mass confirmed the diagnosis of PHEO with intact capsule and no evidence of mitotic activity (Ki-67 proliferation index： 1%) or invasion.**\n\n【29】**Discussion**\n\n【30】**Pheochromocytoma \\[PHEO\\] a benign type catecholamine-secreting tumor， originating from chromaffin cells of medullary region of the adrenal gland or sympathetic ganglia， is an extremely rare cause of HTN disease；0.2% to 0.4%， ofall causes of hypertension. During pregnancy a scarce prevalence of 1 in 54，000 pregnancies has been reported \\[1，2\\].**\n\n【31】**The diagnosis of PHEO is based on a high level of suspicion facing related severe HTN crisis. The immediate medical interventions as aimed to limit the hazards related to extreme HTN while the definite therapy is surgical resection with the laparoscopic approach being**\n\n【32】**GA： Gestational Age； BP： Blood Pressure； CD： Cesarean Delivery；TOP： Termination of Pregnancy； IUFD： Intrauterine Fetal Demise； NST： Non-Stress Test； BPP：Biophysical Profile， EFW： Estimated Fetal Weight**\n\n【33】**preferred \\[3\\]. The effect of a concomitant pregnancy presents an additional consideration of the PHEO related hazards in view of the maternal-fetal safety concerns. Previous reports show that the two thirds of PHEO cases during pregnancy were diagnosed antepartum and the rest postpartum \\[4\\].**\n\n【34】**The present case of PHEO during pregnancy is representative of all these challenges. We will focus on the PHEO-pregnancy related considerations and present a management algorithm (Figure 4) aimed to early antepartum diagnosis and therapy； both reported to decrease maternal mortality rates from 50% to less than 5% to 15%15-81**\n\n【35】**In PHEO， as in other surgical intervention during pregnancy， the second trimester of pregnancy is considered the optimal timing； due to the fetal organogenesis stage and in cases of intra-abdominal approaches， the gravid uterus does not impair the surgical view \\[9-14\\]. Earlier reports of the PHEO included cases diagnosed after adverse outcome of a delivery or uncontrolled BP， thus with a significant bias towards a recommendation of immediate medical therapy and PHEO removal， irrespective of gestational age or fetal maturity. We hereby raise the concerns of catecholamine excessive secretion when manipulating the tumor， prolonged exposure to general anesthesia agents， prolonged right decubitus position with subsequent profound maternal hypotension and fetal deterioration. We suggest that reviewing the later cases， adrenal surgery may be deferred until after delivery in the late prematurity period.**\n\n【36】**The present suggested multidisciplinary conservative approach is aimed towards all these concerns. Mainly， it consists of an initial alpha-blocker together with an optional beta-blocker therapy to obtain BP control at any GA \\[15\\]. Predelivery medical therapy is based a-blockers at least until up to 14 days before surgery， followed by B-blockers to prevent reflex tachycardia \\[16\\]. Among a adrenergic receptor blockers doxazosin rather phenoxybenzamine； although both category C drugs during pregnancy， the later was reported to be associated with neonatal cardiorespiratory complication \\[17，18\\]. We suggest that the BP therapeutic goals in pregnancy should be higher than in the non-pregnant state， especially if longer period until delivery is expected； hypoperfusion of the uteroplacental unit， intrauterine growth restriction and placental abruption may occur with excessive low BP \\[15\\].**\n\n【37】**Although the non-pregnant BP goal is considered less than130/80 mmHg while seated and greater than 90 mmHg systolic while standing \\[19，20\\]， we suggest， a BP goal of 140/90； all the more in cases of PHEO diagnosis in the late 2n and 3r trimester ofpregnancy.**\n\n【38】**Gestational age， fetal status， patient’s response to medical treatment，malignantcharacteristics ofthetumorandthe respectability of thetumor are the main factor to take into consideration in order to plan the surgical excision \\[21\\].**\n\n【39】**Before 24 weeks of pregnancy， the recommendation is that the delivery should be postponed after the surgical therapy， for full maternal benefit； and the mode determined by obstetric considerations. The 24 weeks limit has been derived from the fetal viability limits； however， we may suggest that since these limits are re-defined， 22 weeks of gestation seems a more reasonable bound. After fetal viability， additional considerations such as HTN crisis， placental abruption prior to or during adrenal surgery together with the difficult surgical field approach are to be taken in consideration\\[9，17，22\\]. Nevertheless， antihypertensive therapy and hemodynamic**\n\n【40】**instability during adrenal surgery may be seriously detrimental to the fetus leading to severe brain hypoperfusion. We consider that the consult in the fetal pre-viability period should include the option of termination of pregnancy. In case surgical intervention is performed and the pregnancy is continued， careful targeted fetal brain imaging into the second part of the pregnancy is warranted.**\n\n【41】**In cases the PHEO is diagnosed after fetal viability， that the mainstay of the management should be aimed the achievement and maintenance of maternal BP response to medical therapy， under hospitalization in a center with multidisciplinary facilities. This first goal successful achievement is the indicator that allows postponing delivery and refraining from extreme prematurity，i.e.，at least until 32weeks gestation \\[11\\]. Although fetal movements have been postulated an ability to induce adrenal hypertensive crisis； we found no robust proof in the literature； including the present case. Antenatal steroids for fetal lung maturation are to be administered with concurrent 24h BP Holter.**\n\n【42】**The delivery， either emergency or planned should be attended by a multidisciplinary team. Previous case reports suggested a higher maternal mortality rate after Vaginal Delivery \\[VD\\] in contrast with elective Cesarean Section \\[CS\\] \\[3\\]； CS is reported to lower the maternal and fetal mortality rate from 33% to 19% \\[23\\]. This might be the base that approximately 80% of the cases were delivered by CS； either planned or emergent \\[20，21\\].**\n\n【43】**The excess of maternalfetal hazards in the case ofavaginal delivery， has been explained by the maternal BP stress induced rapid changes， elevation of the intra-abdominal pressure during labor and the labor and the related pain which can result in excessive catecholamine's secretion. We consider that independent of the BP control， in view of a planned premature delivery with an expected low cervical Bishop score， a planned CS is the preferred mode of delivery. Importantly， the pain management is critical in either delivery situation \\[24-26\\].**\n\n【44】**The anesthetic management goal for the CS is preoperative anxiety limitation and BP stability and monitoring； in addition to ASA standard monitoring， a radial arterial line is warranted.**\n\n【45】**Neuraxial anesthesia should be considered for PHEO Caesarean sections \\[26\\]. This type of anesthesia may prevent the swift rise in BP often observed during intubation and reduce pain-related hypertension via use of intrathecal morphine. However， neuraxial anesthesia (namely spinal anesthesia) often results in sympathectomy， causing an associated decline in BP. In the present case a Combined Spinal Epidural anesthesia (CSE) approach was elected， as it allows the use of reduced doses of intrathecal Bupivacaine and reduced subsequent hemodynamic effects， with additional epidural doses， if needed.**\n\n【46】**Conclusion**\n\n【47】**In cases of concomitant PHEO and pregnancy， timed diagnosis， a multidisciplinary approach (Figure 4) with planned delivery will benefit the mother and the fetus with a favorable outcome.**\n\n【48】**References**\n\n【49】**1\\.

The following is a clinical case of PASAT in a47-year-old woman，and a bibliographic search was carried out to update the evidence.**\n\n【16】**Case Presentation**\n\n【17】**A 47-year-old female patient with no relevant background presents with a history of 5 years of hirsutism and amenorrhea， intensified in the previous year， adding alopecia， increased muscle mass， and voice deepening (Figure 1a， 1b). The physical examination reports an average weight， normal blood pressure， moderate hirsutism (18 on the Ferriman-Gallwey scoring system)， and clitoromegaly without elements of Cushing's syndrome nor acanthosis Nigricans syndrome.**\n\n【18】**Laboratory tests highlight the value of Total Testosterone of 937 ng/dl (reference value 8.4 to48.1)； serum Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) 331 pg/dl (reference value 56.2 to 282.9)； normal serum Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH)， Luteinizing Hormone (LH)， and Prolactin(PRL)； finally， a serum cortisol level of 1.6 ug/dl was obtained after a dexamethasone suppression test.**\n\n【19】**Imaging**\n\n【20】**An abdominal Computed Tomography (CT) shows a solid nodular right adrenal mass with hypodense areas inside， 40x34x32 mm， washout of 16.3%， deemed uncharacterizable. On the left adrenal， an adenoma of 12 ×10×10 mm size is reported (Figure 2). A Positron Emission Tomography (PET-CT) with 18F-FDG (fluorine-18 fluorode oxyglucose) shows low and diffuse metabolism in the right lesion and confirms the left adenoma (Figure 3).**\n\n【21】**Pathology**\n\n【22】**Given the described findings， right-side adrenalectomy by the laparoscopic approach was decided and performed without complications. Multiple pathologists analyzed the histological**\n\n【23】**Figures 1A and 1B： Patient's physical features relevant to the diagnosis.**\n\n| **Figures 1A and 1B： Patient's physical features relevant to the diagnosis.** **Table 1： Weiss Score.

The total testosterone and DHEAS levels dropped to a normal range for age and sex regarding laboratory findings.**\n\n【29】**Discussion**\n\n【30】**Epidemiology**\n\n【31】**Virilizing adrenocortical tumors are rare in adults. About 50%appear before puberty， 39% correspond to adenomas， and 80%are seen in women. They have a high chance of malignancy (70%) if virilization appears in adult women， with rapidly progressive symptoms and Cushing syndrome. This association was ruled out in our patient \\[2\\].**\n\n【32】**According to Moreno et al. \\[3\\]， PASATs make up for 2.4% of all adrenalectomies and cause 49% of women’s virilizing syndromes. In their review of 34 patients with PASAT， Gabrilove et al. \\[4\\] report a slight predominance ofthe right adrenal compared to the left \\[4\\].**\n\n【33】**PASATs secrete DHEA and DHEA-S rather than testosterone. On the other hand， the predominance of testosterone tends the diagnosis towards an ovarian pathology \\[2\\]. It should be noted that there are no alterations found in the patient's ovaries. Exceptionally， there are adrenal tumors that secrete only testosterone in the absence of other androgens \\[2\\].**\n\n【34】Figure 2： Abdominal CT. The continuous arrow indicates right adrenal lesion； the dashed arrow indicates left adrenal adenoma.\n\n【35】**Figure 3： 18F-FDG PET/CT. The arrow indicates the right adrenal lesion.**\n\n【36】**Clinical findings**\n\n【37】**The androgen excess in women clinically shows with hirsutism and progress to virilization with clitoromegaly， voice deepening， alopecia， increase of muscle mass， changes in body fat distribution， and decrease in breast volume， among others. However， other entities present similar clinical manifestations， such as Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)， ovarian tumors， and congenital adrenal hyperplasia \\[5，6\\]. The literature has described cases of malignant PASAT patients without hirsutism. These cases could be explained by abrupt tumoral appearance， without leaving time for androgens to act on hair receptors and manifest this sign \\[3\\].**\n\n【38】**Diagnosis**\n\n【39】**A biochemical confirmation， using DHEAS and increased total testosterone (12-fold above the upper limit of normal range orients to malignancy) \\[3\\] will confirm the clinical suspicion. Some authors suggest that dynamic tests should be performed， such as dexamethasone androgen suppression test for establishing a differential diagnosis between an adrenal tumor and other causes of hyperandrogenism. A decrease in post-dose androgens of at least 40%allows the identification of non-tumor pathology with a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 88%， given that adrenal tumors secrete androgens autonomously without ACTH regulation \\[7\\].**\n\n【40】**Diagnosing PASATs in males represents a challenge for the clinician since they are only evident when the peripheral androgen-to-estrogen conversion is present 8\\].**\n\n【41】**Imaging diagnostic tools include abdominal CT as the initial approach，followed by MRI or 18F-FDG PET-CT. This last technique reveals its usefulness in evaluating intratumoral metabolic rate\\[9，10\\]. In our case， due to the CT characteristics and the equipment's availability， an 18F-FDG PET-CT was requested， and it revealed low**\n\n【42】**intratumoral metabolism.**\n\n【43】**PASATs are almost always large-sized， which is not surprising since the adrenal glands secrete few androgens compared to virilizing ovarian tumors， which are often small and may even be hidden\\[11\\]. The maximum diameter of the adrenal mass typically predicts malignancy； however， in PASATs， the size does not always correlate with malignancy probability. A series of 9 cases presented by Tong et al. described two adenomas exceeding 9 cm \\[1\\]. Unlike adrenal carcinomas， which generally have a larger size， the literature usually reports that most adrenal adenomas are less than 4 cm to 6 cm in diameter， confusing the diagnosis \\[12\\].**\n\n【44】**In addition to the size， the classic imaging features that guide us to tumor benignity， such as the lipid-rich nature (Hounsfield units <10) or a contrast wash-out >60% of the 10-min protocol， also generate confusion， since the PASATs do not always comply with them \\[13\\].**\n\n【45】**Treatment**\n\n【46】**The surgical approach is recommended in all functioning adrenal tumors. Some authors recommend the open approach in tumors larger than 10 cm with or without suspected malignancy.Otherwise， the laparoscopic approach may be considered. Complete surgical removal is the key to a good prognosis \\[3，14\\]. Finally， the definitive diagnosis will be established through the pathologic report of the surgical specimen， using the Weiss criteria (Table 1) \\[15\\].**\n\n【47】**Regarding the follow-up， Moreno et al. did not show an increase in androgen levels or post-surgical tumor relapse in their series of11 benign PASAT patients， who were followed for an average of 17years 3\\].**\n\n【48】**In summary， our case presents a 47-year-old female， without previousillness，who had a progressiveclinicalcourse OI hyperandrogenism and virilization and was diagnosed as a PASAT with no evidence of malignancy in the right adrenal gland， and an adenoma in the left adrenal gland. She had an excellent post-surgical evolution and no clinical， biochemical，or structural recurrence than the different case series findings. Provided a contralateral adenoma， a clinical follow-up is proposed， requesting a new image in case of recurrence of symptoms.**\n\n【49】**Conclusion**\n\n【50】**PASATs are rare tumors that predominate in the female sex. The diagnosis is achieved by clinical suspicion with signs of hyperandrogenism andvirilization， elevatedserum androgen levels， and imaging evidence of adrenal tissue lesion. Nevertheless， these elements are not enough to make an accurate diagnosis，being the pathological report of foremost importance for the definitive diagnosis. The 18F-FDG PET-CT is a new diagnostic tool to take into account to assess tumor characteristics. Surgical treatment is the gold standard， and the approach will depend on the size and tumor characteristics. The pathological report will determine the medium and long-term prognosis.**\n\n【51】**Recommendations**\n\n【52】**PASATs must be considered when a differential diagnosis for female patients with hyperandrogenism and virilization is made It should be emphasized that a significant increase in serum total testosterone is not always associated with ovarian pathology. After surgical treatment and in search of new manifestations of hyperandrogenism， it is suggested to carry out clinical and laboratory follow-up every six months in the first year， and further on， a clinical follow-up.**\n\n【53】**References**\n\n【54】1\\.

We report a case of a large pleomorphic adenoma in the upper lip in a 42-year-old man with a 6-month evolution， which due to its size could be mistaken for a malignant lesion. Biopsy is essential to close the diagnosis in these cases and to exclude the hypothesis of a malignant lesion； the treatment was performed with surgical excision.**\n\n【12】**Keywords： Pleomorphic adenoma； Salivary gland tumor； Benign neoplasm**\n\n【13】**Introduction**\n\n【14】**Pleomorphic adenoma is the most common benign mixed tumor of the salivary glands. May occur in both major and minor salivary glands \\[1，2\\]. This tumor usually presents as a solitary， painless， slow-growing nodular mass， with prevalence in females and with a higher occurrence between the third and sixth decade of life. Histologically， the lesion may present variable epithelial， myoepithelial and mesenchymal elements， usually presenting a well-circumscribed capsule. Epithelial cells can form ducts， islands， or cords of cells \\[3，4\\]. Differential diagnoses include mucoepidermoid carcinoma， salivary gland tumors， mucocele， neurofibroma， schwannoma and secondary infections. Treatment consists of surgical excision of the lesion with a safety margin. Incomplete removal cases can cause recurrences. Post-surgical follow-up is essential to assess the possibility of malignant transformation \\[3，5，6\\].**\n\n【15】**Case Presentation**\n\n【16】**Male patient， 42 years old， sailor， was referred to our department for presenting a painless swelling in the upper lip region. The patient reported evolution of the lesion of six months. During the anamnesis， the patient had a good general condition and reported being hypertensive controlled by medication. In the intra-oral clinical examination， the patient presented a large， solitary， painless， hardened， normocolored， pedunculated， smooth-surfaced tumor lesion in the region of the upper left labial mucosa， with an evolution of six months (Figure 1). Patient had a urine test result， performed six days before our appointment， without the presence of abnormalities.**\n\n【17】**Given the different diagnostic hypotheses， an excisional biopsy of the lesion was requested to clarify the diagnosis. The macroscopic material sent for analysis consisted of a soft tissue fragment， with a smooth surface， irregular shape， firm consistency， brown in color， measuring 20 mm x10 mm ×10 mm (Figure 1). Histological sections revealed a fragment of glandular neoplasia. Neoplastic cells form ducts with two or seven layers of cells containing hyaline material in their interior. In some fields， neoplastic cells displayed eccentric plasmacytoid-like nuclei. In other fields， the presence of deposition of hyaline material and myxoid material was observed. The neoplasm was delimited by dense fibrous connective tissue and showed， in some fields， neoplastic cells with a polyhedral shape that， sometimes，presented eccentric nuclei with a plasmacytoid shape. Completing the histopathological picture， a discrete mononuclear inflammatory infiltrate， extravasation of red blood cells and ectatic blood vessels of varying sizes were present in the specimen (Figure 2). The final diagnosis was compatible with pleomorphic adenoma.**\n\n【18】**The treatment was performed by surgical excision of the lesion and was uneventful (Figure 2). Antibiotic， anti-inflammatory， and analgesic were prescribed to control postoperative symptoms. The patient had a satisfactory recovery and within the expected parameters.**\n\n【19】**Figure 1： A) Initial appearance of the lesion.B) Surgical process. C) Surgical piece measuring 20 mmx 10mmx 10 mm. D) Immediate postoperative final appearance.**\n\n【20】**Figure 2： Neoplastic cells forming duct of cells containing hyaline material in their interior (H&E；100x).**\n\n【21】**Discussion**\n\n【22】**Salivary gland tumors are complex lesions that are differentiated by the clinical-histological pattern. These lesions are rare and represent about 3% to 10% of all head and neck neoplasms \\[7\\]. Most represent benign tumors， about 75% to 85%； females are the gender most affected by these tumors， the parotid gland represents the most affected location， it can occur in any age group， however， the highest reports occur between the third and sixth decade of life \\[7-9\\].**\n\n【23】**The AP represents the most common neoplasm of the salivary gland. Most of these tumors arise in the parotid gland. Intraorally， the most common sites are the palate， upper lip and buccal mucosa， areas that have many minor salivary glands. The name of this lesion refers to its varied histology， composed of epithelial， myoepithelial andmesenchymal structures \\[1，2，9\\]. Clinically， the lesion is usually present as a unilateral， asymptomatic， slow-growing， well-circumscribed and most often encapsulated tumor， the overlying mucosa most often does not present ulceration \\[1，8\\].**\n\n【24】**Minor salivary gland tumors are uncommon and among them the pleomorphic adenoma is the most frequent. In a study of 82 cases of tumors in minor salivary glands carried out by Toida et al. \\[10\\]， pleomorphic adenoma was the most common tumor intraorally， with the palate being the most common site (44 cases) and females the most affected， with a male/female ratio of 1：3.2\\[10\\]. The occurrence of pleomorphic adenoma in the lip represents about 20% to 40% of**\n\n【25】**all intraoral pleomorphic adenomas \\[11\\]. In the study by Toida et al.\\[10\\]， of the 54 cases of intraoral pleomorphic adenoma， only 3 were in the upper lip \\[10\\]. The upper lip is more affected than the lower lip in a ratio of 6：1， the exact cause of this discrepancy is not known， but it is believed that it is due to differences in the embryonic development of the upper and lower lips， another theory is that the cells tumors would be destroyed by the continuous presence of inflammatory cells in the lower lip induced by frequent traumatic events \\[11-13\\]. Adenomas that occur on the lips appear to occur at a younger age than those that occur elsewhere， with a peak incidence between the third and fourth decade of life， with a mean of 33.2 years \\[2，6\\]. According to a bibliographic survey of 38 cases of AP in the lip performed by Suka，2021，the upper lip was the most affected， with a predominance of the left side， males (21 cases) were more affected than females (17 cases)， the mean age was 43.3 years and the mean diameter of the tumors was2.6 cm \\[12\\]. This information corroborates our case， as it is a 42-year old male patient with a lesion in the upper lip on the left side.**\n\n【26】**Due to its nonspecific clinical features， the differential diagnosis of AP in the upper lip includes a wide variety of pathologies： benign and malignant neoplasms of the salivary glands， sialolithiasis， leiomyoma， hemangioma， neurofibroma， schwannoma or infection with a foreign body \\[2，6\\]. The diagnosis of pleomorphic adenoma is made by histopathological analysis： It usually presents as a proliferation of encapsulated epithelial and myoepithelial cells with the presence of stroma， which can be myxoid， chondroid or hyalinized. The epithelium may form ducts and cystic structures or may appear as islands or nests of cells \\[2，4\\]. Imaging tests， such as magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography， can aid in the diagnosis， as they allow a better visualization of the location and size of the lesion， in addition to being useful for differentiating between a benign or malignant lesion \\[3，12\\].**\n\n【27】**The treatment of choice for AP in the lip is tumor excision with a safety margin， but some authors suggest performing aspiration biopsy before definitive removal of the tumor，the prognosis is good. Recurrence cases may be associated with incomplete tumor excision or capsule rupture. Malignant transformation presents about 2% to7% of cases \\[5，14\\]. Some authors report that the occurrence of AP in the upper lip is more related to benign tumors， while the lower lip is more related to malignant lesions \\[2，11，15\\].**\n\n【28】**Conclusion**\n\n【29】**Finally， AP should be investigated and considered as a differential diagnosis in cases of painless tumor masses of the lips. Due to its non-specific clinical characteristics， diagnosis may be difficult， and for this， biopsy is indispensable，imaging tests can also be useful. Surgical excision is the treatment of choice for this lesion and periodic follow-up should be performed to reduce the chances of recurrence and malignant transformation.**\n\n【30】**References**\n\n【31】**1\\.

It has become an important adjunct for clinical diagnosis and procedural guidance. We present a case report of a patient who presented to our Pediatric Emergency Department (PED) and was diagnosed with myocarditis using cardiac ultrasound at the start of her resuscitation. Point-of-care ultrasound was found beneficial in making a crucial diagnosis of myocarditis at the initial stage ofresuscitation. POCUS directed the quick management and eventual connection of the patient to Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) which contributed to the better outcome of the resuscitation.**\n\n【11】**Case Presentation**\n\n【12】**A 15 months old female child was referred to the PED of a tertiary care， university-affiliated， urban facility， due to 4 days of vomiting， restlessness and high fever. Apart from atopic dermatitis， the child was previously healthy and fully immunized.**\n\n【13】**Parents reported that 3 days prior to her presentation， she developed fever and shortness of breath. She was prescribed antibiotics by her pediatrician for pneumonia.**\n\n【14】**On the day of presentation to the PED， the pediatrician did not see any improvement in her condition and referred her to our PED since she appeared pale and lethargic.**\n\n【15】**On arrival to the PED she was obtunded， in severe respiratory distress and pale. Her vital signs were as follows： Oxygen saturation of 70%， heart rate160 bpm， blood pressure 85/58 mmHg， temp37.30°Cand a capillary refill time of 4 sec.**\n\n【16】**Further examination revealed clearlung sounds bilaterally， rapid heart sounds with no murmurs and no jugular vein distention. Her abdomen was soft， non-tender， with no enlargement of the liver or spleen. Peripheral pulses were felt very weak on palpation.**\n\n【17】**From triage， the child was transferred immediately to the resuscitation room. While attempts were being made to establish an IV access， the PED， POCUS trained， attending performed a POCUS examination following the \"RUSH\" protocol - Rapid Ultrasound for Shock and Hypotension. Cardiac echo revealed severely poor cardiac function (Figure 1) with an enlarged IVC and multiple B-lines (Figure 2) in both lung fields. Based on these findings， the child was deemed to be suffering from myocarditis with severe cardiac failure. She was connected to fluids and given a small bolus of 10 ml/kg with normal saline and later， due to poor response， inotorpe treatment was initiated.**\n\n【18】**Her initial blood tests revealed leukocytosis of 26，000 cells/pl with 34% neutrophils， hemoglobin9.7 g/dL and thrombocytosis of 543，000 cells/ul sodium level was 137 meq/L， potassium 7.6 meq/L， albumin 3.8 g/dL， uric acid 13.7 mg/dL， LDH 1024 U/L with a slight elevation in liver function tests. C-Reactive Protein (CRP) level was 0.4 mg/dL， venous blood gases demonstrated a pH of 6.9 with pCO， 34 mmHg，pO， 32 mmHg and HCO3 of 8.4 mmol/L.**\n\n【19】**Despite all efforts undertaken， blood pressure was not restored and after consultation with the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit (CICU) team， the child was intubated and put on an Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) machine in the PED resuscitation room. Once connected，blood pressure stabilized and the child was transferred to the CICU.**\n\n【20】**At the CICU the infant remained connected to the ECMO machine for a period of 8 days with gradual improvement of her cardiac function. After two weeks， she was weaned off from mechanical**\n\n【21】**Figure 1： Parasternal long image of the heart.

Her nasopharyngeal swab culture subsequently revealed influenza A.**\n\n【23】**An echocardiogram prior to discharge showed mild dilation with low systolic function of the left ventricle and mild mitral regurgitation. The child was neurologically intact at discharge**\n\n【24】**In the following months， the child was admitted twice to our emergency department. She was found to be with poor cardiac function and was later diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy.**\n\n【25】**Ultrasound Technique**\n\n【26】**The RUSH protocol assesses three main components： the pump- i.e. the cardiac system； the tank - i.e. volume status； and the pipes _一_ \\-i.e. the vascular system. A useful acronym in order to remember the exam components by is HI-MAP： Heart， IVC， Morrison's pouch(FAST)， Aorta and Pneumothorax.**\n\n【27】**Since aortic aneurysm or deep vein thrombosis are rare in children our exam focused on cardiac evaluation and volume status as reflected by the IVC and pulmonary edema.**\n\n【28】**The cardiac exam looks at the heart in four views：**\n\n【29】**_1\\._ Subxiphoid - the transducer is placed underneath the xiphoid with the probe marker directed to the right of the patient. The transducer is directed to the patient's left shoulder.**\n\n【30】**_2\\._ Parasternal long- the transducer is placed to the left of the manubrium with the probe marker towards the patient's right shoulder.**\n\n【31】**_3\\._ Parasternal short - while maintaining the same position as**\n\n【32】**for the parasternal long view， the transducer is rotated 90° towards the patient's right hip.**\n\n【33】**_4\\._ Four chamber views -the transducer is placed at the point of maximal impulse， probe marker towards the patient's right and the transducer is angled towards the patient s right shoulder.**\n\n【34】**These views enable a gross assessment of cardiac function -normal， moderately decreased， severely decreased. In addition， the heart is inspected for pericardial effusion.**\n\n【35】**The IVC is examined by placement of the transducer beneath the xiphoid， probe marker towards the patient’s right and the transducer is perpendicular to the xiphoid. The diameter of the IVC is compared to the aorta where the normal ratio would be 0.8 to 1.2.**\n\n【36】**The lungs are examined by placement of the transducer in a mid-clavicular line with the probe marker towards the patient's head， over the right and left lung. Finding of lung gliding would rule out a diagnosis of pneumothorax. Finding of multiple B lines may suggest pulmonary edema**\n\n【37】**Review of the Literature**\n\n【38】**Several studies have reported on the benefit of rapid use of ultrasound in the emergency department as a tool which influences the decision on how to manage a patient in an unstable condition1-3.**\n\n【39】**Ultrasound assessment of patients in shock is becoming the standard of care in emergency and critical care settings worldwide. One of the most common protocols used for this assessment is the Rapid Ultrasound in Shock (RUSH) examination.**\n\n【40】**The RUSH exam， a rapid evaluation of cardiac function， key vascular structures， and likely sources of hypotension， represents a comprehensive algorithm for the integration of bedside ultrasound into the care of the patient in shock. By focusing on a stepwise approach for evaluation the cause of shock defined here as \"Pump， Tank， and Pipes\"， clinicians will gain crucial anatomic and physiologic data to better care for these patients \\[4\\].**\n\n【41】**Bagheri-Hariri et al. \\[5\\] reported an overall sensitivity of the RUSH exam of 88% and specificity of 96% \\[5\\] with no significant difference between the emergency physician and radiologist as operators of this protocol \\[6\\].**\n\n【42】**The value of using the RUSH protocol has been reported in two case files of patients， one with hypotensive shock and the other with cardiac tamponade， who presented to the emergency department in shock and were managed promptly using the RUSH protocol during resuscitation71**\n\n【43】**ECMO is used in cases of cardiopulmonary failure to reestablish cardiac output and organ perfusion so that permanent end-organ injury， while awaiting reversal of cardiac and other organ disease processes， is prevented. An overall survival rate of 51% was seen in children who were supported with rapid-response ECMO after suffering from in-hospital cardiac arrest that did not respond to conventional CPR \\[8\\].**\n\n【44】**The use of Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) is still limited owing to low availability， especially in emergency departments. Nevet et al. \\[9\\] reported two children with acute myocarditis successfully treated with ECMO in the emergency department of a tertiary pediatric medical center. Given the urgency**\n\n【45】**of their condition and its presumably reversible (viral) etiology， treatment with ECMO was initiated in the department's resuscitation room. The outcome was excellent， and cardiac function remained normal throughout the 6 and 10 months follow-up.**\n\n【46】**Myocarditis among pediatric patients varies in severity from mild disease to a fulminant course with overwhelming refractory shock and high mortality. Because the disease is potentially reversible， it is reasonable to use ECMO to bridge patients until recovery or transplantation. Nahum et al. \\[10\\] reported on the course and outcome of 12 children with acute fulminant myocarditis who were managed by ECMO due to refractory circulatory collapse. They demonstrated that ECMO can be safely and successfully used for children with acute fulminant myocarditis without a need for heart transplantation.**\n\n【47】**ThenewPALS recommendations from 2015 emphasize the advantage of connecting the patient toECMO during cardiopulmonary resuscitation. These recommendations rely on evidence from 4 observational studies of pediatric IHCA that have shown no overall benefit to the use of CPR with ECMO compared to CPR without ECMO， but have shown better outcomes when used during cardiac arrest in children with underlying cardiac disease \\[11\\].**\n\n【48】**While ECMO has been recognized in the latest PALS guidelines， ultrasound was not mentioned in the PALS section and only noted in the adult advanced cardiovascular support section， where the authors recommend that “Ultrasound (cardiac or non cardiac) may be considered during the management of cardiac arrest， although its usefulness has not been well established\".**\n\n【49】**We believe that due to the noninvasive nature of ultrasound and its ability to provide rapid and repeated assessment of physiology during resuscitation， this modality should move to the front line of emergency care. Integration of POCUS techniques such as the RUSH exam has the potential to augment the clinical evaluation and guide resuscitation to improve the patients outcomes.**\n\n【50】**Conclusion**\n\n【51】**This case illustrates the potential clinical impact of POCUS in the management of shock in the pediatric emergency department. The use of POCUS at the very start of resuscitation enabled the treating team to arrive to the diagnosis of severe myocarditis， and the early initiation of the complicated， drastic， yet lifesaving therapeutic option of ECMO， which ultimately improved the child’s prognosis.**\n\n【52】**It is reasonable to think that the rapid intervention enabled by the POCUS examination contributed to the good neurologic outcome in such a severe case.**\n\n【53】**References**\n\n【54】**1\\.

The patient was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit(ICU)， where Intravenous Immunoglobulin G (IVIg)， neostigmine， corticosteroids， azathioprine and plasmapheresis were administered.**\n\n【20】**During his ICU stay， the patient experienced de novo seizures. CT and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the Central Nervous System (CNS) ruled out brain metastases.

Meanwhile， myositis， Myasthenia Gravis (MG)， Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS)， and other polyneuropathies fall under the category of Peripheral Nervous System (PNS) involvement \\[3，7\\].**\n\n【24】**Discussion**\n\n【25】**Neurological immune-related Adverse Events (N-irAEs) have an incidence of about 1% to 6% \\[3，5，7\\].N-irAEs can be divided into two major groups： those affecting the Central Nervous System (CNS) and those affecting the Peripheral Nervous System (PNS). Within the CNS group， conditions such as hypophysitis， aseptic meningitis， non-infectious encephalitis or myelitis， diffuse encephalopathy， rheumatological CNS diseases， and PosteriorReversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES) have been described. The PNS group includes myositis， Myasthenia Gravis (MG)， Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS)， and other polyneuropathies \\[3，7\\]. Among drug-induced MG cases，ICI therapy appears to be the most common cause，**\n\n【26】**with an incidence reported in small studies of approximately 0.24%\\[8\\]. Notably， Nivolumab (anti-PD-1) use has been associated with an incidence of ICI-induced MG as high as 0.12% \\[9\\]. Myasthenic syndrome typically occurs within the first 3 months after treatment initiation， either de novo (due to ICI use) or as an exacerbation of pre-existing disease \\[1，10\\]. According to available data， the majority of cases (85%) present de novo syndrome induced by ICIs， while a smaller number manifest as exacerbations， predominantly associated with anti-PD-1 use \\[11\\].**\n\n【27】**Clinical manifestations include ocular weakness and fatigability(ptosis， diplopia)， bulbar weakness (dysphagia， dyspnea)， and weakness in proximal muscles. ICI-induced MG may concur with varying degrees of myopathy in 37% to 51% of cases and myocardial involvement in 8% to 16% of cases \\[1，6，8，10\\].**\n\n【28】**Diagnostic aapproaches may include serological testLsSfor acetylcholine receptor or anti-Musk antibodies， Tensilon or ice pack test，electromyography with repetitive nerve stimulation， CT or MRI， CSF analysis， and nerve sample biopsy \\[5，11\\]. Importantly， some patients maypresent with seronegative myasthenic syndrome induced by ICIs， with a seropositivity rate of 59% \\[10\\]. Management involves discontinuation of the ICI and the use of drugs such as neostigmine， immunosuppressants， corticosteroids， rituximab， mycophenolate， IVIg， or plasmapheresis in case of clinical deterioration， as was the case with our patient \\[1，5，6，121.**\n\n**Although most patients have a favorable outcome， mortality rates range from 20% to 30%， with respiratory failure being the most frequent cause.

It has been the object of growing interest since its frequency tends to augment as life expectancy has increased globally considered. In this work， we study the eventual neuroprotective effect of Progesterone (P) injected a few days before establishing a Reserpine (R) model of Parkinsonism in adult male rats. We focused on cognitive (Novel Object Recognition test； NOR)， affective (Forced Swimming Task； FST) and motor (Catalepsy Test； CT) outputs. We performed the appropriate tests along with the administration for two weeks of low doses of R. Our results show very clearly that P prevents the impairment of several tasks regarding the deleterious effects of R， without affecting negatively other areas of the subject behavior. In total accordance with current information， we show here that P -in particular- and neuroactive steroids -in general- are promising molecules to delay diverse manifestations of neurotransmitters depletion.**\n\n【16】**Keywords： Progesterone； Neuroactive steroids； Parkinsonism； Neuroprotection； Male rats**\n\n【17】**Introduction**\n\n【18】**Parkinson's disease is a threatening health problem in the world.

This is so -at least in part-because what was once the hallmark of the disease， the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra， has since changed to consider the disease as a multi-systemic degenerative process involving several pathways， structures and neurotransmitters\\[3\\]. Ongoing research is highly interested in the possibility of using neuroprotective drugs to avoid the damages of the disease or at least delay them long enough to give the patient a better quality of life.**\n\n【19】**Neuroactive steroids are a well-known set of molecules that comprise steroids from any source that show effects on the Central Nervous System (CNS). Among them， there are a group of neuroactive steroids-collectively named neurosteroids- that are synthesized the novo in the CNS， and that exert autocrine and paracrine effects only \\[4\\]. Both groups of molecules have a renowned target as putative molecules regarding neuroprotection. Progesterone (P) is one of the major players among them \\[5\\]. Parkinson’s disease remains elusive in terms oftreatment， being one major reason that the disorder， once thought as merely a motor illness， is a complex set of signs and symptoms that involve cognitive， affective and motor expressions \\[2\\]. Today， a major goal is to recognize early subtle behavioral (cognitive， affective and motor) signs of malfunctioning to promptly begin with the treatment.**\n\n【20】**There are several animal models of Parkinsonism that have proved to be very useful in researching several essential aspects of the disease， from behavior to molecules \\[3\\]. In this work， we try to study whether or not P. could be eventually neuroprotective when administered just a few days before of injecting our subjects with severallow doses of Reserpine (R) \\[6\\]. We selected R as our model since it affects not only dopaminergic neurons but also catecholamines and indoleamine as a whole \\[3\\]. What was once a disadvantageous situation， today it has been reverted since the human disease involves a much more complex landscape that the mere loss of dopaminergic**\n\n【21】**neurons. Additionally， the method-comparatively- is a rapid way of establishing the deficits in the subiects and also testing the effects of putative protective molecules.**\n\n【22】**Methods**\n\n【23】**Subjects**\n\n【24】**Male Sprague-Dawley rats， 60 days old， and 450 g average weight were used. Animals were housed in groups of three individuals per cage. Room temperature was maintained at 22℃±2C， on a 12 h artificial light/dark cycle (light from 7：00 am to 7 pm). Commercial rodent food and water were provided ad libitum. All procedures were approvedbythelocal committee for care and use ofanimals in medical research (CICUAL， Facultad de Ciencias Medicas， Universidad Nacional de Cuyo， cicual@fcm.uncu.edu.ar)， and experiments were performed in accord with the National Institutes of Health guide for the care and use of laboratory animals.**\n\n【25】**Reagents and solutions**\n\n【26】**Reserpine (R) and Progesterone (P) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich St Louis MO， USA. R was diluted in glacial acetic acid (final concentration 0.5% acetic acid in distilled water) and subcutaneously administered (SC) at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg. P was dissolved in ether， benzyl alcohol was added， and finally， it was resuspended in corn oil. P administration was also SC， at a dose of 4 mg/kg.**\n\n【27】**Experimental design**\n\n【28】**The experimental protocol was carried out along 21 days， according to Figure 1. From day-5 to-1 animal received either a daily Intraperitoneal (IP) injection of sterile saline or an SC injection of P. On odd days from 1 to 13 animals received either daily reserpine or sterile saline according to the group (Figure 1). Catalepsy test was carried out on even days from 2 to 14. Novel Object Recognition test(NOR test) was performed on day 8， and Forced Swimming Test(FST) was performed on day 9.**\n\n【29】**At the beginning (Figure 1)， animals were randomly assigned to one of 4 groups (n=10 each) injected with： 1) Sham (S)， saline-saline；2) saline-reserpine (R)； 3) Progesterone-Reserpine (P+R)； and 4) Progesterone-Saline (P+S).**\n\n【30】**Reserpine model**\n\n【31】**Reserpine (R)， a monoamine depleting agent， is an ester alkaloid derived from Rauwolfia sp. root utilized initially for the treatment of hypertension \\[7\\]. R was underused for years as a useful reagent to induce animal Parkinsonism since it was not selective for dopamine， the hallmark neurotransmitter whose lack by death of dopaminergic neurons in the substantial nigra was always considered to be the responsible for the pathophysiology of the illness， according to Jenner in 1989 \\[8\\]. Today this is not the case anymore as different monoamines besides dopamine (noradrenaline， serotonin) and different nuclei besides the substantia nigra (raphe nuclei and locus coeruleus) are all known to be affected by the disease \\[3\\]. Today， R is a well-established model to induce animal Parkinsonism \\[6\\].**\n\n【32】**Catalepsy test**\n\n【33】**In the catalepsy test， the subject is placed in an unusual posture and then the observer measures the time that takes to the animal to correct this unusual posture \\[9\\]. We used a horizontal Plexiglass bar held between two vertical support bars located at 9 cm from a smooth surface. Animal's front limbs were positioned on the bar and the latency time to step down from the bar was recorded. Three trials were made per rat on each observation. Result for each observation**\n\n【34】**was the mean value. We establish catalepsy like behavior criteria， considered as immobility posture time. Maximum time allowed for the whole test was 180 sec.**\n\n【35】**Novel object recognition**\n\n【36】**The experiment was realized as described elsewhere \\[10，11\\]. Briefly， the apparatus consisted of a wooden box (70 cm x 45 cmx30 cm) with a white acrylic floor. It was located in an isolated testing room that was dimly lit by constant indirect illumination from the primary source， a 25 Wlight bulb suspended over the box. The objects utilized as familiar (previously experienced object) or unfamiliar(object not previously experienced， i.e. the novel one) were three copies of a pink truncated pyramid and a grayish-opaque candlestick of approximately the same size， all of them heavy enough to prevent accidental displacement by the subjects.**\n\n【37】**The animals were allowed to get used to the experimental room for at least 1 h. The day before training， each animal freely explored the apparatus with no objects for 2 min. A training session (T1) was followed by a test session (T2) 24 h later. During the training session， animals were placed in the arena containing two identical objects(pink truncated pyramids). In the test session， a familiar object was changed for an unfamiliar one (grayish opaque candlestick). Both training and test stages were 3 min each. The position of the objects(familiar and unfamiliar) and the extreme of the box used to place the objects were randomly exchanged for each experimental animal to avoid the use of potential confounding spatial clues. Exploration was defined as the orientation ofthe animal’s snout toward the object within a range of 2 cm or less from the object. Running around the object or sitting on it was not recorded as exploration. The objects and floor were carefully cleaned with ethanol (10%) after each trial to equate olfactory cues. The experiments were recorded with a camcorder digital camera JVC Everio GZ-MG330 (Japan) using a black and white recording mode to improve the register. The measures in the object recognition test were as follows： 1) total time spent by the subject exploring both objects during training (T1)； 2) total time spent by the subject exploring just the novel object during T2； and 3) discrimination index， the difference between time spent exploring unfamiliar and familiar objects during T2.**\n\n【38】**Forced swimming test**\n\n【39】**The FST was slightly modified from the original one \\[12\\]. The device consists of a plexiglass cylinder 38 cm in diameter and 60 cm in height. The cylinder contained water at 25C， 45 cm in height. Rats were individually introduced into the cylinder for 5 min and removed to be dried before returning them to their home cages. The test was videotaped (see above). The following parameters were scored：1) Immobility time： time spent with the head above the water surface， and the necessary movement to maintained it； 2) swimming time： movements through the apparatus with front limbs inside the water； 3) climbing time： Movements with the front limbs against the cylinder wall； and 4) diving： Events of exploratory movements under the water with all the body submerged**\n\n【40】**Statistical assays**\n\n【41】**All data were analyzed by a one-way ANOVA test followed by a Tukey post hoc test and expressed as the mean ± SEM. A value of p<0.05 was considered statistically significant.**\n\n【42】**Results**\n\n【43】**In the present work， when compared to another study \\[6\\]， relatively small but repeated doses of R (0.1 mg/Kg) were used to**\n\n【44】C= Control group； R=Reserpine group； P=P group； P+R=P plus reserpine group. Results are expressed as mean ±SEM. p<0.05， \"p<0.01，p<0.001.\n\n【45】**obtain subtle but reliable motor changes as well as cognitive and affective ones. In this sense， we were able to induce Parkinsonism signs in our subjects since all of the animals treated with R developed changes in each of the testing conditions.**\n\n【46】**These changes included： a) More time spent in the bar during the catalepsy test， indicating a definite impact on motility， particularly from day 10 of R treatment until reaching a peak on day 14 (Figure2)； b) subjects significantly spent less time swimming during the forced swimming task， which is a clear indication of what is known as a \"depression\" like behavior in rodent models when compared to controls without treatment or subjects treated with P alone (Figure3). The diving activity was measured by the number of accumulated events. Control group made 21 dives， while in the reserpine group we observe only 4 events.**\n\n【47】**Reserpine group previously treated with progesterone obtained a cumulative result of 11 dives， while for the group treated only with progesterone the cumulative result was 16 dives； c) also in the**\n\n【48】**recognition of the novel object during the test， controls， and P alone treated subjects did not have any problem at all in recognizing the new object. On the other hand， R treated subjects， nonetheless spending the same total amount of time in exploratory behavior -also a clear indicator of what is supposed to be expected from animals that did not suffer from any lack of motivation and/or translation problems(Figure 4) ignored the condition of new object during the test day， indicating an impact on memory， a cognitive component of the model(Figure 5). These results， when taken together， allow us to consider our subjects as a valid model of monoamine depletion. By extension also as a modelofpremotor and motor signs of Parkinsonism， suitable for being used to study eventual neuroprotection by the neuroactive steroid P.**\n\n【49】**Discussion**\n\n【50】**Regarding P， it was striking the effect when administered for five days before the injections of R. In fact， in every condition tested， P. prevented the impairment of all the components previously**\n\n【51】C =Control group； R=Reserpine group； P=P group； P+R=P plus reserpine group.

The results represent the mean ± SEM expressed as discriminations index(Dl) in seconds. p <0.05.\n\n【54】**described， resulting in motor， cognitive and affective performances quite comparable to control subjects. It is important to note that P had not any effect per se. Additionally， we must stress here that the model we used in the present work allows us to study the acute effect of neuroprotection instead of addressing neurorestoration， being more useful for the later models based on intrastriataladministration of toxins like 6-Hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)\\[13\\].**\n\n【55】**Several papers stress the importance of sex steroids and neurosteroids as neuroprotective factors \\[14，15\\]. Men are more susceptible than women to Parkinson's disease， at least until women reach menopause \\[15\\]， which is highly suggestive for a role of sex steroids like estrogen \\[16\\]. Moreover， steroid hormones synthesized by the brain have been shown to display neuroprotective properties eventually useful for the prevention and treatment of**\n\n【56】**neurodegenerative diseases \\[14\\]. Probably， what it is particularly interesting here are twofold：1) the validity of reserpine as a reagent suitable for generating a deficit constellation in rodents that remembers what happens -at least in part- in Parkinson's disease. It does so relatively quickly when compared to another method\\[3\\]， and it does consistently every time according to our results. Additionally， the whole picture is reversible when R is discontinued； and 2) P. prevented impairments in all areas-again consistently-when administered for a short time before R administration. There are advantageous animal models of Parkinsonism that are widely used \\[3\\]. However， all of them involved some cumulative changes and cell death with compensatory changes as well. In this work， we show short bursts of P. before Rtreatment， and a short Rtreatment to induce the reported malfunctions.**\n\n【57】**Parkinson's disease is a very complex disorder in which probably many factors contribute to the onset and later stages of the disease\\[17\\]. At present， there is no single successful treatment to stop the progression of the illness \\[17\\]. As such it results interesting the possibility of addressing the role of several treatments at once acting synergistically to prevent neuronal death or restore brain damage. In this sense -among others- gonadal steroid hormones have been shown to result promising. As we mentioned earlier， since women are less prone than men to present Parkinson's disease \\[15\\] at least until menopause- it looks promising to think about gonadal steroids as putative candidates to be one of the combined strategies to treat the disease. In fact， and besides that estrogens have been less contradictory that progestin's in showing beneficial effects， P also has been reported to be useful \\[17\\]. In our lab， treatment with P. for 3 days after 6-OHDA injections improved behavioral targets as well as normalized glutamatergic and dopaminergic activities\\[11，18\\]. However， here we are dealing with acute effects， instead of the chronic model of neuronal death by 6-OHDA， which poses the question of that， apparently， at least， we could talk of dysfunctional neurons here more than dead cells. Since one of the possible targets of Parkinson’s disease is neurotrophic factors \\[13\\]， it would be possible that P. before administration of reserpine could -acting quickly- exert their protective effect on membrane progesterone receptors， stimulating neurotrophic factors， such as BDNF. In our lab we have seen an increase in BDNF levels in response to administration of allopregnanolone， an endogenous neurosteroid derived from progesterone that acts as a GABAA positive allosteric modulator (unpublished data). Since nigral Dopamine (DA) neurons are sensitive to several neurotrophic factors (BDNF among them) it would not be impossible to think of P as inducing an increase of such neurotrophic factors and then， preventing DA neurons of becoming dysfunctional and hence， avoiding the potential proinflammatory damage of reserpine. Interestingly， Jarras et al.\\[19\\] reported that in mice gut -gastrointestinal symptoms are also common in Parkinsons disease- lesioned with 1-Methyl-4-Phenyl-1，2，3，6-Tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) they showed neuroprotection and immunomodulation of DA neurons (they had previously shown also neuroprotection in brain DA neurons；\\[19\\]).**\n\n【58】**In brief， we suspect (being careful of taking into account the great complexity ofthe first motor disorder in human beings) that， at least in early stages ofthe disease there could be a possible proinflammatory situation enhanced by some kind of oxidative stress that would be deleterious for-among others-DA neurons in substantia nigra. Based on the evidences， we suggest that neurotrophic factors could protect the neurons under dysfunctional state. In this sense， P. could be in**\n\n【59】**part responsible for stimulating such trophic factors； however， more studies become necessary to test this hypothesis. Actual efforts are underway to increase our understanding in this devastating disease.**\n\n【60】**Funding**\n\n【61】**The work was supported by grants from the National Research Council of Argentina CONICET (PIP 11220100100126)，Universidad de Mendoza (133/10)， and Fondecyt 102-0581.**\n\n【62】**References**\n\n【63】**1\\.

Nevertheless， there are not any reports in the literature about the usage of these apps yet.**\n\n【6】**This report describes the utilization of a sleep app in the short-term follow-up of Mandibular Advancement Device(MAD) therapy applied for a moderate Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) patient with habitual snoring. Initially Epworth Sleepiness Scale (EPSS) of the patient was determined and sleep app recordings were performed simultaneously with PO at three different nights.

However， these PSG studies require high costs withal long waiting time for appointments due to the limited number of sleep laboratories despite the presence of increasing demand \\[1\\]. In addition， some patients tend to prefer home-based studies rather than hospitalization required methods because of the higher comfort afforded by natural sleep environment\\[1\\]. Pulse Oximetry (PO)which hasbeen successfully used in medicine for the last 40 years have become an effective home-based screening technique for OSA patients \\[1-3\\]. Respiratory stability of subjects can be easily monitorized and recorded with overnight PO in home conditions. Thus， apneic and hypopneic episodes which indicate fluctuating arterial oxygen saturation can be safely detected and crucial events such as Oxygen Desaturation Index(ODI) and Heart Rate Variability (HRV) may be predicted from PO records \\[1-3\\]. However， predicting the snoring severity can be more challenging than detecting the respiratory stability in home conditions， due to the absence of approved medical devices \\[4，5\\]. Fortunately， it seems that a new promising opportunity arises with the wide usage of Smartphone's (SP) and their applications(apps) \\[6\\]. Recently， program creators have presented several SP apps to record snoring sounds during sleep.Some of these apps can convert the recorded data to the numerical values and provide a**\n\n【15】**Figure 1： The result of the first diagnastic record of the SnoreLab app.**\n\n【16】**Figure 2： The result of the first diagnastic and the last fallaw-up records of the SnoreLab app.**\n\n【17】**snore score using a special algorithm \\[6\\]. Despite the wide availability and ease of usage， only one in vitro study has been published about sleep apps yet \\[6\\]. The present case report was aimed to describe utilization of a novel home-based evaluation technique that was consisted of sleep app and PO in short-term follow-up of Mandibular Advancement Device (MAD) therapy applied for a moderate OSA patient with habitual snoring.**\n\n【18】**Case Presentation**\n\n【19】**A 43 year-old Caucasian male patient was referred to the otolaryngology， head and neck surgery clinic ofour hospital with the complaint of severe snoring， witnessed apnea and excessive daytime sleepiness. In clinical interview， he reported he had a serious traffic accident one year ago caused by daytime sleepiness. The patient’s history did not contain any systemic disorders， cigarette smoking and alcohol or drug abuse.**\n\n【20】**On the physical examination， the waist and neck circumferences and body mass index of the patient were 108 cm， 42 cm， and 29.8kg/m²respectively. Not any signs were detected during temporomandibular joint examination. On intraoral examination， presence of elongated soft palate， moderate macroglossia and slightly narrowed oropharynx were noted. Oropharengeal relationship of the patient was classified as Class 4 according to the Mallampati scale. His Epworth Sleepiness Scale (EPSS) was 16 and the provisional diagnosis was OSA. Thus， overnight PSG evaluation was required for definitive diagnosis.**\n\n【21】**According to the medical history， the patient had been referred to a sleep laboratory by a chest physician two years ago. However， having had difficulty in falling asleep and felt discomfort arising from cables and electrodes he had left the test unfinished. Therefore， it was decided to perform overnight PO recording at home in order to check his cardiorespiratory stability during sleep. In addition， snoring monitorization was planned concurrent with the PO recordings. Thus， a sleep app (SnoreLab， Reviva Soft works Ltd， London， UK) was downloaded and set as the creators'instructions. To obtain the most accurate data， the noise level of the patients' bedroom was checked with a sound level meter (LM-8102， Lutron Ltd， Taipei， Taiwan) and conveniences of the room conditions were confirmed. The patient was informed in detail about the working principals of the PO and the app. The Smartphone (IPhone 4S， Apple， CA， USA) was switched and the app was activated before sleep. Finally， the PO (Beurer PO80， Beurer Medical， Ulm， Germany) was inserted by a sleep technician and overnight recordings were performed at the patient’s home. In total， three recordings were executed in order to minimize the error margin.

Impressions were made with irreversible hydrocolloid material (CA37， Cavex， Haarlem， Holland) and the master casts were obtained from Type III dental stone (Moldano， Heraeus Kulzer， Hanau， Germany). Maxillary and mandibular occlusal splints were manufactured with Autopolymerising Clear Acrylic Resin Material (ACARM) (Ortocryl， Dentaurum， Ispringen， Germany) on isolated master models such as to cover occlusal and incisal surfaces of the existing dentition. Prepared splints were inserted in the mouth and adjusted on dental arches. Afterwards，intermaxillary relationship was recorded at 75% of maximal mandibular protrusion and intraoral records were mounted on a semi-adjustable articulator (Artex Type NK， Amann Girrbach， Pforzheim，Deutschland). The vertical openingamount was increased up to 10 mm，approximately. Maxillary and mandibular splints were**\n\n【31】**attached to each other using ACARM and finishing procedures were performed. After intraoral adjustments， the MAD was delivered to the patient with recommendations. Three Follow-Up Recordings(FRs) were performed at the end of the 6th month of the MAD treatment. The same recording procedure applied in the DRs was also performed during Frs. Insertion of the MAD during sleep was the only difference between DRs and FRs protocols. The results of the last snoring recording were shown in the Figure 1.**\n\n【32】**At the end of the six months follow-up period， the EPSS of the patient dramatically decreased at 3. The mean ODI of the patient was improved significantly with the MAD therapy. In addition， significant improvement in HRV was observed with the MAD therapy. Moreover， therapeutic effect of the MAD was recorded successfully with the sleep app. All snore scores obtained by the sleep app showed**\n\n【33】**highly compatible alterations both with EPSS and PO values. Not any serious complaints were reported by the patient except dry mouth that generally occurred in mornings.**\n\n【34】**Discussion**\n\n【35】**According to our knowledge， this is the first report describing the utilization of a sleep app and PO in the management of a moderate OSA patient with habitual snoring. Gradually increasing usage of the PO in sleep studies can be observed from the current literature， and its diagnostic value has been qualified by previous studies \\[1-3\\]. However， there exist some studies notifying the variable sensitivity of PO according to the severity of the OSA. Chung et al. \\[2\\] stated that PO recordings could be more sensitive for the patients having ODI above 10 (93%). The reason of the highly coherent ODI values obtained from three DRs could be arisen from the moderate severity of the OSA in the present case. In fact， three ODI values obtained from the DRs was extremely close to each other. However， a little less proximity was detected among ODI values obtained from FRS Nevertheless； strong and coherent relations was seen among EPSS， PO and sleep app values in terms of DRs and FRS Moreover， EPSS， PO and sleep app values dramatically decreased in chorus at the end of six months.**\n\n【36】**As seen in the present case， snoring may be the foremost signs of OSA directing the patients to seek a medical assistance. However， there is no agreement in the literature on the accuracy of snoring severity predicted with the provided information by bed partners. In fact， objective findings may affect the treatment planning of patients or have an importance for avoiding elective surgical interventions\\[4\\]. In the present case， simultaneous decrease in EPSS， IDO， HRV and snoring scores displayed not only treatment efficiency of the MAD therapy for a moderate OSA patients， but also problem solving capacity of sleep apps on the existence of an objective method to score the snoring severity of subjects in home conditions. Thus，using a sleep app in the scoring of snoring severity may be an option for the home based sleep studies at the foreseeable future. However， some unknown titles should be made clear to take yet another turn， as previously stated by Stipping et al. \\[6\\]. Numerous brand of SP with different hardware and software have been presented in market up to now. Thus， structural properties of the Smartphone's can be quite varied from each other’s and their recording quality may be affected from these variations. In addition， some of them may record human**\n\n【37】**snoring sounds more effectively than the others. However， there are not any comprehensive studies in the literature which responds to these queries， yet. Therefore， absence of data about the reliability and repeatability of sleep apps algorithms should be fulfilled.**\n\n【38】**Unfortunately， an in vivo study about the usage of sleep apps has not been published yet. Thus， impossibility of making a comparison is one of the most important limitations of the present case study. However， absence of any PSG data， which can be enabled the verification of obtained results， is the major limitation of the present case. Additionally， findings of this single case cannot be extended to all related population. Therefore， present findings need to be verified by further studies conducted with inclusion of more participants. Moreover， not only sufficiency of widely used SPs but also accuracy and repeatability of existing sleep apps should be evaluated with further studies. More preferably， standard PSG evaluations can be used to constitute a reference point to compare accuracy and repeatability of both SPs and sleep apps. Despite it is as yet too early to make a definite decision， using a sleep app in the scoring of snore sounds seems like a promising innovation for the future sleep studies to be executed in home conditions.**\n\n【39】**References**\n\n【40】1\\.

It affects 6 per 100，000 with the highest prevalence in males， whites， and people with 60 years of age or older， with age increasing both， its prevalence and incidence. Potential risk factors for ALS include family history， heavy manual labored occupations， football， agricultural work， pesticides， chemicals， smoking and electric shocks \\[1\\].**\n\n【11】**The primary symptoms include unilateral but progressive weakness in the distal limbs without remission and relapse. Atypical presentation can include weight loss， cognitive impairment， emotional alteration and fasciculations. Muscle cramps and twitches with positive Babinski sign is also seen \\[1\\]. The duration between the onset of symptoms and diagnosis of ALS is about a year. And by that time nearly 50% to 70% of motor neurons become nonfunctional\\[1\\]. The Cleveland group， based on experimental design hypothesizes that the onset of disease is due to the vulnerability of motor neuron itself， whereas disease progression is the result of immune responses characterized by neuroinflammation，particularly the activation of microglia \\[2，3\\].**\n\n【12】**In the early 1990s， riluzole (rilutek)， a putative blocker of glutamate release， was established as the first drug for ALS. Riluzole became the gold standard drug which paved the way for newly formulated drugs in the treatment of amyotrophiclateral sclerosis. There are currently five drugs for the management of ALS， namely Rilutek， Tiglutik， Exservan，Radicava and Nuedexta \\[4\\]. The first three being different formulations of generic Riluzole. Furthermore， Neudexta is indicated for the treatment of certain unspecific neurologic symptoms， but not for ALS itself.**\n\n【13】**FDA has approved a new oral drug named “Relyvrio” for the treatment of ALS in adults \\[5\\]. Experts had concerns regarding the effectiveness of the drug which were ruled out in updated clinical trials data. Relyvrio is a compound of two drugs， sodium phenylbutyrate and taurursodiol. Sodium phenylbutyrate helps in elimination of ammonia from the body while taurursodiol helps liver in detoxification \\[5\\].**\n\n【14】**The drug formerlyknown as AMX0035 can be taken orally or be administered through a feeding tube \\[5\\]. Relyvrio is taken within 1 h of its preparation either orally or through feeding tube. Initial dosing is one packet per day for starting three weeks (3 weeks) followed by a maintenance dose of one packet twice daily.**\n\n【15】**The efficacy of Relyvrio was tested in a 24-week multicenter， randomized， double-blind，placebo-controlled，parallel group study. The trial showed that the patients treated with relyvrio had a slower decline in daily functioning with longer overall survival as observed， as compared to controls on placebo \\[6\\].**\n\n【16】**The pathophysiological mechanism of action is aimed to reduce endoplasmic reticulum stress and mitochondrial dysfunction associated with protein misfolding and aggregation， the ultimate pathogenesis of ALS. Some potential side effects seen with the administration of relyvrio were diarrhea， abdominal pain， nausea， and upper respiratory tract infection. Taurursodiol， a bile acid， can affect patients with problems associated with enterohepatic circulation of bile acids， thus patients with liver dysfunction or with other known comorbid should consult a specialist before**\n\n【17】**intake. The prescribing information lists additional risks associated with relyvrio's administration \\[6\\]. It’s not known whether it's contraindicated in pregnantladies or children.**\n\n【18】**ALS is a debilitating disease with a difficult diagnosis， poor prognosis， shorter survival periods and currently has no cure \\[1\\]. With the advances being made in drug therapies， relyvrio can be a breakthrough in the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis， with its enhancing effects on life expectancy，as compared to the old drugs in use for ALS. More studies investigating the efficacy and efficiency of Relyvrio in patients with ALS and other related neurological disorders and comorbidities are required to give a better insight of the long-term outcomes of the usage of drug for which longer and larger trials are required.**\n\n【19】**2.上Boillee S， Yamanaka K， Lobsiger CS， Copeland NG， Jenkins NA， Kassiotis** **G， et al.

Diagnosis is straight forward in individuals with bone fragility and a positive family history or several extra skeletal manifestations (hearing loss， dark or bluish sclera). OI is classified into a number of major subtypes based on genetic， radiographic，and clinical characteristics， but more useful is the clinical classification， based upon the typical problems that manifest in infants， children， and adults with mild， moderate to severe and lethal disease.**\n\n【11】**This case report describes a 53-year old female patient with an unknown genetic disorder， but with medical history of bone fragility， currently presented with spontaneous ace tabular fracture that led to the diagnosis of osteogenesis imperfect a type I. OI is associated with multiple perioperative complications， thus the patients require extensive preoperative evaluation and an individualized surgical and anesthetic management.**\n\n【12】**Keywords： Osteogenesis imperfecta； COVID-19； Periarticular**\n\n【13】**Introduction**\n\n【14】**Osteogenesis imperfecta is rare inherited connective tissue disorder， being characterized by bone brittleness and increased fracture risk. Its incidence is described at 1：10.000-20.000 live births\\[1\\]. Clinical diagnosis includes fractures from the mildest oftrauma， short stature， bone deformities， blue sclera， dentinogenesis imperfecta and deafness \\[2\\]. Clinical severity varies from mild forms with only premature osteoporosis or severe postmenopausal bone mineral loss determining normal life expectancy in OI type I， to perinatal death in OI type II. Almost 90% of cases are caused by mutations in the genes encoding type I collagen \\[3\\]. Perioperative management can be challenging due to difficult airway， respiratory failure due to scoliosis or abnormal platelet function with easy bruisability. It is essential to predict these risks and implement a high-quality management for trauma in such patients. Treatment ofOI depends on the severity and age， the main objectives being to maintain autonomy and prevent long term complications \\[4\\]. This current case report describes a patient with an unknown genetic disorder and her medical history that led to the diagnosis of osteogenesis imperfecta.**\n\n【15】**Materials and Methods**\n\n【16】**In September 2021， a 53 year-old female (body mass 78 kg， height 157 cm， body mass index31.6 kg/m²) was admitted for a minor trauma (same height fall)， which resulted in a complex left acetabular fracture and protrusio acetabuli (Figure 1).**\n\n【17】**Clinical examination revealed blue sclera (Figure 2)， moderate scoliosis， and mild skeletal deformities of the forearms， dentinogenesis imperfecta and deafness.**\n\n【18】**Twenty years prior she developed early onset deafness and underwent a stapedectomy for presumably right ear otosclerosis. Her hearing worsen in both ears over the next six years and needed hearing aid. That’s when she was first told she had a genetic disorder， but at the present time she did not possess any medical history， nor remembered any details. Family history revealed the patient’s mother also had blue-gray colored sclera. The patient had multiple rheumatology admissions for osteoporosis， tendinitis and bilateral chronic hip and knee articular pain requiring treatment with analgesics and bisphosphonates (alendronic acid). She also had a history of essential arterial hypertension， gastro esophageal reflux disease and smoking. She required immediate plate osteosynthesis of the posterior column of acetabulum (Figure 3) with normal perioperative evolution， being discharged in good clinical condition.**\n\n【19】**Figure 1： Left acetabular fracture and protrusio acetabuli.**\n\n【20】**Figure 4： Aseptic necrosis of the left femoral head.**\n\n【21】**Figure 2： Blue sclera.**\n\n【22】**Figure 5： Total left hip arthroplasty.**\n\n【23】**\\[6\\]. Corticosteroids induce fat mobilization and may promote fat emboli occlusion of blood vessels， disrupt calcium metabolism and increase osteoclasts activity and bone resorption \\[7\\]. In January 2022， on a follow up visit the patient had recurrence of acute， severe， left hip articular pain. Although all her previous follow-up visits shown progressive healing of the fracture， this time her radiology report showed aseptic necrosis of the left femoral head (Figure 4)， requiring total hip arthroplasty (Figure 5).**\n\n【24】**Figure 3： Ostheosynthesis of the posterior column of acetabulum.**\n\n【25】**During recovery， in November 2021 she develops respiratory signs of SARS-CoV-2 infection (fever， cough， muscle aches and sore throat) and is diagnosed with a positive RT-PCR test through her family doctor. She had a mild to moderate form and received inpatient low-flow supplemental oxygen therapy via nasal cannula and 8 mg daily dexamethasone for 5 days.**\n\n【26】**The patient received general anesthesia combined with an ultrasound-guided fascia iliaca block to ensure adequate perioperative analgesia， with good outcome. General anesthesia was preferred over neuroaxial anesthetic procedures due to the coagulopathy found in OI patients which includes reduced platelet aggregation， reduced factor VIII activity and an increased capillary fragility. Difficult airway must be anticipated in these patients and video laryngoscopic or fiber optic endotracheal intubation should be readily available. The moderate scoliosis with restrictive lung disease and long-term effects of COVID-19 like lung fibrosis can impede perioperative respiratory function.**\n\n【27】**The approach to management of COVID-19 evolves rapidly as clinical data emerge， but corticosteroids are almost a constant in treatment protocols for moderate to severe cases \\[5\\]. The use of high doses of dexamethasone was lifesaving in many cases，but one adverse effect is corticosteroid induced a vascular necrosis of the femoral head**\n\n【28】**Results and Discussion**\n\n【29】**A vascular necrosis of the femoral head can be a consequence of the trauma， it can be corticosteroid-induced， but OI can also**\n\n【30】**associate periarticular bone dysplasia and lesions of ischemic origin. Taking that into account， the differential diagnosis can prove difficult in a patient with history of osteoporosis， chronic hip pain and corticosteroid treatment. Considering all of the above， a clinical diagnosis of osteogenesis imperfecta type I was formulated.**\n\n【31】**OI is also known as “brittle bone disease\" because of high risk of fractures after mild trauma， or ever from transporting or mobilization of patients. Diagnosis of OI on the basis of clinical and radiological findings is straightforward in most cases， but bone mineral density measurements， bone metabolic markers and morphological bone studies may aid the process. Genetic testing can be useful in differentiating between quantitative and qualitative collagen I defects. Bone fragility， osteoporosis and coagulopathy can complicate or prolong surgical interventions. OI is associated with multiple complications， thus the patients require extensive preoperative evaluation and an individualized orthopedic and anesthetic management.**\n\n【32】**Conclusion**\n\n【33】**Currently， only symptomatic therapy is available， such as growth hormone or bisphosphonates and surgical treatment is necessary for decreasing the rate of complication. Most of the literature focuses on diagnosis and management of OI in the pediatric population， but the manifestations are lifelong and some cases can be first diagnosed throughout adulthood. In this case the new onset of aseptic necrosis of the femoral head was pluri factorial， corticotherapy-induced， a complication of bone brittleness and ischemic lesions found in OI， as well as the recent history of acetabular fracture. The approach to such a heterogeneous disease should be multidisciplinary in order to assure adequate long-term quality oflife and decreasing complication rates，**\n\n【34】**References**\n\n【35】**1\\.

At the first check-up， the woman presented a fairly severe form of chronic vulvitis with candida superinfection， associated with severe alteration of the external genitalia as well as extremely limiting symptoms.**\n\n【12】**The patient was treated with local therapy with vitamin E-based ointments and hyaluronic acid creams， cortisone and local antifungal therapy was then started and the boric acid tablets were interrupted， maintaining the evening sitz baths with boric water at 3%.**\n\n【13】**The woman returned to control after 3 and 6 weeks， presenting a significant improvement in the local state and in the symptomatic sequence she reported.**\n\n【14】**Clinical Reports**\n\n【15】**This brief paper we intend to describe the morphological features of a chronic vulvitis in an84-year-old woman affected by type 2 diabetes mellitus， poorly controlled with diet and medical therapy - baseline blood sugar 132 mg/dl， HbA1c 6.3%\\[1\\]. The woman had certainly postponed her specialist visit for a long time and presented， at the gynecological examination， a case of vulvitis associated with burning， itching and pain. The vulva showed extensive edema and a highly erythematous area involving the labia majora bilaterally， the genitocrural folds， the perineum， the perianal and the intergluteal region (Figure 1). The presence of erythematous-squamous areas and the other morphological characteristics of the picture led to suppose， in the first hypothesis， a mycotic superinfection with candida \\[2，3\\].**\n\n【16】**The mucosa of the vulvar vestibule was dry and eroded. The vaginal introitus was strongly stenotic， to the point of not making it possible to see the labia minora and the clitoral button (Figure2).**\n\n【17】**At the inguinal margin it was possible to observe ulcerated and easily bleeding scratch lesions， surrounded by areas ofthickened epidermis as from hyperkeratosis (Figure 3).**\n\n【18】**At a general observation it was observed bilateral lesions， in both tibial areas， erythematous and ulcerated， similar to those founded in the vulva， characterized by reddish areas easily desquamating and small ulcers from alteration of the venous circulation (Figure 4)， as often seen in patients with chronic diabetes \\[4\\]. The patient had vaginal swabs done which tested positive for C. albicans.**\n\n【19】**The patient was treated with fluconazole 50 mg tablets， one tablet per day for 28 days，**\n\n【20】**Figure 1： Chronic vulvitis with evidence of erythematous， ecchymotic， pruritic and ulcerated areas.**\n\n【21】**Figure 2： This image shows the severe stenosis of the vulvar introitus associated with disappearance of the labia minora and clitoral button.**\n\n【22】**Figure 3： Area of hyperkeratosis associated with scratching lesions in the lateral area of the labium and at the level of the inguinal margin but with the presence of areas of altered tissue trophism due to vascular insufficiency.**\n\n【23】**Figure 4： Diffuse erythematous lesions of the tibial area， reddish and squamous， similar to the same lesions are present on the vulva.**\n\n【24】**antihistamine Ebastine 10 mg， one tablet per day for 7 days， diflucortolone valerate + isoconazole nitrate cream， one application in the evening on the entire affected area， panthenol cream local applications in the morning， 3% boric acid for local compresses and sitz baths \\[5\\].**\n\n【25】**The woman returned to control after three weeks of therapy(Figure 5). The ulcerative lesions were on the mend， the edema and erythema also in the vestibule area were reducing and the patient reported a marked improvement in her clinical symptoms.**\n\n【26】**Figure 5： In this image it is possible to observe how the areas previously affected by Candida have undergone complete resolution after three weeks of therapy， with adequate re-epithelialization of the affected areas.**\n\n【27】**Figure 6： This image shows the vulva after six weeks of targeted therapy. The erythematous areas are strongly reduced in association with complete resolution of the ulcerative lesions.**\n\n【28】**Finally， 6 weeks after the beginning of the therapy， the two ulcerations at the root of the thighs had completely disappeared with a complete regression of the patient’s symptoms. It was a residual erythema of purplish color， in inflammatory outcome， areas of scleroatrophy especially in the medial region of the root of the thighs (Figure 6). Local treatment with vitamin E-based ointment and hyaluronic acid creams was therefore started， treatment with cortisone and local antifungal was suspended and the compresses with boric acid were interrupted， maintaining the sitz baths in the evening with 3% boric water.**\n\n【29】**References**\n\n【30】1\\.

The two-child policyhas provided a new chance for studying the previous cesarean section， which is considered a new medical risk in China. This study aimed to examine the previous cesarean sections influence on pregnancy complications among women with singleton delivery in their second pregnancies.**\n\n【14】**Method： A total of 2018 eligible women with second pregnancies who had a singleton delivery from January 2015 to October 2017 were studied retrospectively. Data on the previous delivery mode for the first pregnancy， maternal characteristics and pregnancy complications for the second pregnancy were obtained from the electronic medical records. Chi-square test was used to describe and obtain the significant maternal characteristics according to the previous mode of delivery. The pregnancy complications associated with previous cesarean section was analyzed with binary logistic regression.**\n\n【15】**Results： Of 2018 eligible women with singleton delivery in their second pregnancy， 942 (46.7%)had a previous cesarean section (study group) while 1076 (53.3%) also had a previous vaginal delivery LISC(reference group). Previous cesarean section had an increase risk on the following pregnancy complications； Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) (Adjusted Odds Ratio \\[aOR\\]： 1.438；95% CI，1.093-1.894)， fetal anomaly (aOR： 14.258； 95% CI， 4.213-48.248)， and placenta previa (aOR： 2.890；95% CI，1.623-5.148).**\n\n【16】**Conclusion： This study demonstrates that the previous cesarean section is associated with increased risk of GDM， fetal anomaly and placenta previa on second singleton pregnancy after the implementation of the universal two-child policy in China.**\n\n【17】**Keywords： Cesarean section； China； Pregnancy complications； Second pregnancy； Two-child policy**\n\n【18】**Introduction**\n\n【19】**Cesarean Section (CS) is the most common obstetrical operation known worldwide. Over the past decades， the rate of CS has increased both in developing and developed countries. The WHO issued a disclosure in 1985， stating the CS regional rates must not exceed 10% to 15%\\[1，2\\]. Nonetheless， China is one of the countries with the prevalence of CS averagely of 46.2% over the past decades that are higher than the recommended threshold. Coincidentally， this high prevalence of CS began during the implementation period of the one-child policy introduced in 1979 to reduce the then growing population in China. CS is considered safe under medical indications， but most women who had CS under the one-child policy opted for it without any medical indications \\[1，3\\]. In 2015， the one-child policy was replaced with the universal two-child policy. This new policy has encouraged most couples to consider having a second child. As a result， it suddenly increased the number of pregnancies with an obstetrical history of previous CS \\[4，5\\]. Hence， previous CS has become a new medical risk for clinicians in China.**\n\n【20】**A study on previous CS and its association with adverse pregnancy outcomes has been studied extensively in other countries. However，literature on such studies in China is sparse， mainly due to**\n\n【21】**the one-child policy， which could not all ow for subsequent pregnancies that could be used to access previous CS's influence on pregnancy complications. However， these previous studies' findings have been reported to be associated with some pregnancy complications\\[1，2\\]， but the results were inconsistent. Some studies have indicated previous CS to be associated with pregnancy complications such as pregnancy-induced hypertension disorders \\[6-8\\]， placenta previa \\[7-10\\]， placenta abruption， placenta accreta/adhesions \\[8，9\\]. In contrast， other studies showed that previous CS had no significant effect on placenta disorders such as placenta previa \\[6，11\\]， placenta abruption\\[7，9\\] and placenta accrete \\[12\\].**\n\n【22】**Furthermore， other pregnancy complications are not well known to be associated with previous CS due to the limited number ofstudies on these outcomes. Few studies have reported an increased risk for Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) \\[7\\] and polyhydramnios \\[6，7\\] in pregnancy after CS when compared with vaginal delivery. Also， a previous study indicated high incidence of pregnant women with a previous CS diagnosed with fetal anomaly when compared with women with previous vaginal delivery \\[13\\]. Studies conducted to support the hypothesis of previous CS association with GDM， polyhydramnios， and fetal anomaly remains sparse to the best of our knowledge. Given the limited evidence on the influence of previous CS on these pregnancy complications such as GDM， polyhydramnios and fetal anomaly and the inconsistencies in the association between previous CS and the placenta disorders shown in other studies， there is a need for research attention on these pregnancy complications to update clinicians and women on the risk associated with CS.**\n\n【23】**The implementation of the universal two-child policy provides an ideal situation to study previous CS's influence on pregnancy complications. Therefore， this study examines previous CS's influence on pregnancy complications such as Gestational Diabetes Mellitus， polyhydramnios， fetal anomaly， Pregnancy Induced Hypertension(PIH)， placenta disorders (placenta previa， placenta abruptions and placenta accreta among women with singleton delivery in the second pregnancies.**\n\n【24】**Methods**\n\n【25】**Subject's section**\n\n【26】**This study used clinical data of 2018 women with singleton delivery in the second pregnancies delivered between January 2015and October 2017 at the Third Xiangya Hospital of Central South University. These women were identified from the electronic medical records and enrolled in the study. The 2018 women were selected based on the following inclusion criteria： (i) women who had live delivery at ≥ 24 weeks gestation； (ii) had singleton delivery for both the first and this second pregnancy. Women were excluded if they do not meet the criteria above or； (i) women whose pregnancy were as a result of Artificial Reproductive Technology (ART)； (ii) women whose records had missing information on the previous mode of delivery， pregnancy complications in the second pregnancy as well as maternal characteristics of second pregnancies.**\n\n【27】**Clinical data on theeprevious delivery mode， maternal characteristics and the pregnancy complications in the second pregnancy were retrieved from the electronic medical records and further validated and maintained by our research team. Women with a singleton pregnancy with previous CS in the first pregnancy were categorized as the study group. In contrast， those with spontaneous vaginal delivery for the first pregnancy were categorized as the**\n\n【28】**reference group.**\n\n【29】**We obtained ethical approval for this study from the Xiangya School of Nursing and the Institutional Review Board from the Third Xiangya Hospital of Central South University， Hunan， China.**\n\n【30】**Definitions of variables**\n\n【31】**Maternal characteristics included demographic and obstetric information such as maternal age at second pregnancy， Body Mass Index (BMI)， which was obtained from the weight and height of the pregnant woman at the first prenatal booking and was calculated as (weight in kg)/(height in m)， the number of prenatal care visits2 4 (standard prenatal care according to doctor’s suggestion)， Interpregnancy Interval (IPI) was also defined as the interval of years between the first delivery and the second pregnancy， history of Terminations of Pregnancy (TOP) before this second pregnancy and preexisting medical conditions which were all diagnosed by an obstetrician (pre-pregnancy diabetes， chronic hypertension， angiocardiography， anemia， systemic lupus erythema， asthma， fibroid， ovarian and fallopian cyst， syphilis， hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism).The continuous yvariables of the maternal characteristics were further sub-grouped into categories.**\n\n【32】**The pregnancy complications for this study are defined as disorders or diseases that occur during the second pregnancy period. Hence the pregnancy complications that obstetricians diagnosed were selected for this study and included Gestational Diabetes Mellitus{(GDM)， Polyhydramnios，Fetalanomaly， Pregnancy Induced Hypertension (PIH)， Placenta Previa， Placenta abruption， Placenta accreta. Gestational Diabetes Mellitus GDM was diagnosed using a 2-h， 75 g oral glucose tolerance test \\[14\\]. Polyhydramnios was defined as an abnormally sizeable amniotic fluid of 24 cm or greater during pregnancy and diagnosed through ultrasound examination\\[15\\]. The fetal anomaly was defined as a delivery defect or congenital malformation during the intrauterine life and can be identified prenatally or at delivery (WHO). Pregnancy Induced Hypertension(PIH) was defined as diastolic blood pressure >90 mmHg on two occasions， four hours apart or a single reading of >110 mmHg from20 weeks gestation \\[16\\]. Placenta previa is an implantation of the placenta over or near the internal opening of the cervix. Placental abruption is the premature separation of a usually implanted placenta from the uterus， and placenta accrete refer to the clinically apparent morbidly adherent placenta \\[17\\].**\n\n【33】**The study's covariates included significant maternal characteristics and the possible pregnancy complications (in the second pregnancy) known in the published literature as risk factors of the pregnancy complications in this study (potential confounders). For significant maternal characteristics that were used as covariates， we excluded pre-pregnancy diabetes and chronic hypertension when analyzing for GDM and PIH， respectively. We considered potential risk factors for the following： GDM (PIH\\[18\\])， polyhydramnios (fetal anomaly\\[19\\]， GDM \\[20\\]) and PIH (placenta disorders \\[21\\]， GDM \\[22\\]).**\n\n【34】**Statistical analyses**\n\n【35】**The maternal characteristics were described and summarized by frequencies and percentages. Chi-square and Fisher's exact test was used to compare the groups. Probability values of <0.05were considered statistically significant. We used univariate and multivariate logistic regression to ascertain the influence of previous CS on pregnancy complications. The influence of the covariates was analyzed. First， maternal age， Body Mass Index (BMI) at booking，**\n\n【36】**history of pregnancy termination， and significant preexisting medical condition (diabetes， chronic hypertension， asthma， fibroid， ovarian and fallopian cyst) were added as covariates. For the covariates of GDM and PIH， we excluded pre-pregnancy diabetes and chronic hypertension， respectively. Then potential risk factors for GDM(placenta disorders， PIH)， polyhydramnios (fetal anomaly， GDM) and PIH (placenta disorders， GDM) were further analyzed. We presented the logistic regression results as crude and adjusted Odds Ratios (ORs) with 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs). The data was analyzed using SPSS 25.0 (IBM Corp.，Armonk，NY，USA).**\n\n【37】**Maternal characteristics**\n\n【38】**Amongthe 2018 eligible women with singleton second pregnancy，942(46.7%) had experienced one previous CS， while the remaining1076 (53.3%)had one previous vaginal delivery.**\n\n【39】**Women with previous CS were older and had advanced age (≥35years) than women withprevious vaginal delivery. Those with previous CS had a higher BMI>25.0kg/m'and a longer IPI (5years and above) than those with previous vaginal delivery. Both women with previous CS and previous vaginal delivery had the recommended number of prenatal visits 2 4 visits. The history of pregnancy termination was slightly higher among those with previous CS than those with previous vaginal delivery. Furthermore， women with previous CS had a higher rate of preexisting medical diseases such as diabetes， hypertension， asthma， fibroid， cyst of the ovary and fallopian tube than those with previous vaginal delivery (Table 1).**\n\n【40】**Analysis of previous CS on pregnancy complications**\n\n【41】**Regarding the pregnancy complications， women with previous CS had a significantly higher rate of Gestational Diabetes Mellitus， fetal anomaly and placenta previa when compared with those with previous vaginal delivery. When these pregnancy complications were analyzed using the univariate binary logistic regression (odd crude ratio)， they were all associated with previous CS (Table 2).**\n\n【42】**After the multivariate logistic regression (adjustment for the covariates， which include significant maternal characteristics and potential risk factors)， there was an association between previous CS with GDM， fetal anomaly and placenta previa. Comparing the adjusted odds ratio of the pregnancy complications among women with previous CS and previous vaginal delivery (reference group)， women with previous CS were 1.44 times more likely to have GDM(95%CI， 1.09-1.89) and 14.26 times more likely to have fetal anomaly(95%CI， 4.21-48.25). Furthermore， women with previous CS were2.89 times more likely tohave placenta previa (95% CI，1.62-5.15)than those with previous vaginal delivery. In contrast， polyhydramnios， pregnancy-induced hypertension， placenta abruption and placenta accreta were the pregnancy complications that were not associated with previous CS compared with previous vaginal delivery in our study (Table 3).**\n\n【43】**Discussion**\n\n【44】**This study examined previous CS’s influence on pregnancy complications among women having their second pregnancy under the Chinese two-child policy's implementation. The main findings of this study indicated that GDM， fetal anomaly and placenta previa are the pregnancy complications associated with previous CS independent of maternal age， BMI at admission， IPI， history of termination of pregnancy， significant preexisting medical conditions**\n\n【45】**Table 1： Maternal characteristics of women with second pregnancies by the first previous mode of delivery in Hunan， China.**\n\n| **Previous Mode of delivery， n(%)**  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Maternal characteristics**  | **Previous vaginaldelivery n= 1076**  | **Previous CSn=942**  | **P value**  |\n| **Age， (years)**  |  |  |  |\n| **<35**  | **716(66.5)**  | **447(47.5)**  | **<0.001**  |\n| **235**  | **360(33.5)**  | **495(52.5)**  | **<0.001**  |\n| **BMI on admission (kg/m?)**  |  |  |  |\n| **<18.5**  | **1(0.1)**  | **1(0.11)**  | **<0.001**  |\n| **18.5-24.9**  | **359(33.4)**  | **198(21.0)**  | **<0.001**  |\n| **25.0-29.9**  | **606(56.3)**  | **558(59.2)**  | **<0.001**  |\n| **230**  | **110(10.2)**  | **185(19.6)**  | **<0.001**  |\n| **IPl (years)**  |  |  |  |\n| **\\>2**  | **365(33.9)**  | **149(15.8)**  | **<0.001**  |\n| **2-4**  | **262(24.3)**  | **217(23.0)**  | **<0.001**  |\n| **25**  | **449(41.7)**  | **578(61.1)**  | **<0.001**  |\n| **Prenatal care visit ≥ 4**  | **938(87.2)**  | **796(84.5)**  | **0.085**  |\n| **History of termination of** **pregnancy**  | **625(58.1)**  | **625(66.4)**  | **<.001**  |\n| **Preexisting medical conditions**  |  |  |  |\n| **Pre-gestational Diabetes**  | **21(2.0)**  | **44(4.7)**  | **0.001**  |\n| **Chronic Hypertension**  | **8(0.7)**  | **19(2.0)**  | **0.013**  |\n| **Angiocardioparthy**  | **68(6.3)**  | **54(5.7)**  | **0.581**  |\n| **Anaemia**  | **52(4.8)**  | **43(4.6)**  | **0.777**  |\n| **Systemic lupus erythema**  | **4(0.4)**  | **9(1.0)**  | **0.941**  |\n| **Asthma**  | **13(1.2)**  | **23(2.4)**  | **0.037**  |\n| **Fibroid**  | **22(2.0)**  | **35(3.7)**  | **0.024**  |\n| **Fallopian and ovarian cyst**  | **11(1.0)**  | **39(4.1)**  | **<0.001**  |\n| **Syphilis**  | **3(0.3)**  | **10(1.1)**  | **0.47**  |\n| **Hypothyroidism**  | **21(2.0)**  | **15(1.6)**  | **0.543**  |\n| **Hyperthyroidism**  | **16(1.5)**  | **12(1.3)**  | **0.683**  |\n\n【47】BMI： Body Mass Index； IPI： Interpregnancy Interval\n\n【48】**and potential risk factors (pregnancy complications in the second pregnancy that are confounders) for the pregnancy complications in this study.**\n\n【49】**This paper has shown that previous CS is associated with increased risk of GDM， fetal anomaly and placenta previa but not polyhydramnios， PIH， placenta abruption， and placenta accreta. To our knowledge， this is the first study to support the hypothesis of previous CS's influence with GDM and also the first recent study to show an association between previous CS and fetal anomaly.**\n\n【50】**Pregnant women with previous CS were 1.44 times at high risk of GDM. The results of Hu’s study also presented this relationship \\[7\\]， although there is an unknown exact biological relationship between previous CS and GDM. Nonetheless， there has been speculation that inefficient placenta function due to abnormal trophoblastic invasion that may occur due to the uterine changes induced by prior CS can interfere with uteroplacental blood flow leading to subsequent gestational complications， including GDM \\[23\\]. Furthermore， a normal placenta's buffer action against hyperglycemia in the mother\\[24\\] may impede due to placenta insufficiency as a result of placenta abnormalities associated with previous CS. Therefore， this may cause GDM in pregnancy.

Pre-gestational diabetes was not added to the covariates of GDM and chronic hypertension was also not added to the covariates of PIH**\n\n【60】**tFurther adjusted for PIH in the second pregnancy**\n\n【61】**#Further adjusted for fetal anomaly and GDM in the second pregnancy**\n\n【62】**placenta insufficiency may also affect the glucose transporters found in the placenta's syncytiotrophoblast， responsible for increasing glucose transport from the mother to the placenta \\[25\\]. This placenta insufficiency may result in hyperglycemia in the maternal circulation that may contribute to GDM. GDM in previous pregnancy can be recurrent in the subsequent pregnancy. However， a study \\[7\\] indicated that recurrent GDM in previous pregnancy does not significantly reduce previous CS’s influence on GDM. Also， advanced maternal age and overweight or obesity is identified as risk factors for gestational diabetes mellitus. Although most of the women with previous CS were of advanced maternal age and were overweight， we adjusted for these confounders. Nevertheless， there remained an association between previous CS and GDM. However， further studies elucidating the current findings on the relationship between previous CS and GDM and the possible biological and physiological relationship need to be appraised.**\n\n【63】**Furthermore， previous CS showed a significant impact on the fetal anomaly in our study. To our knowledge， this is the first recent study that shows the association between previous CS and fetal anomaly. These findings of this study， might be due to the increased risk of placenta disorders associated with previous CS， which can predispose the women to placenta insufficiencythat may affect the fetus s normal development leading to increased risk for fetal anomaly \\[26，27\\]. It could also be speculated that the risk of fetal anomaly may be due to the uterine cavity changes induced by a uterine scar from previous CS， which can alter the uterus s anatomy that predisposes women to have**\n\n【64】**a fetal anomaly. Although advanced maternal age， pre-gestational diabetes， and chronic hypertension are considered high-risk fetal anomaly factors， there remained a higher risk for fetal anomaly associated with previous CS when adjusted for our studies. However， most of the pregnancies with fetal anomaly were terminated at the first or second trimester， which may not represent the exact number of women with a fetal anomaly. Therefore， more studies focusing on the association between previous CS and fetal anomaly need to be conducted in the future.**\n\n【65】**Among the placenta disorders， only placenta previa has an association with previous CS in our study. Previous CS was associated with an increased risk of placenta previa with an adjusted Odds Ratio(ORs) of 2.89， higher than some previous studies \\[7，28，29\\]. These previous studies have indicated the association between previous CS and placenta previa， but the Odd Ratios (ORs) were lesser than our study. However， parity and multiple gestations，considered to increase the risk of placenta previa in a previous study \\[30\\]， were excluded from our study. Furthermore， when adjusted for the covariates(significant maternal characteristics)， which were also considered potential confounders to placenta previa in previous studies \\[28，31\\]， it remained a higher risk. This higher Odd Ratio (OR) may be due to the study conducted with data from a tertiary hospital where women with high-risk pregnancies such as placenta previa are referred to. Currently， the exact cause of placenta previa is unknown. However， placenta previa is hypothesized to be related to a failure of apparent placental migration， impaired differential growth of the lower uterine**\n\n【66】**segment， and deficient decidua basalis in the presence of previous surgery injury \\[10，32\\].**\n\n【67】**However，polyhydramnios was not associated with previous CS in our study； this is in variance with previous studies \\[6，7\\]. The difference might be attributed to the small number of pregnant women with polyhydramnios in our study， which contributed to a small effect size that did not associate previous CS and polyhydramnios. This is supported by the wide Confidence Interval (CI) observed in its Odds Ratio (OR). Furthermore， among the placenta disorders associated with previous CS in the previous studies， placenta abruption and placenta accreta did not show any association with previous CS. This finding is in variance with other previous studies \\[1，8-10\\]. An observation of no increased risk between previous CS and Pregnancy Induced Hypertension (PIH) existed in our study. This may be due to a smaller number of women with PIH in our study which could not predict the association.**\n\n【68】**Our study also confirms the high CS rate of 46.7% in the first delivery as the previous CS. This finding is congruent with the WHO study， which indicated China to be the country with the highest CS rate of 46.2% among the 24 Asian countries. This present study is one of the few studies conducted after the two-child policy that examines previous CS's influence on pregnancy complications. This study also adjusted for several confounding factors that could have influenced our result. The study was conductedthree years after implementing the two-child policy that accurately represents pregnancy complications among women with a second pregnancy.**\n\n【69】**The present study also had some limitations， primarily due to the retrospective nature of the design. Firstly， misclassification of the pregnancy complications may exist just as other administrative databases， which can lead to bias， but this may have occurred randomly and therefore could have the tendency of reducing the bias that could have occurred in this stuidy.**\n\n【70】**Secondly， some details of information on the first pregnancy， such as the pregnancy outcomes and indications for previous CS， were not present due to the transitioning from paper medical records entry to electronic medical records. Information regarding their first pregnancy， which happened very long ago， was not captured. There can be a reduction of bias from lack of indication for the previous CS since most women during the one-child policy had CS without any medical reasons \\[1，3\\]. Also， some women did not have their first child at our hospital； hence the available details ofthe first pregnancy were obtained from maternal self-report， of which there could be a _P_ presence of recall bias.**\n\n【71】**Thirdly， the BMI used for the study was BMI at admission for delivery， which may not represent the exact BMI since the fetus’s weight could have influenced maternal BMI at admission. Lastly， there could be selection bias since most women who had obstetric complications in their first pregnancy might opt for a tertiary hospital or be referred to a tertiary hospital to seek medical help during their subsequent pregnancy.**\n\n【72】**Conclusion**\n\n【73】**In conclusion， our study revealed the association of previous first CS with pregnancy complications such as GDM， fetal anomaly and placenta previa on singleton pregnancy among women having their second child under the universal two-child policy. Hence， this study provides the needed information for obstetricians， nurses**\n\n【74】**and midwives to acquaint themselves with knowledge pertaining to pregnancy complications and provides intensive management and follow-ups of women with previous CS to ensure a healthy mother and baby throughout the pregnancy and delivery periods. Such information obtained from this study could help the decision-making process regarding CS for the health care providers and expectant mothers alike， mainly when there are no clear medical indications for CS.**\n\n【75】**Data Availability**\n\n【76】**The datasets generated during and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.**\n\n【77】**Acknowledgement**\n\n【78】**We are grateful to the Department of Medical Records and the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of the Third Xiangya Hospital of Central South University to provide us with the electronic database for this study.**\n\n【79】**References**\n\n【80】**1\\.

Japan is likewise aging more rapidly than any other country， the percentage of the population aged 65 and over reached 23% in 2009， the highest in the world. Furthermore， by2030， one in three people will be 65 or older，and one in five will be 75 or older \\[2\\]. Deterioration in physical and cognitive health with aging increases the risk of developing disability in older adults. Older adults remain at great risk for cognitive decline and， as a result， for increasingly poor quality of life. As for those reasons， previous studies have shown that (a) a decline in information-processing speed， (b) failure to engage in elaborative processing， (c) deficits in various types of problem-solving ability，(d) decrease in working memory capacity， and (e) lack of controllability \\[3-8\\]. Suzuki et al. developed an intervention program in the form of a dual task in which physical exercise and cognitive tasks are performed simultaneously \\[9\\]. Dual tasks require executive functions that are particularly important for Activities of Daily Living (ADL). Doi et al. reported that increased prefrontal activation during dual-tasks correlated with executive function in elderly patients with MCI \\[10\\]. Other previous studies have also shown that interventions using dual-task training may be a promising approach for MCI patients \\[11，12\\]. In our previous study also showed that our multi-component program could improve the cognitive and physical functions of older adults in community dwellers \\[13\\].**\n\n【21】**_Copyright C 2023 Ota H.

Cultural activities include daily events for enjoyment， entertainment， recreation， or social contribution \\[14\\]. Participation in cultural activities can be“passive\" or \"active，\" interestingly， active cultural participation has been shown to be more effective**\n\n【23】**in cognitive function than passive participation \\[15\\]. In recent years， theatrical approaches have been reported to improve the health and cognitive function of older adults through active cultural participation \\[16-18\\]. However， most of the studies reported to date have focused on cognitive function. Theatrical approaches may have a positive impact on physical and social function because they promote rich experiences and interaction among participants. The purpose of this study was to clarify the effects of a theater program intervention on the cognitive， physical， and social functions of older adults living in the community.**\n\n【24】**Materials and Methods**\n\n【25】**Participants**\n\n【26】**Participants were recruited in Akita prefecture， Japan. Our study was performed from June to October 2022. The participants aged 65years old or over， had the ability to walk independently and living at home without personal assistance. The exclusion criteria were dementia， major depression， severe hearing or a visual impairment， stroke，Parkinson's disease， another neurological disease， intellectual disability， need for support of care as certified by the Japanese public long-term care insurance system due to disability， and inability to complete cognitive tests at the baseline assessment. The demographic data comprised age，gender，education， and health variables including Body Mass Index (BMI) \\[kg/m²\\].**\n\n【27】**Intervention**\n\n【28】**Of the 43 participants who gave informed consent， they were assigned to the control group and theatre intervention group. Each group also received a 90-minute program once every two weeks for three months.**\n\n【29】**Multicomponent exercise program for the control group**\n\n【30】**As previouslyreported\\[9\\]，amulticomponent exercise interventionWasperformed1，，where cognitiveetrainingWas incorporated into the sessions combined with resistance and aerobic training. The control group was conducted by health and fitness instructors or trained care workers. The content of the program is to maintain and improve ADLs and lead to preventive care for the elderly. Each session included as follows； first， started with bending exercises such as per and lower limb stretching. After that， physical training was 10 min of aerobic exercises with cognitive stimulation and 20 min of resistance exercises with cognitive stimulation. The therapist adjusted the level of aerobic exercise and resistance exercises according to each participant's ability， and the participant rested when needed. The cognitive exercises included dual-task training.**\n\n【31】**Theatre intervention group**\n\n【32】**The theatrical intervention consisted of a basic program and an application program， and was conducted by longtime theater professionals and teaching staff. The basic program consisted of stretching， aerobic exercise， and vocal and emotional expression exercises for 30 min. Emotional expression exercises involved rhythmically imitating the words and emotions (anger，joy， sadness， etc.) of the instructional staff (Figure 1). The application program included chorus practice， dance， and dialogue practice based on a script created by the participants. The theatre script was produced by the Warabiza， but the lyrics to the theme song were written by the participants themselves (Figure 2). In addition， participants prepared their own costumes and props to be used in the play.**\n\n【33】**Assessment and outcome**\n\n【34】**We evaluated a physical performance consisting of grip strength(kg) and usual walking speed (m/s). Four cognitive subtests of the National Center for Geriatrics and Gerontology Functional Assessment Tool (NCGG-FAT) \\[19\\] were also assessed for each participant. Cognitive subtests are indicated as follow；**\n\n【35】**Components of NCGG-FAT**\n\n【36】**The computerized multidimensional neurocognitive test was performed on an iPad (Apple， Cupertino， CA， USA) with a 9.7-inch touch display. The task instructions were presented with aletter size of at least 1.0×1.0 cm’on the display. For this study， a trained operator supported each participant by setting up the tablet PC and running each test. Participants completed the NCGG-FAT subtests as follows.**\n\n【37】**Tablet Version of Word Recognition (WR)： This test is comprised of two computerized tasks of immediate recognition and delayed recall. In the first task of immediate recognition， participants were instructed to memorize 10 words， each of which was displayed for 2 s on the tablet PC. After that， a total of 30 words including 10target and 20 distracter words were shown to participants， and they were required to select the 10 target words immediately. This task was repeated for three trials. The average number of correct answers was recorded as a score ranging from 0 to 10. In another task， participants were asked to correctly recall the 10 target words after 20 min. The number of correctly recalled target words was scored ranging from0 to 10. Finally， we calculated the sum score of the two tasks of immediate recognition and delayed recall.**\n\n【38】**Tablet Version of Trail Making Test Version A (TMT-A) and Version B (TMT-B)： In the Trail Making Test Version A (TMT-A)**\n\n【39】**Figure 1： Emotional expression exercises.**\n\n【40】**Figure 2： Meeting to create theme song lyrics.**\n\n【41】**Table 1： Comparison of participant characteristics between Control and Theatre group.**\n\n|  | **Contral groupn=25**  |  | **Theatre groupn=18**  |  | **p value**  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Median**  | **IQR**  | **Median**  | **IQR**  | **p value**  |\n| **Gender (% female)**  | **88.0**  |  | **50.0**  |  | **0.000\\***  |\n| **Age (year)**  | **73**  | **6**  | **71.5**  | **9**  | **0.407**  |\n| **Education (year)**  | **12**  | **2**  | **14**  | **4**  | **0.286**  |\n| **BMI(kg/m²)**  | **22.2**  | **3.3**  | **22.2**  | **8.7**  | **0.506**  |\n\n【43】**\\*p<0.01， Mann-Whitney test， x2test**\n\n【44】**task， participants were instructed to touch the target numbers in a sequence as rapidly as possible. Target numbers from 1 to 15 were randomly displayed on the tablet panel. In addition， the Trail Making Test Version B (TMT-B) instructions required participants to touch target numbers (e.g.， 1-15) and letters in turn.**\n\n【45】**Tablet Version of Symbol Digit Substitution Task (SDST)： In the Symbol Digit Substitution Task (SDST)， nine pairs of numbers and symbols were shown in the upper part of the tablet display. A target symbol was shown in the center of the tablet panel， and selectable numbers were displayed at the bottom. Participants were asked to touch the number corresponding to the target symbol shown in the central part of the tablet display as rapidly as possible. The number of correct numbers within 90 s was recorded.**\n\n【46】**Criteria of physical frailty**\n\n【47】**Frailty status was defined based on five dimensions of the Fried frailty index， including i) shrinking， ii) exhaustion， iii) low level of activity， iv) weakness， and v) slowness， 0 for robust， 1 to 2 for prefrail， and 3 to 5 for frail， and the frailty \\[20\\].**\n\n【48】**Criteria of social frailty**\n\n【49】**Makizako's social frail index was applied for this study， consisting of i) Living alone (yes)， ii) Talking with someone every day (no)， iii) Feeling helpful to friends or family (no)， iv) Going out less frequently compared with last year (yes)， v) Visiting friends sometimes (no)，0for robust， 1 for social prefrail， and 2 to 5 for social frail. According to the change of social frail status at the following-up period， robust persons classified at the baseline were grouped into three categories， such as robust， social prefrail， and social frail \\[21\\].**\n\n【50】**Statistical analysis**\n\n【51】**We compared the controlgroup and theatre group in demographics for age， gender， education， and BMI by using the Mann-Whitney test. Next， The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was applied to compare the results of physical function and UWS， GS，**\n\n【52】**Table 2： Comparison of physical and cognitive function pre-test and post-test in each group.**\n\n【53】**WM， TMT-A & B， and SDST between pre-test and post-test of this program for participants. The Wilcoxon signed rank test was applied to compare the results of the physical frailty ratio and social frailty between pre-test and post-test. Moreover， the Mann-Whitney test was applied to compare amount of change the physical and cognitive items for the control group and theatre group. SPSS Version 27.0 for Windows (SPSS INC.， Chicago. IL， USA) was used for the analysis， and the level of significance was set at p=0.05.**\n\n【54】**Results**\n\n【55】**The 43 participants were divided into 25 from the control group(mean age， 72.1 years) and 18 from the theatre group (mean age， 70.7years). The comparison demographics of participants for the control group and the theatre group were shown in Table 1. According to the result of y test， the theater group had a significantlyhigher percentage of males. Table 2 lists the results of physical functions and cognitive functions for the pre-test and the post-test. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to analyze the differences between pre-test and post-test and revealed significant differences in the UWS (p<0.05) for the control group， and the UWS (p<0.01) for the theatre group， however， there was no significant improvement in cognitive function both the control group and the Theatre group. Next， comparisons of the physical frailty and social frailty for the control group and the theatre group at the pre-test and the post-test were shown in Table3. As a result of the Wilcoxon signed rank test， physical frailty， and social frailty improved significantly after the intervention in the control group (physical frailty； p<0.01， social frailty； p<0.05) and theatre groups (physical frailty； p<0.05， social frailty； p<0.01).**\n\n【56】**Finally， as a result of the Mann-Whitney test was applied to compare the amount of change in the physical and cognitive items for control group and theatre group， the amount of the change in UWS in the theatre group was significantly higher than in the control group (p<0.05) (Table 4).**\n\n【57】**Discussion**\n\n【58】**This study population was a significantly higher percentage of males for the theatre group than control group. Previous studies have similarly reported that social exchange is less likely in male older adults， thus theatre interventions may be effective in increasing male participation \\[22\\].**\n\n【59】**This study sought to determine whether 3 months of theater training would enhance aspects of cognitive functions and physical functions essential to independent living.

Especially，amount of the change in UWS in the theatre group was significantly higher than in the control group from pre-test to post-test. Pua et al. were reported that walking speed is strongly associated with balance ability and agility. In other words， we believe that walking speed improves when both balance capacity and agility are combined \\[23\\]. The theatrical approach in this study may have been effective in improving gait speed because it incorporated dynamic and quick rhythmic movements， as well as mid-backposture and crouching movements in the play (Figure 3). On the other hand， WM and SDST for cognitive function showed a trend toward improvement after the intervention， but no statistically significant improvement was observed. However， because this participant consisted of healthy， independent-living participants， the cognitive functions were quite high to start with， and ceiling effects might have been present. Theatrical training requires the simultaneous execution of the characters lines and accompanying actions. The ongoing practice of this kind of complex multitasking may improve the efficiency of real-world dual-task processing. Therefore， we would like to further increase the number of participants and conduct further validation with participants with cognitive decline， such as MCI.**\n\n【69】**Most interesting in this study， the significant improvement in physical frailty after the intervention， especially was that the improvement in social frailty was markedly more pronounced in a theatre group. Several previous studies have found that increasing age， cognitive impairment， obesity， presence of multiple diseases，low education，andhospitalizationare risk factors forworsening frail status， whereas increased physical activity， women， overweight， low alcohol intake， higher education， living alone， and low baseline disability increase the likelihood of improving frailty \\[24-27\\]. Although factors**\n\n【70】**other than training need to be examined in detail， theatrical training may provide similar physical frailty improvement benefits as multi-component training. As Japan's population ages at an accelerated rate， social challenges faced by the elderly are increasing， and social frailty resulting from social challenges is attracting more attention. Also， the emergency situation of thorough social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic has consequently affected the spread of the epidemic， and our previous study also reported an increase in social frailty after the COVID-19 expansion \\[28\\]. Moreover， Makizako et al. reported that among independent community-dwelling older adults who are not physical frail， those who are socially frail may be at greater risk of developing physical frail in the near future， and social frail may precede (and lead to the development of) physical frail \\[21\\]. Therefore，prevention and improvement of social frailty is considered an important issue in aging society around the world. Jasmine et al. were reported that evidence on the effectiveness of complex interventions targeting reduction in socialvulnerability for improving health related outcomes (mortality， function， cognition， subjective health and healthcare use) in older adults living in the community\\[29\\]. According to that report， social support and strengthening the community in which elderly people live in the area are necessary to improve social frailty， and furthermore， reducing social frailty may also help improve the condition of their health \\[30，31\\]. Seeman et al. were identified that theater requires each person to perform in front of everyone and that a very powerful group dynamic was created when everyone experienced the same play. The participants in this study were also able to join forces and make friends to accomplish a play， and furthermore， not a single person dropped out. We have confirmed that theater programs can engage and motivate the elderly， and we have also shown that they can strengthen bonds in social situations.**\n\n【71】**The present study had several limitations. First， the sample sizes for both the control group and Theatre group were quite small. In a further study， we plan to increase the sample size. Second， the participants were not blind to interventions， and this study lacked a control group with no treatment. Case-control comparisons with blinding are needed in addition to before and after the intervention. Third， participants in this study may be healthful and higher cognitive function than non-participants. These requirements should be adjusted for further additional research in the future.**\n\n【72】**Conclusion**\n\n【73】**We have shown that a theatrical intervention can be as effective as the multicomponent exercise recommended in previous frailty prevention. Furthermore， the theatrical intervention was suggested to be effective in strengthening the community of participants， and improving social frailty. Therefore， theatrical intervention needs to be further studied to become a new intervention method for the prevention of frailty. Authors should discuss the results and how they can be interpreted from the perspective ofprevious studies and ofthe working hypotheses. The findings and their implications should be discussed in the broadest context possible. Future research directions may also be highlighted.**\n\n【74】**Acknowledgment**\n\n【75】**The authors thank all the participants in this survey.

Recently， the state of Andhra Pradesh Visakhapatnam saw the largest styrene gas leak into the atmosphere， which LG Polymer India Company Limited caused. The LG Polymers Company produces plastics， polyesters， synthetic rubber，latex paints， and coatings. This paper discusses the risks associated with a styrene gas leak occurrence.**\n\n【12】**Keywords： MIC； Benzene； Hazards； Styrene； Gas leakage；Polyesters**\n\n【13】**Introduction Methyl Isocyanate， or MIC**\n\n【14】**The most significant tragedy in India occurred a few years ago， on December 2， 1984， when workers at the Union Carbide facility in Bhopal， India， were exposed to methyl isocyanate gas. The eyes， respiratory system， and skin were a few of the major organs. Acute irritating effects on the eyes and respiratory system were significant results.**\n\n【15】**Methyl isocyanate is a white liquid with a strong scent. Its molecular weight is 57.1， soluble in water and methylamine， and it breaks down into carbon dioxide when heated to its boiling point of39°C \\[1\\]. The skin， eyes and respiratory membranes become immediately irritated when the human body is exposed to this gas \\[2\\].**\n\n【16】**Effects on health**\n\n【17】**Respiratory poisoning the upper and lower respiratory tracts were affected by this gas exposure， with the respiratory tract being the most severely impacted. The most common symptoms were coughing， a sense of suffocation and chest discomfort， dyspnea， irritation of the throat， and rhinorrhea \\[3\\].**\n\n【18】**Carcinogenicity of MIC**\n\n【19】**_Citation：_**\n\n【20】**_1404._**\n\n【21】**Ennever et al. \\[4\\] described the battery selection technique and carcinogen prediction methods to determine the MIC carcinogenicity. According to the results of several in vitro and in vivo investigations， the MIC gas had a 76% risk of being a genotoxic carcinogen， according to the studys authors. Negative assays in that test showed high specificity and low sensitivity， whereas positive assays had low specificity and high sensitivity. It suggests a mild to moderate carcinogenicity. Finally， the authors concluded that the MIC in this situation was an animal carcinogen due to its low potency. In a different research， an examination of the population-based cancer registry in Bhopal identified a relative risk of lung， buccal cavity， and oropharyngeal cancers. Because of tobacco usage， the ICMR Cancer Institute observed increased lung cancer rates and impacted parts of the tongue， mouth， and esophagus. Finally， the living style and other biological characteristics may lessen the danger of MIC exposure， according to research by the Jawaharlal Nehru Cancer Hospital and Research Center (JNCHRC) conducted in Bhopal. MIC has not been designated as a carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) or the US Environmental Protection Agency \\[5-7\\].**\n\n【22】**Styrene Monomer**\n\n【23】**On May 7h， 2020， a new natural gas leak using styrene occurred in Vizag. Numerous individuals were affected， and 12 people died. This gas influences thousands of individuals within**\n\n【24】**a 5-kilometer radius \\[8\\]. One of the most significant monomers in the contemporary petrochemical sector is styrene. In the year 1930， it was created. The most significant polymeric compounds made using styrene are polystyrene， styrene-acrylonitrile， and others. Styrene is mainly manufactured in the industry by dehydrogenating the ethylbenzene method. Styrene is a gaseous， liquid substance with no color and a strong smell. Styrene， sometimes referred to as vinyl benzene， is a crucial industrial chemical molecule utilized in producing a wide range of industrial resins， incuding polystyrene and hundreds of copolymers. One of the most significant monomers in the contemporary petrochemical sector is styrene. In the year1930， it was created. Most polymeric compounds produced with styrene include polystyrene，styrene-acrylonitrile，and others. Styrene is mainly manufactured in the industry by the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene.**\n\n【25】**Styrene is a gaseous， liquid substance with no color and a strong smell. Styrene was initially identified in 1831 as a Storax balsam distillation byproduct \\[9\\]. Its molecular mass is 104.15， and its chemical formula is CH.CH=CH，. Water， ethanol， Benzene， and petroleum ether have a small amount of solubility in styrene. A substance having a high boiling point is styrene. The organic molecule styrene has the chemical formula C H. It is kept as a liquid in industries， but as it readily evaporates， it must be kept at low temperatures. One of the most significant monomers in the contemporary petrochemical sector is styrene. Polystyrene， styrene-acrylonitrile， and acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene are the three most significant polymeric compounds produced primarily from styrene(ABS). Styrene can be found in consumer goods， including drinking cups，insulation forwiring and appliances， fiberglass， plastic pipes，and vehicle parts. Styrene from the Hazards gas was recently discovered to have spilled in Vizag on May 7h， 2020. Numerous individuals were affected， and 12 people died. This gas influences thousands of people within a 5-kilometer radius \\[8\\].**\n\n【26】**Preparation of styrene**\n\n【27】**From Ethvl Benzene： Most styrene monomer is made from ethyl benzene \\[10\\]， and virtually all ethyl benzene generated globally is used to make styrene. Because ofthis， the two processes are frequently quite interwoven. A Friedel-Crafts reaction between Benzene and ethylene produces ethylbenzene. Originally， this process employed aluminum chloride as a catalyst， but in contemporary manufacture， zeolite has taken its place.**\n\n【28】**Bydehydrogenation： Total styrene producedby the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene is 80%. Using superheated steam and over an iron (III) oxide catalyst \\[11\\].**\n\n【29】**Finally， the crude product of ethylbenzene is purified by the distillation method. The differences in the boiling point between the two compounds were only 90°C at ambient pressure use of a series of distillation columns. It is complicated by the tendency of monomers to undergo thermally induced into polystyrene \\[12\\].**\n\n【30】**Synthesis of polystyrene**\n\n【31】**The polymerization of the styrene monomer creates polystyrene during its production. Styrene can be polymerized via free radical， anionic， and cationic reactions， as well as employing metal catalysts in this process.**\n\n【32】**Industrial gas leakage： Aswe consider the LG Polymers**\n\n【33】**accident in Vizag， memories of the Bhopal Gas Leak Disaster of 1984immediately emerge. The same disregard for human life， the same disregard for conventional operating protocols， and the same absence of emergency measures. Recently， a gas leak was discovered in Vishakhapatnam， Andhra Pradesh. Numerous hazardous industries are located in the port city of Vizag， also known as Vishakhapatnam， which is found in the state of Andhra Pradesh on the southeast coast of India. The alarming news of a toxic chemical leak from a plant producing polystyrene-based products located about 15 km awayon the outskirts of the city at a private plastic manufacturing plant owned by LG Polymers Pvt. Ltd. rudely awakened five million residents of the Vizag Metropolitan Region on May 7t， 2020， early in the morning. The styrene gas leak in Vishakhapatnam resulted in severe dyspnea. Up to this point， roughly 12 persons and 32 animals have perished from being exposed to deadly styrene vapors that escaped from the factory \\[13\\]. Over 800 of the estimated 1000+ victims of injuries who resided in nearby communities within a six-kilometer radius had to be hospitalized. A further 4，000 people were able to leave the area unharmed after being alerted to evacuate in time by a few volunteers. Nearly 10，000 more locals were compelled to flee their houses in a panic 14.**\n\n【34】**The death toll might have been far worse if the extremely combustible styrene vapors caught fire and the massive amount of styrene monomer housed in the plant's two giant tanks had been released. Most people living in the Vizag Metropolitan region are fortunate to have escaped the most recent calamity unhurt because， miraculously， that did not occur. Although styrene is much less toxic than MIC (Methyl-Iso-Cyanate)， the chemical that had caused the Bhopal disaster in 1984， the enormous amount of styrene that had been stored at the plant at the time of the disaster (reportedly about7，000 kiloliters compared to the 80 kiloliters of MIC at Bhopal) did have the potential to cause a massive disaster in the Vizag region that would have had much worse (Fortunately， the remaining styrene monomer in the concerned tank has been deactivated， and on May11h，2020， 5，000 kiloliters from the plant's unaffected tanks was sent back to Seoul.) Styrene is invisible， heavier than air， and very combustible. The Threshold Limit Value (TLV) for styrene， as defined by the safety guidelines established by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH)， is 20 pp， TWA (Time Tested Average) for an exposure duration of eight hours. The Short-Term Exposure Level (STEL) for styrene for fifteen minutes is 40 ppm\\[by comparison， the TLV of MIC is 0.02 ppm\\] (parts per million). While the Immediately Dangerous to Life or Health (IDLH) dose of styrene is around 700 ppm， according to the National Institute for Occupational Safety & Health (NIOSH)，USA \\[15\\]. Styrene mayenter the body of a human by breathing， ingesting food， and skin contact. Styrene takes a few days to degrade into other compounds and pass through urine after entering the human body. Styrene impacts the stomach and eyes when it is introduced to people. Long-term impacts include central nervous system dysfunction， depression， hearing loss， and peripheral neuropathy. If exposed to styrene gas for extended periods， they risk leukemia and headaches. Styrene exposure at work has been the subject of studies， although those results have not been definitive. The United States Environmental Protection Agency has proved styrene to have low to moderate toxicity by inhalation and oral exposure in experiments， including acute exposure of rats and mice. In animal studies， styrene exposure by inhalation has been linked to effects on the neurological system， liver， kidneys， and nose discomfort. Animals exposed to chromium orally affect their liver， blood， kidneys， and stomach.**\n\n【35】**Exposure to styrene gas**\n\n【36】**Chronic low-level exposure to styrene may cause cancer. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) states that short-term exposure to low levels of styrene in humans can have gastrointestinal symptoms as well as mucous membrane and ocular irritation. On the other hand， prolonged exposure impacts the central nervous system， resulting inheadaches， weakness， exhaustion， hearing loss， nerve damage， and depression. Exposure to it can result in shortness of breath， respiratory issues， eye irritation， indigestion， and nausea， momentary loss of consciousness， unsteady walking， and giddiness. When styrene vapor is inhaled in large amounts， it irritates the skin， eyes， and lungs and makes breathing difficult. However， these disorders may worsen in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) patients and respiratory illnesses， including asthma. Exposure to styrene gas primarily affects mucosal membranes. Compared to other organic compounds， styrene takes longer to enter the blood from the lungs. According to studies， 86% of styrene that enters the body is eliminated through urine.**\n\n【37】**The styrene leaked in what way?**\n\n【38】**Humans can have gastrointestinal symptoms，mucous membrane irritation， and ocular discomfort after short-term exposure to low amounts of styrene. Styrene cannot seep into the air unless high-temperature， such as a fire or an explosion. From an LG Chem Polymers storage tank， styrene gas spilled. The plant opened its doors in 1961. In the beginning， Hindustan Polymers produced polystyrene. In 1978， it amalgamated with McDowell & Co of the UB Group， and in 1997， South Korean company LG Chem acquired and renamed it LG Polymers. Expandable polystyrene， general-purpose polystyrene， high-impact polystyrene， and engineering plastics compounds are all produced at the business. It is situated 15 kilometers outside Visakhapatnam city at RRV Puram in Gopalapatnam. A corporate representative stated that a tank with a capacity of 2，400 tones was holding 1，800 tones of styrene. The gas escaped from this tank when authorities were getting ready to reopen the plant that had been shut down for 44 days owing to the lockout. Before it could be contained， around half of the gas spilled. There are significant environmental and occupational exposures to Benzene since it has been measured in all areas of the environment and is often released in severalindustrial and transportation contexts. The most frequent exposure route is inhalation， although Benzene can contaminate food and water， quickly permeate the skin， and cause cutaneous and gastrointestinal exposures. This incident in Visakhapatnam is connected to elevated levels of Benzene and had a positive outcome.**\n\n【39】**Styrene monomer applications**\n\n【40】**One of the most significant monomers for industrial polymers and co-polymers， which are employed in many applications， is styrene. Plastics， latex paints and coatings， synthetic rubbers， and polyesters are the main uses for styrene monomer \\[16\\]. The most common use of resins containing styrene monomer is in foams used as fillers and bolsters. Additionally， pipes， fittings， tanks， lighting fixtures， and corrosion-resistant items have applications in the construction industry. Artificial marble， flooring， throwaway dinnerware， and furniture made of plastic are examples of household items. Applications for transportation materials include car body putty， reinforced plastics， and tires. The vast majority of styrene is transformed into polystyrene resins， which may be easily molded and compatible with various colorants， modifiers， and fillers. The second-largest families of Styrene-Acrylonitrile (SAN) resins， co-**\n\n【41】**polymers， and adducts are used in various moldings for appliances， automobiles， buildings， pipelines， and electronics \\[17\\].**\n\n【42】**Causes of stvrene**\n\n【43】**Styrene causes include a recent gas leak in Vishakhapatnam， Andhra Pradesh. In the wee hours of July 54， 2020， a leak occurred at a privately held plastic manufacturing facility operated by LG polymers Pvt. Ltd. Styrene or vinyl benzene was used to confirm the gas. It is employed in the manufacture of resins and polymers made of polystyrene. These materials are used in food packaging， rubber， plastic， etc. PVC gas is another name for it. It can enter a person's body by inhaling， eating， or skin-to-skin contact. Styrene takes a few days to degrade into other compounds and pass through urine after entering the human body. Styrene impacts the stomach and eyes when it is introduced to people. Long-term impacts include central nervous system dysfunction， depression， hearing loss， and peripheral neuropathy.**\n\n【44】**Styrene carcinogenicity： According to the National Toxicology Programs (NTP) to the human studies， which are based on the 2，009exposure of employees to these gases， there is only minimal evidence that styrene monomer causes cancer in people \\[18\\]. The likelihood of developing esophageal and pancreatic cancer among these exposed monomers is also elevated； as is mortality from cancer of the lymphohematopoietic system and genetic damage in lymphocytes due to DNA adduct levels \\[19\\]. Styrene exposure and cancer in humans are linked， however， by the discovery of DNA adducts and chromosomal abnormalities in lymphocytes from the exposed individuals.**\n\n【45】**Applications of polystyrene**\n\n【46】**In addition to being used for packing， polystyrene is used to make furniture，refrigerators， and other toys. Furthermore， the co-polymers of ABS and SAN are primarily utilized in transportation， watercraft， and the medical industry. The principal application for polystyrene foam is an insulating material for heat-sensitive goods.**\n\n【47】**Benzene**\n\n【48】**Colorless and combustible， Benzene has a lovely smell. When exposed to air， it swiftly evaporates. It serves primarily as a rav material for producing other chemicals， including plastics， rubber， dyes， medicines， lubricants， and insecticides. Additionally， it was frequently employed as an industrial solvent. Along with gasoline， cigarettes， and crude oil， Benzene is a naturally occurring component of all three.**\n\n【49】**Exposure locations**\n\n【50】**This viewpoint mentions a few locations， including the rubber industry， oil refineries， chemical factories， and gasoline-related businesses.**\n\n【51】**Health effects**\n\n【52】**This substance has the potential to be hazardous. These impacts are listed below if exposure to it can have immediate and long-term adverse health effects.**\n\n【53】**Short-term consequences**\n\n【54】**Dizziness， headaches， tremors， disorientation， and unconsciousness are short-term side effects. The neurological system can be impacted by benzene inhalation at significant concentrations. High doses of Benzene can make you throw up， make your stomach hurt， make you sleepy， and make your heart beat quickly. However，**\n\n【55】**eating or breathing very high levels of Benzene can be fatal. Benzene usuallyirritates the skin， eyes，and throat when exposed to it. Redness on the skin might happen after exposure to Benzene.**\n\n【56】**Long-term consequences**\n\n【57】**The soft inside of bones， called the bone marrow， is where new blood cells are primarily harmed by exposure to Benzene. One possible outcome is anemia (which can cause a person to feel weak and tired.) Low platelet count 2. (Which can lead to excess bruising and bleeding). 3. Alow white blood cell count， potentially fatal， might make the body less able to fight infections.**\n\n【58】**Carcinogenicity of benzene**\n\n【59】**International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC)： Benzene is carcinogenic. It belongs to the WHO. Based on adequate evidence that Benzene causes Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)， Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia (ALL)， Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia(CLL)， and multiple myeloma， the IARC has classified Benzene as carcinogenic to humans.**\n\n【60】The National Toxicology Program (NTP) has also designated Benzene as a substance known to cause human cancer.\n\n【61】**The Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS)， a database with information on the effects of exposure to numerous environmental contaminants on human health， is maintainedby thLeeUS Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The EPA lists Benzene as a recognized human carcinogen \\[20\\].**\n\n【62】**Conclusion**\n\n【63】**The authors concluded by stating that all of these natural gas exposures have a negative impact on human health and， in some situations， result in fatalities. These chemical compounds were released into indoor air due to cigarette smoking and emissions from various home items. They are highly significant chemicals utilized in manufacturing a wide range of polymers， copolymers， and glass-reinforced plastics. There is also a chance of being exposed to small amounts of food. Many people were sick， and some died due to the toxic gas leak that occurred in Bhopal and Vizag. It might spread across the natural world and contaminate the air， water， animals，and even people. Therefore， we should take care of our future and defend ourselves against such risks of tragedies.**\n\n【64】**References**\n\n【65】**1\\. Blake PG， Ijadi-Maghsoodi S.

AIHA is a severe hematological manifestation ofCMV infection. AIHA is an erythrocyte (RBC) hematologic disorder that is rarely seen in infants and young children. Most cases are associated with viral or bacterial infection， but the immunologic events leading to hemolysis are poorly understood. We report two cases of infants who presented with severe anemia and CMV infection. The first infant had chronic refractory mixed AIHA and the second infant had anemia directly attributable to CMV infection.**\n\n【13】**Introduction**\n\n【14】**Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection presenting as severe anemia in infancy is rare. Auto-Immune Hemolytic Anemia (AIHA) is characterized by the presence of auto antibodies that bind to RBC membranes and lead to their premature destruction. It can be classified as primary or secondary AIHA. The latter is due to lymphoproliferative and autoimmune diseases， drugs， and severe injuries. Bacteria and viruses can be associated with AIHA in children \\[1，2\\]. Amongst its various hematological manifestations， Cytomegalovirus (CMV) can cause transient neutropenia with thrombocytopenia or more severe， such as AIHA and pancytopenia. We report two cases of infants who presented with severe anemia， thrombocytopenia， and CMV infection. The first infant had chronic refractory mixed AIHA and the second infant had severe anemia and thrombocytopenia directly attributable to CMV infection.**\n\n【15】**Case Series**\n\n【16】**Case 1**\n\n【17】**_Citation：_**\n\n【18】**A six-month-old male child born out of third-degree consanguineous marriage presented with new onset progressive paleness of the body and worsening respiratory difficulty in the last 20 days. He received 7 aliquots of packed RBC every 2 to 3 days in the past 20 days and was started on syrup prednisolone at 2 mg/kg/day with no response. His physical examination was remarkable for severe tachypnea (54/min)， tachycardia (166/min)， pallor， icterus with moderate hepatosplenomegaly. CBC at admission showed severe anemia with thrombocytopenia with a hemoglobin of 3.1 g/dl with a platelet count of 43，000/uL. The corrected total leukocyte count was 18，600/uL with 30%neutrophils， 68% lymphocytes， and 2% myelocytes and metamyelocytes each. Peripheral smear showed numerous spherocytes with reticulocytosis of 23%. There was indirect hyperbilirubinemia， LDH was 2150 U/L and Direct Coombs Test (DCT) was strongly positive (4+). DCT positivity was due to IgG (titer ≥ 1000) of subclasses IgG1 (titer >100) & IgG3 (titer >100) coating the red cells along with C3d， a very weak coating with IgM was also seen. A diagnosis of AIHA was made. Serologic and virologic testing revealed CMV IgM and CMV IgG positive. CMV PCR blood and urine showed 200 copies and 2120 copies， respectively. Flow cytometry for double negative TCRaB+T cells was negative.**\n\n【19】**He was started on intravenous ganciclovir (dose calculated as 3 x BSAx Creatinine clearance) daily for 10 days. He also received IVIg at 1g/kg daily for 2 doses with methylprednisolone at 2 mg/kg for 3 days followed byprednisone at 2 mg/kg for 2 weeks followed by a slow taper of 0.25 mg/kg/week. At discharge he was shifted to Valganciclovir. His hemolysis continued with persistent requirement of blood transfusion. He had a poor response to steroids and was started on weekly rituximab at375 mg/m. Peripheral blood PCR for CMV DNA came negative after 3 weeks of valganciclovir. His hemoglobin stabilized at 10.8 g/dl， platelet count normalized， LDH was 568 U/， and bilirubin was**\n\n【20】**0.8 mg/dl after 3 weeks of rituximab.Steroids were slowlytapered and stopped as he was in complete remission. He relapsed after 2 months of stopping steroids and 6 months after rituximab therapy. He was restarted on steroids followed by mycophenolate mofetil at a dose of400 mg/m’as the steroid sparing agent. He started responding within1 month and the steroids were tapered slowly and stopped. At his last visit to the OPD in June 2021，he was 1 year and 8 months of age， his parameters were- hemoglobin 14 g/dl， LDH 368U/L， bilirubin 0.53mg/dl.MMF is planned to be tapered slowly (Figure 1).**\n\n【21】**Case 2**\n\n【22】**A five-month-old male child was symptomatic from 2 months of age with pallor， decreased activity with decreased feeding. There was no history of fever， jaundice， or any bleeding. He had received 4 PRBC transfusions in the past 2 months. On examination he had pallor with moderate hepatosplenomegaly. Blood investigations revealed hemoglobin of 3.9 g/dl， normal total leukocyte count of 17100/uL， platelet count of 23，000/uL， and absolute reticulocyte count 45，000/uL. His serum bilirubin was 2.3 mg/dl， with indirect bilirubin 1.3 mg/dl， LDH was 590 U/L. DCT was negative. A bone marrow biopsy was done and revealed marked erythroid hyperplasia with unremarkable megakaryocytes and myeloid cells.**\n\n【23】**Presence of anemia with hepatosplenomegaly with hepatitis with marked erythroid hyperplasia in bone marrow， differential of thalassemia； CDA and infection related (TORCH) was kept. TORCH profile was positive for CMV IgM and IgG antibodies. CMV PCR revealed 2130 copies/uL. A diagnosis of CMV infection causing recurrent anemia was made. He was started on ganciclovir and received it for 18 days. He became transfusion independent and his liver and spleen regressed on ganciclovir.**\n\n【24】**Discussion**\n\n【25】**In this case series， we report two infants both with CMV infection with severe anemia， thrombocytopenia， and moderate hepatosplenomegaly. The cause of anemia in case 1 was mixed autoimmune hemolytic anemia and on the other hand， the cause of**\n\n【26】**anemia in case 2 was attributed directly to CMV infection. In both these cases， thrombocytopenia improved with treatment of CMV infection. The mixed AIHA in case 1 was steroid refractory and required rituximab as secondarytreatment， further during the course， relapsed and required steroid sparing immunosuppressive therapy(mycophenolate mofetil). We would be discussing case 1 in detail.**\n\n【27】**Heisel et al. \\[1\\] evaluated prognostic factors in childhood AIHA and concluded that there are two distinct varieties of AIHA in children， the acute disease generally occurred in 2 to 12 years of age， had a sudden onset of symptoms， showed low reticulocyte counts and had normal platelet counts. This acute disease variety responded well to steroids and the disease resolved within 6 months without mortality. On the other hand， children with chronic AIHA were generally less than 2 or greater than 12 years of age， had a more prolonged onset of symptoms， had increased reticulocyte counts， and had decreased platelet counts. These children with the chronic variety had a variable response to steroids， frequently requiring other modalities of treatment and had a mortality of 25%. It also seems to be the scenario as in case number 1，he had a poor response to steroids and relapsed 6 months after Rituximab， warranting maintenance of second line steroid sparing immunosuppressive therapy.**\n\n【28】**Literature was reviewed regarding CMV as the cause of AIHA in children. In the largest series of pediatric AIHA patients， Aladjidi et al. \\[3\\]， we evaluated 265 children with AIHA and reported 6 patients with Cytomegalovirus as the causative agent for AIHA. Naithani et al. \\[4\\]， reported 26 patients (range， 0.2 to 17 years) with AIHA. Secondary AIHA was seen in 9 (35%)patients， with only 1 patient with CMV as the etiology. Thatikonda et al. \\[5\\]， in their study evaluating50 childhood AIHA patients， CMV was the causative etiology in 1patient only. In a study by Fan et al. \\[6\\]，7 patients out of 68 cases were EBV/CMV positive. Few case reports of CMV with AIHA are reported \\[7，8\\]. All these studies suggest that CMV is a rare cause of AIHA in children. Comparing with adults， Rafailidis et al. \\[9\\]， we performed a systematic review of 290 immunocompetent patients with severe CMV infection， 25 patients were found to have various**\n\n【29】**hematological manifestations among them only five were found to have hemolytic anemia， so AIHA secondary to CMV infection is a rare event in adults.**\n\n【30】**Efficacy of Rituximab in steroid refractory AIHA in children has been reported in small case series. Zecca et al. \\[10\\]， reported data of fifteen children (range， 0.3 to 14 years) with AIHA who were given rituximab， 375 mg/m²/dose for a median of 3 weekly doses. Three responders relapsed at 7， 8 and 10 months after rituximab infusion. Quartier et al. \\[11\\] reported five children with refractory idiopathic AIHA who received rituximab. All children remained in complete remission for 15 to 22 months after receiving rituximab. In adult patients， the median duration of response after Rituximab is 20 months. In our case number 1， the infant started responding to rituximab after the 3 weekly dose but relapsed after 6 months. Rituximab use is associated with absence of circulating B cells and hypogammaglobulinemia，which have implications for vaccineefficacy especially in infants. Ideally inactivated vaccines should be completed at least 1 week prior， and any live-attenuated vaccines should be completed a minimum of 4 weeks prior to commencing treatment. Due to lack of immune cell function， all future immunizations should be withheld whilst on rituximab. Post the completion of rituximab therapy， immunoglobulin and B-cell levels should be checked every 3months. Once both levels have returned to normal AND 26 months post treatment has lapsed (whichever is later)， immunization with both inactivated and live-attenuated vaccines can recommence \\[12\\].**\n\n【31】**According to the guidelinesfromAIEOP for second-linetreatment nwarm AIHA pediatric patients \\[13\\]， second-line treatment options for steroid dependence on a dose of prednisone ≥ 0.1 mg/kg/day to 0.2 mg/kg/day， include rituximab， immunosuppressive drugs， splenectomy， alemtuzumab and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Immunosuppressive drugs， with the exception of cyclophosphamide， are an appropriate second-line treatment， as they can be used as steroid-protective drugs in steroid-dependent patients. Given that these drugs require a long time to elicit a response， in fact， they should be infused early with the help of powerful drugs， such as steroids. Mycophenolate mofetil， a potent inhibitor of the enzyme containing 5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase， is the most widely indicated in steroid-dependent patients to reduce the dose of steroids. Panigrahi et al. \\[14\\] reported in 3 pediatric AIHA patients that MMF appears to be an effective and well-tolerated adjunct immunosuppressant that allows for rapid weaning of steroid usage， minimal adverse side effects to the patients， and long-term stabilization ofcounts. Therefore，this novel combination therapy may be an excellent alternative for the treatment of persistent or chronic autoimmune cytopenia's in the pediatric population. In our patient， MMF with steroids was started and the patient achieved complete response on MMF and steroids could be tapered. He tolerated MMF and had no side effects and remains in complete remission.**\n\n【32】**Conclusion**\n\n【33】**CMV infection should be considered when evaluating patients with severe anemia and thrombocytopenia. AIHA may be primary or secondary to other diseases， including infections， autoimmune**\n\n【34】**disorders， and malignancies. The mixed AIHA in our case was secondary to CMV infection. It was steroid refractory and relapsed after 6 months of rituximab therapy and received MMF as the steroid sparing immunosuppressive therapy. The patient had no side effects to MMF. MMF may be an excellent alternative for the treatment of chronic AIHA in pediatric patients. Vaccination should be carefully planned in children， especially infants receiving rituximab.**\n\n【35】**References**\n\n【36】1\\. Heisel MA， Ortega JA.

Majority of case reports on brain abscess either as a complication of stroke， or as a stroke mimic are in adults. Here， we present a case of a brain abscess in a child who presented with stroke.**\n\n【13】**Case Presentation**\n\n【14】**We report the case of a 12-year old boy who was admitted to our institution for sudden onset of right-sided weakness. Four days prior to admission he started to have low to moderate grade intermittent fever associated with occasional non-paroxysmal unproductive cough. He was prescribed with Clarithromycin， antihistamine， and B2-agonist medications， with resolution of symptoms. The fever recurred 1 day prior to admission associated with 2 episodes of non projectile vomiting of previously ingested food， and a throbbing frontal mild to moderate headache. About12 h prior to admission， the patient could no longer move his right upper and lower extremities， prompting transport to the hospital where he had an episode of generalized tonic clonic seizures lasting for 10 sec.**\n\n【15】**The past medical history revealed that the patient had a bout of fever and cough about 3 weeks prior to admission， for which he was prescribed Amoxicillin-clavulanic and Salbutamol， with subsequent improvement.**\n\n【16】**In the emergency room， the patient was examined conscious， coherent， oriented to 3 spheres， verbal but unable to move his right upper and lower extremities， and febrile at 38.6C. The systemic physical examination findings were generally normal. However， the neurologicexamination revealed a flattened right nasolabial fold， inability to lift his right shoulder， and deviation of the tongue to the right on protrusion. There was 0/5 motor strength of the right upper and lower extremities. Babinski sign present at the right. Hyporeflexia was noted on the right upper and lower extremities.**\n\n【17】**The patient was initially admitted as childhood stroke， and was worked up along this impression. There was neutrophilia seen in the complete blood count. This， together with the fever prompted administration of antibiotics. Hyponatremia at 127.5 mEq/L was seen. The prothrombin time was prolonged with an activity of 57.4% while the activated partial thromboplastin time was normal. The lipid profile showed low High Density Lipoproteins (HDL). The urinalysis was normal. The chest radiograph and the 2-dimensional echocardiography were normal.**\n\n【18】**The initial non-contrast cranial CT scan only showed focal brain atropy at the right frontallobe area without any sign of hemorrhage or infarction (Figure 1).**\n\n【19】**The fever resolved on the third day of hospitalization while on the antibiotics， but the motor deficits did not improve. Physical therapy was started.**\n\n【20】**By the sixth day of hospitalization， the patient’s motor strength on the right upper and lower extremity was seen to be 2/5， which further improved to 3/5 the next day. Rehabilitation therapy and the antibiotics were continued.**\n\n【21】**The patient's condition was progressively improving， when on the 17 hospital day there was note of sudden regression of the motor strength of the affected side to 0/5. Anisocoria was also noted. A re-stroke was considered so a repeat non contrast brain CT scan was performed； this time， multiple defined masses on the left frontal lobe were seen with vasogenic edema and mass effect， consistent with a brain abscess (Figure 2).**\n\n【22】**_cited._**\n\n【23】**A neurosurgery referral was made， and a contrast-enhanced brain CT scan was preceded，**\n\n【24】**Figure 1： The initial non-contrast cranial CT scan only showed focal brain atropy at the right frontal lobe area without any sign of hemorrhage or infarction.**\n\n【25】**Figure 2： A repeat non contrast brain CT scan was performed； this time， multiple defined masses on the left frontal labe were seen with vasogenic edema and mass effect， consistent with a brain abscess.**\n\n【26】**Figure 3： A contrast-enhanced brain CT scan was preceded， revealing multiple enhancing complex masses， with subfalcine herniation to the right.**\n\n【27】**revealing multiple enhancing complex masses， with subfalcine herniation to the right (Figure3). Medical and surgical decompression was done. Antibiotics were shifted to Metronidazole， Amikacin， and Meropenem per brain abscess guidelines. Post-operatively， the patient's pupils became isocoric； the motor strength in the right lower extremity was 1/5 while the motor strength in the right upper extremity was 0/5.**\n\n【28】**With the medications and rehabilitation， his condition gradually improved. By the 8h post-op day， he was already able to gain full motor strength in the right leg while the right arm strength improved**\n\n【29】**Figure 4： A repeat contrast-enhanced cranial CT scan done on the 37hh haspital day showed interval enlargement of the rim-enhancing fluid density in the left frantal labe， surraunding vasogenic edema and expansile effect， right subfalcine herniation and left frontal craniotomy defect.**\n\n【30】**W13D L：43**\n\n【31】**Figure 5： A repeat cranial CT scan on the 42d hospital day showed interval decrease in size of rim-enhancing fluid density in the left frontal lobe and interval decrease in rightward subfalcine herniation， still with vasagenic edema.**\n\n【32】**to 2/5.**\n\n【33】**A repeat contrast-enhanced cranial CT scan done on the 37hospital day showed interval enlargement of the rim-enhancing fluid density in the left frontal lobe， surrounding vasogenic edema and expansile effect， right subfalcine herniation and left frontal craniotomy defect (Figure 4).**\n\n【34】**Aspiration of the abscess was performed. Culture of the abscess fluid did not yield any growth. Antibiotics were continued.**\n\n【35】**A repeat cranial CT scan on the 42n hospital day showed interval decrease in size of rim-enhancing fluid density in the left frontal lobe and interval decrease in rightward subfalcine herniation， still with vasogenic edema. Medications were continued and further clinical improvement was noted (Figure 5).**\n\n【36】**Patient was discharged on the 45h hospital day already isocoric， with full strength in both lower extremities and left upper extremity， and residual weakness in the right upper extremity.**\n\n【37】**Discussion**\n\n【38】**Childhood stroke is defined similarly as adult stroke： an acute onset neurological sign or symptom attributable to a focal brain infarction or hemorrhage \\[1，2\\]. Just like in adults， childhood stroke can be divided into hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke.**\n\n【39】**Hemorrhagic stroke may be intra parenchymal or spontaneous non traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage. Focal brain damage results from hemorrhage through localized mass effect and ischemia of adjacent tissues. Cerebral infarction or ischemic stroke may result from Arterial Ischemic Stroke (AIS)， venous infarction， or Cerebral Sinovenous Thrombosis (CSVT). Focal brain damage from ischemic stroke results when there is a loss of blood flow or oxygenation to an area of brain tissue \\[3\\].**\n\n【40】**Stroke in children is reported to be common. It affects 1 in 1，600to 4，000 neonates \\[3，4\\]， and 2.3 to 13 per 100，000 older children annually \\[5-7\\]. Hemorrhagic stroke accounts for 50% of pediatric stroke， with an annual incidence of approximately 1 to 1.7 in 100，000children \\[6，8\\]. The remaining 50% of pediatric stroke is accounted for by ischemic stroke， with a slightly higher annual incidence of 1 to 2 per100，000 children in developed countries \\[8，9\\]. In the Philippines， the registry of childhood diseases of the Philippine Pediatric Society， Inc.， shows that there is a total of 701 reported cases of stroke in children from January 1，2006 to December 315，2019\\[10\\]. In a country with roughly 42，311，222 children \\[11\\]，the annual incidence rate of stroke is approximately 0.12 per 100，000 Filipino children. This number is much lower than that was reported for developed Western countries. However， this may not be a true reflection of the incidence of stroke among Filipino children as the PPS registry collects data only from their accredited training hospitals.**\n\n【41】**The most common symptoms of acute stroke in children are similar to those in adults. These include hemiparesis and hemi facial weakness (67% to 90%)， speech or language disturbance (20% to50%)， vision disturbance (10% to 15%)， and ataxia (8% to 10%).Non-localizing symptoms like headache and altered mental status may also be present. Seizures manifest in 15% to 25% of children with stroke\\[12-15\\]. Seizure serves as a sentinel sign of acute stroke in children， occurring in 31% to 46% of younger children with stroke \\[3\\]. Our patient presented with headache， vomiting， right-sided hemiparesis， and seizures. Clearly， our patient’s clinical manifestations are compatible with acute stroke.**\n\n【42】**The nature of the stroke-like manifestations of the patient on presentation was a dilemma for a time because aside from the absence of an infarcted area in the brain on the initial cranial CT scan， the search for the more common etiologies like sickle cell disease，cardiac disorders， or prothrombotic conditions were negative. A suspicion for yet undetermined infection was considered based on the presence of fever and neutrophilia in the complete blood count.**\n\n【43】**Literatures show that only approximately 50% of patients with ischemic stroke will have known risk factors predisposing to stroke at the time of diagnosis. However， after thorough evaluation， 40% of children with ischemic stroke are found to have 1 risk factor， 50%have 2 or more factors， and 10% have no identified risk factor for stroke. These risk factors include arteriopathies， cardiac disorders， infection， acute head and neck disorders， acute systemic conditions， chronic systemic conditions， prothrombic states， chronic head and neck disorders， atherosclerosis-related risk factors， and others \\[16\\].**\n\n【44】**The path physiology of the stroke in our patient was made clearer when a repeat cranial tomography showed multiple defined masses on the left frontal lobe with vasogenic edema and mass effect， which showed enhancement with contrast. This finding was compatible with brain abscess.**\n\n【45】**Brain abscess is a focal infection in the brain parenchyma**\n\n【46】**consisting of encapsulated _d_ ous andpyogenic bacteria. Less commonly， fungi， mycobacteria or protozoa cause brain abscess\\[17\\]. Brain abscesses are reportedly rare in children， but they can cause significant morbidity and mortality \\[18\\]. They occur in 0.4 per100，000 children annually but may range from 0.3 to 1.3 per 100，000children \\[19，17\\]. The registry of childhood diseases of the Philippine Pediatric Society (PPS)， Inc. shows that there are 1，206 cases of intracranial abscess over 14 years \\[10\\]. This translates to an annual incidence of 0.20 per 100，000 Filipino children. This number is lower than the reported incidence and contrasts with the report by Gaskill and Marlin \\[20\\] which said that there is a higher incidence of brain abscess in underdeveloped countries \\[20\\]. They more common in males in the first two decades of life \\[21\\]. Children 4 to 7 years old have the highest incidence of brain abscess \\[19，22\\]. The locations of abscesses in the brain， in decreasing frequency， are frontotemporal， frontoparietal，parietal，cerebellar， and occipital areas \\[23\\].**\n\n【47】**Eighty percent of children with brain abscess have predisposing factors while 20% of cases are cryptogenic \\[17\\]. Among children with predisposing factors， 30% to 50% result from contiguous focus of infection like otitis media， mastoiditis， sinusitis， orbital cellulitis\\[17\\]， or dental infections \\[24\\]. Approximately 10% of cases occur in cases where the body's natural barriers are disrupted like in cases of neurosurgical procedures or head trauma \\[17，25，26\\]. Hematogenous spread associated with上bacteremia andimmunosuppressive conditions accounts for 40% of cases of brain abscess in children \\[17\\]. Direct spread of the organism from a contiguous focus of infection usually causes solitary brain abscess \\[24\\] while bacteremic spread typically causes multiple brain abscesses \\[27\\]. Based on the history and the physical exam which did not show evidence of probable contiguous foci of infection， neurosurgical procedure or head trauma， and the multiple abscess lesions seen in the cranial tomogram， the brain abscesses in our patient must have resulted from a bacteremic route. However， despite work-up， there was no underlying condition that was identified. This absence of an underlying condition or a primary site of infection has been reported in 20% to 40% of patients with brain abscess.**\n\n【48】**The signs and symptoms of brain abscess are initially nonspecific\\[28-31\\]. Headache is the most common symptom， occurring in 69%of cases. Fever occurs in 45% to 53% of patients， seizures in 25%，and focal neurologic deficits in up to 50% of children with brain abscess\\[32，33\\].Individually， each of these signs and symptoms is not a reliable basis for the diagnosis of brain abscess. Even the classic triad of fever， headache， and focal neurologic deficits that suggests brain abscess is present in only 20% of cases \\[34\\]. Thus， a high index of suspicion is recommended. Our patient presented with fever， headache， and hemiparesis. This should have alerted us to the possibility of brain abscess on admission； however， in the absence of abscess lesions on the initial cranial tomogram， the diagnosis of brain abscess was not considered on admission.**\n\n【49】**Hemiparesis in cases of brain abscess is reported to be more common in children than in adults. In a review of literatures on brain abscesses in children， the incidence ofhemiparesis ranged from19.2% to 44.06% \\[35-37\\]. This high incidence was demonstrated to result from the involvement of the eloquent areas of the brain with seeding of metastatic abscesses \\[37\\].**\n\n【50】**The question that we asked ourselves in the management of this patient was that is this a case of the brain abscess being a stroke mimic or is the brain abscess a complication of stroke. Unfortunately， there**\n\n【51】**is a dearth of literatures related to this topic in pediatrics. However， there have been reports of brain abscess as complication of stroke in adults. To date， there are 20 case reports of brain abscess after stroke that were published \\[38-57\\]. All of these are reported in adults. The abscess is reported to develop 12 days to 14 months after the stroke incident \\[58，59\\]. Our patient was diagnosed with brain abscess 17days after the stroke.**\n\n【52】**The pathogenesis of brain abscess after a stroke involves the disruption and loss of integrity of the blood brain barrier around the ischemic area \\[43\\]， making it vulnerable to microbial seeding when bacteremia occurs during a systemic infection \\[38\\].**\n\n【53】**However， brain abscess as a complication of the ischemic stroke could not be explained by the afebrile state of our patient at the time of or immediately before the diagnosis of brain abscess was made. This made us consider an alternative scenario where the developing brain abscess acted as a stroke mimic.**\n\n【54】**There have also been reports of brain abscesses as stroke mimics\\[60-70\\].Unfortunately again all these reports are in adults. The exact mechanism how a brain abscess presents with stroke-like symptoms is still unclear. One hypothesis is the development of paroxysmal septic emboli that causes embolic infarction which becomes the nidus for the abscess formation \\[61\\]. However， the septic work-up in our patient did not reveal any focus of infection that could have thrown a septic embolus to the brain. The authors hypothesize that the stroke-like manifestations in our patient， not accompanied by an apparent infarct in the cranial tomogram， may be due to the cerebritis stage of abscess formation and its accompanying inflammatory vasculitis or in-situ thrombus formation， and that the brain abscess in our patient could have been cryptogenic in nature. It has been reported that the cranial tomography of the brain may be negative or may show only subtle nonspecific findings during the early stages of evolution of a brain abscess \\[71\\]. It could have been better if a magnetic resonance imaging of the brain was done as it is the preferred imaging method in the initial examination. Sadly， our institution lacks this technology for now.**\n\n【55】**The most important lesson that this patient taught us， regardless of whether the brain abscess is a complication of a stroke or is a stroke mimic， is that a high index of suspicion for the possibility of a brain abscess in a patient with stroke-like manifestations is quite necessary for early diagnosis and treatment to prevent significant morbidity and mortality.**\n\n【56】**References**\n\n【57】**1\\.

Unusually， in our patient the metastatic calcification with Metastatic Pulmonary Calcification (MCP)， vascular calcification， soft tissue calcification surrounding large joint and calcific uremic arteriolopathy. He underwent parathyroidectomy for secondary hyperparathyroidism. Five months after surgery a rapid regression of MCP and soft tissue calcification was observed， but calcific uremic arteriolopathy keep progressive development.**\n\n【12】**Case Presentation**\n\n【13】**A 43-year-old man with uremia due to glomerulonephritis， receiving hemodialysis since 2010， three times per week， four hours per time， was presented with ulcer of left heel for 1 month. He found a swelling over the right shoulder joint in early 2011. The swelling was mobile and soft， and grew rapidly from 2 cm to 10 cm in five months， but he had neither pain nor skin changes. There was no special treatment or regular examination of serum calcium， phosphorus and intact Parathyroid Hormone (iPTH). Over the next two years， another swelling developed over the left elbow joint similar to the ones described for the right shoulder joint. He hospitalized for lumbosacral area and bower limbs pain in July 2016. Blood tests revealed： (iPTH) 2156.5 pg/ml (<72 pg/ml). Computed Tomography (CT) scans showed bilateral， diffuse， centrilobular， ground-glass opacities areas distributed in the upper lobes (Figure 1). He was diagnosed with uremic renal osteopathy and uremic pulmonary metastatic calcification. There was no significant decrease in iPTH level after treatment with calcimimetics for 2 months. The lumbosacral area and bower limbs pain still progresses. He was difficulty in walking by the end of 2017. One yearlater， the patient returned to our hospital with the complaint of severe pain in left heel. In the past eight years， his height has been shortened by 6cm and his weight has dropped by 20kg.**\n\n【14】**Physical examination on admission showed： Emaciated form， a blood pressure of BP 144/96mmHg， a pulse rate of 90/min， a body temperature of 36.5℃ and a respiratory rate of 28/min. Two irregular， hard masses were found around right shoulder joint and left elbow joint. Joint range of**\n\n【15】**Figure 1： Computed tomography of the lungs in 2016.

Tender and necrotic indurated plaques with surrounding erythema were noted on his left heel(Figure 2).**\n\n【20】**Blood tests revealed： Calcium 2.27 (2.02-2.57) mg/dl，phosphorus of 2.53 (0.6-1.6) mg/dl， and iPTH levels up to 2580.5 pg/ml. Parathyroid scintigraphywas performed 15 min and 2 h after injection of Tc99m MIBI. The Tc-99 MIBI scintigraphy demonstrated a focus of intense uptake in the upper pole of the right lobe， lower and upper pole of left lobe on the early and late images. CT scans show multiple， centrilobular， calcified nodules through-out both lungs (Figure 3A，3B). The nodules were predominant in the upper and mid lung zones which was worse than 2016. Severe vascular calcification of thoracic and lower limb (Figure 4)， multilobulated calcified masses around the right shoulder joint were found at the same time (Figure 5). X-ray of the knee joint showed stripe shaped calcification of lower extremity vessels (Figure 6A，6B).**\n\n【21】**Total parathyroidectomy was performed in October 2018. Five parathyroid glands were excised (Figure 7). The pathological results**\n\n【22】**Figure 5： Computed tomography of the lungs before operation in 2018.

The pain of lumbosacral and lower limbs was significantly relieved the second day after operation， but the pain on heel ulcer was not relieved. The patient was re-checked5 months after operation to evaluate the amelioration of metastatic calcification. CT scans revealed reduced metastatic pulmonary calcification (Figure 8A， 8B). Peri-articular soft-tissue calcifications ofthe right shoulder were barely visible (Figure 9). X-ray of knee joint showed have no change (Figure 10A， 10B). calciphylaxis on his left heel got worsen (Figure 11).**\n\n【26】**Discussion**\n\n【27】**With the advent of hemodialysis technology， the incidence of secondary hyperparathyroidism is rapidly increasing and metastatic calcification has become prominent. Metastatic calcification refers to the deposition of calcium in normal tissue， that is commonly**\n\n【28】**Figure 8： Follow-up computed tomography examinations. Axial (A) and coronal (B) computed tomography of lungs shows metastatic pulmonary calcification were remarkable absorption on image after five months operation in 2018.**\n\n【29】**Figure 9： Follow-up computed tomography examinations. soft-tissue calcifications of the right shoulder were barely visible.**\n\n【30】**Figure 10： X-ray of the both knees before and after parathyroidectomy at 6months. (A) and right knee joint (B) at 6 months after operation showed no significant changes compared with thase befare aperation.**\n\n【31】**associated with secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients on maintenance hemodialysis. Regions most commonly involved by this pathology are subcutaneous tissue， soft tissues of periarticular， vascular wall， internal organs \\[1\\]. In the presented case， a middle-aged patient suffered from multiple metastatic calcification due to secondary hyperparathyroidism. The biggest differences of our patient are the widespread metastatic calcification with pulmonary metastases， vascular calcification， soft tissue calcification surrounding large joint and calcific uremic arteriolopathy. To our knowledge， no similar researches have been reported in the past.**\n\n【32】**The diagnosis of secondary hyperparathyroidism is mainly depending on the history of chronic renal failure and elevated PTH levels， hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia were also observed.**\n\n【33】**Figure 11： The lesion progressed significantly after five months of parathyroidectomy.**\n\n【34】**Visceral calcinosis can affect lung， stomach， heart， pancreas， and kidneys， but lung is the most vulnerable organ \\[2\\]. The pathological characteristics of Metastatic Pulmonary Calcification (MPC) is calcium salt deposition in basement membranes ofthe epithelium and endothelium of pulmonaryalveoli \\[3\\]. The main pathogenesis of MPC has not yet been illustrated， but some factors， such as hypercalcemia and hyperphosphatemia， dialysis-associated intermittent acid-base imbalance， and local secretion of free hydrogen ions in the lungs， kidneys， and stomach have been suggested as the risk factors for MPC formation \\[4\\]. The diagnostic rate of MPC is very low， but histological changes of MPC are seen at autopsy in 60% to 75% of maintenance hemodialysis patients \\[5\\]. This may probably due to insufficient sensitivity of chest X-ray examination， poorly understood about the imaging manifestations of MPC among clinicians， and the benign clinical course of the disease.**\n\n【35】**Chest radiographs are not very sensitive in the detection of MPC， especially in early stage of disease (small calcifications)， and are usually show patchy or confluent airspace opacities or normal. CT has high sensitivity in an early detection of MPC. A chest CT scan of metastatic pulmonary calcification reveals of bilateral， diffuse， centrilobular， ground-glass nodular opacities and partially calcified nodules or consolidations， predominantly in the upper lung fields， is the most common finding on \\[5，6\\]. Calcium preferentially deposits in relatively alkaline tissues. The upperlung fields have high Ventilation/Perfusion (V/Q) ratio， creating high oxygen and low carbon dioxide levels.**\n\n【36】**The high V/Q ratio results in decreased PaCO， and increased pH \\[4\\]. Therefore， it had nothing strange that the lung apex is more commonly involved than the lung base. In our case showed symmetrical， multiple， centrilobular areas of ground-glass opacity throughout both upper lung area in 2016. Preoperative CT scan showed more calcareous were deposited in upper lung zones， but not in lung base，which was in accordance with the characteristics of MPC imaging changes. In addition， radionuclide imaging is another useful technique in finding out the early MPC， demonstrating generally symmetrical and increased radioactive isotope uptake in affected lung fields \\[7\\]. The pathological examination is the diagnostical golden standard for metastatic pulmonary calcification. However， it is largely limited in clinical applications since it is an invasive procedure.**\n\n【37】**MPC is a benign lesion， it generally slows progression in a long time， but it can also deteriorate rapidly within several weeks or months\\[8\\]. Most patients with MPC are asymptomatic， but several cases of hemoptysis， cough， dyspnea have been reported \\[2，9\\]. In our case， diffuse， patchy high-density shadows were found in both upper lungs**\n\n【38】**in 2016. The imaging changes of MPC were obviously aggravated in 2018 before operation， but throughout， the patient have no any respiratory symptoms. Preoperative pulmonary function test mainly shows mild restrictive ventilatory dysfunction. The pathological changes were absorbed gradually after five months of operation.**\n\n【39】**So far， the best treatment of MPC has not been established. The mainstayoftreatmentisnormalizationofphosphate and calciumlevels， primarily with phosphate binders. Another means is too applicate of active vitamin D to control secondary hyperparathyroidism on the basis of maintaining normal calcium-phosphorus product \\[10\\]. Most of these patients with asymptomatic， non-progressive MPC do not need to intervention since these patients eventually died of other causes instead of MPC. Cases have been reported that MPC can be fully absorbed after parathyroidectomy \\[11，12\\]. More research’s need to be done to see whether renal transplant is good for MPC\\[13\\]. In this case， the patient has no any respiratory symptoms， however， besides MPC， the patient had multiple periarticular metastatic calcifications， severe systemic vascular calcification， bone deformation，bone pain and calciphylaxis of the heel at the same time. Therefore， he underwent total parathyroidectomy. Five months after surgery a rapid regression of MCP was observed.**\n\n【40】**Soft tissue calcifications are another common manifestation of secondary hyperparathyroidism， characterized by large calcium phosphate deposition into cutaneous and subcutaneous tissues. Depositing of calcium salt in periarticular soft tissue region on patients of maintenance hemodialysis for chronic renal failure call Uremic Tumoral Calcinosis (UTC). Its estimated incidence is between 0.5% and 7% of hemodialysis patients \\[14\\]. It usually presents with benign nodules at periarticular sites， mainly manifests as firm， painless， lobular， tumor-like masses around the joints that can lead to limitation of movement of joint when large in size. The key feature is absence of erosion and destruction of nearby bone， and such lesions is reversible after medication or parathyroidectomy \\[15\\]. The sites commonly affected are soft tissues of periarticular shoulder， elbow， hip regions \\[16\\]， other areas such as wrist \\[17\\]， spine \\[18\\]， and knee have been observed \\[19\\]. Our patient had extensive involvement of the shoulder and elbow； findings were consistent with metastatic calcinosis cut is secondary to TC. Why does it preferentially occur around joints? The exact mechanism behind this clinical entity is unknown. It may be related to the pH value of joint fluid， like the pathogenesis of gout. However， there have been no related experimental investigations published on this subject. In the natural course of such lesions is usually slow and progressive over several years \\[12\\]. Sometimes， too much tumoral masses leads to ulceration with superadded secondary infection. In this case， five months after surgery， a rapid complete absorption of the tumoral masses around the right shoulder and left were observed.**\n\n【41】**Additionally， this case also showed calcification in vessels along chest and limbs. There was no improvement in systemic vascular calcification， instead an aggravation of calcific uremic arteriolopathy on his left heel was observed. These results consistent with the previous reports \\[19，20\\]， indicating that once calcification develops it probably cannot be reversed and tends to become more severe as time passes.**\n\n【42】**Overall， we report this case for the purpose of expanding the clinical and treatment of multiple metastatic calcifications in patient with SHPTH. MPC associated with uremia is potentially reversible， and can resolve after parathyroidectomy， but vascular calcification**\n\n【43】**cannot be reversed and tends to deteriorate as time passes.**\n\n【44】**References**\n\n【45】**1\\.

The reduction oflearning load through instruction is accurate because it must revalue knowledge based on meaningful experience， where the student develops attitude and skill. Where multiple analyses can be generated with respect to what is presented in the clinical case. In other words， between the teacher and the student， educational action is developed through experience translated into the assimilation of knowledge. The exercise carried out by an undergraduate student through the clinical case brings them closer to reality and prepares them to deal with problems through their competences.**\n\n【23】**Case Presentation**\n\n【24】**Male patient aged 21 years， ASA II， with no personal history of morbidities， no surgical history， with a family history of morbid hypertension. A moderate smoker， he came for assessment due to spontaneous consultation， with the reason for consultation \"I have a tooth on the side of my teeth， at the bottom\". Data collected： The last visit to the dentist was in 2019 for extraction of a supernumerary tooth without complications. The patient had poor dental hygiene， with an unspecified brushing technique， no flossing， a diet high in carbohydrates， sugars and soft drinks.**\n\n【25】**With regard to the dental history， we can highlight the extraction of another supernumerary tooth at tooth level 4.4 on the lingual side， bleeding on brushing and bruxism.**\n\n【26】**Within the segmental examination， a variation in the trajectory of mandibular movement was observed， with corrected deviation to the right and a unilateral left click noise， without pain on palpation or movement. As for lymph node palpation， only the submandibular nodes were palpable， unilateraly， on the right side， less than 1 cm， with a soft， mobile consistency and the presence of discomfort to the touch. The rest of the nodes were not palpable.**\n\n【27】**With regard to the dental anomaly of the patient， who presented a rudimentary paramolar supernumerary tooth； of a smaller size， molariform and located in the mandibular region， on the lingual side in the area of the premolar teeth， we can highlight the importance and responsibility we have as dentists to recognize and detect pathologies in our patients.

There is reported significant negative association of semen volume， total sperm count， sperm motility， and morphology with advanced male partner’s age. Therefore， combination of the sperm preparation and assisted reproductive treatment were used for a better chance of pregnancy. This study was aimed to evaluate the in fluence of age on the sperm quality and pregnancy outcome in couple with subfertility undergoing Intrauterine Insemination (IUI).**\n\n【12】**Material and Methods： This retrospective cross-sectional study in vestigating 181 cases of IUI cycles from reproductive clinic of two public universities from January 2019 to December 2020. They were categorized into study group (male partner’s age 40 years and above) and control group (male partner’s age less than 40 years old). Sperm parameter reports were extracted from the patients records. Clinical pregnancy was the criteria for the IUI success.**\n\n【13】**Results： The mean age of male and female partners were similar in both groups. Sperm parameters showed an improvement after density gradient centrifugation sperm preparation with significant results in grade 1 and grade 3 sperm motility. There was no significant different in the clinical pregnancy between the groups.**\n\n【14】**Conclusion： There is an improvement in sperm parameters after density gradient centrifugation and the male age is not significantly affect the pregnancy outcome following IUI. Further study with larger sample is needed to confirm these findings.**\n\n【15】**Keywords： Density gradient centrifugation； Insemination； Paternal age； Pregnancy outcome； Semen analysis**\n\n【16】**Introduction**\n\n【17】**Lately， the topic of male infertility has been popularly discussed. A man who failed to produce high quality sperm in terms of density， motility and morphology is considered as infertile male. There are increase rates of infertility and adverse pregnancy outcomes seen after the age of 40 years old (independent of female partner’s age)， thus the male age factor might have some contribution to this matter， even though the spermatogenesis known to continue in elderly men， in contrast to oogenesis \\[1\\]. From the literature， contribution to conception by male partner is still occur ev after 40 years of sexual maturity \\[2\\]. But， degenerative changes in germinal epithelium occur with aging， causing Leydig cells to reduce in quantity and its function， thus affecting the spermatogenesis process due to decrease testosterone level， in which it starts at 30 years ofage \\[1，3，4\\]. Studies suggest that male partner's age is associated with diminished semen volume， sperm motility and/or sperm morphology. Increasing seminal ROS levels and changes in epididymal and accessory sex gland function may be possible causative factors for the decline in motility with aging. Emergence idea of intrauterine insemination with sperm preparation has shown some improvement in semen parameters but with conflicting data. In this respect， our objective is to established evidence on influence of age on the sperm quality and effect of density gradient centrifugation on pregnancy outcome in infertile couple undergoing Intrauterine Insemination (IUI).**\n\n【18】**This was a retrospective cross-sectional study involving two university hospitals in Malaysia**\n\n【19】**with fertility services. Completed one hundred and eighty-one IUI cycles from January 1， 2019 to December 31， 2020 were included in this study.**\n\n【20】**Couples who underwent IUI during the study period were enrolled in this study. Only the first IUI cycle of the couples were included in the study.**\n\n【21】**The inclusion criteria were as follow： Men age between 18 to 70years old， with semen analysis results either normal or one， or two of the sperm parameters were below the normal value established by the WHO \\[5\\]. The semen parameters are the sperm count， sperm motility with characterized into Grade 1 (rapid and slow linear progressive motility)， Grade 2 (non-progressive motility) and Grade 3 (immotile spermatozoa). The female partner had regular menstrual cycle， normal pelvic ultrasound findings and at least one fallopian tube patent in hysteroscopy or laparoscopy dye insufflation test.**\n\n【22】**The exclusion criteria were including men with azoospermia， femalepartnerwith endometriosis，polycystic ovarian syndrome，poor ovarian responder， or premature ovarian insufficiency. Incomplete data on pre- and post-processing semen analysis or missing data regarding the pregnancy outcome were also being excluded.**\n\n【23】**All the data such as age of the couple， duration of infertility， semen analysis parameters before and after sperm processing， and the IUI results were obtained from the patient’s records. Pregnancy was defined as positive serum beta Human Chorionic Gonadotropin(b-HCG) taken at 14 days after IUI followed by presence of the fetal heart activity after 6 weeks period of a menorrhea.**\n\n【24】**The eligible couple were stratified into two groups according to the male partner’s age - study group (male partner’s age 40 years and above) and control group (male partner's age less than 40 years old). The semen parameters and pregnancy outcome were compared between the groups.**\n\n【25】**Semen sample collection and preparation for IUI**\n\n【26】**Semen samples were collected from the male partners following2 to 5 days of sexual abstinence by masturbation in sterile plastic containers at the clinic. Liquefaction was performed at roor temperature for 30 min. The initial analysis of the semen parameters(semen volume， sperm count， and sperm motility) was performed manually according to WHO guidelines (2010) \\[5\\].**\n\n【27】**Subsequently the semen samples were processed using the density gradient centrifugation to remove seminal fluid and enhance sperm quality for IUI. The total volume of semen was divided so that a 15-ml conical tube marked with patient's identification would contain2 ml of a 90% density lower layer， 2 ml of a 45% density upper layer， and 2 ml of semen upper most layer. A gentle and careful move was required to ensure the layers were not mixed-up at each centrifugal stage. The sample was then centrifuged at 1，500 rpm for 20 min at Room Temperature (RT). After centrifugation， the supernatant was removed and the spermatozoa (pellet) was placed into another 15-ml conical tube， which contained 2.0 ml of sperm rinsing medium and mixed thoroughly； it was then centrifuged at 1，500 rpm for 10 min at room temperature. The supernatant was again removed， and the final pellet was suspended in the same medium solution， obtaining a final volume of 0.5 ml. A 10-ul aliquot was used to perform the analysis of post-processing seminal parameters. The motility of spermatozoa in the sample determined and incubated sample at 37°C until ready for insemination. The Makler counting chamber was used to assess**\n\n【28】**the count and motility and the processed sample in the best possible way. The sample was ensured to maintain its temperature at 37°Cby placing it in a test tube warmer before IUI procedure.**\n\n【29】**Ovulation induction and insemination**\n\n【30】**Standard protocol was used involving administration of 100 mg clomiphene citrate from the second day of menstruation for five days and injection of human menopausal gonadotropins (75 IU to 150IU) on day five onwards up to day ten of menstruation， either daily or every other day. When at least one follicle achieved more than 17mm， intramuscular HCG 10，000 IU was given for final maturation. Single insemination was done at thirty-six hours later with 0.5 mL to 1.0 mL of processed sperm from the fresh semen sample， injected intrauterine using a Gynetics catheter. After the insemination the patient was lying in the supine position for 15 min to 30 min. Oral dydrogesterone 10 mg three times daily was prescribed for the luteal phase support.**\n\n【31】**Statistical analysis**\n\n【32】**The Statistical Package for Social Sciences for Windows (SPSS version 22.0) was used to record and analyzed the data. Quantitative variables were compared using Mann-Whitney test and the results were expressed as mean ± Standard Deviation (SD) and percentage. Categorical variables were evaluated using the Chi-squareand Fisher's exact test. A p-value of less than 0.05 is considered as statistically significant.**\n\n【33】**Results**\n\n【34】**A total of 181 of IUI cycles， from January 15， 2019 and December31，2020， were analyzed. The mean (± Standard Deviation， SD) age of male and female partner included in this analysis were similar for each group. Majority of the indication for the IUI was unexplained infertility (Table 1).**\n\n【35】**Table 2 showed the results of sperm parameters of the two studied groups. As can be noted， there was no difference of sperm parameters among the male partner with different age groups. There was an improvement in the sperm concentration and Grade 1 sperm motility after the DGC， however not statistically significant. In the study group (male age 40 years and above)， there is significant increment in the grade 1 sperm motility and significant reduction of immotile sperm after GDC as illustrated in Table 3. Regarding the successful pregnancy， there was also no significant difference of the semen parameters between the studied group (Table 4). The number of pregnancies was higher in group of male partner less than 40years old， compared with older age male partner，however， it was not statistically significant (Table 5).**\n\n【36】**Discussion**\n\n【37】**Semen fluid analysis is the first step in the evaluation of male infertility. Semen characteristics that being evaluated includes the volume， sperm concentration， sperm motility， and sperm morphology. The standard value of semen analysis that is accepted by the World Health Organization (WHO) 2010 is the volume of1.5 mL， pH of 7.2， sperm concentration of 20 million/mL or more， total motility (progressive and non-progressive) of 40%， and normal sperm morphology of 4% \\[6\\].**\n\n【38】**There was an association between male age and sperm parameters in the literature.

In conjunction， study in Central India by classified age 36 to 42 as under the 3d group in a five-age class (21 to 60 years) that is relates with the decline in semen parameters and it is significant when the individual is after the age of 35\\[1\\]. Meanwhile， Gao et al. revealed a significant association between the increasing age and a drop in sperm quantity and quality based on 7-age groups among men aged25 to 51 \\[9\\]. The large dispersion also believed to derive this smaller**\n\n【54】**number of groupings to elucidate age as factors in differentiating the sperm counts. This study showed better sperm motility of the younger male compared to the older male who aged more than 40years old. Therefore， testing the subjects with different age level may validate the influence of age on semen parameters at certain degree of comparison.**\n\n【55】**Most of the finding showed an increase of the mean value in the count and motility. The significant difference was obtained in the study mostly in the post DGC for Grade 3 motility (immotile**\n\n【56】**sperm) suggesting positive effect of DGC on semen motility. Density gradient is the preferred technique for sperm processing for ART as it improved sperm motility and quality \\[10\\]. This study also highlighted the higher chance of pregnancy in female with the male partner who aged less than 40 years old， control group (3.3%) compared to female with male partner aged more than 40 years old. It showed that as the age of the couple grows older， the likelihood of pregnancy decreases， and most studies link aging to a drop in sperm parameters \\[11\\].**\n\n【57】**On a separate note， Dong et al. concluded that chances of pregnancy from IUI decreases as semen sample contained lower than 2 million motile sperm \\[12\\]. Thus， other studies specified that pregnancy from IUI is more probable with the existing of linear progressive motile among pairings with subfertility male with the higher likelihood of pregnancy from larger counts of post-prepared sperm with greater motility in IUI \\[13，14\\]. In addition， Ajayi et al. suggested than men with lower sperm counts had a 4 times higher likelihood to develop progressive sperm motility than men with normal sperm counts \\[15\\]. Somehow， Ombelet et al. reviewed that studies should consider association of sperm parameters with other factors that may determine the success of IUI such as female age and period of subfertility. In addition， they iterate that prediction on pregnancy rate is acceptable yet considered as poor in sensitivity as comparison made with standardized limit sperm counts classing. Perhaps this study may output to different significance if sperm counts categorized in to non-parametric groupings for comparison with the nominal measure of pregnancy status. For the time being， this study suggests that IUI has done effectively in ensuring pregnancy from samples with lower sperm counts from pre-processed total or from post-processed non-progressive spermatozoa that originates from men below 40 years old. On the other side， female may conceive offspring in relation with lower counts of motile sperm or higher counts of immotile sperm after the post wash procedures conducted for semen samples of men aged 40 and above \\[16\\].**\n\n【58】**Readings of bHCG level recorded pregnancy outcome either pregnant or not were insignificantly correlated with male age group as a result from IUI denoted from Fisher's Exact Test p-value of 0.185. This hypothesis in several manner is consistent with findings from other study with differing fertilization procedures that remarks male age as not a defining factors of pregnancy rates or outcome \\[17-20\\]. On the other hand， Tatsumi et al. described age among men does not correlate with pregnancy outcome， yet simulation from IUI revealed women at the age of 38 to 40 years old as the sole factor influencing chances of pregnancy \\[21\\].**\n\n【59】**Conclusion**\n\n【60】**In conclusion， similar semenparameters andcomparable pregnancy outcome was seen among couples with male partner's age below and above 40 years old. There was an improvement in sperm parameters after density gradient centrifugation which may involve in the achievement of pregnancy following IUI. This study is limited to sperm count and motility without analysis of morphology and sperm DNA， therefore further study with these added sperm parameters and larger sample could be considered in the future study.**\n\n【61】**Acknowledgement**\n\n【62】**The authors thank the patients of the Advanced Reproductive Centre (ARC)， Hospital Canselor Tuanku Muhriz， Kuala Lumpur who were involved in the study.**\n\n【63】**References**\n\n【64】**1\\.

Multiple Myeloma (MM) represents a malignant proliferation of plasma cells derived from a single clone. The co-occurrence of two rare malignancies CML and MM in the same patient is an extremely rare incident. We report a case of a 54 vear old female who was simultaneously detected with MM and CML. At the outset， only chemotherapy for multiple myeloma was started as bone marrow and peripheral smear were not suggestive of CML. Subsequently Dasatinib was started in view of left shift seen in peripheral smear. It was both a diagnostic dilemma due to the rarity of synchronicity of these two malignancies and a therapeutic dilemma of whether to start with Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (TKI) as both peripheral smear and bone marrow was normal.**\n\n【16】**Case Presentation**\n\n【17】**A 54-year-old female with no comorbidities， a known case of solitary plasmacytoma (with kappa restriction， CD 138 positive)，previouslytreated in July 2020 with definitive radiation therapy to the left pubic ramus. She received a dose of 50 Gy in 25 fractions from 3.6.2020 to 6.7.2020. She was on three monthly follow up since then. At the time of diagnosis， a baseline PET scan revealednoevidence of disease elsewhere， with bone marrow aspiration and biopsy were normal. Also， cytogenetic analysis by conventional karyotype was normal. In the month of June， 2021， she presented with pain in the left pubic region of three months duration. PET CT was done to evaluate disease status. It revealed a 2.8 cm x 5.6 cm lesion involving left pubic ramus and anterior acetabulum (SUV 26.1) which was 12.1 at baseline before radiation therapy. There was a cortical discontinuity with a small extra Osseous soft tissue. There was also a mention of interval development of additional small metabolically active osteolytic lesions in anterior L1 and L4 vertebra which raised the suspicion of progression to multiple myeloma. Work up for multiple myeloma was done that included bone marrow aspiration and biopsy， Serum myeloma panel \\[Serum Protein Electrophoresis (SPEP)， Serum Immunofixation (SIF) studies， Free Light Chain Assay (FLC)， beta 2 microglobulin\\] and cytogenetics. Bone marrow showed 10% plasma cells with no immature cells in myeloid lineage. SPEP showed presence of M spike in gamma region (band value： 0.52 g/dl). SIF studies showed IgG band with kappaband. Total proteins were in the range of 8.6 (normal range 6.4 g/dL to 8.2 g/dL). Ig Glevel in serum was 17.4g. Ratio of involved and uninvolved free light chains was 150 with involved kappalight chain being 465. Hence a diagnosis of Multiple myeloma was established. Routine cancer cytogenetic studies at our institute (i.e.，culture ofunstimulated bone marrow aspirate at 24h and 48h of incubation at room temperature) revealed two clones of cells- one with normal karyotype and one with t(9；22) i.e.， 46，XX，t(9；22)(q34；q11.2)\\[15\\]/46，XX\\[10\\].**\n\n【18】**A complete blood count with peripheral smear was normal with no leukocytosis with left shift or thrombocytosis or any abnormal cells. She was started on a three drug regimen (proteasome inhibitor bortezomib， lenalidomide and Dexamethasone with bisphosphonates) as per our institutional protocol for a standard risk stage III Standard risk multiple myeloma after a thorough discussion about the treatment options including transplant. However， the family refused for transplant. At this point of time， BCR ABL mutation was being considered as a part of normal**\n\n【19】**variant as marrow and peripheral smear were normal. Hence， we decided to serially monitor the peripheral smear of the patient and took a decision to not expose the patient to TKI then. She completed4 cycles of VRD (bortezomib/lenalidomide/dexona) till 20.10.21following which reassessment was done by serum myeloma panel which was suggestive of Very Good Partial Response (VGPR) as per International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria with an absent M spike， normalization of serum FLC ratio. It was decided to continue with the same chemotherapy regimen. Her peripheral smear was being serially monitored at each visit. At her visit during cycle 5-D22， her PS was suggestive of left shift with 1% blasts， 6%myelocytes， 7% metamyelocytes， 12% band forms. Now we started her on TKI (Dasatinib 100 mg once a day) after reviewing the drug interactions with other drugs being used for multiple myeloma.**\n\n【20】**Discussion**\n\n【21】**We report a case of synchronous hematological malignancies， multiple myeloma coexistent with CML. Though bone marrow was not suggestive of CML， the characteristic translocation t(9，22) was present in the cells. We further did cytogenetic analysis to rule out Philadelphia positivity as a constitutional abnormality by the PHA(Phytohemagglutinin) induced peripheral blood cell culture with 72h incubation at room temperature， which showed all cells as normal karyotype， thereby proving the existence of the t(9；22) translocation in our reference case as clonal. Following the conventional karyotype report，hybridtranscript for BCR/ABL 1 was quantified by IS MMRRT PCRassay. The ratio of BCR-ABL1/ABL 1 transcript as represented in IS scale was detected to be 5.931%.Genomic breakpoint observed was e 13a2 which corresponded to p210. Other cytogenetic abnormalities seen in multiple myeloma like IGH rearrangement， p53 del， del 13q were negative. Unfortunately on conventional cytogenetics or FISH analysis it is not possible to comment on the type of cells that are carrying specific genetic aberrations. Hence a dilemma might arise as whether they were myeloma cells or leukemic cells which were harboring BCR-ABL1 translocation. Plasma cell enrichment by cell sorting of CD-138 expressing cells in bone marrow or peripheral blood by immunomagnetic methods has been widely applied for targeted molecular cytogenetic analysis of multiple myeloma cases1-31.**\n\n【22】**The Philadelphia chromosome was originally detected by workers in Philadelphia as an abnormally short G-group chromosome in analysis of bone marrow metaphases from CML patients \\[4\\]. It is the first genetic abnormality to be associated with a human cancer. Now it’s understood through chromosome banding techniques that Philadelphia chromosome was the result of a balanced translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22， denoted t(9；22)(q34.1；q11.21)， where the derivative chromosome 222 is significantly smaller. Chromosomal abnormalities can be germline (constitutional) or acquired. Germline abnormalities could be heritable or non-heritable.t(9；22) is as either non-heritable constitutional or acquired. The Philadelphia chromosome is present in hematopoietic cells from patients with CML but not in non hematopoietic cells， including bone marrow fibroblasts \\[5\\]. BCR-ABL fusion transcripts resulting from translocation t(9；22)， are hallmarks of Philadelphia chromosome positive ph +leukemia patients. This translocation is detected in>90%patients with CML and ~20% patients with Acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients \\[6\\]. There are three common variants of BCR ABL1， p210 BCR ABL 1： This is created by fusion of ABL 1 at a2 with a breakpoint in the major BCR region at either e13 ore14 to produce an el3a2 or e14a2 transcript that is translated into a 210 kD protein \\[7-**\n\n【23】**101\\. This variant is present in most of the CML patients. It is present in one third of the patients with ph positive B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. p190 BCR ABL 1： This is created by fusion of ABL 1 at a2 with a breakpoint in the minor BCR region at el to produce an ela2 transcript into a 190 kD protein. This variant is present in two thirds of those with Ph+ B ALL (80% of childhood and 50% of adult Ph positive B-ALL) and a minority of patients with CML p230 BCR ABL 1： This is created by fusion of ABL 1 at a2 with a breakpoint in the mu BCR region at e19 to produce an e19a2 transcript which is translated into a 230 kD protein. This variant is seen in some patients with chronic neutrophilic leukemia.**\n\n【24】**There are three hypothesis that have been thought of with regard to the presence of BCR ABL rearrangement in our case.**\n\n【25】**The first one that we considered initially was that this rearrangement is a part of a normal variant， the significance of which could be found out on regular follow-up of this patient. A study by Jew Win Kuan et al. was done in normal population in southern Sarawak by performing quantitative PCR for BCR ABL1with ABL1 as an internal control on total white blood cells. In this they demonstrated that the BCR ABL1 fusion gene is expected to be present in approximately 0.5% to 1% of normal individuals in that area. The positive subject in this study had BCR ABL1 Fusion gene of 0.002320.0032%， which is equivalent to MR4.5. In our patient in discussion， the BCR ABL1 transcript was 5.931%.**\n\n【26】**Secondly， tumorigenesisafter exposure toeenvironmental carcinogens such as ionizing radiation and chlorinated solvents is a well-known phenomenon. A common insult to the bone marrow can cause irreparable DNA damage potentially leading to neoplasms of myeloid and lymphoid origin. This might partially explain as the patient had been exposed to radiation therapy for plasmacytoma one year back.**\n\n【27】**Thirdly， treatment of first malignancy with cytotoxic drugs or radiation can potentially lead to secondary malignant transformation. The role of melphalan and cyclophosphamide in developing secondary malignancies is well documented in literature. Various secondary malignancies in lenalidomide-treated patients have also been described. Nevertheless， this hypothesis cannot be extrapolated to our patient because the two diseases were simultaneously detected. In addition， chronic antigenic stimulation due to multiple etiological factors may be involved in the development of simultaneous myeloid and lymphoid neoplasms. Other factors such as genotypic polymorphism may also be involved.**\n\n【28】**The other possibility is de novo ph+ multiple myelomas， which is an extremely rare event.**\n\n【29】**Another possible theory is the presence of a common malignant pluripotent progenitor stem cell which can be transformed to both lymphoid and myeloid lines \\[11\\].**\n\n【30】**Also， it has been proposed that a more sustainable environment for the formation of secondary tumors is created due to the presence of myeloma cells. Studies have showed that multiple myeloma cells have pleiotropic proliferative and antiapoptotic properties \\[12，13\\].**\n\n【31】**At the outset we had hypothesized it to be a normal variant and decided to keep under close observation. However， subsequently we started TKI， in view ofleft shift in peripheral smear. Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) is a clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorder. The annual incidence of CML is 1.5 cases per 100，000 individuals.**\n\n【32】**Multiple Myeloma (MM) represents a malignant proliferation of plasma cells derived from a single clone. The co-occurrence of two rare malignancies CML and MM in the same patient is an extremely rare incident， and simultaneous diagnosis of CML and MM is reported in only five cases in the literature. Multiple Myeloma (MM) has been reported in association with a variety of myeloproliferative disorders， including polycythemia vera， myelofibrosis， essential thrombocythemia and Chronic Neutrophilic Leukemia (CNL). However， the association with Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia(CML) has been rarely reported \\[14\\]. A retrospective study between year 2013 to 2017 was done by Rouslan Kotchetkov et al. \\[15\\]， in which they identified 46 patients with synchronous hematological malignancies， out of which 50% were myeloid + lymphoid 43%lymphoid + lymphoid and 7% were identified to have myeloid +myeloid synchronous malignancies， however none of them was CML with MM \\[15\\].**\n\n【33】**There are few reported cases of multiple myeloma with a Philadelphia chromosome. One reported case is of a 61-vear-old man showing BCR ABL positive bone marrow after autologous bone marrow transplantation for multiple myeloma. Anecdotal cases of patients of multiple myeloma who developed CML after treatment or occurrence of multiple myeloma in a known case of CML on follow up are reported in literature.**\n\n【34】**Conclusion**\n\n【35】**After reviewing the literature， it is possible that the coexistence of these two hematological disorders is multifactorial. The occurrence can’t be attributed to one factor alone. No formal guidelines have been established regarding the use of antimyeloma therapy along with TKIs used in the treatment for CML. In our patient we used the combination of Dasatinib with VRD regimen with good response and minimal toxicity to the patient.**\n\n【36】**References**\n\n【37】1\\.

The cardiovascular risk factors and cardiotoxicity control remains challenging， since drug interactions may result in significant clinical events.**\n\n【11】**Methods： This study describes a cardiotoxicevent causedby syncope-related sinus pause，exacerbated or resulting from the use of thalidomide in a patient during multiple myeloma treatment.**\n\n【12】**Results/Discussion： A 63-year-old male submitted to VAD (vincristine， doxorubicin and dexamethasone) chemotherapy for multiple myeloma. After six months， the patient underwent a Bone Marrow Transplant (BMT)， first with thalidomide，evolving with successive syncopal episodes(Stokes-Adams syndrome)， one of which resulted in traumatic brain injury， with a fracture in the left temporoparietal region. A 24-h Holter showed 2 pause episodes of more than 2 sec， the longest being 18.5 sec，not associated with symptoms. It is known that patients submitted to chemotherapy are at risk of developing cardiotoxicity. Preventive measures should be part of clinical management， in order to prevent ventricular damage and the occurrence of other phenomena.**\n\n【13】**Conclusion： The use of thalidomide requires monitoring bradyarrhythmia's and syncope. Medication with greater tolerability， such as lenalidomide，should beincreasingly prescribed，thereby avoiding undesirable clinical situations that may directly affect patient morbidity and mortality.**\n\n【14】**Introduction**\n\n【15】**The demographic and epidemiological transition process that occurred in Brazil and the world in the last century changed the profile of the most prevalent diseases. Increased life expectancy and improvement in certain aspects of the health-disease process led to a reduction in infectious and parasitic diseases， with a rise in the incidence of neoplastic diseases. Thus， neoplasm's that accounted for around 3% of overall deaths in 1930， increased proportionally to 12% in the mid-1980s \\[1\\].**\n\n【16】**There have been important advances in the area of medicine， with new drugs and treatments to manage these diseases. On the other hand， new drug interactions may result in a significant clinical event in the follow-up of this population \\[2\\]. This can be particularly relevant given the need to control cardiovascular comorbidities prevalent in survivors.**\n\n【17】**One of the concerns with the use of antineoplastic agents is the potential for cardiotoxicity. This clinical entity is defined by confirmation of new clinical cardiovascular alterations during or after antineoplastic treatment and/or change in biomarkers and/or cardiac imaging tests， provided other etiologies have been excluded \\[3，4\\].**\n\n【18】**Multiple myeloma， a malignant disease of the hematopoietic system， was one of the neoplasm's whose natural history was modified. Despite still being incurable， the therapeutic arsenal has been broadened.**\n\n【19】**The aim of this study was to describe a cardiotoxic event caused by syncope-related sinus pause， exacerbated or caused by the use of thalidomide in a patient being treated for multiple myeloma.**\n\n【20】**Case Presentation**\n\n【21】**A 63-year-old male was referred to the cardio-oncology outpatient facility due to hypertension after the onset of VAD (vincristine， doxorubicin and dexamethasone) chemotherapy to treat multiple myeloma. There were no cardiovascular symptoms at that time. The patient was using10 mg/d of amlodipine and 50 mg/d of metoprolol tartrate. Physical examination showed a good overall state， pallor， FC I with BP= 44 mmHg x 86 mmHg， HR= 84 bpm， and RR=22 ipm. CMR**\n\n【22】**Figure 1： Electrocardiogram at patient admission.**\n\n【23】**Figure 2： ECG image obtained after BMT and syncope.**\n\n【24】**at 3T， with 4S， A2 hyperphonesis and mitral regurgitation murmur(+/6+). No systemic or pulmonary congestion or other disorders were detected.**\n\n【25】**ComplementaryEexaminations atfollow-upshowed an electrocardiogram with siniis rhythm，left-axis deviation， electrically inactive lower wall area， and QTc of 426 msec (Figure 1). Transthoracic echocardiogram revealed grade I diastolic dysfunction， with preserved systolic function (LVEF=69%)， and no change in segmental contraction. Due to the high risk of cardiotoxicity， the anti-hypertensives were replaced by 20 mg/d of enalapril and 6.25mg/d of carvedilol. There was good tolerance to increasing doses of carvedilol up to 50 mg/day.**\n\n【26】**After six months， the patient was submitted to a Bone Marrow Transplant (BMT)， with thalidomide as part of the BMT hematology protocol， evolving with successive syncopal episodes (Stokes-Adams syndrome)， one associated with traumatic brain injury and a fracture in the left temporoparietal region. At this time， the physical examination was similar to that of the first consultation， with controlled blood pressure， no postural hypotension or other disorders， and CMR with 4S. The electrocardiogram exhibited the same pattern as those previously obtained (Figure 2).**\n\n【27】**The 24-h Holter showed 2 pause episodes of more than 2 sec， the longest being 18.5 sec， not associated with any symptoms (Figure3). After joint assessment with an Arrhythmologist， the following**\n\n【28】**diagnostic hypotheses were considered：Thalidomide-induced bradycardia， ventricular arrhythmias caused by cardiotoxicity due to the previous use of doxorubicin or vasovagal syncope resulting from a change in the antihypertensive scheme. The use of 25mcg/d of fludrocortisone was prescribed， associated with non-pharmacological measures， and the beta blocker was discontinued， while complementary diagnosis assessment progressed. Syncopal episodes persisted with similar characteristics to those previously observed.**\n\n【29】**The electrophysiological study to assess sinus node dysfunction was normal， as was cardiac catheterization， which demonstrated only epicardial coronaries with irregularities. The tilt test was negative.**\n\n【30】**Thyroidlffunctionandeelectrolyte doses remainednormal throughout follow-up. Due to the persistent syncopal episodes and the impossibility of suspending thalidomide， a definitive atrial-ventricular pacemaker was implanted， with successful episode resolution.**\n\n【31】**Discussion**\n\n【32】**Syncope occurred in the patient due to a confluence of factors， including base pathology， since cancer leads to a proinflammatory state that may culminate in fibrosis and altered cardiac physiology， the side effects of his medication. The use ofthalidomide seems to be the main factor for the origin of syncope.**\n\n【33】**Thalidomide， an antineoplastic drug， is part of the therapeutic scheme for multiple myeloma. Its most important cardiotoxicity-related side effects are thromboembolicphenomena and arrhythmias， mainly bradyarrhythmia’s \\[5\\]. Some studies found that thalidomide _05_ could induce mild bradycardia in up to 55% ofpatients， irrespective of an association with corticosteroids \\[6，7\\]. The most severe bradycardia symptoms occur in only 1% to 3% of cases \\[7\\]. Numerous mechanisms are involved in1 the hemodynamic determination of cardiac arrhythmias， such as hypotension and pulmonaryhypertension \\[7，8\\].**\n\n【34】**Fahdi et al. \\[9\\] reported topics that deserve attention. More than 90 patients with multiple mveloma treated with thalidomide were compared with the control group. Their concomitant use with negative chronotropic drugs， such as adrenergic beta calcium channel blockers， and antiarrhythmic drugs showed no statistically significant difference in relation to the occurrence of bradyarrhythmia's in the study patients \\[9，10\\]. However， along with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide， these drugs are part of the group that pose a risk for the occurrence of bradycardia \\[11\\]. An important factor that seems to be associated with greater sinus bradycardia occurrence is the existence of concomitant hypothyroidism， which should be closely monitored \\[7\\]. In the patient in question， all thyroid hormone contents were normal**\n\n【35】**Electrocardiographically， bradycardia is expressedIwith no change in intracardiac conduction intervals， such as the PR， QRS and QT interval. The physiopathological mechanism remains unknown\\[7\\]. Fahdi et al.\\[9\\] suggested that the basis for the occurrence of this event is the imbalance caused by thalidomide in the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. Thalidomide inhibits TNF alpha expression and activity， leading to complete inhibition of the dorsal motor neuron in the vagus nerve nucleus， resulting in parasympathetic hyperactivity and culminating in sinus bradycardia and other conduction disorders， such as third-degree atrioventricular block \\[7，9，12\\].**\n\n【36】**It was later suggested that the harmful effect of this chemotherapy drug is dose dependent， as reported by Tamargo et al. \\[7\\]， such that in patients where it could not be reduced or suspended， when severe bradycardia occurs， the typical therapeutic alternative is implanting a definitive pacemaker \\[7，9\\]. This device has increased in patients exhibiting syncopal episodes. Thangaraju et al. \\[13\\] reported the occurrence of sinus bradycardia in young patients being treated for erythema nodosum leprosum， and no association with other drugs. This resulted in regression and return to basal heart rate after the drug was suspended， demonstrating that the effects are associated with higher serum concentration of the drug and suggesting the reversibility of the effects of thalidomide in sinus node function7，9，13-15.**\n\n【37】**In a study of patients diagnosed with stage 1 multiple myeloma， Rajikumar et al. \\[16\\] found that at an average of 400 mg/day of thalidomide (varying from 200 mg/day to 800 mg/day)， around 26%of the patients exhibited bradycardia， showing an association with a lower heart rate. The same phenomenon was observed by Menghui\\[171， where sinus bradycardia was one of the most important side effects of thalidomide in terms of morbidity in the treatment of Crohn's disease， reinforcing the need to monitor cardiotoxicity.**\n\n【38】**There are now drugs with a more tolerable cardiovascular toxicity profile， including second-generation immune modulators such as lenalidomide， a thalidomide analog \\[18\\]. However， this drug is not available in the Brazilian public health system， since it was not included in the National List of Essential Drugs (RENAME)， last updated in 2022\\[19\\].**\n\n【39】**It is known that patients submitted to chemotherapy are at risk of developing cardiotoxicity. Preventive measures should be part of clinical management， in order to prevent ventricular dysfunction and other phenomena. Although not statistically significant， according to the latest Brazilian Cardio-Oncology Guidelines， the use of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and prophylactic beta blockers is indicated， irrespective of symptomatic**\n\n【40】**or asymptomatic cardiac injury \\[3\\]. In the largest randomized clinical trial conducted to prevent cardiotoxicity using adrenergic beta blockers， specifically carvedilol， Avila et al. \\[20\\] found no difference between the control group and placebo in relation to left ventricular ejection fraction and placebo， since there was a decline in troponin levels and diastolic dysfunction in the carvedilol group. It is important to note that in addition to their side effects， these drugs may interact with the chemotherapy drugs themselves.**\n\n【41】**Conclusion**\n\n【42】**The use of thalidomide requires carefulmonitoring of bradyarrhythmia's and syncope， in addition to other cardiotoxicities. Drugs such as lenalidomide exhibit better tolerability and less interaction with therapies to control comorbidities and reduce cardiotoxicity. As such， they should be preferred to lower the risk of undesirable clinical situations and increased morbidity and mortality in this population.**\n\n【43】**References**\n\n【44】1\\. Prata PR.

A potentially blinding necrotizing retinitis can occur， with progressive deterioration of CD4+ T counts below 250 cells/cumm. This case highlights its unusual presentation in an HIV patient with normal CD4+ T counts. A 42-year-old gentleman presented with a week history of left eye diminution of vision. Clinical examination of the right eye was unremarkable while left eye showed anterior chamber and vitreous cells with a yellowish foveal lesion suspicious of toxoplasmic retinitis. He was seropositive for HIV， on therapy for ten years， with CD4+ T count 777 cells/cumm. Laboratory tests confirmed toxoplasmosis. He was started on oral anti-toxoplasma medication with tapering doses of oral and topical steroids. On subsequent follow-up， the patient had good visual and clinical improvement.**\n\n【11】**Keywords： Toxoplasmic retinitis； Human Immunodeficiency Virus； CD4+T count**\n\n【12】**Introduction**\n\n【13】**Toxoplasmosis is a zoonotic infection caused by the protozoal organism Toxoplasma gondii， an obligatory parasite of the cat. In an immunocompetent host， it is generally a benign self-limited infection； nevertheless， severe complications such as retinochoroidal involvement，have been known to occur. Ocular and Central nervous system toxoplasmosis is almost always seen in patients who are severely immunocompromised.**\n\n【14】**This case highlights the possibility of ocular toxoplasmosis in HIV positive individuals at normal CD4+T counts.**\n\n【15】**Case Presentation**\n\n【16】**A 42-year-old gentleman presented with a history of diminution of vision of the left eye for a week. The Best-Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA)， recorded on Snellen's chart， was 6/6， N6 in the right eye and 6/36， N24 in the left eye. Clinically， the anterior segment examination of the right eye was normal， and the left eye showed anterior chamber cells of grade 1 (Standardized Uveitis Nomenclature grading： SUN). Posterior segment examination of the right eye was unremarkable， while the left eye revealed vitreous cells of grade 1+ (National eye institute system grading) with a dense yellowish lesion suggestive of retinitis， involving inferior half of fovea， suspicious of ocular toxoplasmosis (Figure 1A). Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) of the left eye showed few hyper-reflective dots in the vitreous and loss of foveal contour with hyper-reflective full-thickness foveal lesion (Figure 1B). The patient was seropositive for HlV and on HAART medication for ten years with his recent (1 month since the time of presentation) CD4+ T count being 777 cells/cumm. Investigations revealed positive Toxoplasma gondii serology (IgG-453 IU/ml/IgM-9.4IU/ml)， positive Mantoux with induration of 23 mm. Systemic examination was normal. He was started on treatment with Tab. Septra DS (Trimethoprim 160 mg-sulfamethoxazole 800 mg) twice daily， along with Tab. Azithromycin 500 mg twice daily on day 1， followed by 500 mg once daily and topical prednisolone four times daily. On the follow-up visit after 3 days， consolidation of the lesion was noted，and oral wysolone 1 mg/kg body weight was added to the ongoing treatment. The consulting pulmonologist advised an additional INH prophylaxis. On the subsequent follow-ups， one week and one month later， the BCVA of left eye improved to 6/24， N8 and 6/9， N6 respectively. The posterior segment examination and OCT also showed a gross reduction in the size of the lesion in 2visits (Figures 2A，2B and 3A，3B\\]. During the course of disease he was treated with anti-toxoplasma medication for 8 weeks and a tapering dose of oral wysolone， 10 mg weekly taper for 7 weeks. Two months later， on completion of the course of treatment， BCVA of left eye had improved to 6/6，**\n\n【17】**Figure 1A， 1B： Left eye showing yellowishlesion suggestive of retinitis involving inferior half of fovea.

In general， the CD4+ T-lymphocyte count has been accustomed to predict the onset ofbound ocular infections in patients who are seropositive. Patients with HIV infection are particularly susceptible to acute and reactive infections with Toxoplasma gondii， particularly when CD4+ T counts fall below 250 cells/cumm.**\n\n【24】**HIV patients with ocular toxoplasmosis must undergo a neurological evaluation； including imaging and lumbar puncture due to 30% to 50% of these patients have intracranial involvement. Toxoplasmic retinochoroiditis presents as areas of necrotizing retinitis， vitreous， and inflammation of the anterior segment， giving a classical picture of headlight in the fog’ which usually resolves spontaneously， but often leaves pigmented chorioretinal scars \\[1\\]. The choroid and sclera may become involved secondarily \\[2\\]. In our case， however， the posterior segment manifestation in the left eye was in the form retinitis alone without the involvement of choroid. Following treatment， the lesion resolved to leave behind an atrophic scar without pigmentation.**\n\n【25】**Ocular toxoplasmosis in immunocompromised individuals frequently demonstrates a relatively fulminant course \\[3\\]. Potential presentations include multifocal disease in one eye， bilaterally active inflammation and/or extensive areas of necrotizing retinitis. Diagnostic confusion with viral retinitis may necessitate intraocular fluid analysis \\[4\\].**\n\n【26】**When the lesion is characteristic， the demonstration of IgG and IgM serum antibody gives a presumptive diagnosis and allows initiation of a specific therapy. In doubtful cases， it is possible to detect the parasite DNA by vitreous biopsy and PCR for Toxoplasma _gondii \\[5\\]._**\n\n【27】**Classical Triple regimen of anti-toxoplasma medications are given along with oral steroids to control inflammation. Steroids should be tapered and withdrawn a week prior to the completion of anti-toxoplasma medication. Intravitreal management option appears to be an effective treatment for immunocompetent patients， whereas systemic therapy is suggested in immunocompromised patients to prevent toxoplasmosis-related complications in the fellow eye or elsewhere in the CNS \\[6\\]. Prophylaxis with anti-toxic medications is effective against disseminated toxoplasmosis in immunocompromised patients when CD4+ T count less than 100lymphocytes per cumm \\[7\\]. In our case， the eye was quite with normal CD4+ T count in the successive follow-ups without prophylactic treatment.**\n\n【28】**Toxoplasmic retinochoroiditis need not necessarily manifest only in HIV positive individuals with low CD4+ T counts. It can**\n\n【29】**occur at normal CD4+ T counts as well. However， the severity of inflammation， systemic involvement， and need of prolonged anti-toxo therapy in the latter condition is less when compared to the former. Atypicalpresentation as toxoplasmic retinitis alone can occur without choroid involvement in HIV positive individuals.**\n\n【30】**References**\n\n【31】**1\\. Park YH， Nam HW.

Meningitis is the most common severe infectious disease in neonates， infants， childhood and adult individuals. Bacterial meningitis is a serious life-threatening disease with severe neurological emergency such as hearing loss， developmental disorders， and neuropsychological impairment， occurring in up to 50% of survivors of the diseases. Even though there were introduction of PCV and HiB vaccine decreases the bacterial meningitis through the world， but the Incidence is 1 to 2 million cases per year worldwide \\[2\\].**\n\n【19】**_Fekede.

The rate of and associated factors for psychosocial problems among child with meningitis was assessed in this study \\[3\\].**\n\n【21】**Comparable to other childhood illnesses， the impact of meningitis is not limited to the child**\n\n【22】**_cited._**\n\n【23】**experiencing it， but affects all family members. The primary caregiver， caregivers of sick children lost half their daily productivity for an outpatient visit and a full day's productivity for each day a child was hospitalized. According to studies， a caregiver’s daily productivity was assumed to equal the daily minimum wage \\[3\\].**\n\n【24】**The child meningitis had long-term effects on family members'health， particularly affecting the likelihood of family members reporting anxiety and depression. These effects extended beyond a single close family member. These findings suggest that vaccinating against meningitis will bring significant health benefits not just to those that might have contracted the illness but also to their family networks \\[4\\].**\n\n【25】**In comparable to other literature，in this case studythe mother was very concerned about her child's current situation and future health. She also very worried about costs of hospitalization，medication costs and her lost income as she spent more of her time with the children.**\n\n【26】**The family members experience at least one after-effect from meningitis in the survivor. The most commonly reported after-effects were behavioral or emotional problems (28%)， mild/moderate learning disabilities (16%)， scarring or tissue damage (14%)， balance problems (13%)， and speech or language problems (11%) that needs intervention as comprehensive care for caregivers \\[4，5\\].**\n\n【27】**In addition， bacterial meningitis often causes hearing loss and is fatal in 5% to 40% of children and 20% to 50% of adults despite treatment with adequate antibiotics. This increases burdens on the caregiver， which mayadversely affect their mental health. In contrast， the family's mental health may affect the development or outcomes of the long-term sequels of meningitis. The main meningeal sequels were hearing loss which accounts about 22% in child after survivors of meningitis \\[6\\].**\n\n【28】**Some literature recommends rehabilitative care for the child with severe hearing impairment was defined as the absence of an observable response at ≥ 70 dBnHL (decibel above normal adults Hearing Level) and moderate impairment was defined as no response at 50 dBnHL to 60 dBnHL hearing aids throughout their life \\[7\\].**\n\n【29】**In addition to this hearing loss， Neurological sequela occurs in a substantial amount of patients following bacterial meningitis. Most frequently reported sequela are focal neurological deficits， cognitive impairment and epilepsy which were more associated with pneumococcal and meningococcal meningitis \\[8\\].**\n\n【30】**Similar to the literature， the child in this case study also has the clinical manifestation of neurological sequels like hemiparesis， deviation of face to the right side and unable to close her eye lids.**\n\n【31】**According to some literature reveals that children with meningitis caused by P. pneumonae that persist to adolescent also develops or has a greater risk to develop intellectual impairment as compared with normal children \\[9，10\\].**\n\n【32】**Similar to other literature in this case study the mother was more feels anxious for her child future and burden encountered. The mother was very concerned about the child's future health， the burden of giving care along of her life and as her child still didn’t walk by herself after 1 month hospitalization.**\n\n【33】**Nursing Implication**\n\n【34】**Most of reviewed literatures applaud that， the assessment and**\n\n【35】**care of the children with bacterial meningitis was not only focused on physical aspects but also psychosocial aspects of the child & family as it has positive impact on the child's outcome. Because meningitis after Pneurnococcus preurnonae and HIB bacteria were has enormous after effect. Even though several studies recommend holistic approach of nursing care， the psychosocial aspects of the patient care of a patient with meningitis & other acute illness with chronic sequels was not commonly practiced in this set up. Due to this， many patients with meningitis were suffering from psychosocial problems. As a nurse， it important to understand such problems， I have tried to implement psychosocial interventions such as reassurance， counseling about how the patient lives with disease sequels， for the family and managing acute and chronic complication by regular exercise， adherence to medication， preventing infection， promoting positive self-image， helping child and mother to cope with social anxiety and stigmatization. Finally as recommendation， all staff members and caregivers should incorporate psychosocial aspect of meningitis patients on the assessment and care activities in order to improve the wellbeing of the patient.**\n\n【36】**Reflection**\n\n【37】**From this case study I was very notable & get new knowledge. As bacterial meningitis has a significant effect on individual's psychology， social & financially as well. In addition as a nurse we need to know &react on psychosocial influences of meningitis on the patient & his/her family and should intervene as early as possible.**\n\n【38】**References**\n\n【39】**1\\.

Pregnant women are at greater risk of this complication because of several reasons e.g. lower baseline plasma sodium level in pregnancy， altered secretion of Anti Diuretic Hormone (ADH)， inappropriate fluid management in labor or increased oral intake and the anti-diuretic effect of oxytocin. We present a case which illustrates complications associated with hypervolemic hyponatremia as a result of positive fluid balance in labor. A caesarean section was required for failure to progress in first stage， chorioamnionitis， hyponatremia and acute kidney injury. She developed narrow complex Supra Ventricular Tachycardia (SVT) immediate post-delivery which was terminated with adenosine.**\n\n【15】**Introduction**\n\n【16】**In the literature， and national guidance framework， there is a paucity of guidance for the fluid management of laboring women. This group is at a high risk of dehydration， and fluid overload if careful management of fluid intake， both oral and intravenous， is not undertaken. This can lead to risk of acute kidney injury， electrolyte imbalances \\[1\\] and cardiac arrhythmias associated with fluid overload， and well as neonatal risks， including transient neonatal tachypnoea \\[2\\]， jaundice， hyperbilirubinemia， fluid overload and seizures \\[3\\].**\n\n【17】**Case Presentation**\n\n【18】**Ms X， a 26 year old primiparous Caucasian woman was low risk with a BMI of 27 kg/m². Her pregnancy was uneventful and she presented to our Midwifery Led Unit (MLU) following spontaneous rupture of membranes at 40+8 weeks. Following a delay in the 15 stage of labor at 5 cm cervical dilatation，she was transferred to the Consultant Led Unit (CLU) for oxytocin augmentation.**\n\n【19】**In terms of fluid intake and output record in labor； she had 4L of intravenous Hartmann's in labor in consultant led unit， but prior oral intake in labor was unknown. She had required 9 h of oxytocin infusion in labor with titration rates of 8 to 12 ml/hr according to uterine contractions. Her total urine output in 9 h was recorded as 700 ml. She subsequently developed pyrexia in labor. In view of poor urine output and pyrexia in labor， she had septic screen and bloods taken， including FBC， CRP， U&Es and lactate. This showed her sodium level as 120 mmol/l and creatinine 139umol/l. Nine hours prior to deterioration， her creatinine level was 72 umol/l； however sodium was recorded low at 123 mmol/l. There were no preceding sodium levels to compare to.**\n\n【20】**Following review of blood results， identification of Acute Kidney Injury (AKI)， suspected chorioamnionitis and delay in the 15 stage of labor at 8 cm cervical dilatation，the decision was made to expedite delivery by caesarean section. Blood loss at delivery was 800 ml and fetal weight as 4215g. Neonatal Apgar reported as 7 at 1 min and 5 at 10 min. Cord gases were 7.29 BE -3.7 (arterial) and 7.31 BE -4.6(venous). Baby required neonatal special care input with IV antibiotics and sodium replacement in view of neonatal hyponatremia.**\n\n【21】**Immediately following delivery， she developed narrowcomplex supra ventricular tachycardia and required cardio version with IV adenosine. She was subsequently transferred to Intensive Therapies**\n\n【22】**Unit (ITU) for cardiac monitoring， and strict fluid monitoring in light of hyponatremia and AKI. She required multidisciplinary care with further input from intensive care team， medical and renalteams for ongoing management.**\n\n【23】**At time ofSVT，her GCS remained 15 with normal blood pressure and oxygen saturations. Her spot sodium test showed sodium of 117mmol/l and potassium of 3.2 mmol/. She developed second episode of SVT in ITU 6 h later， which required further cardio version with IV adenosine.**\n\n【24】**She required potassium and magnesium replacement in ITU. Her cortisol and thyroid function tests were reported as normal. Her initial urine creatinine was 2.48 mmol/l with urine sodium as 17.8mmol/l and urine sodium to creatinine ratio as 7.2. She made full recovery and was discharged home with baby on day \\[4\\].**\n\n【25】**Following cardiology review， she had an EP (Electrophysiology) study which confirmed the suspicion of an accessory pathway which has now been ablated.**\n\n【26】**Discussion**\n\n【27】**Hyponatremia ishbroadlycharacterized as euvolemic， hypervolemic or hypovolemic hyponatremia. In pregnancy， the most common manifestation is hypervolemic hyponatremia (also referred to as dilutional hyponatremia or water toxicity). This is caused due to the woman taking on more fluid than she is able to excrete， resulting in a relative drop in serum concentration of sodium. Acute hyponatremia may cause cerebral edema in severe cases， but most cases are asymptomatic. Early signs and symptoms of hyponatremia are often difficult to identify. These indlude lethargy， agitation， headache， confusion and altered mental state.**\n\n**Accepted values for normal sodium levels in pregnancy are 130mmol/L to 140 mmol/L \\[5，6\\]， due to the dilutional state induced by pregnancy， particularly in the third trimester \\[1，4，7\\]. This is due to increased water retention - a result of physiologically increased ADH secretion in pregnancy \\[8\\]. Oxytocin， another hypothalamic neuropeptide，has a similar chemical structure to ADH and increases the risk of fluid retention \\[9\\]. Compounds with this effect as well as over-judicious administration of fluids， both IV and oral can lead to hypervolemic hyponatremia. In many cases hyponatremia is mild and asymptomatic |1，10|.**\n\n【29】**Previously reported cases outline that administration ofhypotonic fluid (e.g. 5% dextrose) significantly increase the risk of dilutional hyponatremia \\[2，11，12\\]， so there has since been a shift in trends towards more physiological fluids (e.g.， Hartmann’s solution for fluid resuscitation， and normal saline for oxytocin administration). One Swedish observational study demonstrated that 26% of women who received more than 2500 mL fluid in labor (both oral and intravenous) were hyponatremic in the postpartum period \\[1，13，14\\]. Interestingly， in this same group there was no statistically significant relationship between oxytocin augmentation and hyponatremia.**\n\n【30】**Hyponatremia has been reported in cases of pre-eclampsia npregnancy. It's hypothesized that release of vasopressin in hypervolemic state in cases of deranged circulating volume in pre-eclampsia and ascites may be related to this pathology. It’s important to keep this in mind while investigating for causes ofhyponatremia in labor \\[15，16\\]. Our case did not have problem with blood pressure or proteinuria in pregnancy or labor and did not exhibit any signs and symptoms of Pre-eclampsia.**\n\n【31】**It's important to keep a strict fluid balance while being admitted to maternity wards especially for women undergoing induction of labor and in established labor. We have introduced a local guidance to guide fluid management in labor， recognition of hyponatremia and treatment since this case. We would encourage maternity units to devise their local guidance to increase awareness and management of fluid balance in labor to avoid a potentially serious complication of unrecognized hyponatremia for mothers and neonates.**\n\n【32】**Maternal Hyponatremia risks the cases of neonatal hyponatremia， which can cause fetal hyperbilirubinemia and jaundice， feeding difficulties， respiratory distress and convulsions. It's important to inform pediatrician about maternal hyponatremia in labor so that a neonatal management plan is devised in a timely manner.**\n\n【33】**Electrolyte disturbances can cause conduction problems in heart There have been case reports of atrioventricular block with severe hyponatremia which improved following correction of hyponatremia\\[17\\].**\n\n【34】**Electrolyte disturbances can also cause changes in sino-atrial node and pulmonary vein electrical activity leading to atrial fibrillation\\[18\\]. An ECG should be offered to women with severe electrolyte disturbance to rule out consequent cardiac arrhythmias.**\n\n【35】**Pregnancy itself can predispose to arrhythmiaasSwithout underlying heart disease because of increasing heart rate， circulating plasma volume changes and autonomic and hormonal changes and increased catecholamine.**\n\n【36】**To our knowledge， this is first case report of occurrence of supra ventricular tachycardia in a woman with concomitant severe hyponatremia. Her subsequent investigations revealed the presence of an accessory pathway which needed further management. This could have triggered her SVT with other biochemical changes in immediate postpartum period.**\n\n【37】**Treatment of SVT in pregnancy includes vagal maneuvers first and it fails to terminate tachycardia， adenosine is usually used as first line.

It had to allow ablation nail to allow aligning the limb. It had to preserve the bone capital to allow a secondary osteosynthesis. We decided to perform an anteromedial approach with a distal tibial corticotomy flap respecting the tibio-talar joint and an economical corticotomy at its proximal part. This is to extract the nail retrograde way(Figure 5，6).**\n\n【23】**Figure 1： Irreducible deformity of the right leg.**\n\n【24】**Figure 4： Frontal flexion at the junction 1/3 mid-1/3 inferior of the tibia.**\n\n【25】**Figure 5： Nail retrograde way.**\n\n【26】**Figure 2： Irreducible deformity of the right leg at 45°.**\n\n【27】**Figure 3： Irreducible deformity of the right leg at 45° lateral flexion.**\n\n【28】**Figure 6： Anteramedial approach with a distal tibial corticotomy flap.**\n\n【29】**With regard to osteosynthesis， we have been able to perform a conventional osteosynthesis by medial distal tibial plate LCP 3.5(Figure 7，8).**\n\n【30】**Discussion**\n\n【31】**The deformation of osteosynthesis material is frequent in cases of nonunion due to a progressive and irreversible embrittlement of the metal. In the vast majority of cases， the diagnosis is made at the time of the rupture of the latter and the extraction of this material is carried out in semi emergency. There are many methods of extraction\\[6\\]. The authors focus mainly on tactics with proximal anterograde extraction and distal percutaneous or retrograde extraction. In all clinical cases reported， there is no simple deformation but a complete rupture ofthe metallic material \\[4，7\\].**\n\n【32】**Figure 7： Conventional osteosynthesis.**\n\n【33】**The deformation of material in traumatic cases is much less frequent \\[7\\]. The extraction of the material is made very complicated by this deformation. Yip et al. reported extraction of two tibial nails**\n\n【34】**by standard route \\[8\\]. By carefully studying the deformations， one realizes that these were not important and finally allowed a classic extraction of the nail. One case reported by these authors had 13° of**\n\n【35】**anterior flexion and 20° of valgus. Our clinical case had a much larger deformity.**\n\n【36】**The idea of deforming the tibia by an external force to obtain a realignment allowing the conventional extraction of the nail has not been seriously considered. Some authors have tried with total failure7.**\n\n【37】**Some authors propose a minimal approach on the deformation focus \\[9\\]. The goal is to cut the nail with a plier or saw. Thus， one can realign the limb and proceed to the extraction as in the case of a rupture on a nonunion. Some authors believe that the use of a saw is not advisable because of metal chips and the risk of bone burns \\[7\\].**\n\n【38】**We decided preoperatively to perform a distal corticotomy. We were then able to seize the nail to carry out a retrograde extraction. All the proximal diaphysis was intact. The bonyhood was then rested and fixed by a provisional strapping and a very long bone plate was placed \\[10\\].**\n\n【39】**In conclusion， the presence of osteosynthesis equipment may expose to complications in case of trauma as illustrated by our clinical case. However， it seems that a complication at this degree of severity is exceptional in the literature. According to our service habits， the removal of osteosynthesis equipment must be included in the therapeutic project from initial management， particularly in a population at high risk oftrauma.**\n\n【40】**References**\n\n【41】**1\\.

Today it is known that strength training (TF) has benefits such as decreased fasting glycemia， glycated hemoglobin， stimulates translocation of GLUT4 in skeletal muscle， increases insulin sensitivity， restoring metabolic control. The objective of this research was to observe the glycemic responses of a type 1 diabetic who underwent strength training at different intensities.**\n\n【15】**Methods： A 26-year-old woman with type 1 Diabetes Mellitus participated in this research， with a trained diagnosis time of 22 (twenty-two)years. The volunteer participated in three non-consecutive days of intervention at the first visit. The evaluation was performed with a test of Maximum Repetition (1RM) in the following exercises： Bench press； Knee extension on the device； Peck Deck； Front high pulley with cable； Leg 45；Low row with triangle. On the second visit to the laboratory， the TF session was performed at 40% of 1RM. On the third visit， the session was performed at 80%of 1RM， capillary blood glucose was collected before， during and immediately after each strength training session.**\n\n【16】**Results： The results observed showed that the exercise of less intensity， at 40% of 1 RM， showed a greater drop in capillary glycemia during and immediately after the TF session.**\n\n【17】**Conclusion： Different intensities will result in different physiological responses. It is important to highlight the need for blood glucose monitoring before， during and after training.**\n\n【18】**Keywords： Type 1 Diabetes； Blood Glucose； Strength Training**\n\n【19】**Introduction**\n\n【20】**Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (DM1) is concentrated between 5% and 10% of the total number of people with diabetes. In most cases， DM1 arises as a result ofautoimmune destruction of pancreatic B cells causing complete deficiency in insulin production，being diagnosed more frequently in children， adolescents and young adults， equally affecting men and women， although its pathophysiology is not fully known. It is known that it is a polygenic disease， thus genetic and environmental factors trigger the autoimmune response \\[1\\].**\n\n【21】The treatment of DM1 has historically followed the insulin/food/physical exercise triad. Currently， the triad should switch to insulin/diabetes monitoring/education， including education in nutrition， exercise and guidance for patients and their families \\[2\\].\n\n【22】**Among the treatments， physical exercise offers different methods for controlling DM1， such as aerobic training， which is the most used， since strength training before 2005 was not suitable for DM1 \\[3\\]. Today it is already known that strength training has benefits such as decreased fasting blood glucose， glycated hemoglobin， visceral fat， and body weight； stimulates GLUT4 translocation in skeletal muscle， increases insulin sensitivity and， consequently， restores metabolic control \\[4\\]. Insulin injected by the DM1 carrier acts on the IRS-1 and IRS-2 receptors， promoting a cascade of intracellular signaling that results in the translocation of GLUT4 and the entry of glucose into the cell， physical exercise enhances the phosphorylation of IRS-2， which results in a greater PI3K activity causing an increase in Akt protein phosphorylation， which promotes an increase in the**\n\n【23】**translocation of GLUT4 to the cell membrane， consequently greater glucose entry into the cell， decreasing circulating glycemic levels\\[5\\] strength training also minimizes cardiac risks， increases muscle strength and is a good strategy to improve health， physical fitness and performance \\[6\\]， justifying its inclusion in the treatment ofDM1.**\n\n【24】**However， studies relating strength training in isolation and type1 diabetes are still scarce in the literature， in the same way studies that show the efficiency of different intensities under individuals with DM1 are a great gap in which little has been investigated. Comparing different intensities could clarify the benefits of strength training and provide support for practical applications and recommendations regarding the adequate and safe prescription of strength training for glycemic control in DM1， in addition， the little information on strength training related to DM1 demonstrates the need for further studies that address the topic， in order to elucidate the acute and chronic responses of DM1 through this training method \\[6，7\\]. In this sense， the objective of this research was to observe the glycemic responses of a type 1 diabetic who underwent strength training at different intensities.**\n\n【25】**Materials and Methods**\n\n【26】**Participants**\n\n【27】**This research was characterized as a case study and is linked to the Project Doce Vida - Supervised Physical Exercise Program for Diabetics， held at the Higher School of Physical Education at the University of Pernambuco.

Capillary blood glucose was measured before and after each workout， always on the little or ring fingers， discarding the first drop of blood， the second drop being used \\[8\\]. The glucometer， reagent strips，lancets and lancets used were from the Freestyle Optium Neo model from Abbott. The infectious material (gloves， lancets， tapes and paper towels) used for collection， was deposited in a specific box of hospital material.**\n\n【32】**Blood pressure**\n\n【33】**Blood pressure was measured before and after each strength training session， using the OMRON HEM 7113 digital automatic blood pressure monitor.**\n\n【34】**Initial evaluation and test of a maximum repeat (1RM)**\n\n【35】**The volunteer participated in three non-consecutive days of intervention. On the first visit to the Biodynamics Laboratory， the volunteer was familiarized with the training protocol. Soon afterwards， a test of Maximum Repetition (1RM) was performed in the following exercises： Bench press； Knee extension on the device； Peck Deck； Front high pulley with cable； Leg 45°； Low row with triangle \\[9\\]. The equipment was made by New Fit.**\n\n【36】**Before starting the 1RM test， the volunteer warmed up， in each exercise， from 10 to 15 repetitions， with an equivalent load of 40%to 60% of the maximum perceived strength \\[10\\]. Then， the load was**\n\n【37】**increased to approximately， 60% to 80% of the maximum perceived force. After this warm-up， there was an interval of 2 min， while the load was increased to perform the 1RM test.**\n\n【38】**Experimental sessions**\n\n【39】**On the second visit to the laboratory， the strength training session was performed at 40% of 1RM. On the third day， the session was performed at 80% of 1RM. Each day of intervention aimed to assess the impact of a strength training session on glycemic control. Glycemic responses were analyzed before， during and immediately after each session.**\n\n【40】**Pre-intervention**\n\n【41】**Before each intervention， the volunteer remained seated in the laboratory for a period of 10 min， in a quiet room without noise interference and with a temperature between 23·C to 24C\\[11\\].**\n\n【42】**Intervention**\n\n【43】**Strength training intensities were established based on the ACSM and ADA classification for individuals with DM1 \\[12\\]， with low intensity exercise with 40% 1RM and high intensity with 80% 1RM. The strength training sessions consisted of seven exercises in the same sequence as the 1RM test (Bench Press in the machine； Knee extension on the device； Peck Deck； Front high pulley with cable； Leg 45°；Low row with triangle). For the strength training session at 40% of 1RM，02 sets were performed with 16 repetitions in each exercise， with a recovery interval of 60s between sets and 120s between exercises. For the strength training session at 80% of 1RM， 02 sets were performed with 08 repetitions in each exercise with an interval of 90s between sets and 120s between exercises. The duration of the repetition in each series of the strength training was 3s， being 1s in the concentric phase and 2s in the eccentric phase of the movement.**\n\n【44】**Statistical analysis**\n\n【45】**A descriptive analysis of the variables was performed through the variation of the delta at baseline during and immediately after the intervention.**\n\n【46】**Results**\n\n【47】**According to the observed results， the exercise of less intensity， at 40% of 1RM， showed a drop between the measurement of the pre-training moment and the measurement of the moment during the training， and continued to fall until the moment immediately after the training， showing a greater blood glucose drop compared to training at 80% of1RM.**\n\n【48】**The strength training session at 80% of 1RM， showed an increase**\n\n【49】**Table 1： Variation of the capillary glucase Delta (A) with 40% of 1RM at baseline， during and after intervention of a RT session.**\n\n| **Glycemia**  | **Moment**  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Pre Workout**  | **143 mg/dL**  |\n| **During**  | **137 mg/dL**  |\n|  | **06 mg/dL**  |\n| **During**  | **137 mg/dL**  |\n| **After**  | **100 mg/dL**  |\n| **A**  | **37 mg/dL**  |\n| **Pre Workout**  | **143 mg/dL**  |\n| **After**  | **100 mg/dL**  |\n| **A**  | **43 mg/dL**  |\n\n【51】**Table 2： Variation in the capillary glucose Delta (A) with 80% of 1RM at baseline， during and after the intervention of a RT session.**\n\n| **Glycemia**  | **Moment**  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Pre Workout**  | **267 mg/dL**  |\n| **During**  | **281 mg/dL**  |\n| **A**  | **14mg/dL**  |\n| **During**  | **281 mg/dL**  |\n| **After**  | **240 mg/dL**  |\n| **A**  | **41 mg/dL**  |\n| **Pre Workout**  | **267 mg/dL**  |\n| **After**  | **240 mg/dL**  |\n| **A**  | **27 mg/dL**  |\n\n【53】**in capillary glycemia in the measurement during the training session， but， immediately after the training session， there was a decrease in capillary glycemia below the pre-training values.

Our findings showed a better acute response in low intensity exercise， at 40% of 1RM.**\n\n【56】**A study conducted by Silveira et al. \\[6\\] investigated the acute effects of different strength training intensities on glycemic fluctuations in individuals with DM1， using the intensities of 40%， 60% and 80%of 1RM， with capillary blood glucose measurements being taken at rest， immediately after exercise ， 10 min after exercise， 20 min and30 min after exercise， resulting in a lower concentration of glucose in all intensities up to 30 min after training， however， without showing a significant difference between the three training intensities during each training period time.**\n\n【57】**However， the study showed a significant difference between rest and 10 min after， 20 min and 30 min after training at the three intensities investigated， and during these periods of time， the glycemic drop at 40% of 1RM was moderate， unlike the fall between the highest intensities， 60% and 80% of 1RM， which revealed a fall in great magnitudes 30 min after the last exercise \\[6\\].**\n\n【58】**Campos， Paixao et al. \\[5\\] conducted a case study with a type 1diabetic in order to evaluate the hypoglycemic effect of resistance training with an emphasis on movement along the eccentric phase in an individual with an insulin infusion pump， the study lasted four weeks where the applicability of the training was three times a week.**\n\n【59】**Capillary blood glucose data were collected 15 min， 30 min and45 min， during and after training. The study found a significant drop in glycemia during the training sessions， the authors associate the glycemic drop with a greater activity of the GLUT4 protein， physical exercise promotes an increase in energy expenditure and associated with this there is an increase in the AMP： ATP ratio， this mechanism promotes the activation of AMPK， which is associated with translocation of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane \\[5，6\\].**\n\n【60】**The activation of the AMPK enzyme may explain the reduction in glucose during the training intensities performed in this study， as it is one of the precursors of activation of GLUT4， in addition， exercise promotes the suspension of the mTORC1/S6K1 protein**\n\n【61】**that is capable of phosphorylating IRS1 into serine and interrupting the insulin signaling cascade \\[1\\]. Thus， a greater phosphorylation of AMPK and Akt protein occurs， a mechanism that activates GLUT4through an insulin-independent signaling cascade \\[5，13\\].**\n\n【62】**A study carried out with type 2 diabetes conducted by Moreira， compared the acute effect of strength training exercise of different intensities of lower cardiovascular-metabolic stress on glucose control， intensities of 23% 1RM and 40%1RM were used， while end of the study it was concluded that both intensities were effective in reducing glycemia in individuals with type 2 diabetes， demonstrating that even at low intensities， the muscle contraction performed by exercise can promote GLUT4 translocation and in the reduction of capillary glycemia \\[14\\].**\n\n【63】**The increase in capillary glycemia during training to 80% of1RM and a smaller drop immediately after training compared to a session at 40% of 1RM may be related to hormonal and metabolic responses antagonistic to the decline in blood glucose stimulated to high-intensity exercise \\[15\\]. Guelfi et al. \\[16\\] state that， metabolic and hormonal responses， elevated catecholamine and growth hormone levels， may contribute to avoiding a decline in blood glucose levels at the beginning of recovery， since these hormones stimulate increased hepatic glucose production and inhibits insulin-mediated glucose\\[16\\]. One study that compared responses to glucose levels in high-intensity interval aerobic training vs. moderate-intensity aerobic training demonstrated a drop in blood glucose in both protocols， but glucose levels in interval training high intensity remained stable during recovery due to the hormonal versus regulatory response， which it did not occur in moderate training， where glucose levels continued to fall \\[16\\].**\n\n【64】**Despite the benefits of physical exercise， one of the biggest concerns when relating physical exercise and DM1 patients is the risk of hypoglycemia \\[16，17\\]. However， unlike continuous mild to moderate exercise， in high-intensity exercise the occurrence of hypoglycemia does not is frequent \\[17\\]. Exercises with anaerobic component (weight lifting/resistance exercises， sprints and high intensity interval training) reduce the risk of hypoglycemia during and after physical exercise in DM1\\[1\\].**\n\n【65】**Processes regulated by independent insulin mechanisms are generally preserved when people with diabetes engage in high-intensity work. These processes include normal increases in glucose production and disposition during and immediately after exercise， as well as a normal rate of decline in glucose production after exercise. Since glucose production is mainly controlled by catecholamine’s， current data suggest that physically fit patients with insulin-dependent diabetes can exercise vigorously and exercise require high-intensity workloads \\[18\\] Catecholamines (epinephrine， nor epinephrine， dopamine) exhibit effects excitatory and inhibitory effects of the peripheral nervous system and actions in the Central Nervous System(CNS)， in addition to modulation of endocrine function， such as insulin secretion and glycogenolysis rate \\[17，18\\].**\n\n【66】**The findings of the present study revealed that in strength training at 40% 1RM， glycemic levels showed a continuous drop in the moments during training and immediately after training which occurred due to muscle contraction that is one of the factors responsible for the greatest GLUT4 activity. However， in the 80%1RM strength training session there was an increase in capillary glycemia above pre-workout levels， which can be justified by the**\n\n【67】**regulatory action of the hormones responsible for the production of liver glucose， even so， the higher intensity strength training was able to promote glycemic drop at the end of the training session to lower levels than with the pre-workout moment. Strength training can also be prescribed because it has a lower risk of hypoglycemia in addition to promoting increased muscle strength and cross section that only the high intensity of strength training can promote \\[13\\].**\n\n【68】**Conclusion**\n\n【69】**It is concluded that in this case study， for this participant， both training protocols showed a drop in capillary glycemia values at the end of the training session， however the protocols showed different behaviors during the session， where the strength training at 40% of1RM. The fall happened continuously， while in strength training at80% of 1RM there was an increase in blood glucose during the session and then a fall in capillary blood glucose levels， which demonstrate that different intensities will result in different physiological responses.

It is isolated from patients receiving broad spectrum of antibiotics or long-term urinary catheter carriers. Its identification is one of the biggest challenges facing the laboratory because it is usually missed in routine urine cultures since it does not grow well after an overnight incubation. Thus， its diagnosis is often delayed due to the need for specific culture media， staining techniques and electron microscopy. Herein， we report one patient with clinical suspicion of Corynebacterium urinary infection. However， the isolation of the pathogen was highly demanding. The aim of this case report is to highlight the need of a multidisciplinary approach to diagnose this pathogen and the establishment of protocols to make easier its diagnosis.**\n\n【13】**Keywords： Infection； Encrusted cystitis； Urinary stones； Corynebacterium Lipophile**\n\n【14】**Introduction**\n\n【15】**Encrusted Cystitis (EC) is a rare form of Urinary Tract Infection (UTI)， especially in children\\[1\\]. Is characterized by bladder， ureteral and pelvic encrustations causing pain， bladder necrosis and occasionally renal failure or death. Such encrustations are usually composed of ammonium magnesium phosphate and calcium carbonate-apatite crystals \\[2，3\\].**\n\n【16】**Corynebacteria Species (CS) are the cause ofthis pathology； they are gram-positive slow-growing bacillus characterized with a strong urease activity infecting the lower and upper urinary tract \\[4\\]. CS are frequently selected by repeated broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy and are nosocomial acquired \\[2\\].**\n\n【17】**EC is treatable， but its diagnosis is often delayed. Despite suggestive symptoms and imagining features， diagnosis of EC is challenging given the need for specific culture media， staining techniques and electron microscopy \\[5\\]. There is no consensus of treatment， but multiple options have been suggested based on three complementary elements： Antimicrobial therapy； acidification of urine， chemolysis and elimination of encrustations \\[6，7\\].**\n\n【18】**Here in， we report the importance of a multidisciplinary work between urologist， radiologist， microbiologist， anatomopathologist and infectiologists. After a clinical suspicion， specific staining techniques and electron microscopyare needed for its identification. In addition， due to its multiple resistances and the tissue adherence， the antibiotic treatment may be insufficient， and a multiple approach is needed.**\n\n【19】**An 18-year-old woman， with 10 years of repeated history of UTI， visited the urology department referring hypogastric pain， painful urination， and bladder stones expulsion. Normal uroflowmetry without postvoid residual urine. Laboratory workup did not reveal any clinically significant findings， except alkaline urine (pH 7.8). Standard urine culture was negative. Stone composition analysis revealed ammonium magnesium phosphate (struvite). CT pelvic scan showed thickening and calcification of the bladder wall (Figure 1). The patient went through an endoscopic transurethral resection， multiple solid neoformations coated by calcifications were resected (Figure**\n\n【20】**Figure 1： Basal CT scan showing an irregular thickening and calcification of the right bladder wall (arrow).**\n\n【21】**Figure 2： Endoscopic image during bipolar endoscopic resection into the bladder. Ulcer with fibrin easily friable tissue and calcifications fixed to the bladder mucosa were resected.**\n\n【22】**2). Anatomopathological analysis revealed intense mononudear leukocyte infiltration with focal calcified encrustations (Figure 3). The procedure exacerbated the pain.**\n\n【23】**Prompting a diagnosis ofEC， with pathogenic agent identification missing， a second endoscopic transurethral resection was performed. The anatomic pathology revealed again an intense mononudear leukocyte infiltration with focal calcified encrustations. Resected tissue culture for CU revealed few copies of the bacillus suggesting that urine cultures may be positive for CU infection. To confirm the species identification， PCR and sequencing was performed on the 18S ribosomal gene DNA of the bacteria isolate revealing a Corynebacterium Lipophile Group F1.**\n\n【24】**We started a combined therapy with levofloxacin 500 mg every 24haccordingtoantibiogram results，L-metionine and acetohidroxamic acid (125 mg every 8 h). Three weeks later an endoscopic removal was performed. After one month， the symptoms of frequency， urgency and suprapubic pain disappeared. Urinalysis was normal. Ultrasonography did not show any calcification of the bladder wall.**\n\n【25】**Discussion**\n\n【26】**Many urea-splitting bacteria are responsible for EC， but CU (or Corynebacterium group D2) are the most frequent causative agent\\[5\\] and can be isolated from different samples including urine， blood and expelled encrustations in urine \\[8，9\\]. This fastidious and opportunistic slow-growing microorganism can be missed in routine cultures， requiring enriched media and prolonged cultures(>48 h). Hence， clinical suspicion should be communicated to the**\n\n【27】**Figure 3： Anatomic pathology image revealing active chronic cystitis. Bladder wall histalagy after resection of calcified encrustations shows three distinct zones： A necrotic layer containing calcified encrustations (Depasits of (magnesium ammanium phosphate)). an inflammatory layer containing bacterial colonies， lymphocytes and polymorphonuclear cells， and normal tissue.**\n\n【28】**microbiologist when samples are sent for culture \\[10\\]. Another factor contributing to the delayed diagnosis is the lack of familiarity with EC and diphteroids reputation as colonizers \\[5\\].**\n\n【29】**Progress in molecular taxonomy (DNA-DNA hybridization and 16S rRNA sequencing) and in chemotaxonomy has profoundly modified the classification of Corynebacterium species. Amplified rDNA analysis， and amplification of the 16S-23S gene spacer regions can differentiate between species that are difficult to be differentiated by biochemical reactions \\[11，12\\]. In our case， resected tissue culture revealed few copies ofthe bacillus suggesting that urine cultures may be positive for CU infection. To confirm the species identification， PCR and sequencing was performed on the 16S ribosomal gene， revealing a Corynebacterium lipophile group F1.**\n\n【30】**The correct identification is important because the antimicrobial susceptibilities of different coryneform bacterial isolates are quite variable \\[13\\]. In addition， antibiotic therapy must be administered with urinary acidification 7，14.Endoscopiccresection of encrustations appears necessary to remove bacteria within calcified plaques (especially when cannot be dissolved by urine acidification therapy). This combined therapy should least until the mucosa is completely recovered and repeated urine culture is negative.**\n\n【31】**Conclusion**\n\n【32】**Encrusted cystitis is not a life-threatening disease but is a very painful condition. The delayed diagnosis and drug resistance of CU makes its treatment arduous. The identification of CU is one of the biggest challenges facing the laboratory and its diagnosis demands a multifocal approach. We fall upon the importance of establishing circuits to diagnose these patients as soon as possible when there is a clinical suspicion.**\n\n【33】**References**\n\n【34】**1\\.

Up to now， inclusive education was considered as “children with special needs and ordinary children study and live together in the same physical space， and enjoy equal， non-discriminatory and high-quality education”\\[2\\]. In the 1990s， China carried out the work of learning in regular class for children with disabilities \\[3\\]. With the vigorous implementation of learning in regular class， its quality had attracted more attention. Two periods of special education promotion plans had been issued successively， aiming to put forward requirements for running special education well in the new era and caring for special children. On December 31，2021，the General Office of the State Council forwarded“14h Five-Year Plan\"Special Education Development and Upgrading Action Plan， which clearly pointed out that it was necessary to explore an inclusive education model that could adapt to the common growth of children with disabilities and ordinary children， and promote the integration of children with disabilities and ordinary children \\[4\\]. The importance of inclusive education could be clearlyseen. However， in the implementation ofinclusive education， “along with the class but just sitting “mixed study with class and students reflux frequently occurred \\[5\\] and the teaching effect of inclusive education had always been questioned. Therefore， how to improve the quality of inclusive education is more and more important.**\n\n【17】**_Copyright @ 2022 Fu W. This is an_ _open access article distributed under_ _the Creative Commons Attribution_ _License， which permits unrestricted_ _use， distribution， and reproduction in_ _any medium， provided the original work_ _is properly cited._**\n\n【18】**Relevant studies had found that inclusive physical education could promote the active communication behavior of special children， stabilize emotions， reduce problem behaviors， improve social communication and social adaptation ability \\[6-8\\]， realize life care for students weak in sports， promote students' all-round development， and promote education equity \\[9\\]. Therefore，**\n\n【19】**improving the quality of inclusive physical education could not only promote the physical and mental healthy growth of special and ordinary children \\[10，11\\]， but also promote the overall development of inclusive education in China. The direct implementers of inclusive physical education were physical education teachers， who determined the quality of inclusive physical education. Among them， the inclusive education competency of physical education teachers played an important role \\[3\\]. Teachers’ competency referred to the basic conditions and abilities that teachers had to engage in educational and teaching activities \\[3\\]. Relevant studies had found that， compared with physical factors such as class size， environment and students'personal factors， teachers competencyplayeda moreimportantrolein students learning performance \\[12\\]. Inclusive education put forward new requirements for teachers’ qualities， including the concept， knowledge and skills of inclusive education， so as to meet the needs of special children and ordinary children receiving education under the same roof \\[3\\]. On the basis ofprevious studies， this study defined the inclusive education competency of physical education teachers as the basic conditions and abilities that physical education teachers needed to have when carrying out inclusive physical education teaching activities， including professional attitude， professional knowledge， professional skills and the capacity ofacquiring supports.**\n\n【20】**To sum up， the development of inclusive physical education in China was still in its initial stage. A large number of studies remained in the exploration of inclusive physical education theories， and the relevant research on improving the quality of inclusive physical education was few. High-quality inclusive physical education could not only promote the physical and mental development of special children， but also realize the care for the life of special children， so that special children could enjoy life. While there are few studies pay attention on the inclusive education competency of physical education teachers. In order to provide practical implication for improving the quality of our inclusive physical education， this study analyzed the factors influencing the inclusive educational quality of physical education teachers in primary and secondary schools based on the analysis of the inclusive education quality of P.E. teachers in primary and secondary schools.**\n\n【21】**Method**\n\n【22】**Participants**\n\n【23】**P.E. teachers in primary and secondary schools were selected as the subjects by convenient sampling throughout the country. It covered 20 provinces， including the northeast， east， central and west， with a total of 317 people. After screening， 286 valid questionnaires were obtained， with an effective rate of 90.2%. Sample information was shown in Table 1.**\n\n【24】**Measures**\n\n【25】**On the basis of the “Questionnaire on Professional Quality of Teachers in Compulsory Education”compiled by Wang Yan et al.\\[3\\]， a preliminary questionnaire was prepared. In order to investigate the structure of the questionnaire and the expression of the items， five primary and middle school P.E. teachers and one special education expert were consulted for their opinions. After adjusting the items and expression， the questionnaire on Inclusive Educational Competency of Primary and Middle School P.E. Teachers was formed. The questionnaire consisted of the basic information of the subjects and the status quo of inclusive education competency. The first part was the basic information of the subiects. The contents include gender，**\n\n【26】**province， school district， education background， teaching age， study section， taught special children or not and the length of training related to inclusive education. The second part was the core content of the questionnaire， which was the current situation of the inclusive education competency. It was divided into four parts with a total of28 questions. Part one， professional attitude， 9 questions； Part two， professional knowledge， 6 questions； part three， professional skills， 7questions； part four， capacity of acquiring supports， 6 questions. The questionnaire used a five-level scoring method. According to whether the respondents agreed with the item description， the options were divided into \"strongly agree\"， “relatively agree\"， “not sure\"， “not quite agree” and “strongly disagree\"， which were respectively scored 5，4， 3， 2 and 1 points. The higher the score， the higher the inclusive education competency of the teacher. The reliability analysis of the questionnaire showed that the internal consistency coefficients of the four factors of professional attitude， professional knowledge， professional skills and capacity of acquiring supports were 0.931，0.951， 0.958 and 0.952， respectivelyy..The internal consistency coefficient of the total questionnaire was 0.968， indicating that the reliability of the questionnaire was good. The construct validity of the questionnaire was tested， and the KMO value was 0.937， and the significance level of chi-square value of Bartlett sphericity test was P=0.000<0.001， so this questionnaire was suitable for exploratory factor analysis. The principal component analysis method was used to extract the common factors， and the maximum variance method was used to rotate the factors. Finally， four common factors were extracted，and the cumulative variance contribution rate was 78.58%. Confirmatory factor analysis of the questionnaire was performed， the result found 区/df=1.416， p<0.001， GFI=0.968， AGFI=0.922， RMSEA=0.051， showed that the questionnaire structure validity is good.**\n\n【27】**Data analysis**\n\n【28】**In this study， the data wereobtainedbydistributing questionnaires， carefully screening questionnaires and eliminating extreme values and outliers. SPSS 26.0 software was used to test the reliability and validity of the data and analyze the differences.**\n\n【29】**Results**\n\n【30】**P.E. Teachers inclusive education competency**\n\n【31】**In order to investigate the scores of each dimension of the inclusive education competency of the subjects， Table 2 showed the mean and standard deviation of the scores of each dimension.Among them， the score of professional attitude dimension of P.E. teachers was significantly higher than that of professional knowledge (t=8.639， p<0.001)， professional skills (t=4.903， p<0.001) and capacity of acquiring supports (t=6.296，p<0.001)， and the score of professional knowledge dimension was significantly lower than that ofprofessional skills (t= -5.664， p<0.001). and the capacity of acquiring supports (t=-3.873， p<0.001). The score of professional skills was higher than that of the capacity of acquiring supports (t=1.980，P<0.05).**\n\n【32】**Difference analysis of P.E. teachers inclusive education competency**\n\n【33】**Under different background variables， the differences of inclusive education competency of P.E. teachers were analyzed， and it was found that there were no significant differences in gender， school district and study section， while the statistical test results of four background variables， teaching age， taught special children or not， and the cumulative duration of training related to inclusive education，**\n\n【34】**Table 1： Demographic information of the participants (N=286).**\n\n| **Teacher's information**  | **h**  | **100%**  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Gender**  |  |  |\n| **Male**  | **228**  | **79.7**  |\n| **Female**  | **58**  | **20.3**  |\n| **The school district**  |  |  |\n| **City**  | **204**  | **71.3**  |\n| **Town**  | **58**  | **20.3**  |\n| **Village**  | **24**  | **8.4**  |\n| **Education background**  |  |  |\n| **Master degree or above**  | **40**  | **14**  |\n| **Undergraduate**  | **242**  | **84.6**  |\n| **Junior College and below**  | **4**  | **1.4**  |\n| **Teaching age**  |  |  |\n| **Novice (0~5 years)**  | **142**  | **49.7**  |\n| **Skilled (6-15 years)**  | **80**  | **28**  |\n| **Expert (over 16 years)**  | **64**  | **22.4**  |\n| **Study section**  |  |  |\n| **Primary school**  | **82**  | **28.7**  |\n| **Junior high school**  | **90**  | **31.5**  |\n| **High school**  | **114**  | **39.9**  |\n\n【36】**Table 2： The general situation of inclusive education accomplishment of P.E. teachers in primary and secondary schools.**\n\n| **Dimensions**  | **M±SD**  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Protessional attitude**  | **4.08±0.79**  |  |\n| **Protessional knowledge**  | **3.41±0.97**  |  |\n| **Professional skills**  | **3.73±0.89**  |  |\n| **Capacity of acquiring supports**  | **3.64±0.90**  |  |\n| **Inclusive education competency**  | **3.76±0.74**  |  |\n\n【38】**reached the significant level. Furthermore， one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was conducted on the length of training related to inclusive education， and independent sample t-test was conducted on whether the children with special needs had been taught up (Table3，4).**\n\n【39】**We found on the teaching age background variables， novice and expert P.E. teachers in professional knowledge dimension and the capacity of acquiring supports dimension of dab at significantly higher scores of P.E. teachers， in general， the novice and expert P.E. teachers' education quality is significantly higher than for a master type fusion of P.E. teachers’ education quality. In terms of the background variable of whether brought special children or not， P.E. teachers who have brought special children have significantly higher scores in all dimensions of inclusive education competency than those who have not brought special children. P.E. teachers who have brought special children have higher inclusive education competency. In terms of the background variables of cumulative duration of inclusive education-related training， the scores of P.E. teachers who have received inclusive education-related training in the three dimensions of professional knowledge， professional skills and capacity of acquiring supports were significantly higher than those who have not received inclusive education-related training. However， the length of time receiving inclusive education-related training had**\n\n【40】**no significant effect on the inclusive education competency of P.E. teachers. In general， the inclusive education competency of P.E. teachers who had received inclusive education-related training was higher than that of P.E. teachers who had not received inclusive education-related training.**\n\n【41】**Discussion**\n\n【42】**P.E. Teachers’ inclusive education competency**\n\n【43】**The study found the inclusive education competency of physical education teachers in Chinese primary and middle schools needed to be further improved. Among the four dimensions， professional attitude scored the highest， followed by professional skills， capacity of acquiring supports， and professional knowledge scored the lowest.**\n\n【44】**In the professional attitude dimension， most P.E. teachers held a positive attitude towards inclusive physical education. They generaly believed that special students should receive physical education on an equal basis with ordinary students. They also believed that special students and ordinary students attending classes together was conducive to the social development of special children and the alleviation of social discrimination against special groups， which could also have a certain positive impact on the physical and mental development of ordinary students.**\n\n【45】**In the professional knowledge dimension， most P.E. teachers believed that their theoretical knowledge of inclusive education was not enough. On the one hand， they did not know much about the relevant policies， laws and regulations of inclusive education， on the other hand， they did not master the specific teaching methods of inclusive physical education and did not have the knowledge of how to analyze and adjust the psychology of special children. The reason for this problem was that most physical education teachers usually graduated from the major of physical education， while students majoring in physical education in China had not received the study of inclusive physical education related knowledge \\[13\\]. In addition， 72percent of teachers had no post-service training related to inclusive education. Therefore， there was a lack of inclusive education and other relevant training in both pre-service training and post-service training systems， which hindered the accumulation of teachers professional knowledge and further affected the improvement of teachers'inclusive education quality.**\n\n【46】**In the professional skills dimension， the score of professional skills was significantly lower than the score of professional attitudes， but higher than the score of professional knowledge and capacity of acquiring supports. Some P.E. teachers believed that they lacked the ability to adjust the teaching objectives and teaching strategies according to special students in P.E. teaching， and they had low self-efficacy in implementing group cooperative learning and effective management for special students. The lack of training related to inclusive education would have a negative impact on theaccumulation of professional knowledge， as well as the promotion of professional skills. However， the score of the dimension of professional skills was higher than that of the dimension of professional knowledge and capacity of acquiring supports. The reason was that， on the one hand， professional skills could accumulate practical experience in physical education and improve by imitating other teachers or professional teachers. On the other hand， most physical education teachers had not participated in the inclusive physical education teaching or the training of relevant professional knowledge and skills， which led to their lack of understanding of the actual classroom teaching situation，**\n\n【47】**Table 3： Summary of descriptive statistics of different teaching years， special children and training duration in each dimension.

classroom teaching， which could result in a high score of the dimension of professional skills.**\n\n【53】**In the capacity of acquiring supports dimension， the score of capacity of acquiring supports was only higher than that of professional knowledge. On the one hand， the lack of professional knowledge of physical education teachers could affect their capacity of acquiring supports. Lack of understanding of relevant policies， laws and regulations could affect teachers'understanding of the channels through which they can obtain relevant support. On the other hand， due to the traditional examination evaluation system for pursuing higher education， physical education teachers paid more attention to the physical education examination of all students， but ignored the children with special needs， which limited the initiative ofteachers to**\n\n【54】**Influencing factors of P.E. Teachers' inclusive education competency**\n\n【55】**Difference of inclusive education competency of P.E. Teachers with different teachingage： First， we analyzed the inclusiveeducation competency of P.E. teachers with different teaching age. It was found that different teachingages werethe main factors affecting the inclusive education quality of primary and secondary school teachers. On the whole， the inclusive education competencyof novice P.E. teachers was significantly higher than that of skilled P.E. teachers， and the inclusive education competency of expert P.E. teachers was significantly higher than that of skilled P.E. teachers. Generally speaking， the longer they had been teaching， the longer they had received training related to inclusive education， and the more likely they were to improve their**\n\n【56】**inclusive education competency. Therefore， the longer they had been teaching， the higher their integrated education competency was. However， the data of this study showed that the longer the teaching time， the higher the inclusive education competency was not necessarily. The score of inclusive education competency of skilled teachers was the lowest， while the score of novice teachers (0 to 5 years of teaching) and expert teachers (more than 16 years of teaching) had no significant difference. Relevant studies had found that skilled teachers (who have been teaching for 6 to 15 years) were in the most serious stage of job burnout \\[14\\]. Teachers in this stage had negative emotions towards work and low sense of self-efficacy， resulting in the lowest inclusive education competency. Novice teachers were relatively rich and skilled in theoretical knowledge and skills， and had a high sense of self-efficacy. Moreover， they might not have been exposed to inclusive education-related work， leading to high scores. Constrained by their original thoughts and limited training， expert teachers held a negative attitude towards such a form of education and were unwilling to adjust their teaching strategies to promote the development of inclusive physical education \\[15\\]， resulting in a low score of their inclusive education competency.**\n\n【57】**In terms of experience of teaching children with disables， we found that “taught special children or not\"had a significant impact on the inclusive education competency of P.E. teachers. The scores of physical education teachers who had taught special children in all dimensions of inclusive education competency were significantly higher than those who had not taught special children. Through interviews of physical education teachers who had taught special children， it was found that physical education teachers who had taught special children had certain teaching experience， had certain understanding of the characteristics of physical and psychological development of special children， and could adjust teaching strategies and teaching methods so that all students could adapt to physical education， so as to show high inclusive education competency. Relevant studies also showed that teachers' experience in inclusive education was an important factor affecting teachers' attitude toward inclusive education， and experienced teachers had more positive attitudes \\[16\\]. The quality of education experience had a significant impact on teachers'attitudes towards inclusive education. Teachers with successful inclusive education experience had a more positive attitude than teachers without successful inclusive education experience \\[17\\]. Continuous contact with special children could also improve teachers’ professional knowledge and skills related to inclusive education， to a certain extent， so as to improve their inclusive education competency.**\n\n【58】**Influence of training on inclusive education competency for P.E. Teachers： It was found that whether they had received training related to inclusive education had a predictive effect on the inclusive education competency of physical education teachers， and the inclusive education competency of physical education teachers who had received relevant training was significantly higher than that of physical education teachers who had not received relevant training. Generally speaking， the longer the relevant training time， the higher the inclusive education competency of teachers would be. However， the results ofthis study showed that there was no significant difference in the inclusive education competency of teachers who received training within one month and more than one month， which was consistent with the research results of Wang \\[5\\]. Through interviews with teachers who have participated in relevant training， this study found that the reasons for this situation could lie in the following**\n\n【59】**two points. First， the training content was too shallow. The training related to inclusive education mostly stayed on the concept， without real and systematic teaching. Second， teachers lacked practical exercise. The training content was completely lecture-style without practical training， which hindered the improvement of inclusive education competency.**\n\n【60】**Practical Im plications**\n\n【61】**Firstly， enhance support for P.E. teachers implement inclusive education. Relevant studies showed that external adequate support could improve teachers' attitude towards inclusive education \\[18\\]， and thus improve their inclusive education competency. Therefore， this study suggested that physical education teachers should be equipped with sufficient external support to carry out inclusive physical education， so as to promote the improvement of inclusive education competency of physical education teachers. First， improve the construction of resource classrooms to ensure that every school had at least one resource classroom. Resource classroom was the most important part of inclusive education. The resource classroom was also equipped with special resource teachers who had rich experience in special education. Under such a condition， improving the construction of resource classrooms could not only provide individualized education for students with special needs， but also promote the mastery of knowledge and skills of ordinary physical education teachers and improve their inclusive education competency.Second，bring in a variety of sports equipment. Various kinds of equipment could be customized to meet the needs of different special children， to promote the steady progress of the teaching plan.**\n\n【62】**Secondly， increase the pre-service and post-service training on inclusive education for P.E. teachers. It was found in the survey that teachers who had received training related to inclusive education had significantly higher inclusive education competency than those who had not received training， and inclusive education courses for pre-service physical education teachers could improve their self-efficacy when teaching special children \\[19\\]. Therefore， carrying out training related to inclusive education was the key to improve the inclusive education competency of physical education teachers， mainly in the following two points. First， improve the pre-service training. Relevant content such as inclusive education and special education should be embedded into the compulsory curriculum system of physical education major. Relevant teaching content could be learned from western countries to improve the pre-service training system. Second， improve post-job training. Experts and scholars related to inclusive education and special education were invited to compile training programs. In terms of content， due to the strong practical characteristics of physical education， it was necessary not only to have reasonable teaching content with increasing difficulty， but also to have practical operation content， so that physical education teachers could fully explore and understand relevant theories in practice， but also to ensure frequent training and promote the specialization of post-service training.**\n\n【63】**Thirdly， incorporate the inclusive education competency into teacher assessment of P.E. Teachers. As a baton， evaluation could effectively intervene teachers’actions， and the school’s reward mechanism was an important factor affecting teachers' enthusiasm\\[20，21\\]. Therefore， this study suggested that inclusive education competency should be included in teacher assessment to enhance the external motivation of physical education teachers to improve inclusive education competency.**\n\n【64】**Author Contributions**\n\n【65】**Conceptualization， Methodology， Writing - Original Draft Preparation， Rui Xue； Formal Analysis， Resources and Data， Review and Editing， Hongqin Chai； Investigation， Danxu Zhuand Rui Li； Supervision，Review and Editing， Wangqian Fu.**\n\n【66】**Funding**\n\n【67】**The paper was funded by the Special Fund for Basic Scientific Research of Central Universities in 2021 (No.2021NTSS34).**\n\n【68】**References**\n\n【69】1\\.

There are limited studies that explore health professionals’views on screening or perceived barriers to the screening process.**\n\n【14】**Aim： The aim of this study was to discuss the health professionals’views of psychosocial screening and assessment who work in the private obstetric sector.**\n\n【15】**Methods： Semi-structured face-to-face interviews were completed with 11 midwives， 1 social worker and 2 obstetricians. Three hospital sites were chosen， of which only one currently screens women for psychosocial risk factors. Thematic analysis was applied to interview transcripts. Three researchers then discussed reoccurring themes and a consensus in themes and subthemes was reached.**\n\n【16】**Results： Only one hospital was screening women and had midwives trained in psychosocial assessment including depression screening. There were mixed views on the process and barriers to screening were identified， e.g.， lack of support systems， cultural barriers， inaccurate answers， power barriers with obstetricians， husband interference， fear and powerlessness. Benefits were recognized： early identification of difficulties， standardization and patient-focused care. Concerns were，however， also evident： suicide ideation， intrusiveness of questions， whether women responded honestly， not wanting to screen all women.**\n\n【17】**Conclusion： There was an identified concern by midwives that obstetricians did not take seriously any concerns highlighted by the midwife about women’s psychosocial problems. There was a sense of a lack of ownership'of the women， therefore a feeling of helplessness in addressing their needs. Suggestions were made： appropriate education and training of midwives， flagging high risk women， more in-house resources and external resources/community links and employing a central midwife with interest and expertise in psychosocial screening.**\n\n【18】**Keywords： Psychosocial assessment； Private sector； Health professionals**\n\n【19】**Introduction**\n\n【20】**Women are not universally or routinely screened ante-or postnatally for psychosocial risk factors， depression and anxiety in the private sector in Australia. There are limited studies that explore health professionals'views on screening or perceived barriers to the screening process.**\n\n【21】**Methods**\n\n【22】**The studies conducted for this thesis were approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee(HREC) of the University of Sydney approval number， 15315. Interviews were completed in a focus group format or face-to-face. Interview questions were analyzed using thematic analysis and were verified by a second person. Thematic analysis was undertaken by identifying concepts or experiences and then combining and cataloguing the related patterns into sub-themes \\[1\\]. This process was performed by three researchers who then discussed common themes and a consensus in themes and subthemes was reached. Thematic analysis was used \\[2\\]. The style of Qualitative Analysis employed resembled that described by Burnard \\[1\\] and more recently termed editing analyses by Polit and Beck \\[2\\]. As the researchers conducted the interviews， they kept field notes that were used to contextualize the data and contributed to the commencement of data analysis.**\n\n【23】**Results**\n\n【24】**Group 1： Booking-in midwives**\n\n【25】**The midwife includes the psychosocial assessment as part of her usual antenatal clinical interview. Her role is to assess all women at booking-in for psychosocial risk factors and offer referral as needed. The booking-in visit is conducted in a private room with the woman， her partner and midwife present. The partner could be asked by the midwife to leave the room to ensure privacy.**\n\n【26】**Only those midwives who had attended the Perinatal Mental Health Assessment (Introductory Training) could participate in the study， enroll women to the study， gain their consent and conduct the screening using the Clinical Care Guideline package. During the booking-in visit， women who had consented to be part of the study were asked a series of psychological questions and also given an Edinburgh Perinatal Depression Scale to complete \\[3\\].**\n\n【27】**It is generally accepted that， in an English-speaking population， an EPDS score of 10-12 suggests the respondent may meet criteria for minor depression； a score 13-18 suggests she would probably meet criteria for depressive illness： 19-30 indicates a higher degree of distress and complexity， possibly including depressive illness， but also including other factors， such as a positive score on question 10(self-harm). Women are offered follow-up according to established referral pathways.**\n\n【28】**Group 2： Obstetricians and other health professionals**\n\n【29】**_Health_ professionals (obstetricians， midwives， general practitioners， social workers， psychologists， early childhood nurses) involved in delivering care to study participants as above were asked to contribute their views on the effectiveness/suitability of the clinical care guideline package following implementation， using semi-structured interviews.**\n\n【30】**Midwives and obstetricians were then interviewed in focus groups or individually to ascertain the appropriateness of the psychosocial screening questions， as well as any concerns， suggestions and other issiles.**\n\n【31】**Group 3： Private hospital midwives**\n\n【32】**Interviews were commenced with midwives working at other private hospitals (in addition to the primary study site) to ascertain their views on the effectiveness/suitability of antenatal psychosocial questioning. Early detection and appropriate referral are the main aims of data collection， with a view to establishing Commercial-in-Confidenceevidence for implementing routine， universalscreening in this setting. Midwives at each facility (as well as those at the study site) were invited to share their experiences of the antenatal psychosocial and depression screening of women through voluntary participation in semi-structured qualitative interviews (Table 1).**\n\n【33】**Them es**\n\n【34】**Benefits of psychosocial screening**\n\n【35】**We need to know： A dominant theme among all midwives consenting to interview was related to the benefits of screening women for psychosocial issues. The midwives indicated that this type of information was not only helpful but necessary for them to give the best possible care to women.**\n\n【36】**Midwives spoke of the “need to know” to be able to provide a comprehensive service and holistic care to women. They felt the experience of questioning women offered the opportunity to ask**\n\n【37】**questions， to debrief and provide tailored care.**\n\n【38】**For example， midwives spoke of answers to the psychosocial questions giving them a “heads up”(M1) or\"flags going up\"(M2) or“opening things up”for further discussion.**\n\n【39】**Midwives comments； “We get the heads up that there are issues”“It is invaluable”. We can put supports in place for women， it opens things up\". It allows us to look for issues and explore them with the women\"(midwife 1).**\n\n【40】**Yes， apart from looking after the body， we are looking after the spirit and mind as well. These women are not stupid： mostly career women (midwife 2). Yes，\"If you don’t ask， you won’t know\"(midwife3).**\n\n【41】**Consistency： Another major sub-theme within the benefits of screening concerned the consistency of approach in asking the questions. For example， “We can display empathy for the women if we are aware of their issues\". The benefit of a consistent approach rather than self-selecting who to interview was evident， “Women are consistently asked the questions， all on the same page. It gives them the opportunity to disclose\"(midwife 5).**\n\n【42】**“It is less threatening if it is standardized**\n\n【43】**“It helps us tailor the care to meet their needs”**\n\n【44】**Risks of not screening： Midwives were asked directly about the benefits and risks of not screening. Midwives indicated that the benefits outweighed the risks. For example： Yes， “There are no risks， only benefits， if we don’t ask and they have a history of self harmits our duty\". (Midwife 1) and， “No benefits in NOT asking them. If we don’t we miss someone at risk\" (midwife 3). Although there was an expressed sensitivity around asking the screening questions，“However， they may be uncomfortable being asked these questions\".“If we don’t ask， we won’t know， for example-DV. We can plead ignorance if we don’t ask， as we are not aware\" (midwife 4) “I’m in two minds， as some women want to disclose and others dont. I think that they should given a choice/elect to answer the questions\".“The risk of not asking them is that they will get no help， may have prolonged PND or suicide\"(midwife 5).**\n\n【45】**Barriers to screening**\n\n【46】**No training/experience in how to screen： Midwives identified a lack of training and experience in how to screen women. Only one of the three sites had received any training in psychosocial screening. For example， “Staff feeling uncomfortable and being inexperienced. There is no antenatal clinic. No staff with mental health training. An antenatal clinic would allow rapport building. Also， the husbands are present”(Midwife 3). Some midwives noted that they needed to screen regardless of their lack of training and therefore relied on experience or a “gut feeling. “We have to rely on our experience to detect issues”.“But some of the midwives don't have the experience to do this”.**\n\n【47】**“I think that the postnatal midwives needtraining， they administer an EPDS but often don't know how to score it or what is considered high risk and when to refer\".**\n\n【48】**The husband： Some midwives highlighted the issue of the husband being present. Some husbands stayed in the room to interpret for the woman or were not asked to leave by the midwife.“The problem is that often the husbands come and we don't ask them to leave， that’s the way we have always done it； the booking in. “We**\n\n| **Table 1： Themes.**  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Theme**  | **Subtheme**  | **Quotes**  |\n| **Benefits of psychosocial** **screening**  | **We need to know**  | **\"We would know where they are at， so that we can help them\".** **It you don't ask， you won't know.**  |\n|  | **Consistencv**  | **\"lt helps us tailor the care to meet their needs'** **\"The advantage is having that background information on the woman\".No benefits in NOT asking them.

There was a concern expressed by midwives that they often could not speak to the women on their own as the husbands refused to leave when the woman was being interviewed.**\n\n【51】**The obstetrician：Attimes，the obstetrician was viewed as abarrier by the midwives in their attitudes. For example， “The obstetricians， they are often defensive\"， “the obstetricians， they have a sense of ownership of the women\". There was also a concern that when the midwife did in fact high light a woman’s psychosocial issues to the obstetrician that it was not taken seriously.“Sometimes they fob vou off when you identify an issue and alert them- the obstetricians\"，“We are often left in the dark about a woman’s problems\"， “We rely on the obstetricians to document but they often write nothing.**\n\n【52】**Other themes**\n\n【53】**They lie/fear： There was a reported concern by midwives that women were not honest with the results of questioning. For example， However， some women lie， they will talk if they want help，“The women can lie and not admit that they have problems”(midwife1). Woman may also fear any potential consequences of disclosing issues，“Some women don’t want to know about community services as there is a fear attached，i.e.，DOCS (FACS)”，“They hide their issues， some come here to hide from DOCS， they come under a false name and don’t want to go to the public system because of DOCS”. This is referring to FACS-Family and community services who have to capacity to remove the baby from the mother).**\n\n【54】**They don’t want to disclose- the women， they are high powered38 to 40 year old women that often run big businesses/are high flyers and are used to being in control\".**\n\n【55】**Midwife barriers： Some midwives expressed concern about the psychosocial questions. “Some questions are a bit odd： that is**\n\n【56】**awkward'(Midwife 2). There was also concern about discomfort in asking the questions or receiving uncomfortable answers， difficult responses include： mother passed away； patient estranged from family； half a dozen said abused as a child； someone with trauma in first delivery so has come to private hospital this time； infertility； lack of support. Interestingly some midwives indicated that they could either determine which women warranted asking the psychosocial questions， or that women should indicate that they wanted to be screened. “I don’t think that we should screen all women， the odd one may say that they wanted to be asked the questions”.**\n\n【57】**A social worker expressed concerns with the booking-in process at a hospital.“Certain midwives are more receptive to assisting women than others. Most women here dont seem to disclose at booking in. I get the majority of referrals postnatally when they stay for 3-4 days and a more attuned midwife picks up that there might be a problem. Things need to change here”(SW). The answer-“Change the booking in midwife and educate the midwives.**\n\n【58】**Lack of awareness： Another sub-theme indicated a concern that women were neither attuned to the psychosocial questions nor understood their relevance， “They are often unaware of the connection between their past history and their present status/effect\".**\n\n【59】**Language can be a barrier， e.g.， some Asian women： a few women are very business-like (midwife 2).**\n\n【60】**Lack of time： Time was seen as an additional pressure in psychosocial screening. “It takes a long time to screen the women”(midwife 1). “They book in online” “The pressure on staff， time”(midwife 5).**\n\n【61】**Enough supports**\n\n【62】**A subtheme emerged around a lack of resources and supports for women once positively screened. “We don’t have a social worker； we don’t have enough supports for the women\". When asked**\n\n【63】**whether there was enough support for women one midwife replied，“Sometimes you need to call the obstetrician several times before something is done to help the women， but you just need to keep onto them， the obstetricians.**\n\n【64】**General comments**\n\n【65】**“The psychiatrist may retire soon and I don’t know if she will be replaced”(midwife 4).**\n\n【66】**We only have 1 useless psychiatrist and 1 social worker； they help a bit at least(midwife 3).**\n\n【67】**\"We need better follow-up”**\n\n【68】**“We can’t refer； we just let the obstetrician know”**\n\n【69】**“We do follow-up with the child and family health nurse and flag women if we are concerned”**\n\n【70】**Further suggestions about the psychosocial screening process/procedure?**\n\n【71】**As mentioned by the NUM， it would be good to talk to the women more postnatally， including debriefing (midwife 2).**\n\n【72】**“Ongoing support/training so that staff can repeat the EPDS\". We need an update(midwife 3).**\n\n【73】**“More access to public health services would be helpful”(midwife4).**\n\n【74】**“Sometimes the fathers look depressed； I suppose we could also give them an EPDS?”**\n\n【75】**“I think that we could re-administer the EPDS during antenatal classes at 32/40 approx， as often concerns come up in the classes. These concerns may not have been there at 12-20 weeks when we book them in”.**\n\n【76】**“Our midwives are older here and attuned to women's needs due to their life experience， they have been there， done that， had their families”However， the postnatal midwives would not know how to score； use or flag an EPDS score so need training”.**\n\n【77】**“If we are concerned postnatally we often ask the husband what the woman is normally like”**\n\n【78】**“We need a social worker， just for this unit**\n\n【79】**“We need a community link for the women”**\n\n【80】**“We need to be clear of the referral pathways to help a woman， instead of feeling lost\".**\n\n【81】**“The antenatal classes may be an opportunity to educate the women about psychosocial issues， however， we have such a poor**\n\n【82】**attendance at these classes， as women view them as only for a woman wanting/booking in for a natural birth， not a C/S. Midwives in the obstetricians’ rooms could screen/support the women also. The women need to book in earlier and if they are identified as at risk we could see them again\"(Midwife 3).**\n\n【83】**Discussion**\n\n【84】**At the time of the study， only one other private hospital in Sydney was screening women and their midwives were trained in psychosocial assessment. There were mixed views on psychosocial screening and barriers to screening were identified. Benefits were also identified：early identification of problems， standardization and patient-focused care. However， midwives also expressed concerns： suicide ideation， intrusiveness of questions， “some women lie\"， not wanting to screen all women， lack of support systems， cultural barriers， and inaccurate answers， power barriers with obstetricians， husband interference， fear and powerlessness. Relevant suggestions were made： appropriate and adequate education， training and support of midwives； flagging high risk women； more in-house resources and external resources community links， and employing a central midwife with interest and expertise in psychosocial assessment and screening. Midwives had various views on the program. Some felt that it was within their work role， others did not. Some were fearful of what could be revealed by the woman and how to deal with it. There was an identified concern that obstetricians did not take seriously any concerns highlighted by the midwife about a woman's psychosocial difficulties. There was a sense of a lack of ownership’of the women， therefore a feeling of helplessness in addressing their needs. Some midwives indicated an interest in a woman's perinatal mental health/psychosocial risk factors；however others expressed a concern that this was not part of their role. This highlights the need to educate and support midwives working in the private sector on their important role in enhancing the perinatal mental health of women in their care. Their role includes potential for prevention， early intervention and health promotion to benefit not only the woman but her child， partner and family.**\n\n【85】**References**\n\n【86】**1\\. Burnard P.

If in the 1980s the main concern was the cervical cancer in the last 30 vears interest shifted towards the uterine cancer due to its high incidence and the difficulties for an early diagnostic and therapy， not only due to the sever comorbidities that appear in elderly woman. Today uterine cancer is the 2nd most common female genital cancer after breast cancer. Through the vears the incidence between cervical cancer and endometrial cancer changed from 9：1 to 2：1 in favor of the cervical cancer to 1：3in favor of uterine cancer. The ratio changed due to early diagnosis of precancerous lesions of the cervix and due to higher life expectancy in woman \\[1-4\\].**\n\n【23】**The positive diagnosis for endometrial cancer is based on the symptomatic triad： Obesity， hypertension and diabetes which is associated with bleeding in pre- and post-menopause.**\n\n【24】**The Gold standard for the diagnosis for endometrial cancer is the histopathological exam after diagnostic dilation and curettage.**\n\n【25】**During the 1980s the ultrasound examination became one of the best screening tests for endometrial cancer due to the evolution of the ultrasounds \\[5，6\\] (Figures 1-4).**\n\n【26】**Materials and Methods**\n\n【27】**A number of 112 patients in pre or post menopause which underwent and diagnostic dilation**\n\n【28】**Figure 1： Vaginal US， Glandular cystic hyperplasia.**\n\n【29】**Figure 2： Glandular cystic hyperplasia Hex100.**\n\n【30】**Figure 3： Endometrial hyperplasia.**\n\n【31】**Figure 4： Endometrial endometrioid adenocarcinoma.**\n\n【32】**and curettage during one year were taken into account for our study.

The cases were classified in groups according to the results of the histopathology analysis and the thickness of the endometrium.**\n\n【43】**Table 1 and 2 show the endometrial thickness resulting from the ultrasound examination for the six groups of histopathological results， seen from two perspectives： As a continuous numerical value(expressed with range， mean， and standard deviation) and as a rank value (expressed as six disjoint ranking intervals)， respectively.**\n\n【44】**The endometrial thickness was compared for the patients with endometrial cancer vs. those with endometrial hyperplasia， but statistical significance was not reached for the present sample of cases(t=1.04， df=44，p=0.31).**\n\n【45】**On the other hand， the endometrial thickness was significantly different for the cases with glandular cystic hyperplasia compared to the patients with a proliferative endometrium (t=3.094， df=44， p=0.0036\\*\\*).**\n\n【46】**Endometrial cancer and the hyperplasia of the endometrium were considered as pathological so we further compared the variations and changes in the endometrium separately within this group of cases and the benign ones (i.e.， endometrial polyps， proliferative activity or atrophy). Sensibility and specificity were calculated.**\n\n【47】**Table 3 and 4 show the results of independence statistical testing for the pathology and the benign group， respectively. The Monte-Carlo method was applied for the Chi-square test. For both groups， results proved a very significant association between the histopathological examination results and the ultrasound results regarding the endometrial changes.**\n\n【48】**From this study results that an endometrium with a thickness smaller than 4 mm excludes any pathological lesion in our study in9.82% of the cases.

Circumferential detachment of the Right Coronary Artery (RCA) ostium was detected intraoperatively. The proximal RCA was dissected， the intimal RCA was circumferentially detached with inner intussusception， and only adventitia was partially connected to the aortic root. Instead of performing coronary artery bypass grafting surgery to the RCA， direct RCA implantation to the Valsalva ascending graft was performed after repairing the dissected lumen of the proximal RCA. Cardiopulmonary bypass weaning was smooth， and no complications related to the RCA were observed.**\n\n【12】**Keywords： Aorta； Aortic dissection； Acute aortic syndrome**\n\n【13】**Introduction**\n\n【14】**Retrograde aortic root dissection toward the coronary ostium is uncommon. However， acute myocardial ischemia is a potentially fatal condition in this situation， and repairing dissected coronary arteries to prevent myocardial malperfusion is very important. In this case， we repaired dissected Right Coronary Artery (RCA) ostium and directly reimplanted it to the aortic root rather than Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting (CABG).**\n\n【15】**Materials and Methods**\n\n【16】**A 52-year-old male patient was admitted due to acute-onset seizure-like movement. Chest Computed Tomography (CT) revealed an acute type A aortic dissection from the aortic root to the descending aorta. The intimaltear site on chest CT was expected to reach the ascending aorta (Figures1A-1C).No abnormalities were detected in another preoperative work-up， and Electrocardiography(ECG) showed a normal sinus rhythm without ST-segment abnormalities. Thus， we planned an emergent surgery.**\n\n【17】**Cardiopulmonary Bypass (CPB) was made via the left femoral artery and right atrium after median sternotomy. Then， a total circulatory arrest was performed at 26.5C rectal temperature and underwent direct cardioplegia infusion. Hemiarch replacement distal anastomosis was also performed using a 26-mm Gelweave (Vascutek，Inchinnan， United Kingdom) graft under selective cerebral perfusion guidance. Furthermore， proximal ascending aorta anastomosis was also planned. However， we found that aortic dissection should involve the RCA ostium， and the intimal layer of the RCA ostium was circumferentially detached from the aortic root (Figure 2A，2B). The intimal layer of the RCA was found to have inner cylinder intussusception. Thus， CABG was planned after RCA ostium ligation. However， we decided that direct reimplantation of the RCA ostium can be performed. Thus， the surgical plan was changed. First， the proximal aortic root anastomosis was performed using a 28-mm Gelweave\" Valsalva graft. Then， the dissected layers around the RCA ostium are carefully mobilized and conjoined with the reinforced continuous over-and-over suture using a 7-0 monofilament polypropylene suture (Prolene’， Ethicon， Raritan， USA) (Figure 2C). The false lumen of the dissected RCA was utterly obliterated， and the RCA ostium was directly anastomosed to the Valsalva portion using the Gelweave~ Valsalva graft (Figure 2D). CPB weaning was smooth without ST abnormalities on ECG. No anastomosis-related complications， including bleeding and postoperative myocardial infarction， and no ST abnormality changes occurred in the intensive care unit. The RCA morphology was also examined with coronary CT after moving the patient to the general ward， which revealed no stenosis or visible intimal flap around the RCA(Figure 1D). In addition， no ECG abnormalities were observed during the follow-up.**\n\n【18】**Figure 1： A-C) Preoperative computed tamography scan findings.

(LCC： Left Caronary Cusp，RCC： Right Caranary Cusp).\n\n【21】**Discussion**\n\n【22】**Although retrograde aortic root dissection toward the coronary ostium is relatively uncommon， the incidence of coronary malperfusion in acute type A aortic dissection is reported to range from 5.7% to 11.3% \\[1，2\\] with a high mortality rate \\[3\\]. However， surgical outcomes depend on the degrees of myocardial damage， intraoperative appropriate coronary revascularization， and postoperative management for low cardiac output. Coronary malperfusion by acute type A aortic dissection may not be easily detected even intraoperatively. Moreover， the degrees of coronary**\n\n【23】**malperfusion， including thelocation and size， the existence of reentry， and the flow pattern may affect the onset and severity of coronary malperfusion \\[4\\]. In this patient， the RCA ostium transection was not detected in preoperative CT， and no evidence of myocardial injury was observed preoperatively. Furthermore， no cardioplegia injection complications were encountered intraoperatively.**\n\n【24】**This study showed that direct reimplantation of the transected coronary artery to the aortic graft in acute type A aortic dissection is a feasible option. Neri et al. \\[3\\] distinguished three main types oflesions based on the dissection flap extension within the coronary artery in**\n\n【25】**widely varied situations， i.e.， from the isolated ostial dissection to the circumferential detachment with inner intussusception； this case was classified as type C (circumferential detachment with an inner cylindrical intussusception). CABG could be a treatment option for this type； however， it should only be considered as a rescue procedure for competitive flow and coronary re-dissection risk with complete graft-dependent perfusion of large myocardial territories \\[3\\]. Considering the long-term patency of the vein graft on CABG， coronary reattachment after the repair is the first treatment option. The transected RCA ostial tissue was very friable but showed10a relatively dense appearance after an over-and-over reinforcing suture surrounding the RCA ostium with careful tissue mobilization sufficient to reimplant the aortic graft. Furthermore， the Valsalva graft was used to shorten the distance between the transected RCA ostium and graft to reduce coronary tension. Cabrol procedure \\[5\\]， use of a semicircular hood pericardial patch \\[6\\]， or saphenous vein reconstruction \\[3\\] can also address coronary tension. However， in this case， the Valsalva graft was a better option because it can sufficiently shorten the distance between the transected RCA ostium and graft without requiring additional anastomosis time as compared to other options.**\n\n【26】**In summary， direct reimplantation of the transected coronary artery using Valsalva graft in acute type A aortic dissection can be performed in selected patients and is expected to have good long-term surgical outcomes.**\n\n【27】**References**\n\n【28】**1\\.

Due to the latest evidences， endometrial cancer molecular characterization results crucial for proper risk stratification.**\n\n【14】**A young woman with G1 endometrioid endometrial cancer diagnosed by hysteroscopy was treated conservatively. After cancer persistence， she underwent radical surgery for advanced disease. Post-hoc immunohistochemical analysis was performed comparing the first-diagnosis biopsy (mismatch repair deficiency) to surgical specimen (mismatch repair proficiency). Interestingly， not only the cancer changed biochemically， but it also shifted from a confined tumor to an advanced disease with bulky lymph nodes and negative endometrial infiltration. Eventually， the patient was diagnosed with Lynch syndrome.**\n\n【15】**A wiser evaluation of the mismatch repair deficiency should have guided to the proper therapeutic algorithm， also suggesting genetic tests. This case report represents an encouragement to further investigations on molecular assessment as a predictor for endometrial cancer risk stratification in conservative management.**\n\n【16】**Keywords： Cancer； Endometrium； Fertility； Genital Neoplasms； Immunohistochemistry**\n\n【17】**Introduction**\n\n【18】**Endometrial Cancer (EC) is the fourth most diffuse malignancy in developed countries， also representing the most common gynecological cancer \\[1\\]. In about 80% of cases， EC is diagnosed when the disease is still confined to the uterus. Though total hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy is considered the standard treatment， a conservative management， consisting in oral or intra-uterine progesterone with or without hysteroscopic endometrial resection and follow-up biopsies every 3 to 6 months， is recommended in women desiring off spring \\[2\\]. Although considered a safe approach， a subgroup of patients shows no cancer regression， recurrence or progression to more advanced stages \\[3\\]. For this reason， the study of new molecular markers able to predict response to conservative treatment is extremely important. Only a few small-population studies investigated the role of Mismatch Repair status (MMR) as a promising predictor marker for conservative treatment outcomes \\[4-6\\]. In this case report， we aim to bring to attention the peculiar clinical history of a young woman diagnosed with Mismatch Repair deficiency (MMR-d) EC on hysteroscopic biopsy， treated conservatively， with a atypical disease persistence： Complete local response with spreading of cancer to pelvic and aortic Lymph Nodes (LNs)， with concurrent molecular switch into MMR-proficient immunophenotype.**\n\n【19】**Case Presentation**\n\n【20】**Medical history**\n\n【21】**A 37-year-old woman in good clinical conditions is referred to our attention.

The patient was prescribed Medroxyprogesterone acetate and a three-monthly follow-up plan with pelvic transvaginal ultrasound and scheduled hysteroscopies was programmed. In September 2018 endometrial biopsy resulted in EAH. This finding was confirmed in the following endometrial sampling in January 2019. The patient was advised to continue Medroxyprogesterone acetate and an intrauterine progesterone-medicated device (IUD) were positioned. In May 2020， the follow-up biopsy was diagnostic for G1 eEC. At ultrasound， an 11 mm x9 mm x 11 mm hyperechogenic endometrial tissue at the uterine fundus and a minimal irregularity of the endometrial-myometrial margin at the anterior uterine wall were identified. Nevertheless， an additional endometrial biopsy in September 2020 was negative. The following histological examination in December 2020 confirmed a G1 eEC.**\n\n【28】**Transvaginal ultrasound (December 2020)**\n\n【29】**Endometrium was 5 mm thick and the medicated-IUD properly positioned. Ovaries appeared normal and no endopelvic effusions or dilatation of the renal pelvis were visible. At the aortic bifurcation，on the right， a hypoechogenic， inhomogeneous， a vascular formation of**\n\n【30】**12 mm x7 mm with regular margins was identified. Other formations with the same ultrasonographic features were visible at the left external iliac vessels (16 mmx13mm)and at the left external iliac vessels (16mmx10 mm and 9 mmx10 mm). The abovementioned lesions were to be referred in the first hypothesis to lymphadenopathies.**\n\n【31】**Chest-abdomen-pelvis TC scan with intravenous contrast(January 2021)**\n\n【32】**A 1.5 cm solid nodule suspected for lymphadenopathy was detected at the right iliac bifurcation. Along the internal iliac vessels， solid and uneven bilateral formations of 2.5 cm， suspected for pathological LNs， were identified. Non-confluent LNs of up to 1 cm was observed in the inguinal-femoral region bilaterally.**\n\n【33】**Oncofertility counseling**\n\n【34】**The patient was counseled on the clinical indication of a radical surgery. Once informed， the patient voluntarily chose to keep both ovaries.**\n\n【35】**Surgery (February 2021)**\n\n【36】**The patient underwent laparoscopic Querleu-Morrow class a radical hysterectomy， bilateral salpingectomy， ovarian suspension， systematic pelvic lymphadenectomy and removal of intercavoaortic lymphadenomegaly. Before hysterectomy， a cervical injection of indocyanine green 1 cc per side was performed， for which no fluorescent sentinel LN was identified. Lymphadenomegalies of 3cm were identified in the external iliac and obturator region on the**\n\n【37】**right， and internal iliac area on the left. Hence， a bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy was performed. On examination of the para-aorto-caval region， a lymphadenomegaly of 2 cm was found at the interaortocaval level and removed. Ovaries were fixed to the psoas muscle fascia bilaterally. Surgery time was 158 min with minimal blood loss and no intraoperative complications. The postoperative stay was regular， with no complications， and the patient was discharged after three days.**\n\n【38】**Histological examination**\n\n【39】**Macroscopic， microscopic and Immunohistochemical Analysis(IHC) were performed.**\n\n【40】**Macroscopic and microscopic examination： The uterus was removedwithbothtubes. At theendometrialfundus， araised，necrotic hemorrhagic area of 1.5 cm was observed. Thrombized vascular structures and associated chronic inflammation with multinucleated foreign-body giant cells were recognized in its context. No residual tumor or endovascular neoplastic emboli were detected. The adjacent endometrium appeared atrophic with associated stromal pseudo-decidualization. The cervix was affected by chronic cervicitis with foci of superficial squamous and glandular metaplasia， with no evidence of neoplastic infiltration. Salpinges were negative. Out of 7 pelvic LNs removed， 2 were positive for EC metastases (1/5 at the right and 1/2 at the left). The bulky LN removed at the paraaortic region was positive for EC secondary disease.**\n\n【41】**Immunohistochemistry： We compareddIHC of thefirst endometrial biopsy performed in our center (September 2017) with IHC performed on the surgical specimen (February 2021).**\n\n【42】**Results from the comparison are shown in Table 1. IHC staining pattern for the first biopsy (September 2017) are shown in Figure 1.**\n\n【43】**Inguinal LNs examination**\n\n【44】**Due to the clinical and radiological suspicion on bilateral inguinal LNs， the patient underwent ultrasonographic-guided biopsy of one left inguinal LN localized at the 1st level of Daseler， which was the node with the most worrisome features (confluent with subverted ultrasonographic structure). Biopsy was negative for EC metastases. Nevertheless， in consideration of the highly suspected ultrasound characteristics， the patient was referred for nodal surgical staging in March 2021， during which a bulky left inguinal LN was removed and studied intraoperatively. Intraoperative analysis was negative for secondary EC disease； therefore a systematic aorticlymphadenectomy anda radicalization of the previous pelvic lymphadenectomy were performed for staging purposes. Eventually， at the definitive histological examination， over 6 aortic， 3 pelvic and 1 inguinal LNs removed， none was positive for EC metastases.**\n\n【45】**Genetic analysis**\n\n【46】**Considering the woman's family history， personal history and the aforementioned IHC features， the patient underwent germinal genetic test， which turned out to be diagnostic for Lynch syndrome.**\n\n【47】**Adjuvant treatment**\n\n【48】**In consideration of FIGO stage IIIC2， the patient was referred for adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy.**\n\n【49】**Discussion**\n\n【50】**In this case report we describetheclinicalhistoryofa youngpatient with MMR-d EC conservatively treated， with disease progression duringhormonaltreatment. We comparedtheIHC features ofthe first**\n\n【51】**diagnosis biopsy with the ones on surgical specimen. Interestingly， we identified some relevant differences： on the 2017 endometrial biopsy， tumor cells exhibit MMR-d immunophenotype， whereas the 2021surgical specimen shows features of MMR-p immunophenotype. It is crucial to underline that not only the cancer has changed from a biochemical perspective， but it has also concurrently shifted from a macroscopically confined tumor (early stage) to an advanced disease with bulky aortic and pelvic LNs. Noteworthy， we observed a complete local response to treatment， with no evidence of tumor on uterine samples， with parallel spreading of EC to pelvic and aortic LNs. A post-hoc germinal genetic examination was performed and the patient was diagnosed with Lynch syndrome.**\n\n【52】**These data need to be reframed in perspective of the ProMisE classifier， which outlines four molecular groups of EC with different prognosis： 1) POLE-mutated (POLE-mt， goodl prognosis， very high mutational rate and mutations in the exonuclease domain of Polymerase-e)；2) Mismatch Repair-deficient (MMR-d， intermediate prognosis， high mutational rate and microsatellite-instability)； 3) p53-abnormal (p53-abn， poor prognosis， TP53 mutations， low mutational rate and high somatic copy number alterations rate)；4) p53-wild-type (p53-wt， good-to-intermediate prognosis， low mutational and somatic copy number alterations rates) \\[7-9\\]. In their retrospective study， Chung et al. analyzed how mismatch repair status influences response to EC fertility-sparing treatment \\[4\\]. Among 57 patients， 9 (15.8%) had MMR-d on endometrial biopsy obtained before progesterone treatment. Results show that patients with MMR-d had a significantly lower complete response rate than those with MMR-p/p53-wt in terms of best overall response (44.4%vs. 82.2%) and complete response rate at 6 months (11.1% vs. 53.3%)， concluding that molecular classification has a prognostic significance in EC fertility sparing management， thereby enabling early risk stratification. An Italian study by Falcone et al. \\[5\\] investigated on the molecular features of 25 patients with EC conservatively treated\\[5\\]， stating that ProMisE classifier application on resectoscopic specimens could be a pragmatic model for stratifying genetic risk of women with EC. Specifically， in the group of MMR-d conservatively-treated patients， for a 50% of women the presence of such mutations correlates withh；a worse outcome (persistence/progression or metachronous Lynch syndrome associated tumors). A retrospective Italian study of Raffone et al. \\[6\\]， investigated the association between MMR status and resistance rate to conservative treatment， recurrence rate and MMR-d reliability in predicting the risk of recurrence \\[6\\]. Endometrial samples from 69 young women affected from AEH or mucosal-confined EC were collected before conservative approach and IHC features were examined. Results show that 8.7% of women was MMR-d. For this subset of patients， resistance to treatment was more common compared to p53-wt group (33.3% vs. 15.9%) with no statistical significance (p=0.2508) and recurrence after a complete regression occurred significantly more commonly than WOI p53-wt women (100% vs. 26.4%，p<0.0001). Moreover，MMR-d status was found to be a highly specific predictive marker for recurrence(sensitivity =22.2%， specificity =100%) \\[10，11\\]. Moreover， Zakhour et al. \\[12\\]， observed that in young women with loss of MMR proteins by IHC there was a higher incidence of invasive cancer and a lower incidence of resolution with progestin therapy \\[12\\].**\n\n【53】**According to the few available evidences \\[8，10-12\\]， MMR-d status seems to be related to lower response rate to treatment， higher risk of recurrence and worst prognosis compared to p53-wt. Considering this， we may deduce that a wiser evaluation of molecular the MMR-d**\n\n【54】**status should had guided to the proper therapeutic algorithm for the patient of this case report： The study of personal and family history with Lynch Syndrome blood test， a closer and more intensive follow-up program or a different surgical management.**\n\n【55】**This case-report spontaneously arisesquestions about the possibility to apply molecular classification in young EC patients management. The study of the role of MMR status by IHC may represent apotential stand-alone predictor marker for risk stratification in this subset of patients： EC offspring-desirers with MMR-d should be managed more intensively with the inclusion of II-level imaging in their follow-up schedule， contrariwise p53-wt women could be followed-up in accordance with current guidelines.**\n\n【56】**Further andlarger studies are needed for a deeper understanding of these phenomena and for a wiser application of its potential.**\n\n【57】**References**\n\n【58】**1\\.

It is commonly used to lower the risk of stroke and systemic embolism in non-valvular atrial fibrillation and for the treatment of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism \\[1\\]. In addition， it has recently been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) after the COMPASS trial， which showed a 24% risk reduction of maior cardiovascular events in patients with chronic coronary artery disease and peripheral artery disease \\[2\\]. The most common adverse effect of Rivaroxaban is related to the increased risk of bleeding. We are reporting the sixth case of spontaneous splenic rupture caused by Rivaroxaban. Written permission to publish this case was obtained from the patient.**\n\n【12】**Case Presentation**\n\n【13】**A 66-year-old gentleman with a background of hypertension and chronic atrial fibrillation， treated with Enalapril 20 mg (two times daily)， Bisoprolol 5 mg (once a day) and Rivaroxaban 20mg (once a day)， was admitted to the Emergency Department with abdominal pain， nausea， and vomiting. He was a smoker but denied any alcohol intake.**\n\n【14】**On examination， he was tachycardic (115 bpm)， hypotensive (BP 70/50 mmHg)，had abdominal distention with tenderness in the epigastrium and left hypochondrium. Fluid resuscitation was commenced with crystalloids，and a Noradrenaline infusion was started via a PICCline (Peripherally Inserted Central Venous Catheter). Initial blood tests revealed Hemoglobin (Hb) of 11 g/dL with a normal platelet count (150.000/pL)， and a coagulopathy \\[Prothrombin Time (PT) 43%， INR 1.93， activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT) 50 sec and fibrinogen 1.43 g/dL)\\]. Arterial blood gas sampling confirmed metabolic acidosis (pH 7.22， PO， 93 mmHg and PCO， 35 mmHg) and a Computed Tomography (CT) of the abdomen/pelvis with intravenous contrast was undertaken， revealing a splenic rupture with a moderate hemoperitoneum (Figure 1A，1B). The patient re-affirmed there was no trauma prior to the onset of abdominal pain. A repeat full blood count was performed and confirmed a significant decrease in Hb(5.7 g/dL) and hematocrit (17.6%). Two units of Red Blood Cells (RBC) were transfused immediately， and the patient transferred to the operating room for emergency laparotomy and splenectomy.**\n\n【15】**An arterialline inserted prior to induction revealed severe hypotension (50/20mmHg) requiring administration of small boluses of intravenous Adrenaline (5 ug +5 ug). General anesthesia was initiated with a rapid sequence induction (Etomidate 18 mg， Fentanyl 150 ug， Rocuronium 80 mg). Intubation was uneventful， and anesthesia was maintained with Sevoflurane and Remifentanil. A percutaneous sheath introducer with a 8.5 French was inserted under US guidance into the right internal jugular vein to facilitate rapid administration of blood products. Four units of RBC and three units of Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP) in addition to 500 mL of colloids and 500 mL of crystalloids were required during surgery aiming to stabilize the patient and reverse the coagulopathy. A total splenectomy was performed， and after safe extubation in the operating room， was transferred to the intensive care unit. His postoperative course was uneventful and successfully discharged home seven days later.**\n\n【16】**Discussion**\n\n【17】**Rivaroxaban has a rapid onset of action with a relatively predictable pharmacokinetic profile and a relatively short plasma half-life making initiation， maintenance， and discontinuation of anticoagulant therapy considerably more comfortable than with traditional oral anticoagulants. It is highly protein-bound (92% to 95%) with renal excretion at 36%， and in contrast to other new anticoagulants as Dabigatran， dialysis is not effective for its removal.**\n\n【18】**Table 1： Management of bleeding secondary to Rivaroxaban.**\n\n【19】**Rivaroxaban Moderate bleeding： action Severe bleeding： action**\n\n|  | **Fluid replacement.** **Give blood cells if Hb<8 mg/dL** **Give platelets (if <70.000/pL or if patient is taking an** **antiplatelet drug)** **Tranexamic acid iv (15-30 mg/kg) +/- continuaus infusion (1** **mg/kg/h)** **面 Consider Prothrombin complex 50 lUikg， repeat if necessary**  | **Add recombinant factor Vlla (Novoseven@-100 pg/kgby lV bolus)； repeat if necessary\\*2** **Give Andexanet alfa if available\\*3** **·Bolus 800 mg at 30 mg/minute.** **·Within 2 minutes following the bolus dose， administer** **the continuous iv infusion 8 mg/min for up to 120minutes.**  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n\n【21】Half dose could be an option if there is no a life-threatening bleeding scenario\n\n【22】**Figure1A，1B：CTabdomen/pelvis with contrast showing active extravasation from the spleen with a large subcapsular hematoma and hemoperitoneum.**\n\n【23】**In 2019 the update of the AHA/ACC/HRS in the guidelines for the management of patients with atrial fibrillation， Rivaroxaban is now recommended over warfarin for stroke prevention \\[3\\]. There is， at present， no consensus on the best methodology for assessing Rivaroxaban activity in vivo and hence no guiding dosage. Unlike traditional oral anticoagulants， traditional coagulation tests cannot be used to assess or adjust dosing. At therapeutic concentrations， Rivaroxaban has a relatively weak influence on the PT；however， it is more profound at higher concentrations， with a good correlation between prolongation of the PT and plasma concentration.**\n\n【24】**Although hemorrhage iiss the significant adverse effect of Rivaroxaban， unfortunately， there is no immediate reversal agent currently available. Although Andexanet alfa has been approved by the FDA， for reversal of anticoagulation in life-threatening or uncontrolled bleeding in patients treated with Rivaroxaban， it is not available in many countries. Therefore， other measures should be taken to treat significant hemorrhage (Table 1).**\n\n【25】**Conclusion**\n\n【26】**Rivaroxaban's datasheet details no reference to spontaneous splenic rupture due to its use； however， this is the sixth case report of spontaneous splenic rupture in a patient， with no history of trauma， treated with Rivaroxaban.**\n\n【27】**A pharmacologic interaction could be the potential cause of an increase in activity ofRivaroxaban resulting in major hemorrhage. An interaction between amlodipine and telmisartan/hydrochlorothiazide**\n\n【28】**was reported as a cause of hemorrhage in a previous case report \\[4\\]. An interaction between amiodarone， a P-glycoprotein inhibitor and Rivaroxaban has also been reported as a cause of spontaneous splenic rupture 5\\].**\n\n【29】**It’s well known that the higher risk of bleeding exists when Rivaroxaban is used in combination with antiplatelet agents， particularly in the elderly or in the presence of renal dysfunction. Specifically， of the case reports described previously one had aspirin as a potential cause and another reported renal dysfunction as the potential cause \\[6\\]. Similar to the case we are reporting， another could not ascertain a potential cause \\[7\\]. We believe there are significant numbers for the pharmaceutical manufacturer to mention splenic rupture in the datasheet and doctors need to be made more aware of this severe complication of patients prescribed Rivaroxaban \\[8\\].**\n\n【30】**References**\n\n【31】**l.

We made approach with CT scan thorax and abdomen， with the findings of pleural effusion without parenchymal lung metastases， without pleural thickening， and**\n\n【28】**Figure 2： Sagittal US image of the uterus shows a thickened echo genic endometrium with thickness of 18.5 mm.**\n\n【29】**peritoneal carcinomatosis with uterine enlargement. Transvaginal echography shows endometrial thickness with 18.5 mm associated with free fluid in abdominal cavity (Figure 1 and 2). Thoracentesis， paracentesis and endometrial office biopsy were done， revealing papillary serous adenocarcinoma. With multidisciplinary tumor board (surgicaloncologist，medicaloncologist，pneumologist， thoracic surgeon) we decided to make Video Assisted Thoracic Surgery (VATS) for histologic confirmatory diagnosis and as palliative procedure for her respiratory symptoms with systematic pleurectomy， physical， surgical and chemical pleurodesis， and the findings were only pleural effusion， no lung entrapment or lung parenchymal metastases， no visceral and no parietal pleura involvement.**\n\n【30】**Pathology report**\n\n【31】**Pleural biopsy without tumoral activity with inflammation(Figure 3 and 4)， cytologic analysis with metastatic papillary adenocarcinoma cells (CK7+/PAX8+/WT1+/CA125+) (Figure 5 and6).

We consider the relevance to this communication for the concurrent presentation with unilateral pleural effusion without pleural involvement (parietal and visceral) and without lung**\n\n【37】**parenchymal affection， with peritoneal carcinomatosis， in a stage IV endometrial carcinoma with aggressive subtype.**\n\n【38】**Discussion**\n\n【39】**Endometrial Carcinoma (EC) is the most common malignant tumor of the female tract， and only 2% to 4% are disseminated at the diagnosis (mostly aggressive subtypes， as clear cell and serous papillary). Usually the EC has a lymphatic involvement with pelvic and para-portico nodules affection， and hematogenous spread to distant organs. There are few studies with the full description of pleural and/or lung metastases incidence. Bristow et al. reported 45%of cases with EC and extra-abdominal disease， with pleural cytology positive and previously Bransheid et al. \\[4\\] in 414 patients found2.2% of uterine and ovarian primary tumors \\[2-4\\]. Several years ago， it was believed that the metastatic carcinoma to the pleura， in more than 50% of the cases were of endobronchial tumoral emboli in the pulmonary artery， suggesting terminal disease， even it was thought that bilateral affection was related to hepatic metastases \\[4\\].**\n\n【40】**The pleural fluid is produced about 0.26 ml/kg/day body weight， and when there is an imbalance between production and absorption， results in pleural effusion， for example in the cases of metastatic disease， there are carcinosis， with malignant cells on the parietal and visceral pleura， encouraging the abnormal production of pleural fluid， often with lung parenchymal metastases in the elderly stages of the malignant disease with dismal prognosis. It has been estimated the 15% of malignant neoplasm can develop pleural effusion as a resultant pleural and/or pulmonary invasion for cancers of the thorax and extra thoracic sources as colorectal， kidney， gastric， pancreatic， prostate， and genital tract \\[5\\]. It is important to mention， that， it is most common to find lung metastases than only pleural affection， obviously with pleural effusion， so， the malignant cells can reach this location by direct extension or systemic spread or， even through lymphatic channels in the diaphragm， and they have several types of presentation：**\n\n【41】**a. Solitary pulmonary nodule**\n\n【42】b. Multiple pulmonary nodules\n\n【43】**c. Tumoral emboli**\n\n【44】**d.Endobronchial metastases**\n\n【45】**e. Pleural effusion.**\n\n【46】**These lung metastases are the principal location of extra pelvic dissemination in EC， with 2.3% to 4.6%， or even 25% of the other gynecological cancers， and the parenchymal nodules are the most common finding (30% to 60% by uterine tumors) in the metastatic lung disease， tending to be peripheral， multiple， basal location， in high blood flow areas， or even， there can be cavitation. But the only pleural affection with pleural effusion， nodularity or thickness is an infrequent finding \\[6-10\\].**\n\n【47】**The peritoneal cavity has a dynamic state of the peritoneal fluid， with circulation thanks to the breathing movements， peristalsis and abdominal pressure fluctuation， and absorption through the lymphatics channels on the right diaphragm； its oncologic relevance data from 961， with Morton et al.， being the first to report malignant cells in peritoneal washings \\[11\\].**\n\n【48】**There is no consensus (respect a que?) in patients with concurrent malignant pleural effusion and malignant ascites in the metastatic settings， however， the management of the present case， is according with the palliative procedures like pleurodesis， pleurectomy， etc. and the use of cytotoxic systemic therapy with chemotherapy \\[12\\].**\n\n【49】**Conclusion**\n\n【50】**EC is the most common gynecological neoplasm and the mostly affected in the metastatic context， the thoracic cavity， with lung and pleural disease， with parenchymal invasion (mainly aggressive subtypes).**\n\n【51】**The most interesting finding in this case was the absence of pleural and parenchymal lung affection， having only cytologic as thoracic as abdominal metastases confirmation， considering the possibility of spread through lymphatic channels on the left side diaphragm， another important issue， with only one pleural cavity affected. There would be necessary to implement pleural biopsy (parietal and visceral) and cytologic examination to rule out or confirm ser， for its optimal management.**\n\n【52】**References**\n\n【53】**1\\.

A caesarean section was performed on a lady aged 28 who was carrying twins. She had been scheduled for a hybrid Spinal-Epidural Procedure (CSEA). After several ADP injections at the T12/L1 level， spinal anesthesia with hyperbaric bupivacaine 9 mg and fentanyl 15 g was delivered via the L3/4 interspace； however， analgesia only reached the T12 level. If bupivacaine leaked into the epidural space along with the CSF through the damaged dura， it would be responsible for the lack of analgesia. Under general anesthesia， the scheduled procedure went off without a hitch. If there is significant CSF leakage during spinal anesthesia in pregnant women following ADP， the anesthesia level may not grow as planned.**\n\n【7】**Keywords： Accidental dural puncture； Spinal anesthesia； Combined spinal-epiduralanesthesia； Cerebrospinal fluid； Failed spinal anesthesia**\n\n【8】**Introduction**\n\n【9】**Post-Dural Puncture Headache (PDPH) is hypothesized to be caused by Cerebrospinal Fluid(CSF) leaking following an epidural， and Accidental Dural Puncture (ADP) is a complication of epidural anesthesia that can lead to PDPH.

When the Tuohy needle was progressed around 5 cm with a median approach， however， ADP occurred and CSF flowed forcefully. Next， an effort was made to implant an epidural catheter at T11/12， however gradual CSF leakage was noticed from the Tuohy needle. A second puncture was performed at T11/12， but CSF leakage was discovered， thus the epidural catheter was not inserted. A 25-G pencil-point needle was used to provide spinal anesthetic from L3/4. 1.8 ml of 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine and 16 g (0.4 ml) of fentanyl were delivered upon confirmation of CSF reflux by regurgitation at about 5.5 cm needle depth. After eight minutes in the supine head-down tilt posture， the patient's anesthetic level had only grown to T12. The patient was subsequently moved into the left lateral position and 1 ml of 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine was injected from L3/4. However， the patient continued to feel discomfort in the lower abdomen after 18 min， therefore the surgery was conducted under general anesthesia. The abdomen X-ray following surgery revealed no lumbar deformity. After surgery， the patient continued to experience severe headaches for more than three weeks. Two years later， the patient was scheduled for a second caesarean surgery. Spinal anesthesia was delivered with 2 ml of0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine and 15 g (0.3 ml) of fentanyl using a 25-G pencil point needle inserted at L3/4， attaining an anesthetic level of T5 this time.**\n\n【19】**_Copyright C 2023 Harmilan K.

However， even after repeated injection of bupivacaine， analgesia**\n\n【22】**remained insufficient， and there might be various reasons for this. Bupivacaine may have been injected outside the subarachnoid area， notwithstanding the confirmed backflow of CSF. The CSF collected in the epidural space following dural puncture may have been aspirated into the spinal needle implanted from L3/4 and bupivacaine may have been administered into the epidural space due to a misconception that the spinal needle had been appropriately advanced into the subarachnoid space. It might have been accomplished. In this case， however， such a situation could be ruled out since the anesthetic level climbed to T12 following medication administration， indicating that pharmaceuticals were administered into the subarachnoid area， and the backflow of cerebrospinal fluid was unquestionably from the subarachnoid space. In clinical situations， even anesthetic solutions that are administered into the epidural area are not easily aspirated. Arachnoid cyst may have been one of the causes of spinal anesthesia failure \\[1\\]， which would not have occurred because spinal anesthesia administered two years later was successful. A second option is that some of the bupivacaine delivered to the subarachnoid area escaped into the epidural space， leaving inadequate anesthetic in the subarachnoid space. After the patient was positioned in the supine position， the hyperbaric bupivacaine migrated cephalad in accordance with gravity and leaked through the dura injury site. We assume that a substantial volume of Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) spilled into the epidural area， based on the intensity of the postoperative headache \\[2\\]. The CSF exuding from the Tuohy needle at T11/12may have been CSF collected in the epidural space that seeped through the dura injury site， since collection of CSF in the epidural space following spinal tap has been documented in both infants and young adults \\[3，4\\]. This report is limited by the absence of an MRI**\n\n【23】**or ultrasound imaging confirming the accumulation of CSF in the epidural space. It has been found that continuous spinal anesthesia is beneficial for caesarean section \\[5\\]. After the second ADP， the conversion of CSEA to continuous spinal anesthesia may have been an option for anesthetic management.**\n\n【24】**In conclusion， we saw a situation in which spinal anesthesia following ADP in a pregnant lady did not produce the required amount of anesthesia. Clinicians must consider the risk that spinal anesthetic administered to pregnant women following ADP may be insufficient due to CSF leaking.**\n\n【25】1\\. Parikh KS， Seetharamaiah S.

SBMA characterized by bulbar and limb muscle weakness， atrophy， and fasciculation. The weakness could be symmetrical or asymmetrical， involving proximal and distal muscles. Also， SBMA is associated with endocrine abnormalities due to resistance to androgen， causing defective spermatogenesis leading to gynecomastia and infertility \\[1\\].**\n\n【14】**William Kennedy first defined SBMA as a lower motor neuron and bulbar muscle degenerative disease in 1968. The incidence is 1/30，000 male births \\[2\\]. It is caused by the repeated expansion of CAG on the X chromosome. The age of presentation depends on the numbers of CAG repeats， with an average of 43 years but varying from 18 to 64 years. Weakness in the limbs， cramping， and tremors， as well as dysarthria， dysphagia， tongue fasciculation， and nasal speech， are the most prevalent complaints. The progression of the disease is slow， an estimated 2% decrease in muscle strength per year， measured by quantitative muscle testing (QMT)\\[3\\]. Therefore， until late disease， these patients have good function and mobility preservation； however， involvement in the gait and hip muscles can limit the patients to a wheelchair. Usually， they have a normal life span until the involvement of bulbar and respiratory muscles， resulting in aspiration \\[4\\]. Symptoms such as twitching of the muscle without loss of muscle strength are present in heterozygous females.**\n\n【15】**Since many of the clinical characteristics of SBMA are comparable to other neurodegenerative diseases such as Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and late-onset Tay-Sachs disease， a definitive diagnosis is always required \\[1\\]. We present a unique case of a 53-year-old Hispanic patient present in our institute.**\n\n【16】**Case Presentation**\n\n【17】**A 53-year-old right-handed Hispanic man with a history ofessentialtremor presented with a 6-7month history of progressive weakness and cramps in his lower extremities followed by weakness in the upper extremities. Initially， he noticed difficulty in walking more than a block due to pain and weakness in his legs. Three months later， he developed pain in his lower back， and he realized that he could not lift his arms above his head at work because of weakness. He felt fatigued quickly with physical activity.

In order to obtain the right diagnosis， it is important to avoid delaying the diagnosis and ineffective treatment. In addition， it is always necessary to assess the patients clinically with thorough neurological examinations， to perform necessary testing such as appropriate labs， neuroimaging (If indicated) and electrophysiological studies along with genetic testing. As SMBA is often confused with other neurodegenerative diseases， adequate diagnosis can prevent excessive delay in management and allow appropriate genetic counseling.**\n\n【63】**References**\n\n【64】**1\\.

A case ofa man with hypertension and diabetes mellitus presented with sudden onset of retrosternal chest pain. His ECG showed ST-segment elevation and T-wave inversion in leads II， III， and a VF. Coronary angiography was immediately performed. Before right coronary artery intervention， prophylactic temporary pacemaker was inserted. After percutaneous coronary intervention was performed for the RCA， Two-dimensional transthoracic echocardiography showed the pacemaker lead passed though patent foramen ovale and placed on the mid inferior septum on left ventricle.**\n\n【13】**Keywords： Malposition； Temporary pacemaker； Patent foramen ovale； Percutaneous coronary interyention**\n\n【14】**Introduction**\n\n【15】**Malposition of pacemaker lead in the left ventricle is an unusual complication \\[1\\]. The temporary cardiac pacing may be required in acute myocardial infarction setting for the occurrence of Atrioventricular (AV) block during Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) \\[2，3\\]. Inferior ST- Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI) is especially prone for AV blocks， because of the blood supplyto AV nodal tissues and the inferoposterior surface of the heart share the same arterial territory. Apical septum in Right Ventricle (RV) is usual site for pacing lead and we could check it by using by not only the characteristics of pacing rhythm but also fluoroscopic cardiac anatomy. However， there have been some case reports about inadvertent malposition of transvenous pacing lead in the Left Ventricle (LV)\\[4-15\\]. In this report， we describe the malpositioning oftemporary pacemaker lead on LV septum， passed through Patent Foramen Ovale (PFO)， detected by Trans Thoracic Echocardiography (TTE) after PCI.**\n\n【16】**Case Presentation**\n\n【17】**A 72-year-old man with hypertension and diabetes mellitus had a sudden onset of substernal chest pain a day before he came to the hospital. Findings on the physical examination were unremarkable. Vital signs were as follows： Temperature 36.6'C， heart rate 76 beats/min， respiratory rate 22 breaths/min， blood pressure 95/52 mmHg，and oxygen saturation 100% on room air.**\n\n【18】**His electrocardiogram showed ST-segment elevation and T wave inversion in leads II， III， and a VF. Laboratory evaluation revealed following： CK-MB 113.1 ng/ml； TnI above 22.78； BNP 558.4pg/ml. A heparin bolus (60 U/kg)， aspirin 300 mg and ticagrelor 180 mg were given.**\n\n【19】**Emergent coronary angiography was immediately performed and revealed a total occlusion in the middle of Right Coronary Artery (RCA). Before RCA intervention， prophylactic temporary pacemaker was inserted via right femoral vein approach for the AV block during the procedure. With the help of fluoroscopic images， a pacing lead was advanced until it reached RA. Then， the pacing catheter was passed smoothly to the ventricle without any resistance (Figure 1). PCI was performed for the RCA， and coronary blood flow recovered completely. The patient was moved to Coronary Care Unit (CCU) immediately after PCI. The patient was stable without any symptom. Surface ECG at CCU showed normal sinus rhythm with coincidental two pacing beats with Right Bundle-Branch Block (RBBB) morphology and early pre cordial transition (Figure 2)**\n\n【20】**TTE performed 4-h later after PCI. The TTE showed preserved systolic function (Ejection**\n\n【21】**Figure 1： Fluoroscopic images during the PCl. The white oblique dotted line indicates the direction of inteventricular septum. AP： Anteroposterior； LAO： left anterior oblique**\n\n【22】**Figure 2： 12-Leads surface ECG shows the pacing beats was RBBB pattern with superior axis.**\n\n【23】**Figure 3： Two-Dimensional transthoracic echocardiography images show the pacing wire passed through interatrial septum and located on apical inferior septum in LV. A) Apical four chamber view； B) apical three-chamber view； C) parasternal short-axis view； D) subxiphoid view. LV： Left Ventricle**\n\n【24】**Fraction (EF)=50%) with infero-posterior a kinesis on LV.**\n\n【25】**On the two-chamber/four-chamber views， the pacemaker lead tip was located apical inferior septum in LV (Figure 3)， passed though the incidental PFO (Figure 4). Finally， the temporary pacemaker lead was removed with the guidance ofTTE.**\n\n【26】**Discussion**\n\n【27】**In this case， the physician didn’t have focus on the adequate pacemakerlead site during the coronary intervention procedure. This is a unique case that temporary pacemaker lead tip was crossed the PFO and located on LV septum and suggests that pacing rhythm on surface ECG and fluoroscopic images are important to guide proper lead position. Fortunately， we found RBBB morphology on surface ECG by chance at CCU. Follow-up TTE confirmed the pacemaker lead was on the LV septum and we removed it.**\n\n【28】**We usually establish temporary pacemaker before emergency PCI for acute inferior MI against AV block \\[2，3\\]. Mostly， the pacing wire**\n\n【29】**Figure 4： Two-Dimensional transthoracic echocardiography images suggest the evidence of PFO without shunt flow. The white arrows indicate the site of PFO.**\n\n【30】**PFO： Patent Foramen Ovale**\n\n【31】**tip locates on RV apex only with catheter manipulation without any difficulty. In rare cases， the lead cross interatrial septum and locate on LV pass through mitral valve. If there is a PFO or ASD， the lead tip can pass through the interatrial septum easily like this case. As a standpoint of interventional cardiologists， coronary intervention is the most important procedure. So they didn’t care about the adequate site of adequate pacemaker lead site during the procedure.**\n\n【32】**There have been several complications related with the pacemaker leads unintentionally located on LV， such as， thromboembolic stroke and ventricular perforation \\[4-14\\]. Lead malposition in the LV should be prevented by a high index of suspicion at implant. Consequently， we should at least check the pacemaker catheter tip site during procedure with the guidance of pacing ECG and fluoroscopic images. First of all， if the pacing site is RV， the pacing QRS on V is usually LBBB pattern， the other way， if it is LV， the pacing QRS on V is usualy RBBB pattern. Fluoroscopic image is another important method to check the lead site. If we could find the ostium of RCA， we could differentiate inter ventricular septum with LAO view.**\n\n【33】**References**\n\n【34】1\\. Dunbar RD.

Over time， maternal and fetal outcomes have improved and this is likely related to advances in maternal-fetal monitoring， better surgical techniques， and availability of nontoxic and effective antimicrobial agents.**\n\n【7】**OPEN ACCESS**\n\n【8】**Staphylococcus， Streptococcus， and Enterococcus species account for between 80% and 90% of all cases of IE worldwide \\[3\\]. In particular， S. gordonii is a rare cause of IE that has been sparsely reported in the literature. S. gordonii are Gram-positive， alpha-hemolytic chains of cocci that play an important role in the alkalization of the oral cavity and protective biofilm production \\[4\\]. Once in the blood stream， S. gordonii appear to have the virulence factors that are pathogenic in the development of IE. The cell wall of S. gordonii contains a serine-rich glycoprotein， GspB， which mediates binding to human platelets \\[4\\]. After adherence to the platelet， the combination has the potential to attach to the fibronectin-rich extracellular matrix of the cardiac valves and subsequently form valvular vegetations.**\n\n【9】**Case Presentation**\n\n【10】**_\\*Correspondence：Pietro Candela， Department of_ _Cardiology， Casa di Cura Candela，_ _Palermo， Italy，_ _E-mail： pietro.candela@gmail.com_**\n\n【11】A 40-year-old patient was admitted with fever at 18 weeks’ gestation in her fourth pregnancy.\n\n【12】**Medical history included a small Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD) which was diagnosed in childhood and never required surgical intervention.

The patient described developed Streptococcus gordonii infective endocarditis， which is a rare but aggressive causative organism in infective endocarditis.

Early diagnosis with a multidisciplinary team approach is essential to improve outcomes.**\n\n【32】**Several studies showed that， even today， maternal and fetal mortality is higher than 10% \\[6\\]. For this reason， in our case， given the positive blood culture even in the absence of a clear endocarditic vegetation (see echocardiogram findings)， we prescribed targeted antibiotic therapy. Thepatient was dismissed 4 weeks after completion of antibiotic treatment， with negative blood culture. During the pregnancy， the baby showed a delay in surfactant development requiring corticosteroid therapy； shortly after the delivery， she developed a pneumonia with respiratory failure requiring prolonged stay in neonatal ICU. Happily， she totally recovered after 14 days.**\n\n【33】**EHJJ 2010； 31：2124-32**\n\n【34】**Figure 5： Hypoechogenic thickening near the VSD.**\n\n【35】**2\\.

Cardiac amyloidosis has multiple subtypes， the most frequent forms in our country (Spain) being primary amyloidosis due to light chain deposits (LA-CA) and transthyretin deposit CA (ATTR-CA). The latter has an inherited variant (ATTRh) and a mutant or senile variant (ATTRwt)\\[2\\].**\n\n【18】**We present a curious report of two octogenarian sisters who were independently diagnosed in2019 with ATTR-CA by two different cardiologists； the 87-year-old debuted at this age with a clinical scenario of Heart Failure (HF) with preserved ejection fraction and left ventricular hypertrophy(interventricular septum： 20 mm， left ventricular ejection fraction-LVEF 64%， left atrium volume35 mL/m²， NT-ProBNP 1737 pg/mL； Figure 1A)， with a pseudoinfarction pattern (Q image) in V1to V3 in the electrocardiogram (Figure 1B). An infiltrative deposit disease was suspected， because of this severe degree of ventricular hypertrophy. The younger sister， 82 year-old， had a previous history of syncope with mild conduction disorders in the electrocardiogram (left anterior hemiblock)， and required implant of a pacemaker several years ago because of atrial fibrillation with slow ventricular rate (Figure 1C). She subsequently developed congestive HF with reduced ejection fraction (LVEF20%， left atrium volume 39 mL/m’， NT-pro BNP 16，246 pg/mL). Echocardiogram also showed a severe left ventricular hypertrophy， being interventricular septum 21 mm (Figure 1D). A diagnosis of transthyretin deposit was made in both sisters， according to Gillmore et al. \\[3\\]： Grade 3 uptake of Perugini's classification in bone scan ?mTc-DPD (Figure 1E， 1F)， and exclusion of AL-CA by demonstrating the absence of a monoclonal peak in the serum and/or urine immunofixation test. Blood samples from the two sisters were sent for genetic study， and conventional sequencing by Sanger's method indicated that the TTR gene sequence was normal in both. This was quite a surprise， as we thought we were facing a clear case of ATTRh， and the absence of genetic alterations in the sequencing of the TTR gene showed two matching cases in the same ATTRwt family.**\n\n【19】**Reviewing this case， we would like to point out several essential aspects of ATTR-CA：**\n\n【20】**Variability in clinical presentation ofthe disease： TTR-CAcan presented with severeleft ventricular hypertrophy， HF with preserved ejection fraction \\[4\\]， HF with reduced ejection fraction\\[5\\]， and conduction disorders leading to syncope and need for a pacemaker \\[2\\]. Al of them due to the progressive deposit of Amyloid material by transthyretin in the different cardiac structures(myocardium and conduction system).**\n\n【21】**The false belief that we are facing a low-prevalence disease. This case shows it is necessary to test this diagnostic entity in certain patient profiles， because the prevalence is not low. Even in the same family， several sporadic cases of the disease (ATTRwt) may appear， as occurred in our report. There are already published series where up to 5% to 13% of patients with HF with preserved ejection fraction \\[4\\] and up to 11% with HF with reduced ejection fraction have Amyloid deposit per transthyretin 5\\].**\n\n【22】**The need for a genetic study to sequence the TTR gene for pathogenic variants. As in this case， normal sequencing excludes the possibility of ATTRh， which has diagnostic implications for the family (they would not require a cardiological study or follow-up) and also therapeutic implications， because it excludes the possibility of using treatments thus far only approved for**\n\n【23】**Sistolico pico**\n\n【24】**Deformacion longitudinal \\[%\\]**\n\n【25】Figure 1： A， D) Transthoracic echocardiagrams in short axis and apical four chambers with significant ventricular hypertrophy and left atrial dilation， as well as the typical pattern of cardiac amyloidosis in the longitudinal strain known as \"bull's eye\"； B) Surface electrocardiogram showing pseudo Q pattern in V1 to V3derivations， C) Surface electrocardiogram showing a left anteriar hemiblack in pacemaker-carrying patients， E and F) Uptake grade 3 of Perugini classification in bone scan with 99mTc-DPD.\n\n【26】**ATTRh and not for ATTRwt.**\n\n【27】**Learning Points**\n\n【28】**1\\.

On the chest CTalarge volume of fatty tissue and bowel was seen in the anterior mediastinum. There was no history of trauma. An initial diagnosis of Larrey hernia was made and the patient was operated on. Laparotomy revealed a large defect in the tendinous centre of the diaphragm and pericardium with intrapericardial displacement of the omentum and the transverse colon. The viscera were reduced into the abdominal cavity and the defect was closed using a Teflon patch. The patient was questioned again about any trauma in the past and he remembered a car accident20 years earlier. In the early postoperative course transient atrial fibrillation occurred and next pleural and pericardial effusion was diagnosed， requiring thoracentesis and pericardiocentesis Further course was uneventful and the patient was discharged home. Although this condition is rare， delayed diagnosis of diaphragmatic and pericardial rupture should be taken into consideration in patients with epigastric symptoms， who sustained torso trauma in the past.**\n\n【17】**Introduction**\n\n【18】**Traumatic Intrapericardial Diaphragmatic Hernia (TIPDH) is a rare consequence of blunt torso trauma. Most such injuries are diagnosed in the acute period because of symptoms associated with organ displacement or with concomitant injuries. Rarely， the injury is missed in the immediate period and the diagnosis may be delayed for months or years.**\n\n【19】**Case Presentation**\n\n【20】**A sixty-nine-year old male presented with epigastric discomfort and pain. Medical history was irrelevant. A physical examination did not show any evident pathology. At the chest X-ray， widening of the lower mediastinum was present， with anterior mediastinal mass seen on the lateral view (Figure 1). Contrast-enhanced CT of the chest and abdomen revealed large volume of fatty tissue and bowel in the anterior mediastinum (Figure 2).**\n\n【21】**An initial diagnosis of Larrey hernia was made and the patient was scheduled for surgery. Transverse laparotomy ~3 cm below the xiphoid process was made. Transverse colon and almost the whole omentum were displaced upwards and through the large defect in the diaphragm. After reduction of the viscera into the peritoneal cavity (Video 1， Figure 3) the defect was exposed， involving the central tendon of the diaphragm and pericardium and penetrating to the pericardial sac (Video 2， Figure 4).**\n\n【22】**Because of the size ofthe defect primary repair was not attempted and a Teflon patch was used to close it. Several Ethibond No 2 sutures were put around the defect， placed through the diaphragm and pericardium (and anteriorly through the costal arches). The Teflon patch was tailored to the size of the defect and the parachuting'technique was used to place it in the proper position (Figure 5).**\n\n【23】**The abdomen was closed without any drains. The patient was questioned again aboutanytrauma in the past and he remembered a car accident 20 years ago with no serious injuries diagnosed at that time. On the 2nd day after surgery atrial fibrillation occurred with symptomatic hypotonia， and was successfully treated pharmacologically. On the 7th postoperative day， a chest X-ray was performed**\n\n【24】**Figure 1： Preoperative chest X-ray. A) Antero-posterior； B) Lateral view.**\n\n【25】**Figure 2： Contrast-enhanced CT of the chest and abdomen showing large volume of fatty tissue and bowel in the anterior mediastinum， A) At the level of the diaphragm； B) At the level of the ascending aorta.**\n\n【26】**Figure 4： Intaroperative view of the defect in the diaphragm and the pericardium.**\n\n【27】**Figure 3： Large bowel and omentum reduced from the pericardial sac.**\n\n【28】**the outpatient follow-up no recurrence of the herniation or fluid accumulation was seen.**\n\n【29】**Discussion**\n\n【30】**due to fever and revealed fluid accumulation in the left pleural cavity. Thoracentesis was performed with 300 mL serous fluid removed. On the next day the follow-up chest X-ray showed widening of the heart silhouette and ultrasound examination confirmed pericardial fluid. Under the ultrasound guidance， cannula was inserted into the pericardial sac and 500 mL of bloody-stained fluid was removed. During the next 2 days fever subsided，50 ml serous fluid was drained from the pericardium and the cannula was removed. On the 13h postoperative day right-sided thoracentesis was performed and 300mL of serous fluid was removed. Further course was uneventful and the patient was discharged home on the 14 day after surgery. During**\n\n【31】**Diaphragmatic rupture associated with pericardial.rupture resulting from the blunt torso trauma， referred to as TIPDH is a rare condition. One hundred well documented cases were described in the literature， the first two as early as in 1910 \\[1\\]. Avast majority of these injuries are diagnosed in the acute period after trauma. On rare occasions this type of injury is missed and the diagnosis is not made until symptoms caused by displacement of viscera occur. To our best knowledge， only 45 cases of delayed presentation of TIPDH were described so far， with the delay ranging from 23 to 23 years \\[2\\]. We describe a patient who presented with epigastric pain and discomfort20 vears after torso trauma sustained in a motor vehicle accident.**\n\n【32】**Figure 5： A) Ethibond sutures placed through the margins of the defect； B) Teflon patch in place.**\n\n【33】**Figure 6： Types of the traumatic intrapericardial diaphragmatic hernia.**\n\n【34】**The reason for missing the diagnosis in the acute period may be the small size of the rupture， with no organ displacement. Surgeons focus their activity on clinical priorities， which may include different types of intra-abdominal injuries， requiring immediate repair. Also， its location deep in the upper part of the peritoneal cavity may contribute to missing it， even if laparotomy is performed. Because of constant contractions of the diaphragm a small-size rupture tends to enlarge gradually over a long time. This， together with the pressure gradient between the abdominal cavity and the chest， causes slowly progressing displacement of viscera.**\n\n【35】**The first review including 17 cases of TIPDH was published by Larrieu et al. \\[3\\]， in 1980 \\[3\\]， followed by 58 cases reviewed in 1986by Van Lohenhout at al. \\[4\\]， and 82 cases described in 2001 by Reina et al. \\[5\\]. The literature search has shown 18 more cases described in detail since then \\[2，5-19\\].Traumatic intrapericardial diaphragmatic hernias constitute a heterogenic group， depending on the type and location of rupture and the route of visceral displacement. They can be categorized in 4 main types (Figure 6).**\n\n【36】**Reportedly， the most often displaced organs are colon， stomach and omentum \\[5\\]， which was also seen in our patient. What was particularly rare in our patient is the very long time since the initial trauma to the presentation， being as long as 20 years， the second longest interval published to date. Despite a large volume of displaced**\n\n【37】**omentum and colon， the patient’s symptoms were relatively mild， probably due to slowly increasing volume of displaced viscera， over a very long period of time. The patient did not report any complaints that might be associated with the bowel obstruction. It is likely， that the empty space inside the enlarged pericardial sac， resulting from reduction of the bowel and omentum into the abdominal cavity contributed to the accumulation ofexudate in the postoperativecourse.

Studies have established similaritiesbetween the immunopathologyof COVID-19and mycobacterial Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome (IRIS). Innate immune component of both COVID-19 and IRIS centers on aberrant activation and signaling of macrophages and monocytes， by the immunomodulatory effects of cytokines produced， particularly interleukin-18\\[1\\].**\n\n【5】**Case Presentation**\n\n【6】**OPEN ACCESS**\n\n【7】**A 1-year 9-month-old boy presented with fever (100-102 F) for 10 days along with neck stiffness and extreme irritability. The caretaker of the child was diagnosed with tuberculosis two months back with sputum beingpositive foracid fastbacilliand GeneXpert detecting thepresenceofMycobacterium tuberculosis sensitive to Rifampicin. Subsequently， the parents had recovered from COVID-19about six weeks back. In view of baby having CNS symptoms along with history of contact with a patient of tuberculosis， the baby was suspected to have TB meningitis and relevant investigations were sent accordingly. Computed Tomography (CT) chest revealed necrotic mediastinal nodes. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) brain showed moderate communicating hydrocephalus with meningeal enhancement. Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) study revealed lymphocytic pleocytosis (Cell count- 640/cmm，lymphocytes 98% and neutrophils 2%) with elevated protein (1463 mg/100 ml) and normal glucose (75 mg/100 ml). CBNAAT from sputum and CSF was negative. In addition， COVID IgG antibody was positive. He was diagnosed as tubercular meningitis and started on 4Anti-Tubercular Drugs (ATD) along with oral prednisolone. Baby was afebrile and playful within a week and repeat MRI brain after one month showed moderate communicating hydrocephalus with mild reduction in the ventricular size and regression ofperiventricular interstitial edema.

Two forms have been described \\[2，3\\]. In unmasking IRIS， the immune reconstitution unmasks a previously undiagnosed infection. Paradoxical IRIS refers to the worsening of previous infection after**\n\n【19】**the commencement of therapy. A typical feature of this syndrome is the recurrence of original lesions in a more pronounced version and rapid clinical improvement following corticosteroid therapy \\[4\\].

As per a study by Seddiki et al.，COVID-19 and Mycobacterial IRIS share similar immunopathology and suppression of inflammatory response by corticosteroid therapy is effective in both cases. In addition， the study also established the central role of Interleukin-18 and hence should be investigated further as a possible therapeutic target \\[1\\].**\n\n【21】**Corticosteroids (prednisolone 1.5 mg/kg/day tapered over four to six weeks) are considered as the first line therapy for IRIS. Duration of therapy depends on severity and recurrence of symptoms but continuation beyond four-six months is discouraged. Biologics and immunomodulators including TNF-a inhibitors， thalidomide， IL-6blockers have been used in various cases ofrefractory IRIS \\[2\\].**\n\n【22】**References**\n\n【23】**1\\.

Investigation pointed to Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA)and hypokalemia. The patient underwent neuroimaging studies and Magnetic Resonance (MRI) showed a pituitary macroadenoma with suprasellar invasion. Growth Hormone (GH) and IGF-1 (Insulin Growth Factor-1) levels were increased and diagnosis of acromegaly was then established. In the fifth day there was a peak of Creatine Kinase (CK) with progressive decrease. After 12 days of hospitalization， with resistant hyperglycemia， proximal flaccid tetra paresis and global hyporeflexia (MRC score of40 points) was noted. Clinical diagnosis of Critical Illness Myopathy (CIM) was established. After 30days of hospitalization， he was discharged with MRC score of 50 points and improves in CK levels.**\n\n【13】**Discussion： The presented case shows a CIM， a type of ICUAW. Some important risk factors are endocrine logical (thyroid diseases， diabetes， adrenal and pituitary dysfunctions). The patient presented hyperglycemia and underwent a prolonged period of hospitalization and use of glucocorticoid medications， increasing the risk of the disease. With clinical management and physiotherapy the patient regained autonomy.**\n\n【14】**Conclusion： ICUAW can bring long-term consequences， so that early identification and management as well as preventive measures are primordial to minimize chronic disability and morbidity.**\n\n【15】**Introduction**\n\n【16】**Intensive Care Unit-Acquired Weakness (ICUAW) is a growing problem in critically ill patients and is associated with a longer duration of mechanical ventilation， greater permanence and in-hospital mortality， in addition to higher costs to the health system. Preventing its risk factors， therefore， becomes fundamental in the approach to the critical patient \\[1\\].**\n\n【17】**Case Presentation**\n\n【18】**Male， 45 years old， with no known comorbidities or use of medications， entered the Emergency Service of Santa Casa de Sao Paulo， with a drop in general condition， fluctuation in consciousness and dehydration. Upon admission， Glasgow 14， severe dehydration and pale. Ectoscopy showing acromegalic facies， enlarged extremities， acrochordons in the cervical region， macroglossia and skin sweating. Vital signs： Blood pressure 100 mmHgx60mmHg， HR 100 bpm， SatO，97% in room air， capillary blood glucose above 500 mg/dL. Laboratory tests were performed， of which alterations are reported： plasma glucose 503 mg/dL (RV 70-99)， glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) 9.8%(RV<5.7%)， creatinine 1.9 mg/dL (RV 0.6-1.1)， plasma sodium 175 mEq/L (RV 135 to 145)， potassium 3.4mEq/L (RV 3.5 to 5.1)， CPK 8023 U/L (RV 38 to 174) and arterial blood gases： pH 7.2，pCO2 19， HCO3 6.3，BE-3.2 and lactate 3.9. Type 1 urine with 3 ketonuria crosses.**\n\n【19】**The patient was diagnosed with Diabetes and Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA)， starting treatment for DKA，prioritizing intravenous hydration， with care not to reduce acute sodium levels， in addition**\n\n【20】**to an intravenous insulin pump， after correction of hypokalemia. Due to the fluctuation in consciousness， the patient underwent a cranial tomography， showing a lesion in the pituitary topography， progressing the investigation with Magnetic Resonance (MRI)， which showed a Pituitary Macro adenoma with suprasellar invasion， compressing optical chiasma， measuring in its largest axis 6.1 cm.**\n\n【21】Pituitary hormone measurements were performed： GH>200mcg/L， IGF-1 476 ng/mL (RV 112 to 282)， Prolactin 21 mcg/L (RV up to 24)， ACTH 28p g/mL， Basal cortisol 23 mg/dL (RV>15)， TSH1.2 mUI/L (RV 0.45 to 4.5) and free T4 0.5 ng/dL (RV 0.6 to 1.3).\n\n【22】**Diagnosis of Acromegaly due to hormonal changes， lesion in adenohypophysis and suggestive phenotype. Treatment with a somatostatin analogue (Octreotide) 20 mg monthly was started， in addition to a dopaminergic agonist (Cabergoline) 1.5 mg/week.**\n\n【23】**One day after admission， the patient evolved with a decrease in the level of consciousness requiring Orotracheal Intubation (OTI). He maintained high sodium levels， but already improving DKA. He was kept under OTI for 4 days， being extubated after normalization in sodium levels.**\n\n【24】**The patient refused the surgical procedure for the treatment of acromegaly. He remained with difficult glycemic control during the period of hospitalization， with improvement in intra hospital glucose levels after about 15 days of admission， using high doses of insulin (2 ui/kg/day). He also received treatment with corticosteroids(hydrocortisone 300 mg/day for 8 days， followed by prednisone 40mg/day for 18 days) due to the airway infection associated with the condition (sinusitis).**\n\n【25】**After 12 days of hospitalization， a picture of flaccid tetra paresis of proximal predominance (total MRC score of 40 points)， associated with global hyporeflexia， without changes in cranialnerves， sensitivity or in other modalities on neurological examination， was noted. Cerebrospinal fluid was normal. On the fourth day of hospitalization，he presented a Creatine Kinase (CK) of 12665， with a peak on the fifth day of 12888， followed by a gradual decrease during hospitalization. In the two weeks following extubation， the patient showed progressive clinical improvement in the peripheral nervous system， especially after better glycemic control. Due to the presence of generalized muscle weakness after severe， diffuse， symmetrical， flaccid pattern and without involvement of cranial nerves， associated with a sum of MRC less than 48 points， a diagnosis of myopathy of the critically ill patient was then established.**\n\n【26】**At the time of hospital discharge， 30 days after admission， the patient had a sum of the MRC score of 50 points， good glycemic control， using insulin， improvement in CPK， creatinine and sodium levels. Maintained GH 195 mcg/L (RV<1)and with refusal of surgical procedure. Referred to the endocrinology clinic to follow up on the diagnoses of acromegaly and diabetes； and the neurology outpatient clinic for follow-up of the diagnosis of myopathy.**\n\n【27】**Given the current epidemiological context， we emphasize that throughout the hospitalization period， the patient did not show any signs or symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 infection.**\n\n【28】**Discussion**\n\n【29】**In the case in question， the patient had multiple risk factors for the development ofICU-Acquired Weakness (ICUAW)and had a course of Critical Illness Myopathy (CIM). Although the pathophysiology of CIM is still being studied， the likely mechanisms include**\n\n【30】**inhibition of protein synthesis， mitochondrial dysfunction， changes in the ubiquitin-proteasome system， oxidative stress and changes in intramuscular calcium homeostasis \\[2\\]. Hyperglycemia associated or not with the use of steroids， uise of neuromuscular blockers and sepsis are the main risk factors \\[3\\].**\n\n【31】**Myopathy is worsened by multiple endocrine logical and metabolic factors. Among them， thyroid diseases， diabetes， adrenal dysfunctions and acromegaly stand out \\[4\\]. The patient in question had hyperglycemia， with DKA，and was diagnosed with acromegaly during hospitalization. Acromegaly， characterized by high plasma levels of GH and IGF-1， has pituitary adenomas as its main etiology. It usually causes slowly progressive proximal myopathy and normal CPK levels \\[5\\]. Myopathy presented by the patient probably was not due to the acromegaly， once there was clinical neurological improvementdespitee maintaining activity cof this disease， documented by the presence of high GH levels， even after therapy with somatostatin analog.**\n\n【32】**Diabetes is associated with multiple presentations of neuropathy and muscle involvement. Pathophysiology may be associated with microvascular changes in muscle and nerve regions， but neuropathies arenot common in the first years ofthe disease \\[5\\]. Theytendtoappear after 10 years of diagnosis and are commonly associated with other micro vascular lesions typical of this disease， such as retinopathy and nephropathy \\[6\\]. Regarding the clinical muscle condition， it has been documented in some cases that the cause of the injury is probably due to focal myonecrosis， followed by micro vascular injury \\[7\\].**\n\n【33】**Low carbohydrate diet and hydration should be instituted， in addition to the measurement of glycated Hemoglobin (HbA1c)， aiming at the previous diagnosis of diabetes， in those patients with in-hospital hyperglycemia in addition to assisting in the management of the disease at hospital discharge \\[6\\]. The insulin prescription should ideally be performed according to the protocol of each institution or with the help of a specialist. Glycemic control aims at an intra-hospital goal between 140 and 180 mg/dl \\[6-8\\]. These measures reduce overall mortality and the risk of developing polyneuropathy in critically ill patients. Values below 100 mg/dL are correlated with increased mortality， due to the risk of severe hypoglycemia and， therefore， should be avoided \\[8，9\\].**\n\n【34】**Myopathy mainly affects the proximal and axial muscles and makes weaning from mechanical ventilation and recovery of normal respiratory function difficult. It can be associated with elevation of muscle enzymes， such as increased Creatine Kinase (CK)， which can assist in diagnosis， as occurred in the case reported. However， CK values within normal levels can be found in mild cases or at the beginning of muscle involvement and， therefore， should not exclude the diagnosis in the face of a strong clinical suspicion \\[10\\].**\n\n【35】**In the Electroneuromyography exam， changes such as the reduction of the amplitude and duration of the action potentials of the motor unit with early recruitment stand out， in which there may be， in some cases， fibrillations and positive acute waves. In nerve conduction studies， the result is usually normal， but there may be a reduction in the amplitude of the Compound Muscle Action Potential(CMAP) with prolonged duration， suggesting MDC \\[10\\].**\n\n【36】Muscle biopsy shows signs of myopathy with loss of myosin， severe atrophy of type 2 fast-twitch fibers and loss of the myosin heavy chain. Findings such as accumulation of inflammatory cells， glycogen or lipids are not typical of MDC and indicate the need for\n\n【37】**investigation of differential diagnosis， such as immune-mediated inflammatory myopathies， dystrophic or metabolic myopathy \\[11\\].**\n\n【38】**The patient persistently refused to perform invasive exams， as he progressed with evident clinical improvement. Such complementary exams were not performed and a diagnosis was established based on clinical criteria：“Generalized weakness developing after the onset of a serious illness； diffuse weakness (affecting the proximal and distal muscles)， symmetrical， flabby and sparing cranial nerves； the sum of the MRC-SS score <48 points， more than once with an interval>24h； and other causes of weakness unrelated to serious illnesses have been ruled out.”**\n\n【39】**Conclusion**\n\n【40】**ICUAW canbring long-term consequences. It is important to pay attention to identify it， in the ICU environment， and provide early rehabilitation in order to minimize chronic dysfunctions，morbidity and disability.**\n\n【41】**References**\n\n【42】1\\. **Burtin C， Clerckx B， Robbeets C， Ferdinande P， Langer D， Troosters T， et** **al.

To treat discogenic neck pain，Intradiscal Pulsed Radiofrequency (ID-PRF) could be used in management of chronic CDNP.**\n\n【13】**Objective： This study aimed to investigate the efficacy of percutaneous ID-PRF in chronic CNDP.**\n\n【14】**Methods： In this retrospective study， thirty-four patients were included and allocated into two groups according to the duration time of the PRF procedure they underwent (7 min group = 16vs.15 min group =18 patients). The principal outcome measures were pain score， evaluated with the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS)， and the Oswestry Disability Index(ODI) at three different time points：Baseline， at 2 weeks after the procedure 2-weeks and at 6-month after. The degree of achievement was determined as a reduction in NRS of2 50% or an ODI reduction of≥ 40%.**\n\n【15】**Results： At 2 weeks and 6 months after the procedure， retrospectively， NRS was found to be significantly reduced (P<0.05) in both groups， but no significant differences were found between the groups. It was also found that ODI scores is sign ificantly lower in treatment groups when compared to the control， but the difference between the groups were not significant. At the 6 months after procedure， 12 patients (75.0%) and 14 patients (77.8%) were found to have decrease in the NRS by more than 50% among the 7-min group and 15-min group， respectively， while there was no significant difference in the percentage of patients who had decrease in ODI more than 40% between the two groups (P=0.243).**\n\n【16】**Conclusion： ID-PRF was shown to have significant efficacy in management of CDNP regardless of the duration of ID-PRF (7 min vs. 15 min).**\n\n【17】**Introduction**\n\n【18】**Chronic neck pain is a common cinical problem among general population \\[1\\] and reported prevalence between 14% and 41% \\[2\\]. Chronic neck pain can be induced by anatomical predisposition， including facet joint irregularity， disc pathology， neck muscle and ligament \\[3\\]. The prevalence of zygapophyseal joint pain was 55% and discogenic pain was 16% \\[4\\]. Among chronic neck pain， discogenic neck pain could be caused by abnormal nerve in growth into annular and the expression of pain nociceptors \\[5，6\\]. Several methods were introduced to treat discogenic neck pain7-91.**\n\n【19】**Percutaneous radiofrequency treatment was first introduced in the 1980s \\[10\\] and distinguished into two type of radiofrequency： Continuous radiofrequency stimulation \\[11\\] and Pulsed Radiofrequency (PRF) \\[12\\] stimulation by means of an electromagnetic arena. PRF consists of a high-intensity electromagnetic current delivered in pulses， allowing heat to disperse through the latent period so that neurodestructive heats cannot be extended \\[13\\].**\n\n【20】**It is reported that the Intradiscal PRF (ID-PRF) is applied to an in lumbar discogenic pain\\[14-16\\]. It has been proposed that percutaneous ID-PRF may reduce nociceptive input from the intervertebral disc \\[17\\]. In adding， numerous studies have related the beneficial effects of ID-PRF on discogenic low back pain \\[14，17-20\\].**\n\n【21】**While the application of percutaneous jellified ethanol， platelet-rich plasma， and inter laminar epidural injection in cervical discogenic neck pain were reported \\[21-24\\]， the study on ID-PRF has not yet been reported. The only one case of ID-PRF treatment was reported \\[20\\].**\n\n【22】**_cited._**\n\n【23】**A high-voltage and long-duration PRF， which is assumed to be 15min to 20 min is recommended\\[14，20\\].**\n\n【24】**The present analysis aim to investigate the effect of the application percutaneous monopolar ID-PRF in the management of chronic discogenic neck pain.**\n\n【25】**Methods**\n\n【26】**A total of 34 patients with treatment conducted between January2018 and September 2020 were included in this retrospective study. The patients were allocated into groups based on the duration of the procedure they underwent： 7 min or 15 min.**\n\n【27】**The studyprocedure waspermitted by the Institutional Review Board. The inclusion criteria were： 1) axial neck pain； 2) single level； 3) sitting neck pain； 4) single level degenerative disc in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)； 5) positive response to provoking discogram \\[25\\] and 6) neck pain that had not responded to conventional handlings (pharmacotherapy and physical therapy) inside the prior 4 to 6 weeks. The exclusion criteria were as follows： 1) Neck pain induced by pressure on the paraspinal muscles；2) cervical herniated intervertebral disc； 3) cervical spinal stenosis； 4) facet origin pain； 5) myelopathy； 6) pain due to infection； and 7) bleeding tendency.**\n\n【28】**Data on age， sex and length of pain of each patient was contained. The primary outcome measures were the pain score using the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS)， and the Oswestry Disability Index(ODI) measured before， at the 2 weeks after and 6-months after the treatment.Degree of achievement was described as a decrease in NRS of 2 50% or an ODI reduction of 2 40%.**\n\n【29】**Procedure**\n\n【30】**All patients were intravenously injected with antibiotics in prior to the procedure. The ID-PRF， a single needle placement procedures performed on the patients laying on the fluoroscopy table in the supine position with pillow under their neck. The disc level for the treatment was selected based on the findings ofMR**\n\n【31】**Betadine was used for the disinfection of the skin entry site. With fluoroscopy， the target disc was found using metal indicator. The skin entry site was infiltrated with 1% lidocaine. With second and third digits of left hand second， the trachea and esophagus medially displaced. On fixed two digits， the PRF needle (NeuroTherm， 20 G，15cm length， 20 mm active tip) was percutaneously progressed and was located on the affected disc with an anteroposterior view (Figure 1A). In fluoroscopiclateral view，PRF needle advanced to posterior margin of affected disc (Figure 1B). Anteroposterior and lateral fluoroscopic projections were used to confirm whether the introduced needle was properly placed.**\n\n【32】**We applied ID-PRF with a frequency of 5 Hz， a pulse width of5 ms， the amplitude of 60V， and a extreme heat of 42°C， for either patients with 7 min or 15 min treatment by means of the NT1100generator (NeuroTherm， Middleton， MA， USA). After the end of the procedure， the PRF needle was removed after procedure and the patients were transferred to the recovery room.**\n\n【33】**Wilcoxon signed-rank exam was used in assessments of increase in NRS and ODI scores before and after the procedure. A statistical significance was established when P-value is <0.05.**\n\n【34】**Results**\n\n【35】**Thirty-four patients were included in this study were divided into**\n\n【36】**Figure 1： A) Pulsed radiofrequency needle was placed into the C5-6 disc in c-arm anteroposterior view.

Data on the patient character are presented in Table 1. It is found that NRS and ODI were significantly reduced in a time-dependent manner in both groups (Table 2，3). Mean post-treatment pain scores were found to be significantly lower (P=0.000) in both groups at the follow-up period of 2 weeks and 6 months， respectively， while the variances among the groups were insignificant (Table 2). The ODI scores were also significantly reduced when compared to that of baseline scores； however， the differences between the groups were insignificant (Table 2). At the6-months follow-up examination， 12 patients (75.0%) in the 7-min group and 14 patients (77.8%) in the 15-min group were shown to have decrease by more than 50% in their pain score (P=0.17). No**\n\n【44】**significant difference was found between the degree of reduction ODI score in each groups (P=0.24) (Table 3).**\n\n【45】**No severe problems， including epidural hemorrhage， dural or neural damages， or pollution， were noted in any group.**\n\n【46】**Discussion**\n\n【47】**The outcomes of this report show that significant pain relief can be achieved with either 7-min or 15-min application of ID-PRF. There was little reported to ID-PRF treatment for chronic discogenic neck pain. Only one case ID-PRF had achieved decreased the numeric rating scale at 3-months follow up \\[20\\].**\n\n【48】**Chronic neck pain occurred from severe factors， such as cervical intervertebral， facet join， atlantoaxial joints and neck muscle， etc. Cervical intervertebral disc was innervated sinuvertebral nerve by posterior vertebral plexus， anterior vertebral plexus， and vertebral nerve \\[3\\]. If degenerative change occurred in the disc， disc innervating nerve potentially extending into the internal third of the annulus fibrosus and the nucleus \\[5，6，26\\]. It was can cause discogenic neck pain.**\n\n【49】**The mechanism of ID-PRF is not fully understood. It could be possibly suggested that ID-PRF may reduce nociceptive input derived from the intervertebral disc and the induce of a cellular and immune response and inhibit evoked synaptic activity \\[27，28\\]. Park et al.\\[16\\]， reported intradiscal pulsed radiofrequency was effective in patient with chronic discogenic low back pain \\[16\\].**\n\n【50】**There was difficult to diagnosis discogenic pain \\[29\\]. In our study，pre-procedure provocative cervical discogram was performed. Cervical discogram was useful methods for diagnosis cervical discogenic neck pain \\[25\\]. Inclusion criteria of this study were not guaranteed pure disco-origin pain. It was not easy to distinguish discogenic pain from facet pain，or muscle/ligament pain， etc.**\n\n【51】**This study is limited in that it has small sample size and the lacks control group. We may also not fully full rule out the pain from facet pain or muscle pain. Evaluation with MRI should be not conducted in follow-up to assess the potential of ID-PRF to prevent or to aggravate disc degeneration.**\n\n【52】**It is concluded that the application of ID-PRF is efficient for the conduct of discogenic neck pain regardless of ID-PRF application duration (7-min vs. 15-min).**\n\n【53】**References**\n\n【54】**1\\.

Measurement uncertainty must also be estimated for the most relevant quantitative phases of the examination processes that provide nominal qualitative results.**\n\n【84】**Knowledge of uncertainty of the examination performed in the medical laboratory is necessary to be aware of the reliability of its results. The fundamental aspects are repetition and level \\[12\\]：**\n\n【85】**Whatever the method appliedforthe laboratory examination， the “accuracy of the uncertainty\" is evident from repetitions of the examination on the same material (conditions of repeatability). In support of this comes the Internal Quality Control(CQI) which allows to identify the dispersion of the numerical quantitative results and the frequency of positives for the nominal qualitative results；**\n\n【86】**The uncertainty also depends on the level of property measured in the material， both for numerical quantitative and nominal qualitative results.**\n\n【87】**Security management**\n\n【88】**“The laboratory and associated office facilities shall provide an environment suitable for the tasks to be undertaken， to ensure the following conditions are met...

It defines how to establish and maintain a safe working environment in a medical laboratory. The standard states that a work area safety manual must be readily available with mandatory reading for all employees and must contain security policy， fire prevention， electrical safety， chemical safety， radiation exposure， biological risks， and hazardous waste disposal.**\n\n【94】**The safety manual must include detailed instructions for evacuation from the workplace and the protocols to be put in place to deal with any accidents. The safety program (evaluated with Safety program audits) must be verified and reviewed at least once a year and the premises must be inspected (Safety inspection) at least with the same frequency.**\n\n【95】**Audit management**\n\n【96】**“The laboratory shall conduct internal audits at planned intervals to determine whether all activities in the quality management system， including pre-examination， examination， and post-examination：**\n\n【97】**a) Conform to the requirement of this International Standard and to requirements established by the laboratory， and**\n\n【98】**b) Are implemented， effective， and maintained.” (ISO 15189， S4.14.5)\\[1\\].**\n\n【99】**ISO 15189 requires that a documented procedure for the management of audits must be in place that an audit program must be defined that includes the treatment of all elements of the management system. Internal audits must be carried out by competent and independent personnel (with respect to the activity being audited) and the standard EN ISO 19011：2018-“Guidelines for auditing management systems\" \\[14\\] is expressly mentioned as a guide to follow for the execution.**\n\n【100】This standard has aligned with many recently published ISO standards by including a risk-based approach： An audit approach that considers risks and opportunities of the audit activities.\n\n【101】**The risk-based approach influences planning， conduct and reporting of audits in order to ensure that the latter are focused on significant issues for the client and to achieve the audit program objectives.**\n\n【102】**The process approach is central to this standard as auditors should understand that conducting a management system audit means auditing an organization s processes and their interactions in relation to one or more standards of management systems. Results are achieved more effectively and efficiently when activities are understood and managed as interrelated processes that act as an organic system.**\n\n【103】**The investigation techniques， therefore， should include interviews guided by the 5 \"key questions\" of aprocess audit structured according to the logical PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) sequence：**\n\n【104】**1\\. What are you trying to achieve? (PLAN： What are the objectives， plans and how are they managed?)；**\n\n【105】**2\\. How did you work/are you working to get it? (DO： What are the operational activities and the related support elements and how are they carried out?)；**\n\n【106】**_3\\._ How do you know if you have achieved what you want?(CHECK： What are the measurements and monitoring and how are they carried out?)；**\n\n【107】**_4\\._ How do you know if what you are adopting is the best way to achieve what you want? (ACT： What improvement actions have been planned and carried out?)；**\n\n【108】**5\\. How can you be sure that what you are trying to achieve is right? (How is the overall consistency of the system guaranteed? Is there continuity between strategic and operational objectives?).**\n\n【109】**Conclusion**\n\n【110】**By analyzing the standard ISO 15189 it is clear that there are various requirements that need precise and specific details. For this purpose，there are various standards to support a Medical Laboratory to guide it in the implementation of a management system compliant with ISO 15189； these standards provide more details to demonstrate the compliance of key processes with the requirements ofthe standard and guide thelaboratory towards planning and implementing actions to address the risks and opportunities of the various processes involved. This represents the basis for increasing the effectiveness of the management system， obtaining better results and preventing negative effects that could cause harm to patients，laboratory staffand environment.**\n\n【111】**The consistency of diagnostic resultsSbetween different laboratories (even from different countries) is facilitated when medical laboratories comply with these standards in the correct， complete， effective and efficient implementation of their ISO 15189system.**\n\n【112】**References**\n\n【113】1\\.

However， it is hard to use for diagnosis of the estrous cycle from structural changes in blood vessels and tissues， since mobile phones do not have an image processing function.

This inexpensive fiberscope can be connected not only to mobile phones via Lightning or USB， but also via Wi-Fi. Thus you can bring the inexpensive fiberscope to the research field even though a large endoscopic diagnostic imaging device cannot be used there. Therefore， we propose here to use an inexpensive fiberscope as an endoscope for cow in the barn.**\n\n【18】**Experimental**\n\n【19】**_and reproduction in any medium，_ _provided the original work is properly_**\n\n【20】**_cited._**\n\n【21】**In this study， the inexpensive endoscope developed by NIDAGE was used \\[5\\]. This endoscope has two cameras with a pixel count of 1980x1080 installed at the tip and side. Thus images of both the external uterine ostium and vaginal wall can be acquired at the same time. This number of pixels**\n\n【22】**Figure 1： Endoscopic images of external uterine ostium of cow in the period of estrus； endoscopic image as obtained (White) and images separated to Red， Green， and Blue images.**\n\n【23】**Figure 2： Composited images of G and B of external uterine ostium and vaginal wall of cow in the period of estrus.**\n\n【24】**corresponds to a Full-HD image， and an endoscope image can be acquired as a photo and a movie. In addition， it has a total of 7 LEDs on the tip and side， allowing taking bright images of the inside of the vagina. Since this endoscope has a waterproof function equivalent to IP67， it can be safely used even in the vaginal environment.**\n\n【25】**It is difficult to take single photo during diagnosis using endoscope， because this diagnosis is huge burden on the cow. Therefore， we limited the diagnosis time within 1 min in total. Hence we shot a video and saved as MPEG4 file， and then， Adobe Premiere Pro (version 15.2.0) was used for taking single photo image (JPEG file). It was possible to acquire single photo image with Windows Media Player as well， but the image quality deteriorated significantly and it was not possible to obtain images of blood vessels.**\n\n【26】**ImageJ-win64 (free software) was used to decompose the single photo image into RGB signals \\[6\\]. As you select Color-Split Channel from Image icon， the JPEG file will be split into R， G and B files. Since hemoglobin strongly absorbs G and B light， blood vessels appear as dark color.**\n\n【27】**In order to further improve the contrast of the blood vessel image due to the absorption of hemoglobin light， the G and B images were combined using RegiStax V6 (free software) \\[7\\]. You select G and B JPEG image files， and then， perform set aligns points， align and limit are automatic process work. The image misalignment will be automatically corrected and the composed image will be displayed. Finally， stacked (composed) image can save the composited image.**\n\n【28】**Results and Discussion**\n\n【29】**A stick fixed with an endoscope and a mucus collection tool was inserted into the vagina of an estrus cow in the barn. Figure 1 (White) shows an image of the external uterine ostium. This image was saved from a video file obtained by endoscope. It was clearly seen that the external uterine ostium illuminated by white light. Next， the images obtained by decomposing the white image into RGB are shown as Red， green， and blue images in Figure 1. Red image illustrated the distribution of minor blood vessels that seemed to be capillaries. Green and blue images depicted the distribution of thick blood vessels in the folds of external uterine ostium.**\n\n【30】**The composed images of green and blue images of the external uterine ostium and the vaginal wall are shown in Figure 2. Thick blood vessels could be clearly observed. Image of the vaginal wall also showed blood vessels and it was different from white image.**\n\n【31】**In estrus cows， the blood flow increases due to the excitement， and the endometrium looks reddish as a whole. We believe that the blood flow can be seen in the amount of hemoglobin in the blood vessels as a result of the increase in the activity of cow.**\n\n【32】**Currently， it is attempted the prediction of the estrus period by accurately grasping the estrous cycle from diagnostic imaging and monitoring of pregnancy signal substances. We hope that diagnostic imaging can be used as the primary screening for the diagnosis of pregnancy.**\n\n【33】**Conclusion**\n\n【34】**In this study， it is attempted to observe blood vessels in the external uterine ostium and vaginal wall of cow using an inexpensive endoscope. It was possible to obtain an endoscopic image more easily than the method using a conventional large-sized endoscopic image processing device. Since the blood vessel image could be clarified by image processing， it can be expected to be used for the primary screening for the diagnosis of pregnancy in the future.**\n\n【35】**Acknowledgement**\n\n【36】**This work was supported by a Grant-in-Aid for Livestock promotion of Japan Racing Association.**\n\n【37】**References**\n\n【38】**1\\.

Thoracoabdominal flap is one of the preferred techniques for closing the defect of breast surgery in countries with limited resources such as in Southeast Asia. This technique is relatively easy and has low complication rate.**\n\n【10】**Case Report： A 42-year-old woman complains of a lump in her right breast that reappeared after breast surgery one year ago. We performed a wide excision of this tumor with a margin of 2 cm and the defect was closed using a Thoracoabdominal flap. Patients have been re-educated about the importance of postoperative radiotherapy.**\n\n【11】**Keywords： Malignant phyllodes tumor；Thoracoabdominal flap； Recidive**\n\n【12】**Introduction**\n\n【13】**Phyllodes tumor is a fibroepithelial neoplasm of the mammary gland. This tumor is quite rare in the community. Muller， in 1838 reported that the prevalence ranged from 0.3% to 0.8% of all breast tumors in women. Meanwhile， Parker， in 2001， stated that the prevalence of this tumor is less than1% of all breast neoplasms. The literature states that 10% to 30% of cases of Phyllodes tumors are found to be malignant \\[1，2\\].**\n\n【14】**Malignant Phyllodes Tumor has potential to be recidive and metastatic. Surgical treatment with a wide excision technique is the best option in treating this tumor \\[1\\]. This procedure has an impact in the form of a large postoperative defect， so this will pose a challenge for surgeons to reconstruct the chest wall. Thoracoabdominal flap can be one of the surgeon's options in the closure of large postoperative defects of the breast. Rao et al. in 2015 reported that the Thoracoabdominal flap has the same ability as skin grafts in closing large defects， but with capability to shortening operating time， have less bleeding， and good healing results. Patients can also undergo radiotherapy after defect closure is done \\[3\\].**\n\n【15】**Presented in this case report is our treatment of Recidive Malignant Phyllodes Tumor with extensive postoperative defects. Thoracoabdominal flap was chosen as a method of closing the defect with consideration of its effectiveness and good results.**\n\n【16】**Case Presentation**\n\n【17】**_Citation：_**\n\n【18】**A 42-years-old woman came to our clinic with complains of a lump that reappeared in the right chest for 1 month ago. The lump appeared on the surgical scar initially measured 1 cm ×1 cmx1cm and rapidly growing in 1 month to 10 cmx10 cmx8 cm. The lump is painful， ulcerated， and bleeds.**\n\n【19】**From her history， the patient complained of a right breast lump appearing initially four years ago. The lump was located under the skin with enlarged veins on its surface， slowly growing and there were no ulcers on the surface. The patient underwent a simple right-sided mastectomy 1 year ago at district hospital and the histopathological examination revealed as a Malignant Phyllodes Tumor. The patient was advised to undergo postoperative radiotherapy， but she refused to do it because of financial problem. Four months after surgery， a lump reappeared on the right chest. It was stated that the tumor has been recidive. Regional lymph node examination， thoracic radiology and abdominal ultrasonography did not show any metastatic process (Figure 1).**\n\n【20】**The patient underwent wide excision with a free margin of 2 cm from the recidive tumor by**\n\n【21】**Figure 1： Preoperative clinical picture and excision design.**\n\n【22】**pectoralis major muscle.**\n\n【23】**Figure 3： Final closure of surgical defect with Thoracoabdominal Flap (a) and 6th day post operation wound condition (b).**\n\n【24】**including a previous surgical scar to prevent a recurrence. The operation took only 120 min. Surgical removal of the tumor is done by excisioning the pectoralis major muscle at the base of the tumor because of infiltration process of tumor (Figure 2). A rhombus-shaped postoperative defect was laid with an area of 440 cm’ on the right chest. We performed a Thoracoabdominal flap to close this wide defect. The flap consists of two components： the right side， and the left side. The skin on the inferior side of the defect is divided in half and an incision is made downward along the width of the defect， then continues to divide to the right and left. Those two skin flaps were raised superiorly and used to cover the surgical defect. The abdominal flap defect was closed primarily by bringing the right and left sides closer together. We also put two vacuum drains in the operating area to collect fluids and blood after surgery (Figure 3). The patient has been evaluated at the surgical outpatient clinic on the sixth day**\n\n【25】**Figure 4： Laterally and Medially based TA Flap.**\n\n【26】**after operation. There were no complaints of fever， pain， or surgical infection. The flap was assessed as viable and there was no necrotic area on the wound. The results of histopathological examination revealed a Malignant Phyllodes Tumor of the breast and the tumor cells were no longer found in all excision margin. The patient was educated and scheduled to undergo radiotherapy.**\n\n【27】**Discussion**\n\n【28】**A Phyllodes Tumor is a tumor that is quite rare in the community. These tumors are classified histopathologically into 3 groups： Benign， borderline， and malignant. Anderson Cancer Center in 2012 reported the incidence of Phyllodes Tumor based on histopathology was58% for benign tumors， 12% for borderline tumors， and 30% for malignant tumors. Benign and borderline Phyllodes tumors never recur once the tumor has been completely excised (with tumor-free incision margin). Meanwhile， Malignant Phyllodes Tumors require more aggressive treatment because of the high risk of recurrence and metastasis. The recurrence rate of this tumor was recorded at 14% to21%\\[1，4，5\\]. Surgery is the main treatment for Malignant Phyllodes Tumor. Surgeon can decide between wide excision with safety margin1 cm or simple mastectomy in manage this tumor. Those treatments will leave wide surgical defect which become a surgeon's attention after excision.**\n\n【29】**Broad and radical excision of the breast will leave a large defect so that primary closure usually cannot be performed. Various methods have become the surgeon's choice to reconstruct this wide defect， such as Skin Graft technique， Cutaneous flaps (ex： Thoracoabdominal Flap， Thoracoepigastric Flap， Bilateral Advancement Flap)， and Myocutaneous flaps (ex： Latissimus Dorsi Flap and Transverse Rectus Abdominis Myocutaneous Flap). The Thoracoabdominal flap (TA flap) was originally introduced by Brown in 1975. However， this flap becameless popular after the Myocutaneous flap has been introduced in 1985\\[3，6，7\\].**\n\n【30】**In principle， the TA flap is a rotational-advancement flap of skin and fascia. This flap has two bases of pivot point： The medial base and the lateral base. The medial base blood flow comes from the superior deep epigastric perforating artery， whereas the lateral base blood flow comes from branches of superficial lumbar，subcostal， intercostal and thoracic arteries. The TA flap with a medial base is also known as the Thoracoepigastric Flap (TE Flap). The two flap bases are mirrors of each other， as shown in Figure 4 \\[3，7-9\\].**\n\n【31】**Srinivasa \\[3\\] stated that the TA Flap procedure in post-mastectomy defects in case of locally advanced breast cancer will give satisfactory results. The TA flap is considered easy to perform for surgeons who are not familiar with myocutaneous flap procedures. This flap is not only easier but also faster healing than skin graft**\n\n【32】**technique. Patients can immediately undergo radiotherapy for local control after the TA flap wound has healed. This flap is also useful in developing countries with limited resources because surgeon needs no expensive equipment \\[3，7-9\\].**\n\n【33】**Das and Choudhury \\[8\\] in 2013 reported that 1 in 20 patients(5%) who underwent TA flap surgery in cases of locally advanced breast cancer experienced complications such as wound dehiscence. These complications can be managed directlywith secondary suturing and wound closure. The study explained that the majority of patients were able to go home from the hospital on 3 to 4 postoperative days and underwent radiotherapy with good results. There was no recurrence in 18 months after surgery. It can be concluded that the TA flap procedure is simple，low-cost， and provides good tolerance for radiotherapy \\[8\\].**\n\n【34】**Deo et al. \\[9\\] in 2003 has conducted research comparing TA flaps to Myocutaneous flaps (LD and TRAM flaps) in breast cancer cases. The TA flap requires a shorter operating time， shorter hospital stay， and significantly minimal risk of blood loss compared to the Myocutaneous flap. The morbidity and risk of local recurrence were not significantly different. The study concluded that the TA flap may be the first choice in patients with extensive post-mastectomy defects \\[8，9\\]. Joo Seok's study stated that the TA flap had a faster recovery time than the TE flap. Baroudi et al. wrote that TE flap was hemodynamically weak and fragile because of tissue tension on vascular. The risk of necrosis at the end of the flap is high. If this morbidity occurs， the patient must be re-debrided and followed by a skin graft to close the defect. However， this was disputed by Burattini et al. \\[10\\] who conducted a study on the safety and viability of the TE flap. In this study， it was found that the risk of dehiscence was only 7%. Persichetti stated that the TA flap is very useful in post-mastectomy breast defects with an area of less than 600 cm \\[2，3，7，10，11\\].**\n\n【35】**In our patient， we modified the TA flap by dividing the flap into2 sides at the inferior defect. This flap is a combination of the TA flap on the lateral side and the TE flap on the medial side. We made this modification to provide free skin mobility and to minimize necrotic risk of tissue. Both of the TA Flap base will gain vascular supply maximally with minimal tissue traction.Nowadays， there is no consensus about surgical technique to close post-mastectomy defect. It depends on the experience of the surgeon， patient preferences， facilities， and the size of the defect. However， it is universally recognized that myocutaneous flaps are still better than cutaneous flaps in terms of reducing the risk of necrosis \\[11\\].**\n\n【36】**Conclusion**\n\n【37】**Closure of the breast excision defect using a Thoracoabdominal flap may be an option for a surgeon who is not familiar with**\n\n【38】**performing myocutaneous flaps in chest wall reconstruction. This technique has ability to minimize duration of operation， cost， has rapid healing time， and simple to do by a general surgeon. We have described in this case report about our experience in treating of Recidive Malignant Phyllodes Tumor with a Thoracoabdominal Flap as defect closure technique.**\n\n【39】**References**\n\n【40】1\\.

Cardiac anomalies are common with congenital absence ofpericardium which includes Atrial septal defect， Patent ductus arteriosus， Mitral valve disease， Tetralogy of Fallot and Sinus venosus defect. We report two cases of retrospective diagnosis of congenital absence of pericardium after Atrial septal defect device closure which masqueraded as device embolization.**\n\n【13】**Introduction**\n\n【14】**Congenitalpericardial defects are rare with reported incidence of<1 in 10，000andunderestimated true prevalence due to asymptomatic and incidental diagnosis \\[1\\]. The most common variant is partial absence ofpericardium mainly left sided defects (70%) followed by right sided defects (17%) and least common complete bilateral absence of pericardium (9%) \\[2\\]. Majority of the patients are asymptomatic and are diagnosed incidentally on chest radiographs or while undergoing cardiac surgery. Symptoms are often vague with chest pain， shortness of breath or palpitations and may also arise from associated cardiac anomalies. Atrial Septal Defects (ASD) are common cardiac anomaly found in congenital absence of pericardium. Transcatheter device closure of the atrial septal defect is a feasible option but may pose a dilemma regarding the position of the device post procedure due to leftward and posterior shift of the cardiac silhouette in congenital absence of the pericardium. We report two cases of ASD device closure which presented as device embolization and on further evaluation both the cases were found to have congenital absence of the pericardium.**\n\n【15】**Case Series**\n\n【16】**Case 1**\n\n【17】**A 4 years female came to our center with chief complaints of difficulty in breathing in the past3 years of age. She was first in birth order born out of nonconsanguineous marriage at term with normal vaginal delivery and had no postnatal complications. She had history of recurrent episodes of lower respiratory tract infections requiring hospitalizations for which cardiac consultation was advised.On examination，the patient was hemodynamically stable with systemic pressures of 111/64mmHg， respiratory rate of 30 beats per minute and SpO， of 100% on room air. On cardiovascular examination first heart sound was normal with wide and fixed splitting of second heart sound and soft mid diastolic murmur at left lower parasternal area. Chest radiograph revealed dilated right atrium and right ventricle with increased pulmonary blood flow. A 12 lead ECG showed sinus rhythm with evidence of right atrium and right ventricular volume and pressure overload.**\n\n【18】**Echocardiography demonstrated large malaligned ostium secundum ASD measuring 16mm with adequate rims， enlarged Eustachian valve， dilated right atrium and right ventricle and ventricular function was normal. Transcatheter closure ofthe ASD was done with 18 mm Amplatzer Septal Occluder without any complications. Post-procedure TEE showed device in position with no residual shunt. On the next day transthoracic echocardiography showed ASD device to be embolized in Left atrium with loss of atrioventricular rim. The child was taken for surgical ASD device retrieval and defect closure. During surgery it was found that there was absence of left posterior and mediastinal pericardium with ASD device attached to the septum. On retrospective analysis of chest X-ray revealed leftward and posterior rotation of cardiac silhouette with straightening and**\n\n【19】**elongated left heart border and the space between aorta and the main pulmonary artery appeared widened Snoopy Sign. It was concluded that false presentation of device embolization was due to congenital absence of left posterior and mediastinal pericardium.**\n\n【20】**Case 2**\n\n【21】**An 8 years male child， second in birth order， full-term with no ppostnatal complications was coincidentally found to have ostium secundum atrial septal defect while evaluating for increased precordial activity. On cardiac examination first heart sound was normal， second heart sound was wide and fixed split and a short eiection systolic murmur was heard at left lower sternal border. Chest X-ray demonstrated cardiomegaly with prominent pulmonary arteries and increased vascularity. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed moderate sized ostium secundum ASD with adequate rims and dilated right atrium and right ventricle. Child was taken for transcatheter closure of ASD which was done with 16 mm Amplatzer Septal Occluder. There were no procedural complications and child was discharged on oral antiplatelet. However， on follow-up child had complained of chest discomfort and on evaluation with ECG was normal and Echo showed stable device position with noresidual shunt and no evidence of erosion/effusion. Child was kept on follow-up. On 10 months of follow-up in view of persistent chest discomfort CT pulmonary angiography with coronary evaluation was done which showed levorotation of heart with air interposition between PA and aorta and below the heart with prominent left atrial and normal device position and normal coronaries giving the diagnosis of congenital absence of the pericardium. Retrospective evaluation of the chest X-ray showed levorotation of the heart with obscured right heart border and poor visualization of device due to its superimposition on spine and prominent LA with air seen in aortopulmonary window area in left border suggestive of absent pericardium.**\n\n【22】**Discussion**\n\n【23】**Congenital Absence of Pericardium (CAP) is exceedingly rare cardiac anomaly which occurs due to failure of pleuropericardial membranes to fuse completely on one or both sides. Ellis classified pericardial agenesis into various subtypes namely complete or partial left sided defect， complete or partial right sided defects and diaphragmatic pericardium defects \\[3\\]. Left sided defects are the most common accounting for 70% of all the defects. Diagnosis of CAP is challenging due to asymptomatic presentation or nonspecific symptoms like atypical chest pain， palpitations， dizziness， dyspnea and trepopnea \\[4\\]. Majority of the cases are diagnosed incidentally on chest X-ray due to levoposition of the heart and during surgery for other associated cardiac anomalies. About 30% of the CAP have associated cardiac anomalies namely atrial septal defects， patent ductus arteriosus， mitral valve disease， Tetralogy of Fallot and sinus venosus defect. Chest X-ray shows leftward shifted cardiac silhouette， elongated left heart border， cardiomegaly， radiolucency between aorta and pulmonary artery due to lung tissue also known as Snoopy heart sign \\[5\\]. ECG demonstrates right axis deviation， right bundle branch block in V1 and poor R wave progression. Echocardiography may show right ventricular dilatation， hypermobility of heart， posterior orientation of the apex， elongated atria with widened ventricles give tear drop appearance of the heart. Echocardiography may not be diagnostic but the above finding should make clinicians aware about congenital absence of pericardium. Meanwhile cardiac**\n\n【24】**MRI remains gold standard for diagnosis of CAP with high sensitivity demonstrating the absence of preaortic pericardial recess which is present in normal hearts. Despite these advancing modalities majority of the cases often goes undiagnosed and has been diagnosed incidentally during surgery or CT angiography which was seen in our cases too. Though complete defect of the pericardium have excellent prognosis but partial absence of pericardium can lead to tricuspid regurgitation by traction of chordal structures， fatal myocardial strangulation， ischemia and sudden death requiring surgical intervention \\[6，7\\]. There are literatures which mentions about the rarity of this congenital anomaly and challenges during diagnosis of this entity \\[2-5，8\\]. Our cases were much different from the described case reports because none of the literatures mentions about the ASD device orientation which masqueraded as embolization due to levorotation of the heart. Surgical intervention could have been avoided in our first case as false presentation of device embolization was due to levorotation of the heart seen in congenital absence of pericardium. Similarly in the second case persistent chest discomfort and device orientation in chest X-ray and echocardiography could unnecessarily lead to surgical intervention in the child for device retrieval and defect closure if diagnosis of CAP was not made. In both the cases suspicion of device embolization led to further workup and diagnosis of congenital absence of pericardium was made which would have been missed otherwise.**\n\n【25】**Conclusion**\n\n【26】**This case emphasizes that clinicians should be aware that ASD device embolization can sometimes be a false presentation due to levorotation of the heart. These features may clinch diagnosis for congenital absence of pericardium and clinicians should retrospectively analyze imaging modalities for presence of congenital absence of pericardium.**\n\n【27】**References**\n\n【28】**1\\.

Its characteristics imitate to that of invasive carcinoma. It mostly occurs in females at menopause or after menopause， but rare in children and men. Here we present a case report 37 years old lady having hyperprolactinemia， who came with complain of the stiffness of breast and nipple discharge of milk since 12 to 13 years. Bilateral mammography showed increased density under the left nipple without calcification and dominant mass. Ultrasound of breast evidenced few abnormally dilated ducts in the retro areolar region of left then right nipple. Therefore， the patient was diagnosed with duct ectasia. It is concluded that hyperprolactinemia can also lead to mammary duct ectasia even in women even at a pre-menopausal age.**\n\n【11】**Keywords： Mammary duct ectasia； Hyperprolactinemia； Nipple discharge**\n\n【12】**Introduction**\n\n【13】**Mammary duct ectasia is an inflammatory disorder in breast \\[1\\]. The pathology behind this includes expansion of the main ducts related to intraluminal blocks of histocytes and periductal inflammation \\[2\\]. The rate of occurrence of mammary duct ectasia can vary from 1.1% to 75.0%， according to the investigative methods utilized， which can be clinical，histopathological， or based on necropsy \\[3\\]. Mammary duct ectasia mainly influences those females who are undertaking menopause or about to start menopause but can also take place in younger females， males， and infants \\[1\\].**\n\n【14】**Smoking is a dangerous feature for duct ectasia. It was discovered that smokers were three times more likely to develop the state of duct ectasia than non-smokers \\[4\\]. This ailment is leading cause among other common reasons of bloody nipple discharge and sub-areolar masses， radiologically and medically imitating persistent carcinoma， while Nipple discharge， in turn， is the third significant frequent sign nearing to breast health centers， chasing lumps and pain \\[5-7\\].**\n\n【15】**Here， we present a case report of a female who developed duct ectasia before menopausal age with hyperprolactinemia.**\n\n【16】**Case Presentation**\n\n【17】**A 37-year-old woman known case of hypertension came at Doctors Hospital and Medical Centre Lahore Punjab， Pakistan with a history of hypertension and stiffness of breast along with the discharge of milk since last 12 to 13 years. On compression of her breast， nipple discharge of milk more on the left side was also observed. The nipple discharge was often drenching through shirts within a few minutes of throwing on them. The menarche of the patient took place at an average age， but with irregular menstrual periods. The patient married at the age of 21-year. The patient had two children. Among those children， the elder child had correctly breastfed， but the younger child had not been appropriately breastfed. The younger child breastfeeding was stopped due to increased prolactin level and bloody nipple discharge. The patient had never been smoked and did not have a family history of cancer.**\n\n【18】**On examination endocrinology report for prolactin levels was first done. Report showed prolactin level was 79.5 ng/ml (reference range： 5.18-26.53 ng/ml for female). Mammography was performed and evidenced by increased density under the left nipple. However， no dominant mass or suspicious calcification was seen. There was no architectural distortion of the parenchyma，while， lymph nodes were noted in both axillae (Figure 1). Ultrasound of breast exhibited few dilated ducts**\n\n【19】**Figure 1A： Mammography of right breast.**\n\n【20】**Figure 1B： Mammogram of left breast illustrating increased density under the left nipple withaut suspicious calcification and architectural distartion of the parenchyma.**\n\n【21】**about 8 mm.**\n\n【22】**in the retromolar region ofboth breasts， however abnormally dilated under the left nipple，largest measuring about 8 mm (Figure 2). Based on clinical signs and symptoms and clinical tests fin dings， the patient was diagnosed to have duct ectasia.**\n\n【23】**Discussion**\n\n【24】**Mammary duct ectasia is a seditious (causing inflammation) syndrome in the breast which is linked with inflammation and periductal fibrosis of differing extent \\[8\\]. This illness is also recognized as comedomastitis， plasma cell mastitis， and cholesterol granuloma. Duct dilatation is generally not indicated in the early stages \\[9\\].**\n\n【25】**When it is indicative， mainly general medical appearance is mammary discharge \\[10\\]. In most of the incidences， no clear abnormalities are present， but in afterward phases， tender sub-areolar masses along with skin renunciation happen， which can be detected as infiltrative carcinoma， which is wrong. The identification of Mammary Duct Ectasia is generally medical. The irregular thickening of the sub-areolar breast tissue and micro-calcifications is mostly identified via mammography. These thickenings can be imitated as carcinoma \\[11\\]. The diameter of ducts greater than 5mm can be identified and assessed with the help of ultrasonography\\[12\\]. Ductography is frequently performed for recognizing ductal dilatation with the multifocal luminal barrier in a dropped way， but**\n\n【26】**it is bound as an investigative way for Mammary Duct Ectasia \\[13\\]. Histopathologically， the peri-ductal inflammation is analyzed. The lymphocytes， plasma cells， or foamy histiocytes are present more often. The early stage of Mammary Duct Ectasia is illustrated through the existence of expansion of terminals of duct \\[14\\].**\n\n【27】**Afterward， the inflammation is substituted with fibrosis. Duct ectasia rarely gets better devoid of cure or by means of the utilization of temperate antibiotics and compresses. If the warnings ofectasia do not go biopsy is frequently needed， and the anomalous duct would be eliminated via surgery \\[9\\]. Constant or repeated disorders are handled with centered surgical removal of the abnormal ducts below the nipple \\[15，16\\]. A right way of surgery for duct ectasia is image guided surgery by ductal endoscopy \\[17\\]. There are two theories with respect to the pathology of Mammary Duct Ectasia \\[18\\].**\n\n【28】**First， the main pathological route is believed to be unclear with degeneration of the ducts and glands， pursued via ducts expansion， directing to the apathy of secretion， duct burst， and inflammation. The second contributing incident is offered to exist as an inflammatory progression； periductal inflammation being the primary anomaly， pursued by duct sclerosis， obliteration， and duct ectasia. Alternatively， the etiology of duct ectasia is still unidentified. Other influencing factors consist of squamous metaplasia of the terminal duct epithelium， phenothiazine treatment，cigarette smoking， bacteriall!growth， and hyperprolactinemia.L Tobacco smoking is also a hazardous cause for ductal ectasia. While another study revealed that bacterial infection also leads to duct ectasia \\[19-211. However， this evidence is not enough as a cause of this disorder. An earlier study illustrated a relationship involving unusual prolactin discharge and Mammary Duct Ectasia \\[22\\]. Shousha et al. \\[23\\] also analyzed that there is a linkage between specific hypothalamic/pituitary ailments， likely correlated with prolactin secretion and progress of mammary duct ectasia in postmenopausal patients. It is suggested that hyperprolactinemia may also lead to mammary duct ectasia. However， further studies are needed to elucidate the process， so that such kind of disorders can be prevented.**\n\n【29】**Conclusion**\n\n【30】**It is concluded that there is a strong relationship between hyperprolactinemia and mammary duct ectasia in a pre-menopausal age also. Increased prolactin level induces the various stages of mammaryduct ectasia..Hyperprolactinemia21increasesthe inflammation in mammary ducts. As a result， different signs and symptoms of mammary duct ectasia develop.**\n\n【31】**References**\n\n【32】**1\\. McHoney M， Munro F， Mackinlay G.

In Pakistan alone the prevalence ofGDM is approximately12% of all pregnancies \\[2\\]. GDM has been related with a multitude of factors that include genetic， epigenetic and environmental factors. Furthermore， GDM is associated with both short term and long-term complications and thereby causes a lot of stress to both the mother and the developing fetus. Stress in not only limited to physical stress but also extends to mental and psychological stress to the expecting mother and pregnant females with GDM are four times likely to develop psychological stress \\[3\\]. In recent years the role of genetic factors in GDM \\[1\\] and psychological and behavioral reactions have started to gain global attention \\[4\\]. Genetic studies such as Genome Wide Studies (GWAS) have successfully lead to discoveries of Single-Nucleotide Polymorphisms(SNPs)， common genetic variants and new loci that are related to common complex diseases \\[5\\]. Such studies along with meta-analysis， case-control analysis and linkage analysis have identified candidate genes in the etiology of both GDM \\[6\\] and psychological stress disorders. However genetic studies that link GDM with psychological stress are less well studied. The aim of this review is to understand the association of genetic changes particularly single nucleotide polymorphisms common in females with GDM and pregnancy induced psychological stress.**\n\n【11】**Single Nucleotide Polymorphism**\n\n【12】**Polymorphisms are a form of genetic variation， which refers to the presence of two or more alternative forms of a distinct phenotype. This variation can occur in any morphological， physiological， and behavioral traits and can occur in both coding and non-coding regions of the DNA \\[7\\]. Among these genetic variations the Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNP) are of the most common type occurring in about 90% of the observed differences in the genome. Another feature of a polymorphism is that the most abundant allele should be present in the population at a test frequency of 99% or less. Therefore the rare allele will present at a total frequency of at-least 1%\\[8\\]. Most SNPs occur in the non-coding regions of the human genome but about 50，000 SNPs have been estimated to occur in the coding region of the DNA called cSNP where they can alter protein structure. These SNPs are an important genetic variation as they can influence morphological， physiological and pathological traits thereby have relevance to disease mechanism \\[9\\] as shown in Figure 1. Associations of these SNPs have been linked as risk factors to many diseases including both type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Establishing an association with the genetics can offer prediction of drug response and possibly develop a genome based diet that is safer to risked individual \\[10\\]. Graph： Created using Reactome \\[11，12\\] and modified from Wikipedia.**\n\n【13】**Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms iin Gestational Diabetes Mellitus**\n\n【14】**Gestational diabetes mellitus is defined as carbohydrate intolerance ofvariable severity diagnosed with onset or duringpregnancy\\[13\\]. It is the most common metabolic disturbance duringpregnancy. It is a multifactorial disease with a rising prevalence globally where both environmental and genetic factors play an important role in the pathogenesis of the disease and associated post pregnancy complications \\[14\\]. In a systemic review done by Zhang et al. have assessed multiple genes that are associated with GDM. Among these they identified seven genes that are very significantly associated with GDM. These are The minor alleles of Transcription Factor 7 Like 2 (TCF7L2)， Glucokinase**\n\n【15】**region. The SNPs in the coding region are further sub divided into synonymous or non-synonymous SNPs. The synonymous SNPs and Non-coding SNPs results in un-altered protein structure whereas as non-synonymous SNPs result in altered protein structure which contributes to the pathogenesis of the disease.**\n\n【16】**(GCK)， Potassium Inwardly Rectifying Channel Subfamily J Member11(KCNJ11)， CDK5 Regulatory Subunit Associated Protein 1 Like 1(CDKAL1)， Insulin Like Growth Factor 2 MRNA Binding Protein 2(IGF2BP2)， Melatonin receptor 1B (MTNR1B)， and Insulin Receptor Substrate 1 (IRS1). Among these TCF7L2 showed the strongest association with GDM risk \\[15\\].**\n\n【17】**Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms in Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM)and Psychological Disorders**\n\n【18】**Gestational Diabetes Mellitus is a pregnancy related metabolic disorder characterized by glucose intolerance that was nonexistent prior to pregnancy \\[16\\]. A diagnosis of GDM furthermore increases emotional distress， such as depression， anxiety or stressamong women. A study done by Lee et al. \\[17\\] showed that prevalence depression， anxiety and stress were 39.9%，12.5% and 10.6 % respectively \\[17\\]. Pregnancy itself being a stressful condition the superimposed GDM along with stress results in further complications that could potentially lead to postpartum depression or diabetes mellitus post pregnancy. Multiple factors come into plays that contribute towards the development of stress and GDM however genetic factors play substantial role in the etiology of both psychological symptoms and GDM. In a recent review done by Yahya et al. \\[18\\] they identified about 83 candidate genes that were associated with GDM of which _TCF7L2， MTNRIB， CDKALI， IRSI， and KCNQ1 are the most_ prevalent \\[18\\]. For the purpose of the review， we would only focus on these 5 major genes any overlap of these genes with psychological symptoms.**\n\n【19】**Transcription Factor7 Like 2**\n\n【20】**Genetic studies have showed TCF7L2 is found to be the strongest determinant of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) in the human population. In a review done by Chang et al. encompassing 22 studies6 out of 8 common SNPs were found to be strongly associated with GDM where rs7903146，rs12255372 and rs790169 had the strongest association \\[19\\]. Furthermore In vivo studies showed that not only**\n\n【21】**TCF7L2 is associated with T2DM but is also related to altered behavior of the mice which was seen prior to the development of glucose intolerance \\[20\\]. This shows that TCF7L2 could potentially be associated with stress and GDM however further studies would be needed to make this association.**\n\n【22】**The Melatonin Receptor 1B (MTNRIB)**\n\n【23】**The Melatonin Receptor 1B (MTNR1B) is a newly identified candidate gene belonging to the class of G protein coupled receptors. Till date human genetic studies have identified many common variants of this gene associated with T2DM and GDM. Among these the polymorphism rs1387153 and rs10830963 was to be highly significant \\[6，21\\] later being also found in placental tissues associated with increased risk of GDM \\[21\\]. However when rs10830963polymorphism was assessed for depressive symptoms in T2DM no correlation was found \\[22\\] but independently this polymorphism was associated with increased risk of Schizophrenia \\[23\\].**\n\n【24】**The Cyclin-Dependent Kinase5(CDK5) Regulatory Subunit-Associated Protein1-Like 1(CDKALI)**\n\n【25】**The CDKAL1 is a member of the methylthiotransferase family encoded by CDKALI gene has been implicated in the development of T2DM \\[24\\] and GDM particularly the rs7754840 variant \\[25\\]. Although this variant was not yet studied with respect to stress development multiple genetic variants of this gene were found to be associated with depressive symptoms with T2DM\\[26\\].**\n\n【26】**Insulin Receptor Substrate IRS-1**\n\n【27】**Insulin receptor substrate-1iIsS：an important endogenous substrate of the insulin signaling pathway. Variants of this gene mainlyrs1801278 have been shown to be associated with both T2DM and GDM \\[27，28\\]. Other variants of this gene particularly rs13411764and rs3820926 in the upstream region have found to be a risk factor for major depressive disorder \\[29\\]. Though not linked via studies as a risk factor for stress in GDM the potential of IRS being involved**\n\n【28】**in GDM and variants having association with psychological illnesses could possibly serve as a question for future research studies.**\n\n【29】**Potassium Voltage-Gated Channel Subfamily QMember1(KCNQI)**\n\n【30】**The Potassium Voltage-Gated Channel Subfamily Q Member 1(KCNQ1) gene variants rs2237892， rs2237895， rs2283228， rs151290， and rs2074196， have been recently identified as a risk factor for the development of T2DM \\[30，31\\]. Among these the variant rs2237892and rs2237895 were found to be associated with GDM in Chinese and Pakistani population respectively \\[32，33\\]. Polymorphisms of this gene in relation to psychiatric disorders are not much studied KCNQ1 variant rs8234 was found to be associated with increased of Schizophrenia \\[34\\].**\n\n【31】**Studies Showing SNPS in Stress Related to GDM**\n\n【32】**Currently there are not many studies that have related SNPs associated with stress and GDM. A study done by Lee et al. \\[35\\]， have shown 14 genes associated with GDM and stress. These are _NPY5R； ANO2； EPHX2； TPH2； NRGI； LHPP； FKBP5； SDK2；_ _RORA； OXTR； BDNF； HTR2C； TEX51； and PLEKHG1 which are_ important candidates for various psychological disorders such as depression， anxiety and stress \\[35\\]. In another study by Lin et al the authors investigated that association between gene polymorphisms， environment and psychological stress in GDM. The study included _COMT， NPSR1， HSP90B1，HSP90AA2， FKBP5. Among these genes_ only NPSR1 (rs324981) T/T genotype was associated with reduced risk of psychological stress where as the other genes had no significant association \\[4\\].**\n\n【33】**At present only two studies have shown associations of genetic variants with respect to stress and GDM. However， the candidate genes studied were mostly associated predominantly with stress and psychological disorders. This review further tried to link common candidate gene variants predominantly associated with GDM with potential relation to stress and therefore could serve as a basis for further studies.**\n\n【34】**Implications of Future Research**\n\n【35】**There is no any research work conducted in a local setting， highlighting the relationship of stress with GDM in background of genetic mutations. Thus； exploring the genetic profile of pregnant women is of paramount importance. Identifying the epigenetic mechanism of stress and GDM can benefit for sustainable long-term behavioral change measures to address the mental health of pregnant women. Further， the study will help the health providers treat the pregnant woman in a best suited way as well as to determine whether the new born to a woman will be predispose to psychological disorders in the future.**\n\n【36】**References**\n\n【37】**1\\.

Immunotherapy can generate immune-related adverse events involved all organs， in particular checkpoint inhibitors PD1/PDL1 can develop autoimmune type 1 diabetes.**\n\n【10】**Case Presentation： A 64 years old man affected by metastatic non-small cell lung carcinoma， after conventional therapy， was treated with pembrolizumab (a PD1/PDL1 checkpoint inhibitor)：After ten weeks， he showed hyperglycemia with ketosis， stable reduced c-peptide， and positive anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies therefore he was treated with insulin injection. The histological image of pancreas appeared like an immune-mediated insulitis.**\n\n【11】**Conclusion： New guidelines are recently published to inform clinicians and patients about frequent immune adverse events of these new immunotherapies.**\n\n【12】**Introduction**\n\n【13】**Recently new cancer immunotherapies have revolutionized cancer treatment \\[1\\] and their use is constantlyincreasing. Immune checkpoints are signal pathways that regulate the activation of T-cells in order to protect the tissues from damage triggered by pathogens and to prevent autoimmunity. Immune checkpoint inhibitors act on immune regulation and immune system checkpoint： The most famous are Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte Antigen 4 (CLTLA4) \\[2\\] and Programmed cell Death protein 1 (PD1) and his ligands (PDL1 and PDL2)\\[3\\]. The target of these new therapies is to develop specificity and long-term memory of immune adapted response to achieve tumor regression. In comparison with conventional chemotherapies， these molecules play a role by stimulating immune system and not killing cancer cells so they have a longer latent time to start acting on cell mass (about16-20 weeks) but improve long-term overall survival \\[4，5\\]. Immunotherapy induces immune-related adverse events which can involve all organ system also the endocrine system \\[6，7\\]. CTL4-targeted immunotherapy is associated with increased susceptibility to hypophysitis and primary thyroid dysfunction， PD1-targeted immunotherapy is associated with primary thyroid dysfunction and type 1 diabetes \\[8\\].**\n\n【14】**Case Presentation**\n\n【15】**In our medical clinic we visited a patient of 64 years old for hyperglycemia. He had an irrelevant remote history and one first relative affected by type 2 diabetes； the patient and nobody in his family had any autoimmune disease. Nine months earlier he had been diagnosed with non-small cell lung carcinoma with already evidence of repetitive nodal and vertebral disease (L1-L2). Oncologist started with conventional therapy with cisplatin but patient showed poor response and the disease progressed. The patient was candidate for treatment with Pembrolizumab. This therapy was started with absence of mutations for Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) and with presence of PD L1 expression in 26% of tumoral cell (PD-L1 IHC 28-8 Dako). Ten weeks after the beginning of treatment with PD1/PDL1 checkpoint inhibitor compared hyperglycemia (234 mg/dl) with ketosis and mild increase of lipase (333 U/L， normal value 140 U/L-200 U/L) in the absence of suggestive radiological pancreatitis. At the same time basal C-Peptide was severely reduced (0.2 ng/ml， normal value 0.78 ng/ml to 1.89 ng/ml)； anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies were positive (299U/ml， normal value 0 U/ml to 5 U/ml)， anti-insulin antibodies were negative. Anti-IA2 (tyrosine phosphatase)， anti-insulin or anti-ZnT8 antibodies are not performed and HLA haplotype wasn't**\n\n【16】**Figure 1： Immunohistochemistry showed the expression of PD-L1 (clones used 22C3 and 28.8) with 26% positivity on a pulmonary biopsy specimen.**\n\n【17】**Figure 2： The pancreatic islets were infiltrated by numeraus lymphocytes like a typical picture of immune-mediated insulitis.**\n\n【18】**tested. Multiple daily insulin treatment was started getting a discreet glycemic control. In the following weeks no recovery of basal beta-cell function (evaluated with C peptide assays) was detected.**\n\n【19】**Patientdied for cardiacCtamponade frommetastatic hemopericardium， after 36 months from the oncological diagnosis. It followed an autoptic investigation： the pancreatic histology was indicative for typical insulitis and pancreas beta-cells expressed PDL1in 42% of specific endocrine tissue (Figure l and 2).**\n\n【20】**Discussion**\n\n【21】**The case described is a new form of autoimmune insulin-dependent diabetes， which appears rapidly as a consequence of the use of checkpoint inhibitors. Yoneda et al. \\[9\\] showed with immunohistochemical analyses the number (more than 15 times higher than that of the control group) and the composition(CD8>CD4) of infiltrating CD3-positive T lymphocytes into pancreatic islets and exocrine region in the pancreas of a patient who developed type 1 diabetes after immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. Non-obese diabetic mice lacking PD-L1 develop rapid onset of diabetes： In pancreatic islets low expression of PD-L1 is associated with increased B-cell injury \\[10\\]. In patients affected by autoimmune type 1 diabetes， a decrease PD1 expression is reported also in peripheral CD4+ T cells \\[11\\].**\n\n【22】**We show a histologic image of a typical insulitis related to use of a checkpoint inhibitor like the insulitis in autoimmune type 1 diabetes. The expression of PD-L1 on beta pancreatic cells may be implicated in immunological tolerance and may induce an autoimmune process.**\n\n【23】**Other cases of type 1 diabetes related to PD1/PDL1 checkpoint inhibitors are described in literature \\[12，13\\]. The increasing use of these new drugs stimulates the publication of new guidelines for the**\n\n【24】**identification and treatment of specific side effects \\[14\\]. These side effects may compare in 7 to 11 weeks after the beginning of therapies with checkpoint inhibitors，but they also may develop after months or years， and may have a long duration. It's important to identify these symptoms because the treatment is completely different from the conventional chemotherapy.**\n\n【25】**In conclusion， immune checkpoint inhibitors (anti-CTLA-4and anti-PDL-1) can induce the development of autoimmune diseases， among which autoimmune endocrinopathies (thyroiditis， adrenalite， hypophysitis， type 1 diabetes)： Therefore， before the beginning of the treatment， it's important to take an accurate personal and familiar history， to control hormones and glycemia before， during and after treatment and， if possible， to evaluate a screening antibodies panel in order to select patients at greater risk of developing an autoimmune diseases.**\n\n【26】**References**\n\n【27】1\\.

Lactic acidosis although very rare is a serious complication of metformin use. It can be life-threatening with mortality as high as50% if not recognized and treated early. We report a rare case of fatal metformin poisoning due to severe lactic acidosis following a 40 yr old divorcee with primary infertility secondary to polycystic ovarian syndrome. Treatment of metformin induced lactic acidosis involves the use of renal replacement therapy， sodium bicarbonate infusion and general measures. This case was reported in order to alert physicians on the existence of this rare but life-threatening endocrine emergency. Late presentation was a major limiting factor in the management ofthis patient.**\n\n【13】**Keywords： Lactic acidosis； Metformin； Coma； Suicide**\n\n【14】**Introduction**\n\n【15】**Metformin， a dimethyl-biguanide， is a widely used oral anti-hyperglycemic agent used in the long-term treatment of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM)， polycystic ovarian syndrome and gestational diabetes \\[1，2\\]. As a result of its efficacy， safety， lower tendency to Hypoglycemia， cardiovascular and metabolic benefits， it has become the first drug of choice in the treatment of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) \\[3，4\\]. It acts primarily in the liver to reduce blood glucose by decreasing glucose output and， secondarily， in the peripheral tissues mainly in the muscles by increasing glucose uptake \\[1，5\\].**\n\n【16】**Although the most common adverse effects of metformin are mainly gastrointestinal (nausea， vomiting， diarrhea and abdominal discomfort)， it also has the potential to cause lactic acidosis. Metformin associated lactic acidosis has been reported even at therapeutic doses in patients with end stage renal disease， heart failure or liver disease \\[6\\]. Therefore， caution must be exercised in administering such drugs in those groups of patients.**\n\n【17】**Studies have not shown any difference between the incidence of lactic acidosis in patients with diabetes taking metformin and those not taking metformin as reported in a meta-analysis of 194studies by Salpeter et al.， it however a recognized complication of metformin use \\[7\\]. We present a fatal case of metformin associated lactic acidosis where interactions with benzodiazepines and nicotine may have potentiated the condition that led to the demise of the patient.**\n\n【18】**Case Presentation**\n\n【19】**A 40-year-old divorcee diagnosed with primary infertility secondary to polycystic ovarian syndrome， being treated with metformin 1000 mg daily. She was also taking Bromazepam 3 mg daily for clinically diagnosed depression. She was referred to the emergency of our hospital after deliberately ingesting about 100 tablets of metformin (100 g) 48 h earlier in a suicide attempt. At presentation， she was deeply unconscious with GCS of 3/15 on 100% oxygen via nasal prong. She had intravenous fluid and later vasopressors. The urethral catheter was in-situ and draining less than50 ml in 12 h and RBS was 122 mg/l. Blood pressure was 70/? mmHg， pulse rate was weak， and all extremities were cold and clammy. Chest findings were wide spread coarse crackles in all lung zones.**\n\n【20】**No jaundice or bleeding from anybody orifice. She had about three episodes of cardiac arrest and was resuscitated.**\n\n【21】**Results of laboratory investigations reported a hematocrit of 19.5%， Urea of 2.1 mmol/l， creatinine of 44 mmol/l，potassium of 5.6 mmol/l， bicarbonate of 13 mmol/l， sodium of 141 mmol/l， chloride of 123 mmol/l， whole blood lactate of 16.1 mmol/l normal range (0.5 mmol/1-1mmol/l)， urine toxicology positive for benzodiazepine and cotinine.**\n\n【22】**Liver function tests was normal (AST 28U/L， ALT 32U/L， GGT41U/L， and ALP 169U/L). After about four hours of resuscitation， the patient was confirmed clinically death as she had unrecordable oxygen saturation， fixed and dilated pupils.**\n\n【23】**Discussion and Conclusion**\n\n【24】**Lactic acidosis is a rare but life-threatening complication of metformin use and can occur at high doses of administration or at therapeutic doses in the background of end organ damage like， heart liver and kidney failure or in situations of cardiorespiratory compromise \\[3\\]. The symptoms of lactic acidosis are non-specific， may include anorexia， nausea， vomiting， abdominal pain， lethargy， hyperventilation，and hypotension. It is clinically characterized bythe presence of pH<7.35， blood lactate levels of >2.0 and a PCO， of <42mmHg.**\n\n【25】**Although metformin associated lactic acidosis is a rare condition， with an estimated prevalence of one to five cases per 100，000populations， it has a reported mortality of 30% to 50% \\[3\\].**\n\n【26】**Several studies have reported that the prognosis of individuals who develop lactic acidosis from the use of metformin is unrelated to plasma metformin concentration or lactate level \\[2，3\\].**\n\n【27】**Once ingested， metformin is absorbed in the gut via the enterocytes where it is transported to the liver through the portal circulation， in the liver； it causes an increase in the production of lactate by promoting glycolysis and causing a shift from aerobic to anaerobic respiration. Metformin induced lactic acidosis develops when there is an imbalance between increased lactate production and impaired metabolism and/or reduced lactate clearance.**\n\n【28】**The mechanism of Metformin induced lactic acidosis is due to the impairment of the clearance of lactate via inhibition of complex1 in the mitochondrial respiratory cycle \\[3\\]. Despite the fact that metformin is considered safer than insulin or sulphonylureas due to its lesser tendency to hypoglycemia， the mortality in biguanides(6.1%) overdosing is much higher than overdoses of insulin and sulphonylureas (0.9 and 3.6%) respectively as reported in a study by Von March et al. \\[8\\]. Interactions with other drugs like alcohol， benzodiazepines and barbiturates can potentiate the risk of developing lactic acidosis. Therefore， early diagnosis and initiation of intervention in the form of renal replacement therapy is important in order to restore blood lactate levels to normal. This is largely due to the fact that metformin does not bind to plasma proteins and is excreted mainly unchanged in the urine. The index patient presented late as such she could not benefit from the renal replacement therapy.**\n\n【29】**The type of renal replacement therapy to be instituted depends the nature of the metformin intoxication. In metformin overdose， Intermittent or continuous renal replacement therapy with Hemodiafiltration is recommended. This has been attributed to the fact that the reductions in the metformin plasma levels have been found to be correlated with improvement of lactic acidosis. Extracorporeal hemodialysis is preferred provided that the patient is hemodynamically stable. Discontinuation of treatment is indicated when lactate levels are lower than 3 mmol/L and pH is higher than7.35. Hypotension should be treated with intravenous fluids and vasopressors in order to restore the circulatory status to normal. Treatment of acid base disturbances is necessary in order to restore normal cellular function resulting from alterations in the cellular concentrations of Nat and Ca+ levels due the pH disturbances. The mainstay in the treatment of acidosis is to target the underlying**\n\n【30】**cause as the use of sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO，-) is controversial. In diseases where there is evidence of NaHCO.-losses， there is clear evidence ofthe benefit of replacement therapy. There are however no validated clinical studies on NaHCO，-replacement involving patients with lactic acidosis and hemodynamic instability.**\n\n【31】**At a certain point acidosis has a protective effect in anoxic or ischemic cell， this effect is however lost as the level of acidosis becomes severe. The indications for interfering in acidosis include pH<7.2，HCO，-<10 mmol/l， and base deficit >10 mmol/l. Mortality in metformin induced lactic acidosis can be as high as 50%， although that is lower than that of other causes of lactic acidosis (50% vs.74%) \\[9，10\\]. Therefore， metformin induced lactic acidosis has a better prognosis than other causes of lactic acidosis like sepsis and circulatory failure. Benzodiazepines， when ingested alone are rarely associated with a high mortality or morbidity， but the risk of death rises exponentially when ingested with other drugs especially alcohol， opiates or other sedatives. The risk of death with benzodiazepines is largely due to the fact that they can cause apnea， a risk is highest with alprazolam \\[6，10\\]. One of the limitations of our report is the inability to measure serum metformin levels which is not available in oiir center.**\n\n【32】**This case was reported in order to alert physicians and care givers on the existence of this rare butlife-threatening endocrine emergency. Early detection and institution of appropriate management measures is essential to survival. A Late presentation was a major limiting factor in the management of this patient. This is in addition to the interaction of metformin with benzodiazepines which by themselves can cause lactic acidosis and increased the risk of death of the patient. The inability to measure the serum levels and exclude sulphonyl urea is a major limitation in this study.**\n\n【33】**Acknowledgement**\n\n【34】**The authors acknowledged the effort of Dr Abubakar Bawaand other staff of the Chemical Pathology Department of the Aminu Kano Teaching Hospital who assisted in the laboratory investigations.**\n\n【35】**References**\n\n【36】**1\\.

Some cases are also associated with erosions， crusting， hair， and nail changes \\[2\\]. Most commonly， it is due to generalization of pre-existing dermatoses (such as psoriasis or atopic dermatitis)， drug reactions， or cutaneous T-cell lymphoma， but identification of the underlying disease process represents one of the most complex challenges in dermatology \\[1\\]. We present the case of a patient affected by multiple myeloma who developed erythroderma.**\n\n【17】**Case Presentation**\n\n【18】**A 66-year-old male with a medical history of multiple myeloma developed an erythematous rash spread over the entire skin surface， with scaling and itching. Dermatologic examination revealed extensive pink patches with feathering edges and large scaling on head， neck， trunk， and limbs (Figures 1， 2A， 2C，2E). He did not report previous dermatoses or known allergies， but a history of xerosis. Regarding multiple myeloma， he achieved Very Good Partial Response (VGPR) after four cycles of Bortezomib-Thalidomide-Dexamethasone (VTD) induction therapy followed by Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation (ASCT). Laboratory tests showed eosinophilia (5500/mm)， which has progressively increased for two months， until reaching a peak concomitantly with erythroderma. The previous month， acyclovir was replaced by valganciclovir for a cytomegalovirus reactivation (28000 copies/mL). Current blood tests found the presence of cytomegalovirus (481copies/mL)andhuman herpesvirus-7(90 copies/mL). Thepatient was started on oralprednisone and hydroxyzine， associated with topical steroids and emollients， but one month later erythroderma with lamellar scaling， intense itching and eosinophilia persisted， and thus a skin biopsy was performed. A week later， the patient developed fever， and blood cultures resulted positive for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus casseliflavus， therefore he received intravenous daptomycin in combination with piperacillin-tazobactam. Following the resolution of symptoms， all unnecessary drugs were suspended and intravenous 1 mg/kg/day dose of methylprednisolone was started， resulting in gradual improvement of erythroderma and eosinophilia. On the third day，**\n\n【19】**Figure 1： Dermatologic examination. Exfoliation of scale with underlying erythema and secondary excoriations on head (A) and knees (B).**\n\n【20】Figure 2： Dermatologic examination. Wide spread erythema with large thin scaling and excoriations (A， C， E). After the resolution of erythroderma， persistence of xerasis， lichenification and residual crusts (B， D， F).\n\n【21】**as the patient developed a febrile relapse with positive blood cultures for Klebsiella pneumoniae Carbapenemase (KPC) enzyme producers， steroid therapy was suspended， and ceftazidime-avibactam treatment was set. Clinical improvement was again interrupted by a new febrile episode associated with reactivation of cytomegalovirus (16000copies/mL) and worsening of erythroderma. Foscarnet therapy induced resolution of fever and reduction of erythema and itching. A further biopsy was performed， and intravenous methylprednisolone was started again. The pathologist concluded that histological and molecular findings were referable to a non-specific inflammatory reaction. After the resolution of erythroderma (Figures 2B， 2D， 2F) and negative viral tests， the patient was discharged with a follow-up prograr.**\n\n【22】**Discussion**\n\n【23】**Erythroderma is a condition caused by several etiologies that result**\n\n【24】Figure 3： 2-Plus-1 AD diagnostic criteria proposed by Reynolds et al. \\[7\\].\n\n【25】**in red inflamed skin on 80% to 90% or more ofthe body surface \\[1，2\\]. The diagnoses of the underlying systemic or cutaneous disease can be remembered with the mnemonic SCALPID： Seborrheic dermatitis/sarcoidosis； contact dermatitis； atopic dermatitis/autoimmune diseases； lymphoma/leukemia； psoriasis/pityriasis rubra pilaris； ichthyoses， infestations (Norwegian scabies)； drug reactions \\[2\\]. The most common disorders are contact dermatitis， atopic dermatitis， and psoriasis， along with drug reactions， while the most common malignancy is cutaneous T-cell lymphoma \\[2\\]**\n\n【26】**The color of the skin can vary from pink-red to red-brown to deep red-purple， and pruritus is observed in up to 90% of patients \\[1\\]. The onset of scaling is typically seen 2 to 6 days after the onset of the erythema \\[1，2\\]. It varies in size and color， depending upon the stage of the erythroderma and nature of the underlying disease： In more acute phases scales are usually large and crusted， whereas in chronic states they tend to be smaller and drier \\[1\\]. In cases of pre-existing dermatoses， nail changes may precede the erythroderma (e.g. pits in psoriasis or horizontal ridging in atopic dermatitis)， whereas others develop subsequently， for example they can become thick， dry， and brittle \\[1，2\\]. Colonization of the skin with Staphylococcus aureus is common and can lead to secondary cutaneous infections as well as**\n\n【27】**bacteremia \\[1\\].**\n\n【28】**A detailed history is crucial for diagnosing the underlying etiology： Patients must be asked about pre-existing medical conditions， allergies， medications， and skin diseases (atopic or other dermatitis， psoriasis， etc) \\[2\\]. The presentation of erythroderma in individuals without a pre-existing skin disease is more common with drug-induced erythroderma or malignancy； compared with other causes， the onset of erythroderma secondary to medication is typically more sudden and rapidly progressing， the resolution is often quicker， and additional manifestations may be observed， like fever and peripheral eosinophilia， along with facial swelling， hepatitis， myocarditis， and allergic interstitial nephritis： This constellation of findings is referred to as DRESS (Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms) \\[2\\]. Our patient reported no pre-existing dermatoses or allergies； he was recently started on valganciclovir， but there was no improvement despite its suspension， and eosinophilia already existed before. Furthermore， mites could not be identified from skin scraping examined microscopically， and a screening test panel for associated auto antibodies was negative， thus we performed a 4-mm punch biopsy. Histological examination showed parakeratosis， spongiosis， vacuolization in the basal layer， exocytosis1of lymphocytes and granulocytes， inflammatory infiltrate in the dermis (with predominantly CD4+ T lymphocytes， histiocytes and granulocytes， but a moderate amounts of ezsinophils) and edema of the dermis.**\n\n【29】**Histological findings were compatible with1paraneoplastic erythroderma， idiopathic erythroderma and atopic dermatitis \\[1\\]. Tests for multiple myeloma showed no evidence of disease activity， so we excluded this possibility. Erythroderma is labeled as idiopathic in9% to 47% of cases (this group is composed mainly of older adult men with a chronic and relapsing course of pruritic erythroderma) and longitudinal monitoring of patients with idiopathic erythroderma may reveal undiagnosed cutaneous T-celllymphoma \\[2\\]，therefore we performed a second biopsy to enhance the accuracy ofhistopathologic diagnoses， but it excluded again a lymphoproliferative disease and showed a non-specific inflammatory pattern. Acute lesions of atopic dermatitis show spongiosis， intracellular edema in the lower epidermis， exocytosis of lymphocytes， a perivascular infiltrate of lymphocytes and macrophages around vessels of the superficial plexus， mast cells in different stages of degranulation， and occasional eosinophils \\[3\\]. The presence of dermal eosinophilic infiltrates is a characteristic histological feature observed in skin biopsies from patients with erythrodermic atopic dermatitis \\[4\\]. The diagnosis of atopic dermatitis remains clinical， as there is currently no reliable biomarker that can distinguish the disease from other entities： An elevated total and/or allergen-specific serum IgE level is not present in about 20% of affected individuals \\[5，6\\] as well as in our patient. Of all the existing diagnostic criteria， none are considered wholly or mutually exclusive in the diagnosis of atopic dermatitis， which remains prerogative of the clinician \\[7\\]. According to the 2-Plus-1model (Figure 3) proposed by Reynolds et al. \\[7\\]， our patient had two essential features (acute eczema and pruritus) and one important feature (xerosis)， without any exclusionary features of atopic dermatitis.**\n\n【30】**Furthermore， the onset of erythroderma was associated with a Cytomegalovirus reactivation twice， and the second time antiviral therapy resulted in improvement of erythema and itching. We**\n\n【31】**believe that cytomegalovirus might have been a trigger of the cell-mediated immune response that unleashed an erythrodermic onset of atopic dermatitis. Triggers (e.g. viral infections， food allergens， cosmetics， fragrance， weather， and other causes) are the leading cause of an atopic dermatitis exacerbation， and avoidance of triggers is an important mechanism patients can use to control disease activity\\[5\\]. Hafez et al. \\[8\\] found that active subclinical cytomegalovirus infection is more frequent in patients with atopic dermatitis and may have possible immunomodulatory role in the etiopathogenesis， even if it is not related to disease severity. Docke et al.\\[9\\] suggest that active， subclinical cytomegalovirus infection is more frequent in patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis and may have immunopathological relevance \\[9\\]. In-spite of the high prevalence of cytomegalovirus infection and its potent immunomodulatory activities， the relation of cytomegalovirus to atopic dermatitis is still poorly understood \\[8，10\\].**\n\n【32】**Conclusion**\n\n【33】**Erythroderma is a dermatologic emergency that could necessitate hospital admission， therefore determining the underlying etiology is crucial， and any external aggravating factors must be eliminated. Specifically， any potential drugs inducing erythroderma must be stopped. Early diagnosis is paramount as it allows early treatment and prevention oferythroderma-associated morbidity and mortality. It is very important to recognize atopic dermatitis as a cause of erythroderma， especially in a patient with late onset of the disease and no personal or familial history of allergic diseases. Further studies are necessary to clarify the relationship between atopic dermatitis and cytomegalovirus infection.**\n\n【34】**References**\n\n【35】**1\\. Bolognia JL， Schaffer JV， Cerroni L.

At presentation， up to 25% of gastrinomas are metastasized， predominantly to the liver. The presence of liver metastases has a negative impact on the prognosis. Liver resection for neuroendocrine metastases is associated to long-term survival advantages and disease control. Nevertheless， the benefits of aggressive liver resection should be weighed against the potential risk of post-hepatectomy liver failure.**\n\n【12】**Summary： This report presents the case of a 41-year-old female patient who presented severe diarrhea due to a pancreatic functional gastrinoma with synchronic hepatic metastases.

It is caused by secretion of gastrin by duodenal or Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors(pNETs) called gastrinomas. Although gastrinomas are one of the most common functionalpNETs， only 25% of gastrinomas arise in the pancreas \\[1\\].**\n\n【19】**Recent data suggest that 65% of gastrinomas are malignant， and up to 30% to 40% of patients will have evident metastatic disease at initial presentation. The most frequent site of metastases is the liver (40% to 93%). Because of the poor clinical outcome of patients with advanced and metastatic gastrinomas，and the overall disappointing results with systemic therapy， an aggressive management approach through hepatic resection with curative intent of metastatic NETs is encouraged \\[2\\].**\n\n【20】**Future Liver Remnant (FLR) function in patients with extensive compromise of liver parenchyma due to metastatic disease ought to be thoroughly evaluated before hepatic resective surgery is performed in order to prevent Post-Hepatectomy Liver Failure (PHLF) \\[3\\]. Therefore， whenever an insufficient FLR function is predicted， different surgical techniques can be applied to reduce morbidity and mortality due to PHLF by promoting FLR function improvement prior to a major hepatic resection. Associating Liver Partition and Portal Vein Ligation for Staged Hepatectomy (ALPPS) constitutes one of the latest and promising technical advances among these**\n\n【21】**complex groups of surgical strategies. More recently， a less invasive ALPPS variant， Mini-ALPPS， has been described by our group minimizing the first stage impact to promote rapid patient recovery and leaving the main surgical procedure for the second stage， thus decreasing morbidity and mortality.**\n\n【22】**This report presents the case of a 41-year-old female patient who presented severe diarrhea due to a pancreatic functional gastrinoma with synchronic hepatic metastases. Preoperative assessment of FLR function through a newly developed dynamic measure calculated using Hepatobiliary Scintigraphy (HBS)-HIBA index- is described. The present case report underlines surgical management consisting of Mini-ALPPS procedure which allowed primary and secondary lesions to be fully resected.**\n\n【23】**Case Presentation**\n\n【24】**Forty-one-year-old female patient without relevant prior medical history， who presented at our institution with episodic， watery， and sometimes explosive diarrhea consisting of approximately 10 to 15bowel movements per day， that had been gradually worsening over a 30-month period. The patient had undergone several uneffective empirical and symptomatic treatments at a different center. At our institution， clinical tests were performed， ruling out celiac disease and both bacterial and parasitic infections. Upper and lower endoscopies were performed. Lower endoscopy showed no relevant findings； whereas upper endoscopy revealed a hyperplastic polyp and mild chronic gastritis. Helicobacter pylori were not detected in the gastric biopsy. Consequently， a proton pump inhibitor (omeprazole) was prescribed (20 mg/day). Interestingly， her severe case of diarrhea improved after the first dose of omeprazole. Afterwards， with an etiological diagnostic purpose， an abdominal ultrasound was**\n\n【25】**Figure 1： A-C). Multislice computed tomography.

Subsequently， an abdominal multislice computed tomography was performed which confirmed numerous bilateral hepatic hypodense nodular lesions with prompt brief arterial hypervascularity and rapid wash-out during the portal venous phase. These images were compatible with secondary locations of a hidden primary malignant tumor (Figures 1A-1C). A magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography showed the known hepatic nodules as well as a 12 mm nodular image in the distal section of the body of the pancreas (Figures 1D-1E). Routine laboratory tests， serum Chromogranin A levels， serum tumor markers (cancer antigen 19-9， alpha-fetoprotein， and carcinoembryonic antigen) and urinary excretion of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid were within normal parameters. However， serum gastrin was 2.100 pg/ml， with a normal reference value from 13 pg/ml to 115 pg/ml.**\n\n【28】**Based onthepresumptive diagnosis of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome due to pancreatic gastrinoma with liver metastasis， a radical two-stage surgery was performed. Two weeks prior to the first-stage surgery， the patient received one dose of intramuscular octreotide long-acting release.**\n\n【29】**During the first stage a distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy were performed. Moreover， the hepatic metastatic disease was approached as well， by performing the first procedure of Mini-ALLPS technique as previously described by our group \\[4\\].

Eight days after the first stage， a multislice computed tomography was performed which showed the expected postoperative modifications：Hyperdense images in the hepatic right lobe compatible with previous intraoperative right portal vein embolization.

The patient was discharged on postoperative day 9 without complications.**\n\n【32】**In order to prevent PHLF and based on the notion that FLR volume is not equivalent and sometimes overestimates FLR function， a HBS using 99mTc-mebrofenin was performed to assess FLR function. As previously described by our group， the HIBA-index was used to estimate the risk of PHLF (being the risk higher if HIBA-index was <15%). During the first HBS performed 10 days after the first stage， functional analysis through single photon emission computed tomography revealed a FLR function/total liver function of 21%， while HIBA index was 14.76% and Amsterdam index was0.76% min/m. Consequently， the second stage was postponed. A second HBS was performed 30 days after the first stage revealing a FLR/total liver function of 25%，HIBA index of 17% and Amsterdam index of 0.8% min/m.**\n\n【33】**The second stage procedure was carried out 51 days after the first stage and it consisted of a right hepatectomy (Figure 5).

To the date， four months after her primary first-stage procedure， the patient remains with good clinical evolution without evidence of disease.**\n\n【42】**Discussion**\n\n【43】**Gastrinomas make up 16% to 30% of functional pNETs and hyper-secretegastrin resulting in Zollinger Ellison syndrome， the classic symptoms of which are refractory peptic ulcer disease and secretory diarrhea. Chronic diarrhea is a common problem affecting up to 5% of the population at a given time and， frequently， its etiological diagnosis entails a trying task \\[5\\]. However， when it presents associated with acid-related peptic disease and improves after prescription of proton pump inhibitors， functional NETs such as gastrinoma， must be ruled out.**\n\n【44】**Metastases are detected at diagnosis in about 40% to 80% of patients with pNETs. Surgery remains the treatment of choice in selected patients with pNETs and resectable liver metastases， because it may provide cure. Primary tumor resection combined with neuroendocrine liver metastasectomy may have either curative intent， when complete resection is possible， or palliative intent， when the majority of the tumor burden is removed to control the symptoms of the disease \\[2\\]. Liver resection for neuroendocrine metastases is associated to long-term survival advantages and disease control. Furthermore， this incremental increase in survival time has been described to have occurred regardless of tumor grade. According to guidelines and related studies， the minimum criteria for cytoreductive surgery of liver-metastatic pNETs are as follows：1) G1/G2 liver-metastatic pNET； 2) the primary is resectable； 3) no unresectable extrahepatic disease； 4) younger patients with an acceptable morbidity and low mortality； 5) tumor volume with <25%liver involvement； 6) up to 90% or at least >70% of tumor load is thought to be resectable preoperatively； and 7) treatment decision**\n\n【45】**making requires a multidisciplinary approach；8) either one-stage or two-stage surgery may be recommended \\[6\\].**\n\n【46】**Post-hepatectomy liver failure remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality after major liver resection. Although the etiology of PHLF is multifactorial， an inadequate functional liver remnant is thought to be the most important modifiable predictor of PHLF. For people with a normal liver， an FLR ≥ 25% of total liver volume is adequate to avoid PHLF. Patients with chronic liver disease but without cirrhosis usually require an FLR of at least 30%while patients with cirrhosis but without portal hypertension require an FLR of at least 40%. A shift toward parenchymal-preserving operations has led to a decrease in morbidity and mortality， with excellent oncologic outcomes even in patients with significant disease burden in the liver. Parenchymal-preserving liver surgery is ideal for these well-encapsulated tumors. Non-anatomic resections in combination with ablation offer comparable oncologic results in small tumors \\[7\\]. Two-staged hepatectomies also provide a feasible resective approach for these patients. Moreover， ALPPS， a novel technique first described by Schnitzbauer et al. \\[8\\] in 2012， thoroughly accelerates FLR hypertrophy increasing the feasibility to complete both stages. As originally described， the technique consists of right portal vein ligation combined with in situ splitting ofliver parenchyma during the first stage， followed by a second stage(resective procedure) performed at surgeon discretion after assessing FLR sufficiency， usually within 7 to 10 days. In 2016， our group put forward a new surgical paradigm for ALPPS called“Mini-ALLPS”， aiming to maximally reduce the aggressiveness and surgical impact of ALPPS first stage. The proposal incorporated the combination of Partial Parenchymal Transection (PPT) with Intraoperative Portal Vein Embolization (IPVE) as well as minimum liver mobilization， without hilar dissection \\[4\\]. This approach proves useful in cases such as the one presented in this review， where considerable bilobar hepatic disease requires FLR clean-up and functional enhancement， apart from primary pancreatic tumor resection.**\n\n【47】**FLR function assessment before indicating a mayor hepatic resection or to postpone second-step surgery until satisfactory activity has been reached， is key to the success of this complex procedure. Dynamic 99mTc-mebrofenin hepatobiliary scintigraphy was developed as a quantitative method for evaluating total and regional liver function， including FRL function. In 2017， Serenari et al. \\[9\\] described inter stage assessment of FLR function in ALLPS using HBS and found that HIBA index a newly developed dynamic measure representing the proportion of radionuclide accumulated in the FLR- of <15% to best predict clinically significant PHLF in patients with an already sufficient FLR volume.**\n\n【48】**To summarize， this case comprises at least three uncommon and/or novel subjects. Firstly， the unusual diagnosis of a pNET after a two-year history of misdiagnosed diarrhea. A high level of diagnostic suspicion must be maintained when pNETs are involved， since their early diagnosis allows for the treatment of a localized disease rather than an advanced one， with the management and technical vicissitudes that this brings about， for the patient， the medical team and the health system.**\n\n【49】**Secondly， primary pancreatic tumor resection associated with two-stage hepatectomy is a challenging but feasible approach in this type of metastatic disease. Patients with advanced pNETs without extrahepatic involvement benefit greatly from RO resection and the Mini-ALLPS technique proves a useful tool to achieve this goal； its**\n\n【50】**primary advantages being： 1) A less aggressive first stage which allows the patient to recover rapidly and uneventfully， 2) induced FLR hypertrophy through PPT and IPVE， and 3) a second stage facilitated by lesser perihepatic and hilar inflammation.**\n\n【51】**Lastly， in extended liver resections， function rather than volume alone， should dictate the minimal FLR Preoperative or interstage measurement of 99mTc-mebrofenin uptake in the FLR on functional HBShas proved more valuable than measurement ofthe volume ofthe future remnant in the assessment of the post hepatectomy risk of liver failure and liver failure-related mortality \\[10\\]. Using HIBA index， the parameter developed by our group， with a 15% cut-off value， second-stage surgery can be postponed until a safe FLR function is achieved in order to reduce the risk of PHLF.**\n\n【52】**Conclusion**\n\n【53】**In conclusion liver metastatic pNETs can be approached through an aggressive RO resection with curative intent as long as a meticulous appraisal of FLR function is conducted to ensure the patient's postoperative safe and uneventful recovery.**\n\n【54】**When pNETs are involved， early diagnosis allows a higher rate of respectability. Primary pancreatic tumor resection associated with two-stage hepatectomy is a feasible approach when managing metastatic pNETs. In order to prevent PHLF， using HIBA index and second-stage surgery can be postponed until a safe FLR function is achieved.**\n\n【55】**Ethics Approval**\n\n【56】**This study was performed in line with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.

Although Thyroglobulin (TG) is rarely expressed in MTC， our previous studies found that there was a certain percentage of TG-positive MTC in clinical practice. We hereby aimed to explore the clinicopathological features of MT'C cases with positive expression of TG.**\n\n【14】**Methods： We conducted a retrospective study from June 2006 to October 2017. All the recruited cases were divided into two groups： TG-positive group and TG-negative group. Demographics， clinical profiles and pathological details were reviewed and following immunohistochemical analyses were conducted for recruited cases.**\n\n【15】**Results： Of All patients included， 25 were female and 25 were male， with a medium age of 46.7 years old. The proportion of cases with a tumor mass smaller than 1 cm in diameter in the TG-positive group was significantly higher than that in the TG-negative group (46.15% \\[6/13\\] vs. 5.56%\\[2/36\\]， P=0.001). The proportion of clinical stage I and stage II MTC cases in the TG-positive group was significantly higher than that in the TG-negative group (53.85% \\[7/13\\] vs. 11.11%\\[4/36\\]，P=0.001). In addition， the number of patients with lymph node metastases in the TG-positive group was significantly smaller than that in the TG-negative group (P=0.016). And the TG-positive group had a lower rate of calcium salt deposition than the TG-negative group (7.14%\\[1/14\\] vs. 36.11%\\[13/36\\]， P=0.045). The TG-positive groups had also lower rate of tumors with Amyloid deposits than the TG-negative group (50% \\[7/14\\] vs. 83.3% \\[30/36\\]，P=0.016). Immunohistochemical tests showed that TG-positive cells were not only limited to the follicular structures， but also expressed in non-follicular structures such as nests， cords and sheet structures. TG-positive cells showed partially synchronous immune response to CT， CgA， Syn and CEA， which could be differentiated from mixed medullary follicular carcinoma， suggesting that TG positive cells are not the remnants of the thyroid follicular cells. MTC cells showed the ability to express TG and CT， CgA， Syn， CEA simultaneously.**\n\n【16】**Conclusion： TG-positive MTC cases had significantly smaller size of tumor， lower rate of lymph node metastasis， earlier clinical stages， and better prognosis than TG-negative MTC cases in this study.**\n\n【17】**Keywords： Medullary thyroid carcinoma； Thyroglobulin； CT； CEA； CgA；Syn**\n\n【18】**Introduction**\n\n【19】**Medullary Thyroid Cancer (MTC) is the third most common thyroid malignancy. It is an independent clinicopathologic entity， with unique incident rate and specialized methods for diagnosis and treatment. It originates from the parafollicular or Calcitonin-producing cells (Ccells) and maintains the features ofthese cells \\[1，2\\]. Computed tomography assay is of great significance to the diagnosis of thyroid myelin cancer. However， pathological diagnosis is currently considered to be the gold standard for the diagnosis ofthyroid myelin-like cancer， and with the popularization and application of new molecular detection techniques in pathological practice， pathological diagnosis has developed into the era of organic combination of morphological diagnosis and molecular pathology diagnosis \\[3\\]. Thyroglobulin (TG) has been used as a marker for thyroid carcinoma for many years due to its high sensitivity and specificity to different thyroid carcinomas. TG is**\n\n【20】**expressed in more than 95% of papillary and follicular carcinomas， but usually reduced in poorly differentiated carcinoma and absent in anaplastic carcinoma \\[4-6\\]. Hales et al discovered TG-positive immunoreaction in MTC that does not produce TG normally\\[7\\]. Scholars had different interpretations on it， but the biological significance ofthe TG in MTC is rarely discussed. There was a report that conducted clinicopathological and prognostic analysis of the MTC with immunoreaction to TG in China \\[8\\]， but it was speculated that the TG-positive cells were in the remnants of thyroid follicular cells or the atypical follicular carcinoma \\[9\\].**\n\n【21】**In this study， TG-positive cells were not only limited to the follicular structures， but also present in non-follicular structures such as nested， bundle-like and fluke structures as well. Thus， we compared similarities and differences of clinical， histological and immunohistochemical features between the TG-positive and the TG-negative MTC groups， and then discussed possible clinical treatments and prognosis.**\n\n【22】**Patients and Methods**\n\n【23】**Patients**\n\n【24】**A total of 210 cases of MTC were surgically and pathologically diagnosed in Zhejiang Cancer Hospital from June 2006 to October2017， from which only 50 cases were included in the retrospective statistical analyses，excluding 160 cases that do not meet the diagnostic criteria (Figure 1).**\n\n【25】**The inclusion criteria were as follows： (1) WHO performance status of I to II； (2) serum calcitonin (CT) level ≥ 500 pg/Ml； (3) Pathological diagnosis met MTC standards； (4) The patient had a serum TG test. The exclusion criteria were as follows： (1) There was no pathological tissue examination or the clinical data were incomplete；(2) the patient had significant cardiac， hematopoietic， hepatic， or renal dysfunction or received chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy within 4 weeks before random assignment.**\n\n【26】**All patients provided written informed consents. This study protocol was consistent with the ethical guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Institution of Anji Hospital， Zhejiang University (IRB number： 2018AN0381).**\n\n【27】**Demographics， levels of serum CT， TG and other biomedical indicators， pathological diagnostics and clinical data of all the recruited patients were collected. The clinical manifestations， TNM stages \\[9，10\\]， pathological characteristics and prognosis were summarized. Pathological analysis was carried out by Hematoxylin-Eosin (HE) pathological staining and immunologic tissue chemistry.**\n\n【28】**Immunohistochemistry**\n\n【29】**Formalin-Fixed _d_ Paraffin-Embeddedd(FFPE)tissie sections were stained with HE for histologic examination. Immunostaining was performed to the FFPE sections using antibodies against thyroglobulin (TG， 1：600， DAKO)， Calcitonin (CT， 1：150， DAKO)， Chromogranin A (CgA， 1：600， DAKO)， Synaptophysin (Syn， 1：150， DAKO)， Thyroid Transcription Factor-1(TTF-1， 1：1500， DAKO)， Ki-67(1：1000， DAKO) and Carcinoembryonic Antigen (CEA，1：600， DAKO) using an indirect immunoperoxidase technique. All antibodies were from DAKO (Denmark). For antibody staining， sections were heated for antigen retrieval for 5 min at 120°C in 0.01M citrate buffer pH 9.0. The immunohistochemical method was an indirect method for peroxidase labeling. The positive staining of TG， CT， CgA and Syn was localized in the cytoplasm， the positive staining**\n\n【30】**of CEA was located in the capsule， and the positive staining of TTF-land Ki-67 was located in the nucleus. Brown indicated positive， while no staining indicated negative.**\n\n【31】**Statistical methods**\n\n【32】**Values are presented as Mean ± SEM. Statistical analyses were conducted using Graph Prism software (SAS Institute). Statistical comparisons between groups were analyzed for significance by two-tailed t test or one-way ANOVA with Chi-square test. Results were considered significant at P values of <0.05.**\n\n【33】**Results**\n\n【34】**Baseline demographics， tumor featuresSand clinical features**\n\n【35】**A total of 50 patients were included， among which were 25females and 25 males， with a mean age at 50.5 years. The TG-positive group (10 females and 4 males) accounted for 71.43%，and the TG-negative group (15 females and 21 males) accounted for41.67%. The medium age of TG-positive group was 52 years， while the medium age of the TG-negative group was 48 years. However， there was no statistical significance between two groups in gender or age. Among all cases， 8 had a tumor smaller than 1 cm in diameter，41 larger than 1 cm in diameter， and 1 with unknown tumor size. Among cases with a tumor smaller than 1 cm， 6 were TG-positive， accounting for 46.15% of all TG-positive cases， and only 2 were TG negative， accounting for 5.56% of all TG-negative cases (P=0.001). Among all cases， 11 were diagnosed with Stage I or II MTC， and38 with Stage III or higher. Among all Stage I and II MTC cases， 7were TG-positive， accounting for 53.8% of 13 TG-positive cases， and4 were TG-negative， accounting for only 11.1% of all TG-negative cases (P=0.001). The results showed significant differences between the TG-positive and the TG-negative groups in tumor size and MTC staging. However， there was no significant difference between the two groups in mass number， the range of the affected thyroid gland and the level of calcitonin (Table 1).**\n\n【36】**Pathologic characteristics between the TG-positive and the TG-negative groups**\n\n【37】**The pathological diagnosis of MTC remains the gold standard. The structure of MTC was diverse， with both groups showing follicular， adenoid， nested， organoid， island， trabecular， bundle-like， and fluke structures.

Therefore， it is necessary to develop a more specialized and sensitive prognosis metric for MTC in clinical practice.**\n\n【54】**MTC can synthesize and secrete CT， CgA， Syn， CEA and so on. TG is a protein precursor of triiodothyronine and thyroxine， and is produced exclusively by thyroid follicular cells， both benign and malignant. There were a few researchers proposed that TG， as**\n\n【55】**Table 3： Comparison of immunohistochemistry of TG-pasitive MTC and TG-negative MTC.**\n\n|  | **TG+MTC (n=14)**  | **TG-MTC (n=36)**  | **X**  | **P**  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **CT**  |  |  |  |  |\n| **Pasitive**  | **13**  | **35**  | **2.55**  | **0.11**  |\n| **Negative**  | **1**  | **0 (1 untested)**  | **2.55**  | **0.11**  |\n| **CgA**  |  |  |  |  |\n| **Pasitive**  | **13**  | **36**  |  |  |\n| **Negative**  | **0 (1 untested)**  | **0**  |  |  |\n| **Syn**  |  |  |  |  |\n| **Pasitive**  | **12**  | **33**  |  |  |\n| **Negative**  | **0 (2 untested)**  | **0 (3 untested)**  |  |  |\n| **CEA**  |  |  |  |  |\n| **Pasitive**  | **8**  | **25**  | **0.66**  | **0.42**  |\n| **Negative**  | **1 (5 untested)**  | **1(10 untested)**  | **0.66**  | **0.42**  |\n| **TTF1**  |  |  |  |  |\n| **Pasitive**  | **12**  | **28**  | **0.01**  | **0.94**  |\n| **Negative**  | **2**  | **5 (3 untested)**  | **0.01**  | **0.94**  |\n| **Ki-67**  |  |  |  |  |\n| **≤1%**  | **2**  | **3**  | **1.1**  | **0.29**  |\n| **\\>1%**  | **3 (9 untested)**  | **14(19 untested)**  | **1.1**  | **0.29**  |\n\n【57】**a mature product of terminal secretion appeared in MTC， suggests low malignancy and slow invasion behavior of the tumor， TG-positive MTC has a better prognosis than TG-negative MTC \\[11，12\\]. However， the study on expression of TG in MTC is rarely reported worldwide.**\n\n【58】**This study retrospectively analyzed 50 MTC cases with TG tested， in order to further understand characteristics and biological significance of TG-positive MTC， and to speculate that whether TG could be used as an indicator of the prognosis for MTC.**\n\n【59】**In this study， we found that there were more females than males in 14 cases of TG-positive MTC， and the average age of onset was**\n\n【60】**Figure 4： A) The immunohistochemical tests of CT， which was strongly positive expressian in cancer-cytoplasm of MTC (x100)： B： The immunohistochemical tests of CgA， which was weakly pasitive expression in cancer- cytoplasm of MTC (x100)； C： The immunahistochemical tests of CEA， which was strangly pasitive expressian in cancer-cytoplasm of MTC (x100)； D： The immunahistochemical tests of Syn， which was strangly pasitive expressian in cancer-cytoplasm of MTC(x100)： E： The immunohistochemical tests of TTF-1， which was strangly positive expression in cancer-nucleus of MTC(x100)； F： Ki-67 The immunohistochemical tests of ki-67， which was sporadic positive expression in cancer-nucleus of MTC (x100).**\n\n【61】**46.7 years old， which is in agreement with the Tumors of Endocrine Organs， 2006 WHO in which the average age of onset of sporadic cases was 50 years old， with slightly higher incidence in females. We also found， 46.15% of cases in the TG-positive group have a tumor smaller than 1 cm in diameter， much higher than 5.56% in the TG-negative group. The number of cases with a tumor size more than 1cm was 0 in TG-positive MTC group and 7 in the TG-negative group. It is widely believed that the survival time of the MTC patients is shorter and the prognosis is poor when the tumor is larger than 4 cm in diameter. The proportion of late stage MTC (stage III or higher) in the TG-positive group was lower than that in the TG-negative group (46.15% vs. 88.89%， P=0.001)， which may indicate that TG positive MTC has better prognosis. According to some reports \\[7\\]， both a primary tumor diameter more than 4 cm and thyroid capsular invasion， which are both indicators of Stage III MTC， have an effect on the prognosis of MTC patients.**\n\n【62】**Pathological diagnosis is the gold standard. Microscopically， the tissues of the MTC are mainly composed of polygonal cells and spindle cells. The typical medullary carcinoma can be either well-defined or directly infiltrating the surrounding thyroid tissue. Nested， bundle-like and fluke structures can be found arranged in the tumor \\[3\\]. There are more or less fibrous septums full of vessels between tumor cell nests. Amyloid structure can be found in the intercellular space of the tumor and interstitial cells， which is composed of eosinophilic and amorphous substance produced by cancer cells through a variety of methods. In this study， the rate of the Amyloid substance deposition in tumor of the TG-positive group was significantly lower than that of the TG-negative group(50% vs. 83.33%， P=0.001). According to the histological structure， MTC can be divided into several histological types， which are often mixed. The diagnosis of MTC is mainly according to a variety of permutations composed of spindle cells and epithelioid cells， and combined with immunohistochemical expression of CT， CgA， Syn， CEAandTTF-1.Both TG-positive MTC and TG-negative MTC have a variety of structures： follicular structures also appear in the fluke type； glandular-like and follicular-like structures are mixed in nesting type； most of them have neuroendocrine structures. The proportion of follicular structures in two groups was similar， which indicates that the tumor cells of follicular structure may not necessarily express TG. The TG-positive cells are not necessarily the remaining thyroid follicular cells or the atypical follicular carcinoma.**\n\n【63】**Xu Lai et al. reported that the 15-year survival rate of MTC with nodular goiter was significantly higher than that of MTC without nodular goiter， indicating that the prognosis of MTC with nodular goiter was excellent \\[8\\]. The proportion of nodular goiter in the TG-positive group was higher than that of the TG-negative group (64.3%vs.36.1%)， although there was no statistical difference， which could be due to small sample size and insufficient follow-up time in this study. The main route of MTC metastasis is regionallymph node metastasis. With the increase of tumor volume，the rate oflymph node metastasis is increased gradually. The most common sites of metastasis are tracheoesophageal groove lymph nodes and cervical lymph nodes， followed by upper mediastinal lymph nodes. Research showed that cervical lymph node metastasis is an important prognostic factor for MTC \\[13，14\\]. However， a multifactor analysis revealed that cervical lymph node metastasis might not be an independent risk factor for prognosis.**\n\n【64】**The rate of lymph node metastasis in the TG-positive group was significantly lower than that in the TG-negative group (50%**\n\n【65】**vs. 83.33%， P=0.016). One patient in the TG-positive group and5 patients in the TG-negative group had upper mediastinal lymph node metastases. Upper mediastinal lymph node metastasis is a characteristic of MTC. The upper mediastinal lymph node metastasis may spread from VI region lymph nodes along recurrent laryngeal nerve or from the pretracheal or paratracheal lymph nodes through lymph circulation. And the upper mediastinal lymph node metastasis may be an important cause of lung metastasis. No pulmonary metastases were found in patients of the two groups in this study.**\n\n【66】**The invasion of the thyroid capsular and vessel is related to a decreased survival rate of MTC patients. The TG-positive group had lower rate of capsular invasion (35.71% vs. 55.56%) and vascular invasion (14.29% vs. 16.67%) than the TG-negative group， but there was no significant difference. Tumor with vascular invasion is prone to distant metastasis. The most common distant metastatic sites are lung，liver， bone and brain. In this study， one case ofthe TG-negative group had lumbar and sacral metastases， but no distant metastases were found in the TG-positive group.**\n\n【67】**In the present， most of studies on MTC refer to CT and CEA， including serum level and immunohistochemical expression in tissue cells. Calcitonin is a sensitive and specific marker of MTC，and it is also an important indicator for preoperative diagnosis and postoperative follow-up. The high level of serum CEA>50% is reported to be high level in serum. The expression level of CEA is synchronous with CT\\[15\\]. Previous study discovered that the combination of CT and CEA could increase the diagnostic sensitivity of MTC to 95.7% \\[16\\]. There are lot similarities between MTC and other thyroid tumors in the morphological characteristics； therefore， the diagnosis of medullary cancer by optical microscopy alone has certain risks and limitations. Immunohistochemical stainingis an important means of examination for auxiliary diagnosis. The commonly used markers include CT， CEA， CgA， Syn and TTF-1. A large majority of MTC tumor cells express CT. In this study， almost all cases of MTC expressed CT， except for one TG-positive case that was CT-negative， and one TG-negative case whose CT was unmeasured. In the TG-positive group， CT was mostly weakly or partially positive； indicating that CT may also be an important indicator of MTC prognosis， which supported the findings of our previous article in 2017， but the prognosis in MTC was still unclear \\[17\\]. In this study， except for one CEA-negative case in each group， all other cases were positive for CEA. Positive immunoreactions to several neuroendocrine substances including CgA and Syn were detected in both TG-positive and TG-negative groups， which confirmed that MTC is endocrine-derived.**\n\n【68】**TTF-1 can be used as a marker of thyroid neuroendocrine carcinomas， such as medullary carcinoma. In this study， 2 cases in the TG-positive group and 5 cases in the TG-negative group showed negative results for TTF-1 staining， whereas the other cases were positive for TTF-1. TTF-1 was a more sensitive marker of thyroid carcinoma than other markers \\[17，18\\]. It is expressed in more than 90% of thyroid carcinomas， with the exception of anaplastic carcinoma in which its sensitivity is close to zero.**\n\n【69】**Few studies have focused on the expression of TG in MTC. Hales et al.， for the first time， proposed that TG is expressed in the MTC. Some researchers had conducted clinicopathological and prognostic analysis of MTC and found immunoreaction to TG \\[19\\]， which is consistent with the findings in this study that immunohistochemical TG-positive cells was not only limited to the follicular structures， but also present in non-follicular structures such as nested， bundle-like**\n\n【70】**and fluke structures， with partially synchronous immune response to CT， CgA， Syn and CEA as well， whereas the normal thyroid tissue wrapped around MTC did not show corresponding positive reactions.**\n\n【71】**MTC often invades the surrounding tissues and causes lymph node metastases. Therefore， early operation is the key to the treatment. Other therapeutic options including different extent of thyroidectomy， radiotherapy and chemotherapy schemes \\[20-22\\]； however， few of them are effective in curing MTC. In recent years， great progress has been made in molecular targeted therapy. The 5years survival rate of MTC is about 60% to 75%； with early diagnosis and standardized treatment， the survival rate can reach 90%. This study found that， compared with TG-negative MTC， TG-positive MTC was significantly smaller in tumor size， had a lower rate of lymph node metastasis， and was inclined to be categorized into earlier clinical stages， which indicated better prognosis. There was one death 3 years after operation in the TG-positive group and one death five years after operation in the TG-negative group. There was no significant difference between two groups in survival rate， which may be due to the limited follow-up time. From our study， it can be speculated that TG can be an indicator of the prognosis of MTCand provide a theoretical basis for molecular targeted therapy.**\n\n【72】**There are some limitations in our study， including the limited number ofpatients and region， which cannot represent all MT'C cases globally. Furthermore， only a few patients got genetic tests due to financial limitations， so we did not carry out the analysis of molecular genetic characteristics. Nevertheless， so far there has been a very limited research on TG expression in MTC. This studyretrospectively analyzed a number of MTC cases with TG expression and found a relationship between pathological morphological characteristics and clinical prognosis of TG-positive and TG-negative MTC. Further studies with larger sample size and extended follow-up time combined with molecular biology indicators are required in the future to fully understand the biological significance of TG expression in MTC，and improve prognosis and clinical evaluation of treatment of MTC.**\n\n【73】**Acknowledgement**\n\n【74】This work was supported by the Department of Pathology， Zhejiang Cancer Hospital.\n\n【75】**Funding**\n\n【76】This Study was funded by public welfare research project of Huzhou Science and Technology Bureau (NO.2017GY61).\n\n【77】**Availability ofData and Material**\n\n【78】**All data generated or analyzed during this study are included in this published article.**\n\n【79】**Authors'Contribution**\n\n【80】**JS performed the majority of experiments and drafted the paper.

We present a case of a47-year-old female with a rapidly growing giant Phyllodes tumor managed successfully with breast conservation and extreme oncoplastic reconstruction as an alternative to simple mastectomy which is typically recommended for lesions this size. The surgical approach utilized a split Wise pattern reduction on the affected side and standard Wise pattern on the contralateral side for symmetry. Ultimately， a complete resection with negative margins was achieved， along with satisfactory cosmesis and preserved nipple sensation for the patient. This case demonstrates the efficacy of using oncoplastic techniques in the management of a benign giant Phyllodes tumor.**\n\n【14】**Introduction**\n\n【15】**Phyllodes tumors， which derive their name from their leaf-like appearance on cross-sectional histology (from Greek Phyllon \\[\"leaf\"\\])， are fibroepithelial tumors that account for less than 1% of all breast cancers. Though Phyllodes tumors are typically benign， they boast a high recurrence rate with affected margins as an independent risk factor \\[1\\]. Tumor diameter varies widely in size， with12% of them larger than 10 cm and called “giant Phyllodes”\\[1\\]. These tumors present the surgeon with unique challenges， as wide excision with negative margins is critical to minimize the risk of reoccurrence \\[2\\]. Oftentimes， mastectomy and immediate reconstruction are the only options， due to tumor size-breast ratio， to ensure negative margins and with favorable aesthetic outcomes.**\n\n【16】**However， when preservation of native breast tissue is desired， creative surgical strategies must be utilized to achieve curability and cosmesis that is acceptable to the patient. Oncoplastic surgery is a well-established oncologic technique to reshape the remaining breast tissue following wide excisions， to allow a more acceptable cosmetic result. While this technique is routinely used in malignant breast cancers， its application in benign tumors is infrequently reported. We present the case of a 47-year-old female with rapidly enlarging right breast giant Phyllodes tumor managed with wide tumor excision and split Wise reduction with combined contralateral standard reduction for symmetry. To our knowledge， this oncoplastic technique has not previously been reported in the literature for surgical management of a giant Phyllodes tumor.**\n\n【17】**Case Presentation**\n\n【18】**A 47-year-old female with previous diagnosis of right breast fibroadenoma (2.5 cm)， presented with a growing right breast mass that had doubled in size over 6 months.**\n\n【19】**The examination revealed a multilobulated and mobile right breast mass， occupying entirely the lateral quadrants of the breast， without direct skin involvement or nipple retraction.Diagnostic studies showed a 12 cm right biphasic mass with cyst-like components， in the area of the previously biopsied fibroadenoma， favoring Phyllodes tumor (Figure 1). Due to the patient's strong desire to pursue breast and nipple preservation， a consultation with plastic surgery was recommended， to further discuss reconstructive options.**\n\n【20】**Patient was ultimately managed with wide local excision of the right breast mass with oncoplastic**\n\n【21】**Figure 1： a) Digital diagnostic mammogram in craniocaudal view showing large round circumscribed mass involving nearly the entire lateral breast with barbell dip at the lateral aspect indicating previously biopsied fibraadenama b) Panoramic diagnostic ultrasound view taken to estimate the size of the large round circumscribed mass in the upper outer quadrant， estimated to measure 12.8 cm in greatest dimension. Characteristic cleft-like cystic spaces are noted， better seen on traditional orthogonal views.**\n\n【22】**Figure 2： Front (a) and side (b)view showing a significant asymmetry due ta right breast occupying mass. Preoperative markings for right split reduction and standard left wise pattern reduction.**\n\n【23】**reconstruction using a split reduction and standard left Wise pattern reduction for symmetry. The procedure started by marking the skin in a modified wise pattern on the right to allow for a wide mass excision， and a traditional wise pattern on the left (Figure 2). A wide local excision of the right breast mass was completed. The mass， that appeared to be multilobulated， with multiple cystic components， was removed en-block to include the skin over the anterosuperior margin.**\n\n【24】**Figure 3： Surgical field after completion of wide excision (a)and customization of oncoplastic reconstruction (b).**\n\n【25】Figure 4： Gross specimen showing a multilobulated right breast mass containing multiple fluid-filled cystic lesions， measuring 13 cm x 12 cmx10cm and weighting 823 g.\n\n【26】**Figure 5： Front (a) and side (b) view of the patient at three months postoperative follow up.**\n\n【27】**provide an additional 2 cm cephalad to the lateral incision and 7cm caudad to allow for resection of this area. The medial portion of the**\n\n【28】**wise pattern was left intact. The incisions were temporarily tacked closed using surgical staples and the patient was sat upright (Figure3). The shape and volume ofher breasts appeared generally symmetric despite the split wise pattern on the right and the oncoplastic reconstruction proceeded. Before closing， nipple perfusion was confirmed through piercing with an 18-gauge needle and producing bright red blood. Drains were placed bilaterally. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was discharged home the day of surgery.**\n\n【29】**Histopathology analysis confirmed the diagnosis of benign Phyllodes tumor， exhibiting elongated epithelial-lined clefts in a largely well-circumscribed mass with focally ill-defined edges， scattered stromal mitoses (<2/10 hpf) and negative margins (Figure4).**\n\n【30】**At one week follow up the patient reported preserved nipple sensation bilaterally and a satisfactory cosmetic outcome (Figure5). Patient remains currently disease-free at 7-month follow up， as confirmed by diagnostic imaging. Patient will be closely monitored with diagnostic imaging every six months for 3 years， to account for the elevated risk of recurrence of the disease.**\n\n【31】**Discussion**\n\n【32】**Phyllodes tumors are breast tumors primarily diagnosed in females in the fourth and fifth decades of life， and may be classified as benign， malignant， or borderline \\[1\\]. With an incidence of 1 in100，000， they account for less than 1% of breast neoplasms \\[3\\]. Clinical presentation of the Phyllodes tumor includes insidious onset and slow progression of a painless， round， and mobile mass. Positive surgical margins remain the primary risk factor for Phyllodes tumor recurrence， thus NCCN guidelines recommends wide excision with at least 1 cm margins. However， despite the association between narrower surgical margins and heightened local recurrence risk， this is not are not an absolute indication for mastectomy when partial mastectomy fails to achieve a margin width≥1 cm \\[4\\]. The surgical approach depends largely on the size and location of the mass. Breast cosmesis is inversely proportional to the volume of breast tissue removed， and local deformity results in poorer cosmesis when over10% of the gland is excised \\[5\\]. Studies have suggested that there is no statistical significance in recurrence rate between conservation and mastectomy so long as excision margins are adequate \\[6\\].**\n\n【33】**Oncoplastic breast surgery techniques are defined as tumor-specific breast reconstruction methods that apply aesthetically derived breast reduction techniques to the field of breast cancer surgery， allowing for higher volume excision with no aesthetic compromise\\[7\\]. Preoperative planning is crucial to determine which surgical approach is appropriate， as volume of the initial breast tissue， extent， and location of tissue resection and volume of remaining available glandular tissue will equally weigh into applicability of the techniques\\[8\\].**\n\n【34】**Breast reduction and mastopexy requires additional meticulous planning to determine the appropriate resection pattern according to tumor size and location. The tumor must be included within the resection pattern. Massetti et al. outline the reduction/mastopexy oncoplastic approach as a four-step procedure consisting of parenchymal excision， parenchymal reshaping， repositioning of the Nipple-Areolar Complex (NAC)， and correction of the contralateral breast for symmetry \\[9\\]. The most common pattern used for wide excision with reduction mammoplasty is the wise pattern， which consists of the creation of three triangles with the inferior border**\n\n【35】**along the inframammary fold. When the tumors are in areas that do not normally fall within a standard-wise pattern， the pattern can be reconfigured to include the tumor， termed the “split wise”pattern. The lateral and medial triangles are then advanced upward to overlay the tumor， with the medial or lateral vertical limb of the inverted T being“split\"to accommodate the higher position of the triangle \\[7\\].**\n\n【36】**Extreme oncoplastic techniques (defined as oncoplastic surgery used in women with malignant breast cancers who otherwise require mastectomy) were employed to achieve successful resection and reconstruction. Silverstein was first to utilize the concept of extreme oncoplastic as an alternative to the more radical surgical approaches for breast cancers \\[10\\]. Since then， recent studies have demonstrated success in extreme oncoplasty， with a low rate of recurrence， acceptable local-regional control， and higher patient satisfaction \\[11\\]. To our knowledge， this is the first case presented in which extreme oncoplastic technique such as split wise reduction，has been employed for the resection and reconstruction of a giant Phyllodes tumor.**\n\n【37】**In the present report， the technique was the ideal option due to the ability to achieve tumor resection with safe margins， suitable cosmesis and patient desire for breast and nipple preservation. In cases of patients with larger and more ptotic breasts that also require a large volume of tissue replacement， such as the one presented here， techniques such as therapeutic mammoplasties or mastopexy can be employed to remove the area in question and concomitantly reshape the breast \\[12，13\\]. When large volume tissue resection is required， care must be taken to reduce the risk of wound healing complications to prevent delay of possible adjuvant treatment， especially in case of malignant Phyllodes. This case demonstrates that， with close collaboration between the breast surgery and plastic surgery teams， oncoplastic techniques can be utilized to achieve completed resection and excellent cosmetic outcomes in patients with giant Phyllodes tumors requiring complex reconstruction.**\n\n【38】**Conclusion**\n\n【39】**The giant Phyllodes breast tumors require unique considerations due to challenges in diagnosis and treatment. A high frequency of recurrence makes wide excision margins necessary， resulting in large volume defects and deformities of the breast. Oncoplastic techniques， such as a split wise pattern， should be considered as an alternative to mastectomy as proven to be oncological safe， and with improved cosmetic outcome affecting positive self-image and quality oflife.**\n\n【40】**References**\n\n【41】1\\.

The successful management of infants with ARMs starts with disease recognition. The newborn nursery must deliver high quality care to a high volume of mostly well babies on a day-to-day basis. A reliance on high-reliability principles that fosters teamwork， communication and continuous learning is crucial to this mission.**\n\n【14】**Upon recognizing an ARM within a newborn patient， clinical team members must be prepared to initiate a tailored， multi-disciplinary workup to ascertain the etiology of and inform the planning for long-term care of these infants.**\n\n【15】**Case Report**\n\n【16】**You are rounding in the newborn nursery when the nurse alerts you to a concerning physical finding she noticed during a diaper change. The patient is a two day old term infant female born via uncomplicated vaginal delivery. The mother’s prenatal course was notable only for excessive maternal weight gain in pregnancy but with normal glucose tolerance test. The infant’s birth weight ras appropriate for gestational age. There were no concerns on fetal ultrasound， and mother's prenatal labs were all within normal limits. Review of the chart indicates that the child has passed meconium and urine and she is breastfeeding well.**\n\n【17】**The child's physical examination is unremarkable except for multiple pink， raised soft tissue protuberances around the anus which expand in size when the infant valsalvas (e.g. during crying)(Figure 1). The protuberances immediately reduce when the infant calms. The nursery medical team suspects external hemorrhoids， so pediatric gastroenterology was consulted.**\n\n【18】**The consultant team confirms the finding and recommends abdominopelvic ultrasound. The concern was for the possibility of an intra-abdominal or hepatic arteriovenous malformation.**\n\n【19】**At 2 weeks of life， the thriving infant was seen in the pediatric gastroenterology clinic. The ultrasound was unremarkable. The infant had no signs ofexternal hemorrhoids at that time.**\n\n【20】**Discussion**\n\n【21】**Neonatal hemorrhoids fall under the broad category ofanorectal malformations ofthe newborn. ARMs can be associated with portal hypertension or anatomic anomalies (e.g. rectal polyps， malignancy，etc) which can obstruct venous outflow. Benign etiologies include impaired venous return caused by prolonged pressure on the newborn during delivery. Given that our patient thrived and had normal imaging， we suspect that alterations in venous tone- especially with exposure to maternal hormones during the delivery process-s could be at play.**\n\n【22】**Figure 1： Soft tissue protuberances around the anus which expand in size.**\n\n【23】**Conclusion**\n\n【24】**While neonatal hemorrhoids are most commonly a benign finding， medical teams must consider each patient’s case on an individual basis in order to triage what imaging and other diagnostic**\n\n【25】**workup is indicated.

Treatment of such infections is still challenging in clinical work. An Erbium-doped Yttrium Aluminum Garnet (Er：YAG) laser is reported efficient in disinfection and decontamination. This case report describes a patient with early post-implantation infection that caused severe bone resorption in the right mandibular anterior region 2 months after the implant surgery. Complaint of pain was recorded. After reasonable decontamination and debridement using Er：YAG laser， Guided Bone Regeneration (GBR) was performed. Six months after the surgery， CBCT was taken which indicated that the infected implant achieved re-osseointegration and no lucency around the fixture. Debridement with Er：YAGlaser is promising in treating the infected implant.**\n\n【12】**Keywords： Er：YAG laser； Post-implantation infection； GBR**\n\n【13】**Introduction**\n\n【14】**Early infection after dental implantation is not a common complication. Factors are mainly related to patients'systemic problems， such as untreated diabetes and heavy smoking， technical problems such as bone overheating during drilling and inaccurate implant inserting， compromised operation sterility， and poor oral hygiene \\[1\\]. Severe and acute infection can result in alveolar bone resorption， implant exposure and osseointegration failure. Due to the excessive dense bone， the risk of early implantation failure was 2.7 times higher when implants were placed in the anterior mandibular region than in the posterior mandibular region \\[2\\]. The wavelength of the Er：YAG laser is 2，940 um， which happens to be at the highest peak of water absorption， so it can be absorbed extraordinarily by water to produce a \"microexplosion\" effect. An Er：YAG laser can act on the deep of implant threads and produce less heat， so it is one of the ideal treatment modalities for decontamination and debridement of an infected implant and for promoting implant re osseointegration.**\n\n【15】**In this case report， by using Er：YAG laser for decontamination and debridement， the implant was saved with sufficient bone support. Favorable restorative results and excellent implant osseointegration were achieved.**\n\n【16】**Case Presentation**\n\n【17】**A 38-year-old female patient was received implant placement 2 months ago at mandibular right central incisor region. The patient suffered persistent swelling of the gingiva and pyorrhea with pain for about 1 months. No improvement was achieved after local irrigation with chlorhexidine. The patient denied a medical history with systematic disease， such as hypertension， diabetes and heart disease； no drug allergy； no bisphosphonate treatment； and no smoking.**\n\n【18】**A healing abutment was placed on the implant without mobility. The gingiva of the implant was showing hyperemia， swelling， and hemorrhage. A fistula was observed at the apical of the implant of the labial mucosa. Discomfort occurred when palpating the labial gingiva around the implant. CBCT images showed that the implant was present without the labial bone (Figure 1).**\n\n【19】**Under local anesthesia， a full-thickness flap was reflected to expose the implant. Labial bone was completely resorbed and the exposure of implant threads were observed. There was a large amount**\n\n【20】**Figure 1： A) Pre-operation clinical examination of the patient.

The vertical absorption of the labial bone was approximately 10 mm.**\n\n【23】**Granulation tissue was completely removed with an Er：YAGlaser(parameter settings： SP， 80 mJ， 30 Hz， and water/air： 5/2). Infected implant surface decontamination and debridement were achieved with an Er：YAG laser (parameter settings： SP， 50 mJ， 30 Hz， and water/air： 5/2). After debridement， there was a bone defect in the distal area of the implant.**\n\n【24】**After decortication， bone graft (0.5 g， Bio-Oss， Geistlich) was filled into the bone defect. A resorbable collagen membrane (13mm x 25 mm， Bio-Gide， Geistlich was placed upon the bone graft. Wound closure without tension was achieved by interrupted sutures. Postoperative CBCT images showed that bone graft with a thickness of 2.2 mm was observed on the labial aspect of the implant. Two weeks after the operation， the surgical area healed uneventful without membrane exposure or obvious abnormal secretions. A Maryland Bridge was placed as a temporary prosthesis.**\n\n【25】**Six months after surgery， CBCT images revealed that there was new bone formation on the labial aspect of the implant， and the implant was achieved osseointegration. A screw retaining temporary prosthesis was made to shape the gingival soft tissue. After 3 months， the final prothesis was produced. X-ray images revealed that the crown was seated well. The patient was satisfied with the effect of therapy (Figures 2A-2K).**\n\n【26】**Results**\n\n【27】**At the 24-month follow-up， the implant prostheses showed good function and no noticeable soft-tissue recession was observed. The radiologic examination showed satisfactory preservation of marginal bone (Figure 2L，2M).**\n\n【28】**Discussion**\n\n【29】**The mandibular anterior region generally has the densest bone， mostly consisting of type I and II bone qualities \\[3\\]. Although the primary stability of the implant is excellent in this region， but risk**\n\n【30】**of implantation failure was increased due to the friction and bone necrosis induced by high local temperature during surgical drilling\\[4\\]. Studies have reported that when exposed to a temperature of47°C for half an hour， local osseous necrosis， soft tissue wrapping around the implant， and osseointegration failure can occur， so the area is more susceptible to bacterial infection \\[5\\]. Sufficient bone， which can provide a rich blood supply to maintain the processes of regeneration and reconstruction of peri-implant bone， is required for the implant success. When the facial bone thickness was more than 2mm， bone loss of the implant decreased significantly\\[6\\]. When labial bone thickness was insufficient， bone resorption was more likely to occur in the mandibular anterior region with dense bone and poor blood supply.**\n\n【31】**A large number of studies have shown that implants can still achieve re-osseointegration following localdebridementand decontamination ofthe infected implant \\[7\\]. It was demonstrated that implants with smooth surfaces were more likely to re-osseointegrate than implants with rough surfaces \\[8-10\\]. This may be due to the ease of decontamination of smooth implant surfaces. However， more bone regeneration was observed for implants with rough surfaces than that for implants with smooth surfaces when re-osseointegration occurred\\[10\\]. Therefore，how to achieve effective decontamination of implants with rough surfaces are urgently needed in the clinic.**\n\n【32】**At present， various methods， including mechanical curettes， ultrasonic devices， mechanical sandblasting， titanium brushes and irrigation with chlorhexidine， are commonly used for implant surface decontamination. The wavelengthoftheEr：YA Glaser is the same as the highest peak of water absorption，producing a\"microexplosion\"effect for tissue cutting， debridement and sterilization， which causes little damage to the implant. In vitro experiments showed that， compared with other mechanical methods， the Er：YAG laser had the best decontamination effect on the rough surface of the implants because Er：YAG laser light can irradiate the deep areas of the threads \\[11\\]. Animal study has demonstrated that an Er：YAG laser can effectively treat infected implants and promote implant osseointegration \\[12\\]. In a prospective clinical cohort study， 20 patients with peri-implantitis were treated with an Er：YAG laser (initial settings of 50 mJ and25 pps). After 1 year of treatment， CBCT images revealed that the infrabony defects around the implants disappeared \\[13\\]. However， different Er：YAG laser parameters had different effects on the implant. The application of a high-level Er：YAG laser (150mJ/10 Hz) decreased the proliferative ability of osteoblasts on the SLA surface\\[14\\]. The application of an Er：YAG laser (80 mJ/20 Hz) changed the surface topology structure of implants with SLA surface \\[15\\]. Low energy level of Er：YAG lasers (50 mJ， 60 mJ， 120 mJ) were sufficient for debridement and decontamination of the implant surface \\[16\\]. Moreover，Er：YAGlasers had different therapeutic effects on implants with different surfaces \\[17\\].**\n\n【33】**Conclusion**\n\n【34】**Decontamination and debridement with an Er：YAG laser were promising in treating the infection of the implant.

This study aims to classify open-access microRNA data of patients with colorectal cancer liver metastasis and without liver metastases using the XGBoost method， one of the machine learning methods， and reveal important genes that may cause liver metastases.**\n\n【14】**Methods： This retrospective study considered the open-access microRNA expression data of patients with colorectal cancer liver metastasis and without liver metastases. The dataset consists of miRNA data from 10 CRC tissues from patients with liver metastases and 10 CRC tissues from patients without liver metastases.XGBoost was constructed for the classification via ten-fold cross-validation. Accuracy， balanced accuracy， sensitivity， specificity， positive predictive value， and negative predictive value performance metrics were evaluated for model performance.**\n\n【15】**Results： With respect to the feature selection method，23 microRNA were selected， and modeling was performed with these input variables. Accuracy， balanced accuracy， sensitivity， specificity， positive predictive value， negative predictive value， and F1 score obtained from the XGBoost model were 95%， 95%，90%，100%，100%，90.9%， and 94.7%，respectively. Based on the variable importance findings acquired from the XGBoost， microRNA 4306， microRNA 2115， and microRNA 4708 can be employed as potential biomarkers for liver metastases.**\n\n【16】**Conclusion： As a result of the study， genes that could be biomarkers for colorectal cancer liver metastases were identified using a machine learning-based prediction approach. Following clinical validation of the obtained microRNAs in subsequent research， therapeutic procedures based on this microRNA scan be established， and their usefulness in clinical practice can be documented.**\n\n【17】**Keywords： Colorectal cancer； Liver metastases； Machine learning； Biomarker**\n\n【18】**Introduction**\n\n【19】**The fourth most common cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide is Colorectal Cancer(CRC)， one of the three most prevalent cancers \\[1\\]. 1.9 million new cases of CRC were diagnosed in 2020， while 935，000 CRC patients died \\[2\\]. The worldwide incidence of CRC has been rising at a 3.2% yearly rate， starting with 783，000 cases in 1999 and rising to 1.8 million by 2020. This trend is expected to persist \\[2-6\\]. The improvement of diagnostic procedures and treatment modalities， such as surgery，adjuvant chemotherapies， andpalliative medicines， has resulted in a decline in CRC mortality rates in recent decades. After curative treatment， the metastasis of colorectal cancer is still a big problem， and it is the leading cause of mortality due to CRC. Tumor metastasis remains the most significant barrier to CRC treatment and prognosis. The most prevalent site of distant spread is liver metastasis， and around 15% to 25% of CRC patients will have distant metastases at the time of original diagnosis \\[7，8\\]. Liver metastasis of CRC may be related to factors such as the presence of the portal vein system， which directly connects the colorectal and liver and is associated with abundant blood supply， the location of the primary tumor and its histological type \\[9，10\\].**\n\n【20】**Curative resection and chemotherapy are standard treatment modalities in patients with Colorectal Cancer Liver Metastasis (CCLM) \\[11\\]. However， due to factors such as the location and**\n\n【21】**size of the tumor， the presence of extrahepatic disease， unresectable disease， or comorbidities of the patients， the surgical treatment option can be applied only in 10% to 20% of the cases， and the 5-year survival rate is very low \\[12，13\\]. Those who are unsuitable for surgery also have a worse prognosis. It is， therefore， necessary to find more effective targeted therapies for CCLM. Therefore， understanding the mechanisms underlying CRC and investigating the highly sensitive and specific molecules associated with metastasis， particularly during colorectal liver metastasis， is crucial to improve patient's clinical outcomes and overall survival \\[14\\]. In this process， it is very important to understand the molecular mechanisms and to carry out purposeful studies. Although many previous studies have identified various molecules involved in the initiation and development of colorectal liver metastases， the mechanisms still remain unclear \\[15\\].**\n\n【22】**There is still no holistic understanding of the process of carcinogenesis and metastasis in CRC， and studies for the causes of metastasis have focused on limited molecular markers. Next-generation sequencing， a high-throughput technology， is widely used to detect complex genetic changes to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the molecular pathophysiology of diseases and to identify various biomarkers to determine prognosis and treatment efficacy. Thanks to these genomic technologies used， molecular mechanisms related to diseases can be illuminated， and genes，RNAs， etc.， that may be disease-related biomarkers can be detected \\[16\\].**\n\n【23】**Aiming to develop computer algorithms that can be developed with experience， machine learning aims to provide descriptive information to researchers in the analysis of large， complex datasets of computers. When exposed to new data， machine learning learns based on previous data and makes predictions about new data. In the past ten years， thanks to the availability of big datasets and increased processing power， machine learning approaches have achieved outstanding performance in a number ofresearch. Therefore， machine learning is perhaps most useful for analyzing and interpreting large genomic datasets and may be used to describe a wide variety of genomic sequence elements 17，18.**\n\n【24】**In this study， in order to identify microRNAs that may be biomarkers for CCLM； by making bioinformatic analyzes from an open-access microRNA dataset belonging to CCLM is aimed to model the data set formed by overexpressed RNAs with XGBoost， which is a machine learning model， and to determine the possible biomarker RNAs with the variable importance values obtained.**\n\n【25】**Materialand Methods**\n\n【26】**Data set and variables**\n\n【27】**This current research was conducted using data from a case-control study published by Qiaoming Zhi et al. \\[14\\]. The dataset consists of miRNA data from 10 CRC tissues from patients with liver metastases and 10 CRC tissues from patients without liver metastases. In the current study， this dataset was used to identify miRNAs differentially expressed between the two groups by bioinformatic analysis and to identify miRNAs that could be biomarkers using the machine learning method.**\n\n【28】**Bioinformatics analysis phase**\n\n【29】**For CCLM， which was examined for miRNA expression profiles， differential expression analyses were performed using the limma package available in the R programming language \\[19\\]. Differential expression analysis is known as the statistical analysis of normalized**\n\n【30】**read count data to find the quantitative differences present in expression activities in different group situations. As a result of the analysis， a gene table in order of importance and a volcano plot to visualize differentially expressed genes are obtained. Log2FC>1was used to identify upregulated genes， and log2FC<-1 to identify downregulated genes in the analyzes performed \\[20\\]. Up-regulated miRNAs are shown in red， down-regulated miRNAs are shown in blue in the volcano plot used to visualize genes with differential regulation， and miRNAs that do not show any change in expression between the 2 groups are shown in black.**\n\n【31】**Modelling phase**\n\n【32】**The modeling phase starts with variable selection. In the bioinformatics analysis， LASSO variable selection method was used in the variable selection stage made from differently expressed miRNAs. The variable selection phase is one of the most important steps in any predictive modeling project. Basically， variable selection is the process of deciding which data/variables to include in the study while developing a statistical model. Variable selection is a feature identification process on a data set that has an effect on the dependent variable. The high dimensionality of the explanatory variables that have an effect on the dependent variable can lead to both long computation times and over-learning of the data. For this reason， before performing statistical modeling， the variables with the most important features， that is， the variables that explain the model the most， should be selected \\[21\\]. The datasets obtained by gene expression also have very large volumes. Therefore， variable selection methods are applied before modeling with these datasets. The LASSO variable selection method used in this study imposes a constraint on the sum of the absolute values of the model parameters， and this sum must be less than a fixed value (upper limit). To achieve this， the method uses a throttling (narrowing-regulating) operation that penalizes the coefficients of the regression variables and causes some of them to drop to zero \\[22\\]. Modeling was done with the data set obtained by the variable selection. In the modeling phase， XGBoost， which is a tree-based method from machine learning methods， was used. XGBoost is a machine learning method based on gradient boosting and decision tree methods and has found application in many areas. This method， which has a very high predictive power compared to other algorithms， is 10 times faster than other methods and includes a series of regularizations that can improve the overall performance of the model and reduce overfitting and overlearning\\[23\\].**\n\n【33】**In order to ensure model validity， the n-fold cross-validation method， one of the resampling methods， was used in this study. In this method；**\n\n【34】**First， the dataset is divided into n pieces， and the model is applied to n pieces.**\n\n【35】**In the second step， one of the n parts is used for the testing process， while the other n-1 parts are used in the training process.**\n\n【36】**In the last stage， the average of the values obtained from the models is evaluated for the cross-validation method.**\n\n【37】**Accuracy， balanced accuracy， sensitivity， specificity， positive predictive value， negative predictive value，and F1-score metrics were used to evaluate the performance obtained as a result of the modeling. Finally， in order to identify miRNAs that could be biomarkers， variable importance values were calculated， giving information about how much the input variables explain the output variable.**\n\n【38】**Biostatistical analysis phase**\n\n【39】**Shapiro Wilk test of normality was employed to determine whether the variables had anormal distribution. Data were summarized as mean ± standard deviation. Independent samples t-test was employed to compare data. p-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. IBM SPSS Statistics 25.0 program was used in the analysis.**\n\n【40】**The process flow diagram**\n\n【41】**The process flow diagram of the used models is also shown in Figure 1 for a better understanding ofthe system.**\n\n【42】**Results**\n\n【43】**There are 9 female and 11 male patients in the current study. The mean age of the patients was 63.4±11.51. While the mean age of patients without liver metastasis is 64.9 ± 5.85， the mean age of patients with metastasis is 61.9±15.50 vears.**\n\n【44】**When the data obtained as a result of the bioinformatics analysis were examined， 72 microRNAs with down- and 24 up-regulation were found. According to the table in which the microRNAs with the smallest adjacent P. value are listed， 4 of the first 10 microRNAs were downregulated，5 of them were upregulated， while 1 of them did not. The results obtained according to the bioinformatics analysis are tabulated in Table 1.**\n\n【45】**The volcano plot， where we can see all differentially expressed genes， is as follows (Figure 2).**\n\n【46】**According to the results of the biostatistical analysis performed with 23 microRNAs selected by the variable selection method， statistically significant differences were obtained between the groups with and without liver metastasis with CRC. Mentioned 23microRNAs show differences for 2 groups. Biostatistical analysis results are given in Table 2.**\n\n【47】**The values of the performance metrics obtained as a result of modeling with the XGBoost method are as follows (Table 3).**\n\n【48】**The graphical presentation of the metrics is as follows (Figure 3).**\n\n【49】**According to the variable significance values obtained as a result of the modeling， the 3 microRNAs were the most differentiated microRNAs among the 2 groups. The graphic showing of these microRNAs according to the obtained variable importance values is given in Figure 4.**\n\n【50】**Discussion**\n\n【51】**CRC is still frequent cancer. Most cancers， including CRC， may have a single clonal origin in the early stages of the disease. Still， a malignant tumor contains multiple populations of cells with distinct characteristics such as growth rate， karyotype， immunogenicity， drug susceptibility， and ability to expand. And develop metastases.**\n\n【52】**Table 1： The results of the bioinformatics analysis.**\n\n| **ID**  | **adj. P. Val**  | **P.

Of these， microRNA 4708， microRNA 4306，microRNA142， microRNA 4516， microRNA 345， id=42614， microRNA 2681， id=147834， id=148143， microRNA 33b are the microRNAs with the smallest adj p-value values and the most differentiated. When the log2FC values obtained were examined， microRNA 4708 and microRNA 4516 in CCLM had 2.54- and 2.80-fold higher gene**\n\n【63】**Figure 2： The volcano plot.**\n\n【64】**expression than those with CRC， respectively. When the log2FC values obtained were examined， microRNA 4306， microRNA 345， id=42614， microRNA 2681， id=147834， id=148143， microRNA33b microRNAs in CCLM had 2.77， 2.42，2.51，2.51，2.28，2.14 and5.09 fold lower gene expression than those with CRC， respectively. microRNA 4306 had the same expression between the two groups.**\n\n【65】**Statistically significant differences were obtained between the groups with and without CCLM according to the biostatistical analyzes performed with the remaining 23 microRNAs with the choice of the variable. These selected microRNAs are microRNAs that differentiate between the 2 groups and have a distinctive feature between the 2 groups. The performance criteria values obtained by modeling 23 microRNAs with the machine learning method XGBoost were obtained as accuracy 95%， balanced accuracy 95%，**\n\n【66】**Sensitivity 90%， Specificity 100%， Positive predictive value 100%， Negative predictive value 90.9%， F1 score 94.7%， respectively. Based on the performance criteria， the suggested XGBoost could correctly categorize two groups of patients using an artificial intelligence technique. When the variable significance values obtained as a result ofthe modeling are examined， it can be said that 3 microRNAs are the determining microRNAs between the 2 groups. These microRNAs are microRNAs called microRNA 4306，microRNA 2115，and microRNA4708 and will be associated with the state of metastasis.**\n\n【67】**One study mentioned that MicroRNA (miR)-4306 is associated with tumor growth and cancer， and its relationship with CRC was investigated. According to the results obtained， it was determined that miR-4306 expression was decreased in tissues with CRC \\[28\\]. microRNA 4708 has been investigated for many disease states such as**\n\n【68】**Figure 4： Graphical representation of microRNAs that differed mast between the two groups**\n\n【69】**breast cancer， pancreatic cancer and has been found to be associated with cancer \\[29，30\\].**\n\n【70】**In this study， the classification of patients with and without CCLM was provided using the machinelearning model. According to the results obtained from the model， microRNAs that may be possible biomarkers for CCLM have been determined. With comprehensive analyses and studies to be conducted， these microRNAs can be associated with metastasis， so patients’ care procedures can be regulated. It can be determined whether metastasis will develop or not.**\n\n【71】**References**\n\n【72】1\\. Torre LA， Siegel RL， Ward EM， Jemal A.

According to the CDC， MDD affects more than 16.1 million American adults， or about 6.7% of the U.S. population age 18 and older in a given year. People suffering from MDD experience sadness， anhedonia， feelings of guilt， loss of energy， lack of concentration， loss in appetite， and psychomotor symptoms with possible suicidal ideation. It is a mental disease that unfortunately is still marginalized and ostracized in society today. We wrote this case report in hopes of raising awareness for depression and how it can affect individuals through secondary pathways.**\n\n【10】**Background**\n\n【11】**The role of the gut microbiome and its correlation with the production and dissemination of serotonin is still a relatively novel concept and one that has not been give its due amongst the scientific community. By showing how intrinsic the enteric nervous system and its maintenance is to promoting the production of various neurotransmitters involved in mental health diseases， we hope to make its role intricate to the understanding of mental illness and its potential treatment going forward. Gastric acid is involved in the primary function ofpreparing food for digestion and absorption by the intestine. Acid production is a central component of the stomach's contribution to digestion. Low gastric acid means higher susceptibility to food poisoning. Proton pump inhibitors use can cause diarrhea， enteric infections， and alter the gastrointestinal bacterial population by suppressing the gastric acid barrier leading to Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth (SIBO) \\[1\\]. Normally when food leaves the stomach， it is acidic， and it leads to changes in pH and the pancreas and gallbladder release pancreatic juice and bile but if the stomach is not producing gastric acid， the gallbladder stops releasing bile. Prolonged PPI treatment produces bowel symptoms and symptoms such as cramps，hypotension and hypomagnesemia. The gallbladder has a very important role to play as the same nutrients that work in the gallbladder produce bile. Therefore， when a patient undergoes cholecystectomy， they develop an imbalance of neurotransmitters. Bile makes glycine and taurine and when it is depleted we cannot absorb calcium and this leads to hypocalcemia. Gallbladder bile rinses bacteria off the intestinal lining and the bacteria sticks to the wall increasing its bowel population leading to gastrointestinal symptoms such as malabsorption. This now increasing enteric bacterial populace leads to the formation of the \"leaky gut”bacteria causing inflammation and depression by increased intestinal permeability associated with an upload of Lipopolysaccharide(LPS) translocation which induces depression symptoms \\[2\\]. Hence gut microbiota and probiotics alter behavior and brain neurochemistry.**\n\n【12】**Case Presentation**\n\n【13】**In the case of our patient we had a 62-year-old female who had suffered from years of Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) as well as obesity class 1 with a BMI of 33. Our patient also complained of alternating bowel movements， abdominal cramps， dyspepsia， and years of H2receptor blockers and PPI use， as well as recurring cholecystitis and its affiliated symptoms. In March of 2017 our patient underwent a cholecystectomy after feeling months of gastric discomfort and dyspepsia and had finally had enough and could no longer further prolong her discomfort. Her ultrasound imaging and lab results pointed to a diagnosis of cholelithiasis with concurrent cholecystitis and she presented to the ER with intractable abdominal pain in the right upper quadrant. After initial stabilization with fluids， antibiotic treatment， and pain management， the patient in agreement with the consulting Gastrointestinal (GI) physician， decided to have a cholecystectomy**\n\n【14】**performed as she had been struggling with cholecystitis for years now. The procedure was done laparoscopically with no post operational complications. Three months later the patient presented with severe fatigue and weight gain and the recurrence of her pre-cholecystectomy symptoms. Additionally she did not feel like leaving her house， stopped socializing with her friends， felt a loss of energy and just seemed to stop caring about things. She was taken to her primary care physician， who referred her back to her GI doctor， and recommended a psychiatry consult. After standard imaging and pertinent lab results conducted by the GI physician failed to show any causal gastro intestinal factors that could be contributing to our patients state she visited a psychiatrist who，based on her presenting symptoms， diagnosed her with moderate depression secondary to the life stresses compounded by her recent surgery. The purpose of this report is to theorize how her enteric system undergoing chronic inflammation along with her cholecystectomy further exacerbated the inflammation and ultimately lead to her depression， highlighting the “Leaky Gut\"phenomenon.**\n\n【15】**Past medical history**\n\n【16】**Hyperlipidemia， Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease， Hypertension， Gastritis and Obesity**\n\n【17】**Past family history**\n\n【18】**Thepatient's father and motherboth had ahistory ofhypertension， gastroesophageal reflux disease and hyperlipidemia.

She was prescribed cholestyramine andesomeprazole to deal with any residual symptoms post-surgery. The patient was also scheduled to follow up with a dietician who prescribed a course of medical nutrition therapy individualized to our patient， and to follow up with her PCP to better manage her other chronic medical concerns and for medication reconciliation. The patient was advised to limit fat intake， increase dietary fiber gradually， and to avoid caffeinated and carbonated**\n\n【36】**drinks， chocolate， citrus products， spicy foods and to eat small meals. Due to a combination of factors including non-compliance with proposed dietary restrictions and inability to comply with her PCP's instructions pertaining to maintaining a healthier lifestyle， our patient experienced a return of pre-surgical symptoms as well as a sudden loss of interest in activities of daily living and was diagnosed with moderate depression by a psychiatrist. The psychiatrist after a careful review of the patient’s file suggested a thorough course of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)， a modified and realistic diet in consultation with a dietician， a workout routine and therapy sessions relating to the patient’s depression and eating habits. After two months of little improvement， the patient was started on Wellbutrin XL by her psychiatrist keeping the associated weight gain with other antidepressants in mind. The patient was instructed to take Wellbutrin XL 150 mg once daily in the morning for the first 4 days after which she would start on Wellbutrin XL 300 mg once daily.**\n\n【37】**Outcome and Follow-Up**\n\n【38】**Although our patient was given the appropriate post-op care， she initially did feet better but then began to deteriorate to her pre-surgery levels in terms of symptoms and in addition developed this new feeling of being depressed all the time which could have been related to her non-compliance with the physician ordered lifestyle recommendations in terms of her diet and other appropriate lifestyle changes. After a psychiatric consult and initial assessment， the patient tried to be more adherent to the recommendations and hoped her CBT sessions， therapy， and new dietary guidelines coupled with exercise would alleviate her concerns yet she continued to feel depressed and continued to have abdominal symptoms similar to what she felt before she had her cholecystectomy. The patient was then prescribed Wellbutrin XL and advised to continue her CBTand follow her dietary， exercise， and healthy lifestyle recommendations. After an intense and strict adherence to her diet/exercise/CBT routine together with the medication the patient experienced mild relief within five months post-surgery， her abdominal symptoms had disappeared， and she had started to lose weight and felt happier. The patient started to socialize more and took up a proactive approach to bettering her eating habits and other lifestyle choices. The Wellbutrin XL initially started at 150 mg once a day was increased to 300 mg once today after the initial four day period and then maintained as the patient did not feel like there was any need for an adjustment.**\n\n【39】**Discussion**\n\n【40】**A dysbiotic state leads to increased intestinal permeability and allows contents such as bacterial metabolites and molecules as well as bacteria themselves to leak through the submucosa and into the systemic circulation， a phenomenon aptly named leaky gut syndrome \\[2\\]. In our digestive gut， sugar precursors E. coli &proteobacteria Bifidobacterial species act on the chorismite from where E. Coli， proteobacteria， B. subtilis， firm elves， mycobacterium and actinobacteria leads to formation of tryptophan which in the intestinal epithelial cells causes serotonin production in the gut. When the concentration of these bacteria is reduced due to antibiotics or PPI use， it decreases their quantity in the gut and the lack of bile post-cholecystectomy prevents the cleansing ofthe gut liningto get rid ofthe bad bacteria. This in part leads to less tryptophan and serotonin being produced in the enteric system，leading to depression. Tryptophan is synthesized from chorismite by members of several bacterial phyla including protein bacterium， actinobacterium & fircules. E. Coli can synthesize chorismite， a tryptophan precursor， which acts as a**\n\n【41】**branch point for microbial metabolic pathways consistent with this key role for bacteria. Antibiotics and PPI treatment alters tryptophan and undoes metabolism leading to less serotonin and melatonin in the brain. Tryptophan， tyrosine， and phenylalanine are made in the gut. When tryptophan is shuttled through the kynurenine pathway there is less tryptophan available to make serotonin and hence less serotonin in the gut available to be transported to the brain via the vagal nerve. Low bile，post-cholecystectomy， causes leaky gut as bile acid stimulates biliary lipid secretion due to their physical chemical properties. They can form mixed micelles together with biliary phospholipids which allows the solubilizing in bile of cholesterol and other lipophilic compounds. Mixed micelles also account for the emulsion of dietary fat and lip soluble vitamins in the gut， helping their absorption. Bile acids also facilitate intestinal calcium absorption. At the intestinal level， bile acids are known to modulate pancreatic enzyme secretion and cholecystokinin release. Moreover， they are potent anti-microbial agents that prevent bacterial over growth in the small bowel.**\n\n【42】**There is also a systemic IgM-mediated immune response in depression directed against LPS (which is part of the bacterial wall of gram negative bacteria) suggesting that bacterial translocation may play a role in the inflammatory and pathophysiology of clinical depression. Bacterial translocation indicates the presence of “leaky gut”or an increased permeability of the gut wall or loosening of the tight junction barrier \\[3\\]. Hyperactivity of the HPA axis is also one of the most reliable biological findings in patients suffering from major depression. Exposure to stress and cytokine responses may impair neuronal plasticity and stimulation of neurotransmission. Administration of exogenous IL-1b significantly enhances IL-1b levels in the Pre-frontal Cortex (PFC) and hippocampus and further increases Hypothalamic， Pituitary， and Adrenal (HPA) axis activity. Likewise， acute stress markedly increases IL-1b levels in the PFC， hippocampus and hypothalamus. Repeated stress sensitizes the HPA axis response to administration of exogenous IL-1b and possibly leads to depression \\[4\\].**\n\n【43】**The gut is composed of nerve tissues and uses neurotransmitters to communicate with the brain. The gut microbiota affects brain development and plasticity by secreting various neurotrophins and proteins， such as Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF)， synaptophysin and postsynaptic density \\[5\\]. Our brain has an**\n\n【44】**intimate connection with our gut via vagal nerve， which has hundreds of millions of nerves cells that regulate our digestive processes. This“second brain\" in the gut is spread out throughout the entire length of the gut. This second brain has many sensors in the enteric nervous system. The connection between depression and the gut is integrative from serotonin in the gut and how it relates to serotonin in the brain. Many patients with depression complain of constipation. This might be due to 95% of our serotonin being produced and stored in the gut via enterochromaffin cells which leads to modulation of mood， appetite， and well-being. The serotonin in the gut is synthesized from the food that we inject and the microbes that live in our gut that stimulate the production of serotonin. 60% of the production is due to the signals that come from the microbes in our gut. The serotonin cells are sandwiched between the cells that make the lining ofthe gut. The cells have vagal nerve association and the signal when the cell is activated goes to the brain via the vagal nerve from where it is delivered into the limbic system. This case study involves a patient with a long history of GERD treated with H2 antagonists， PPIs， and a host of other medications over the vears who underwent a cholecystectomy. This was followed by symptoms of depression that required treatment with an ant-depressant coupled with healthier lifestyle changes and dietary restrictions. This case study is being written to establish a possible connection between the gut microbiome and depression.**\n\n【45】**References**\n\n【46】1\\.

It is still an inclined graph， and it becomes an intriguing concept to investigate in a more progressive manner. Anxiety is a mental disorder that develops in reaction to stress and worsens over time as we continue to worry about it； on the other hand， depression is a serious medical ailment that can cause a variety of emotional， mental， and physical difficulties as well as a reduction in quality of life. According to the World Health Organization (WHO)， younger adults are more likely to suffer from anxiety and depression during this ongoing pandemic， with56.2 percent of victims being 18 to 24 years old， 48.9% being 25 to 49 years old， 39.1 percent being50 to 60 years old， and 29.3 percent being 65 years and older in their age groups. Because of many challenges that occurred during this COVID-19， approximately 27% of individuals in India are suffering from stress and despair.**\n\n【15】**Anxiety and depression have had a significant impact on human wellbeing during COVID-19. As a result， anxiety and depression are divided into three major categories： Impact during the lockdown，people's survival， and the impact of the media (Figure 1).**\n\n【16】**People who labor for daily earnings have lost their jobs and daily work， resulting in later phases ofhunger and， with no other option， an upsurge in self-destruction attempts.

It provided opportunities for students to learn， and it was funded by a variety of organizations. When technology is used appropriately， it is always beneficial； however， when it is used unnecessarily or becomes an addiction， it has negative consequences. As a result， continuous hours of online lessons increased students' onscreen time and fostered a sense of isolation.**\n\n【20】**_cited._**\n\n【21】**Because of all of this， students were under a great deal of stress and displayed a variety of behavioral changes， including being annoyed， short-tempered， depressed， and nervous. Apart from that， a significant group of people emerged who were also dealing with depression and anxiety：Internet traders. Many people began crypto-trading during the lockdown period， with estimates indicating a nearly 40% increase. People， on the other hand， entered the market with little expertise. There was a strong market downturn that eventually resulted in market collapse， which was unexpected. The initial and basic losses of these new players led to anxiety and depression， which raised suicidal impulses andlong-term mental disorders. Because there were no proper treatments available during this period， human existence was a question mark， and doctors administered various combinations of medicines， which eventually revealed long-term adverse effects. According to the Indian government， there were 3.2 beds for every 10，000 persons in rural India. This number clearly shows that the uncalled COVID-19， which hit the whole world in the two waves， threw off the entire planning and arrangement by government officials， resulting in an unanticipated scenario among the populace. There was no adequate hospitalization，pharmacy， oxygen cylinders， nursing，**\n\n【22】**or medical practitioner， resulting in a huge number of deaths. These all-unplanned events also created a catastrophic situation for the body's final departure \\[1-9\\].**\n\n【23】**Throughout all stages of COVID-19， anxiety and depression entered human life at various levels. But， with all of this， there were some good things as well； family relations improved as most skilled， grounded people left their jobs and began spending more time with their families； and， as a measure to prevent the spread of the disease， many government and private sectors prompted their staff to contribute from home， allowing people to spend more time with their families. Many individuals began assisting others in need， demonstrating that humanity is still alive. The government has made various initiatives and funds available to frontline workers as well as the general public. Finally， the COVID-19 pandemic is educating us the importance of changing our eating habits and adopting alternative diets to strengthen our immunity. Exercise and a healthy nutrition are also beneficial to our mental health.**\n\n【24】**References**\n\n【25】**1\\. Robinson L. Stress and anxiety. Nurs Clin North Am. 1990；25(4)：935-43.**\n\n【26】2\\.

The results and the empirical evidence obtained from the treatment of the patient indicated that PTC psychotherapy is a short-term yet very effective approach.

Among these challenges are the preferred treatment approach， the length of treatment (number of treatment sessions)， the treatment costs， the treatment efficacy and outcomes， the treatment suitability， the treatment ending， and the relapse of the symptoms. The two major approaches to psychotherapy constitute psychodynamic psychotherapy and behavioral therapy. In recent decades， these approaches have sought to create intervention techniques and methods to overcome the aforementioned shortcomings and increase the treatment success \\[4-71. However，the existence of limitations andproblems related to the treatment， the patient， the disorder type， the therapist， the length of treatment， the costs oftreatment， the treatment outcomes， and the rate of relapse necessitate devising more efficient psychotherapeutic approaches. As a paradoxical psychotherapy， PTC \\[8\\] is an approach to treating psychological disorders which aims to overcome the aforesaid limitations and shortcomings. The present paper aimed to report a briefaccount of the PTC treatment for illness anxiety disorder.**\n\n【13】**A brief summary of PTC-treatment protocol**\n\n【14】**PTC treatment consists of two components： paradox and timetable. Paradox refers to the prescription of disorder symptoms； and timetable refers to executing the paradoxical task within a certain amount of time and to a certain degree. In PTC therapy， these two components are inextricably linked and the therapist should prescribe them together for the patient. Similarly， the patient ought to do the task to a certain degree and within the pre-planned period of time. The inseparability of these two components， called the paradoxical timetable， is regarded as one of the innovations in this psychotherapeutic approach. According to PTC， the paradoxical task should be done only within the pre-planned period of time. In other words， the paradoxical timetable should either be performed within the time limits or never performed at all. The therapist asks the patient to start the paradoxical timetable tasks 24 h after the first session is held. The delayed beginning is another feature of PTC psychotherapeutic model.**\n\n【15】**Case Presentation**\n\n【16】**Mr. NK is a 26-year-old single man admitted to an academic psychotherapy center with IAD. He is a university graduate with an M. Sc degree. The patient signed an informed consent document prior to performing the treatment sessions for both treatment and use of the anonymized case information for educational，learning， and research purposes. A written consent also signed by the patient for video recording of all treatment sessions. For initial evaluation the patient participated in a diagnostic interview \\[9\\]， the short version of the Health Anxiety Index (SHAI； \\[10\\])， and Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II； \\[11\\]). The patient met criteria for DSM-5 illness anxiety**\n\n【17】**disorder， as well as a total score of 38.7 for the SHAI indicating significant health related anxiety，and a total score of 17.9 for BDI-II. Subjective ratings on illness anxiety and symptoms on a scale of 0(none) to 100 (extreme) percent were obtained at regular intervals. Illness anxiety during the first session was 100 out of 100. At his last session， his illness anxiety reduced to 0.00/100(Figure1). Total scores of the SHAI and BDI-II reduced to 13.2 and 8.7 at post treatment， respectively. We next present the application of PTC for treatment of IAD based on a detailed video recorded treatment sessions of NK.**\n\n【18】**The application of PTC to lAD-case of NK**\n\n【19】**The clinical interview based on the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V；\\[9\\])， confirmed the existence of Illness Anxiety Disorder. He explained his symptoms thus in the first session： Following an unprotected sexual intercourse， I was afraid I might have contracted AIDS. I have had tests twice so far， which said that I am HIV negative. As time goes on， however， I feel more and more anxious and scared and I constantly check my body for AIDS symptoms. Whenever I hear anything about this illness， I feel really， really bad. My sleep is disturbed， I have lost my concentration， I have become short-tempered and irritable， I feel indifferent about everything and I have lost all motivation. He said that he had a long history of disturbed sleep， indifference and bad moods， the only difference being that they were short-term before and disappeared after a few days. But， following the anxiety about AIDS that started last year， they have remained with him. He had no history of taking medication and does not use drugs now. In line with the PTC model， the exact symptoms were prescribed along with the following timetable： for the first week， recreate thoughts and worries about AIDS three times a day (at 8：00， 16：00， and 23：00)， each time for 7 to 10 min. For the second week， do the same task twice a day (at8：00 and 23：00). At the beginning of the second session， the patient reported that he had done successfully about 80% of the tasks：“I feel I am much better. When I recreated those thoughts according to the timetable， at other times they did not bother me. I mean， they rarely entered my mind. Even while doing the tasks， I tried so hard to summon those thoughts， but they just didn’t come (smiles). All in all， the frequency of the thoughts has decreased by 30 to 40 percent， but they still haunt me every once in a while\". He was then assigned the following timetable： for the first week， four 5-min sessions (at 9：00，13：00， 17：00， and 23：00) every day， and for the second week， three5-min sessions (at 9：00， 17：00， and 23：00) every day. Answering the patient’s request for tasks related to depression and bad moods， the therapist told him that if depression continues after the fear of AIDS has been cured， they can arrange a timetable for it. According to the report given by the patient in the third session， he had made further improvements up to 50%. The fourth session was arranged to be four weeks later， with the following timetable to be carried out in between：for the first two weeks， three times a day (at 9：00，19：00， and 23：00)， each time for 5 min； and for the second two weeks， twice a day (at9：00 and 23：00). The patient reported in the fourth session that he had made improvement up to 90%. He also added that his bad moods and depression had also gone away， and he could sleep soundly. The following timetable was then arranged： one 5-min session for the first week (at 17：00)， and sessions on even days for the second week. He was to cease the tasks on the third week. The therapist explained to the patient that if there is a relapse after the third week， he must wait for 5 days to a week， in order to make sure the symptoms have returned. Then，he can arrange a timetable himself， similar to what was assigned to him for the first week. In the fifth session， that was**\n\n【20】**held about four months later because of the summer holydays， the patient reported that he had made further improvements and there had been no relapse.**\n\n【21】**Evaluating the treatment outcome and follow-up**\n\n【22】**The result of the treatment evaluation was based on the patient's ratings and was graded on a scale from 0 to 100 as well as an open-ended question. The evaluation indicated that the 100% improvement of the patient， which resulted from PTC therapy， continued after28-month follow-up.**\n\n【23】**Discussion**\n\n【24】**The accounts given by the patient of the second session show that he has succeeded in doing the tasks. The patient reported having forgotten to say in the first session that he had been obsessed with AIDS because he thought the needle they used to take his blood was contaminated. However， due to the nature of the special clinical interview in the PTC model， in which the patient is asked to recreate the exact symptoms (the symptoms which are mentioned during the session or are later remembered； another feature in PTC model)， the patient tried to recreate these fantasies and thoughts during the tasks between the sessions. Despite the efforts made by the patient to recreate the symptoms exactly during the task， the symptoms were not re-experienced. This different condition is common during the paradoxical timetable tasks. The patient surrenders to the conditions of the disorder and is defeated by the symptoms. Suffering from these anxious symptoms， he is willing to be relieved of them and bends over backward to eliminate them. At the time of doing the tasks， the patient acts quite the reverse， according to the therapist's instructions. He wants the symptoms to be present for a couple of minutes and wants to experience them of his own volition. In this stage of treatment， the mere “wanting” constitutes the beginning of the individuals empowerment. This is the same empowerment which is called “ego-strength” and is the main and ultimate goal of PTC treatment. This wanting at the present is clearly the opposite of“not wanting in the past and signifies the individual's power and temporarily resolves the fundamental intrapsychic conflict， which is the basis for the symptoms of the disorder. In the absence of this conflict， the symptoms disappear. The amount of the symptoms was reduced during certain times of the day at a satisfactory level： the**\n\n【25】**patient stated that 40% of the thoughts and worries concerning the illness anxiety were gone.**\n\n【26】**Based on the progress reported by the patient， the frequency and severity of the disorder， and the amount of the residual symptoms， the paradoxical timetable tasks were prescribed for the patient to be carried out in the interval between the second and the third sessions. According to a 40% progress， the patient was asked to do the tasks four times a day during the first week and three times a day during the second week. The report of the patient at the third session showed that the prior level of progress increased by 10% (i.e. 50% between the second and the third session). A one-month interval was inserted between the session three and four so that the patient would be able to do the task three times a day for the first two weeks and to continue to do it twice a day for the second two weeks. The reason behind this time interval was the severity of the illness anxiety and its consequences such as depressed mood and attention deficit， which the patient raised in the previous session. A longer interval provides an opportunity for the therapist to prove or reject the hypothes is that the symptoms are reactive； likewise， the patient will have a chance to see whether the depression and attention deficit symptoms will be relieved when the symptoms of the illness anxiety disorder are treated.**\n\n【27】**The patient reported a 90% progress， a condition which continued in the interval between the third and fourth sessions， which was about a month. It is regarded as a controlled and favorable condition in which the patient has a four-month break before the fifth session. According to the agreed plan， the patient ought to do the tasks once a day during the first week and every other day during the second week which concludes the tasks. Since a four-month break comes before the next session， the paradoxical timetable is explained for the patient in a way that he can prescribe for himself. This is a sort of self-therapy and is one of the features specific to PTC model. It is the same feature that turns the patient into a therapist at the end of the PTC therapy. This treatment plan will be explained to all patients in the last session and will totally obviate the need for another therapy session in case of the relapse. According to this treatment plan， and based on the therapist's instructions， the patient is trained to stop doing the tasks at a certain interval (usually two weeks) after the last therapy session. If the symptoms happen to return， the patient should prescribe and do the paradoxical timetable according to the symptom severity and similar to the therapist's instruction. The clinical evidence based on the patient's account indicates that this method is effective just like the treatment under the supervision of the therapist， returning the patient to his normal condition. The patient's account of the fifth session showed that the improvement had continued for four months and that the patient was 100% content and was ready to end the therapy.**\n\n【28】**Conclusion**\n\n【29】**The results of PTC treatment for IAD showed that PTC psychotherapy model is a successful and efficient psychotherapy. This model is a simple very short-term psychotherapy， which benefits both the therapist and the patient. Experts in the treatment of psychological disorders can easily learn the principles and techniques of this model and apply them to a range of psychological disorders. Patients can achieve the best results as well， based on the therapist's prescribed tasks in the shortest possible time. According to the**\n\n【30】**treatment outcome of the patient’s follow-up as well as the published results of twenty patients with different psychological disorders \\[8\\]， the results of this very short-term therapeutic model have apt stability and constancy. Moreover， the relapse rate in this model is in its lowest level compared to other psychotherapeutic methods. Along with other evidence and reasons， this finding is an empirical evidence that shows PTC psychotherapy has succeeded in bringing about deep and constant therapeutic changes. Among other features of PTC psychotherapy model is the fact that the patient becomes a therapist and， if necessary， he/she can prescribe and do a similar paradoxical timetable for himself/herself.**\n\n【31】**Compliance with Ethical Standards**\n\n【32】**Ethical Approval： All procedures performed in studies involving Wer human participants were in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional and/or national research committee and with the1964 Helsinki declaration and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards.**\n\n【33】**Funding and Acknowledgement**\n\n【34】**The authors would like to acknowledge the financial support of University of Tehran for this research under grant number5106003/1/81.**\n\n【35】**References**\n\n【36】**1\\.

However， the use of centrallines is not without complications. The two most common complications associated with the use of central venous catheters are infection and thrombosis \\[1-4\\]. Improvements in the design and maintenance of CVCs have reduced their occurrence. Current improvements include the use of antibiotics and tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) catheter locking solutions \\[2，3\\]. Even when the rates of infection and thrombosis have decreased and patency has improved， AV fistulas and grafts are still the preferred method of venous access for long-term hemodialysis. Not every patient is suitable for an AV fistula； including the elderly and diabetic populations are not good candidates. An AV graft is often more suitable for this particular type of patients， and is considered a better option over a CVC \\[5\\]. We present a case of sepsis and thrombosis， co-occurring in a patient with End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD)， associated with the use of central venous catheters.**\n\n【16】**Case Presentation**\n\n【17】**A 54-year-old patient with ESRD on hemodialysis with a past medical history of seizure disorder，hypertension， heart failure， and a cerebral vascular accident with residual right hemiparesis， was transferred to the emergency department from a nursing home due to syncope， falls and altered mental status. Last fall prior to admission was unwitnessed.**\n\n【18】**On initial assessment， the patient was unable to recall what had occurred prior to the fall. The patient denied palpitations， headache， blurry vision， excessive sweating or weakness. The only complaint was pain in the left arm and hip. Vital signs were within normal limits， except for a temperature of 39.6C. No signs of fracture were noted on X-rays of the cervical spine， left arm， shoulder or hip. No acute injury noted on cephalic non-contrast CT nor any abnormalities on the electrocardiogram or encephalogram. A portable chest X-ray demonstrated a moderate effusion of the right lung field， as well as cavitary lesions at the left lateral base. Lab findings demonstrated a leukocytosis of 30.62×10/3 with an ANC of 27.18×10/3. The Blood chemistry panel revealed a BUN of 84 mg/dl and a creatinine level of 9.81 mg/dl.Lactate level was 1.1 meq/L. The patient was started on antibiotic therapy with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam.**\n\n【19】**On subsequent investigation， a CT scan of the chest showed bilateral pleural effusions and cavitary lesions scattered throughout the left lung field with a possible consideration for septic emboli. A right internal jugular central venous line extending into the superior vena cava was also visualized. An abdominal CT showed a questionable wedge-shaped hypodensity along the inferior and lateral aspect of the spleen， suspicious for a possible splenic infarct. A pelvic CT demonstrated a small amount of fluid and gas at the entry of a left femoral venous line. A transthoracic**\n\n【20】**echocardiogram demonstrated the presence of a fluffy echogenic mass which appeared attached to the catheter， likely thrombotic in origin. The mass traveled across the tricuspid valve to the level of the tricuspid leaflet. The possibility of the mass being colonized with bacteria was possible. Anticoagulation with heparin and warfarin was initiated. A ventilation perfusion scan and Doppler studies of upper and lower extremities showed no abnormalities.**\n\n【21】**Blood cultures， grew Enterococcus feacalis and Staphylococcus hominis. The tip of the internal jugular dialysis catheter grew Staphylococcus aureus. Sputum cultures grew Candida albicans and normal flora. Antibiotic therapy was switched to gentamicin and ampicillin.**\n\n【22】**Removal of the femoral venous catheter followed. The right internal jugular venous catheter was removed and replaced by a new catheter in the left internal jugular vein. The patient resumed dialysis during the hospital course and continued dialysis upon discharge.**\n\n【23】**Prior to discharge a transesophageal echocardiogram still demonstrated a small thrombus at the junction of the superior vena cava and right atrium； no vegetations were visualized. The patient continued anticoagulation therapy upon discharge with Warfarin5 mg PO daily and heparin 8000 units subcutaneously every 12hr. A new chest CT scan demonstrated stable to slightly decreased lung nodules， interval resolution of the right pleural effusion and a grossly stable 4 cm splenic lesion. Further investigation of the splenic lesion via biopsy or laparoscopy was not recommended due to a high surgical risk. Due to the high suspicion of a splenic abscess， the patient was discharged on 500mg of vancomycin and 70 mg of gentamicin. A follow-up with infectious disease as an outpatient was arranged. The patient's leukocytosis was resolved and blood cultures were negative prior to discharge.**\n\n【24】**Infection andthrombosis arethetwo most common complications of CVC use \\[1-4\\]. Reduction in the incidence of complications**\n\n【25】**are observed with the use of tPA and antibiotic catheter locking solutions， as well as with the use of mupirocin or polysporin as topical agents at the catheter exit site \\[2，3\\]. The presence of catheter-related thrombosis predisposes to bacterial colonization and catheter related sepsis \\[3\\]. Localized injury of the vein at the access site can occur during insertion of the catheter； as a result deposition of fibrin occurs at the site of the injury， followed by the formation of a thrombus \\[1，3\\]. The biofilm layer found around the lumen of the catheter offers a perfect nidus for bacterial growth \\[1，3\\].Obtaining the right long-term vascular access is a critical factor affecting the morbidity and mortality of patients on hemodialysis \\[2，4\\]. In this particular case， the patient's initial catheters were removed，anda new catheter in the left internal jugular vein was placed. A preferred option in these particular types of cases， in which patients require long-term hemodialysis， is that of an autogenous fistula. AV fistulas provide a better outcome in terms of mortality， infections， hospitalization rates， and avoids repeated access interventions \\[2，4\\].

The ulcer started as a nodule which ruptured and formed an ulcer. The latter enlarged gradually with mild pain and occasional foul-smelling discharge. We prepared him for excision biopsy and split thickness skin grafting. The histology result showed squamous cell carcinoma. The photomicrograph is shown on figure two.**\n\n【16】**Aim： To show that skin cancers may be occurring in younger people in recent years.**\n\n【17】**Keywords： Albino； Skin cancer； Solar damage**\n\n【18】**Introduction**\n\n【19】**Albinism is an autosomal recessive condition that results in inadequate or absence of melanin in the skin and other tissues. The melanocytes， the cells that produce melanin， though present， fail to produce the pigment because an enzyme， tyrosinase， is either absent or does not produce enough melanin. Therefore， there is variable absence of melanin depending on the degree of activity of the enzyme. Besides， focal failure of the enzyme in different parts of the body gives rise to conditions such as ocular albinism or isolated absence of melanin in the hair or any other part of the body.**\n\n【20】**The main culprit in the aetiology of skin cancers is ultraviolet radiation \\[1，2\\]. On the electromagnetic spectrum the ultraviolet radiation occupies the wave lengths between 400 nm and200 nm， 400 nm to 700 nm being the visible spectrum. Ultraviolet radiation- A， B and C presently have health significance. Ultraviolet radiation A was initially thought to affect mainly the aging process by causing wrinkles but it has recently been implicated as a cofactor to UVB \\[3\\]. The latter is known to cause most of the skin cancers because it gets to the earth in significant amounts Ultraviolet radiation C does not get to the earth in significant amounts because the ozone layer filters it out. However， production of fluorocarbons by human activity is making the ozone layer thinner and this will make UVC to steadily increase its appearance on the earth. It has been shown that the shorter the wavelength of ultraviolet radiation， the more the carcinogenic effect on the skin. Therefore UVC， having the shortest wave length among the ultraviolet rays， will cause more skin cancers if it gets to the earth in significant amount. Carcinogenicity of UV radiation is caused by mutation on the DNA \\[4\\]. Photochemical damage by UV radiation is repaired by P gene products and the repair mechanism is impaired with aging giving rise to skin cancers \\[5-7\\].**\n\n【21】**Case History**\n\n【22】**This is the case of a thirteen-year-old male albino who presented to us with a scalp ulcer of one-year duration. The ulcer started as a nodule which continued to increase in size and ruptured spontaneously to discharge a foul-smelling fluid. There was mild continuous pain and occasional fever. Dressing of the ulcer with honey and administration of tablets purchased over the counter did not heal it. Neither the patient nor his parents had education on sun protection for albinos \\[8\\](Figure 1).**\n\n【23】**On examination the patient was chronically ill looking， mildly pale， anicteric and afebrile. The vital signs were a temperature of 36.8C， pulse rate of 86 beats/minute and respiratory rate of 20cycles/minute. There was extensive solar keratosis over the head， neck and upper limbs. The trunk and lower limbs had fewer solar keratosis. A fungating ulcer that measured 6 cm by 6 cm was located on the scalp，superior and lateral to the right ear. The posterior auricular， occipital， submandibular， submental and cervical lymph nodes were not palpable. The other regions of the body were grossly normal. We made a clinical diagnosis of basal cell carcinoma. The investigations done and their**\n\n【24】**Figure 1： Fungating scalp ulcer.**\n\n【25】**Figure 2： Photomicrograph of squamous cell carcinoma.**\n\n【26】**results were packed cell volume (32%)， urine analysis was normal. Excision biopsy of the lesion was done and the histology result was squamous cell carcinoma (Figure 2).**\n\n【27】**Discussion**\n\n【28】**Our index patient is 13 years old and presented one year after the lesion started. Therefore， the cancer started at twelve years of age. This is an early age for albinos to develop skin cancer even in our tropical climate where the full impact of the sun is felt. It is believed that although a lot of the damage is done in childhood， skin cancers develop later in life. Indeed， one source quotes fifty percent of skin damage to have occurred at 15 years \\[5\\]. There is increase in the global incidence of skin cancers and now we are beginning to see these cancers in younger age groups. Therefore， the question to be answered by research is whether more UV radiation， especially UVC， is reaching the earth due to human activity. A retrospective study of skin cancers in our hospital for the last two decades will show the age profile the patients and younger people may be having skin cancers. However， the records of patients in the last 20 years are unreliable in our hospital. Most of the skin cancers are cause by UVB but UVC is known to be more carcinogenic if significant amount of the latter gets to the earth.**\n\n【29】**The finding of squamous cell carcinoma in our patient is not surprising because Asuquo et al. have shown that skin cancers**\n\n【30】**in albinos in our community are more commonly squamous cell carcinoma and not basal cell carcinoma as seen in Caucasians \\[9-111.**\n\n【31】**The management of skin cancers in our community is a challenge for many reasons namely ignorance， late presentation， and poverty. Ignorance and late presentation can be addressed by education of the people on radio， television and health talk in different institutions. Albino parents and the affected children， when they are old enough to understand， should cover the body with the right color that does not absorb UV radiation (e.g. white)， use a hat with a wide brim or umbrella in the sun， do outdoor activities when UV radiation is least(between 6 am and 10 am and after 4 pm)， use sunscreen with a sun protection factor of 15 and report early to hospital for treatment of solar keratosis and ulcers \\[12，13\\]. The government should treat skin lesions in albinos free or give a substantial waiver for the treatment.**\n\n【32】**Conclusion**\n\n【33】**Skin lesions in albinos are curable if presentation is early. The government and health care workers should do everything possible to help this socially stigmatized group of people in Africa.**\n\n【34】**References**\n\n【35】**1\\.

Initial neuroimaging studies including CT and MRI showed dural masses bifrontoparietal and a right-sided tentorial mass in the cerebellopontine angle. Biopsy revealed ECD with a BRAF V600E mutation. The patient underwent initial therapy with vemurafenib. However， treatment was terminated due to adverse effects. Accordingly， dabrafenib therapy at a dose of 75 mg twice daily was started， which was well tolerated.

Therapies are based on the recommendation， although therapy with dabrafenib has not yet been considered as a therapeutic option \\[1\\].**\n\n【19】**Case Presentation**\n\n【20】**In the summer of2016， a 73-year-old female patient presented with fever， weight loss and lymph node swelling. Laboratory studies revealed leukocytosis and mildly increased C-Reactive Protein(CRP). Neuroimaging studies including CT and MRI showed dural masses bifrontoparietal and a tentorial mass in the right cerebellopontine angle (Figure 1A， 1B). Pathological examination of the biopsy revealed ECD with a BRAF V600E mutation as previously reported \\[2\\]. After the pathological diagnosis was rendered， additional systemic lesions were detected by 18 F-FDG Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography (PET/CT) in the humerus， femur， piriform sinus， ilium， clavicles and mandible (Figure 2). Based on the BRAF V600E mutation， the patient underwent treatment with the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib at the dose of 960 milligrams per day. The patient showed clinical improvement of her neurological symptoms as well as general condition within eight weeks with mild to moderate side-effects.**\n\n【21】**During ongoing treatment， symmetric polyarthritis of the shoulder joint， wrist and ankle developed accompanied by joint effusions. The patient also noted generalized malaise， loss of appetite， mood alterations， which triggered poor compliance. At the request of the patient， therapy was discontinued. Subsequently， the patient’s arthritic symptoms completely resolved. Almost two months after the treatment was discontinued， the patient presented with increasing tiredness， fatigue and increasing respiratory distress. The patient’s symptoms correlated with radiographic evidence of progression of the underlying disease. The condition of the patient continued to deteriorate，leading to hospital re-admission. Consequently， Dabrafenib， 75 mg twice daily was started. The therapy was tolerated without further side effects under inpatient supervision. After three months of therapy at a single dose of 75 mg/day， the patient returned for follow-up evaluation. Although the patient complained of limited physical strength， the cranial MRI showed a significant regression of the**\n\n【22】**Figure 1A： Hyper intense diffuse tumor in the pons in FLAIR images (white arrow) without evidence of contrast enhancement.**\n\n【23】**Figure 1B： Enhancing dural masses at the convexity in T1 images after contrast administration (white arrows) with moderate contrast enhancement atter partial resection.**\n\n【24】Figure 2： 18 F-FDG (Fluoro Deoxy Glucose) PET/CT： Maximum Intensity Projection (MIP) PET/CT scan shows diffusely increased FDG uptake in osteosclerotic bone changes in the mandible and in the diaphysis of both humeri， femora and tibiae as well as in the periarticular region of the knee joints (thick black arrows).

After eight months ofcontinuous therapy with dabrafenib doses of 75 mg to150 mg daily，another cranial MRI follow-up imaging was performed， whereupon a further regression of the tumor manifestation in terms of a further size reduction of the dural mass and reduced signal enhancement in the brainstem area were confirmed (Figure 4A， 4B). In the last follow-up， two years after initial diagnosis， cranial MRI showed complete regression of the residual dural tumor mass as well**\n\n【26】**Figure 3A： Partial regression of the hyper intense， non-enhancing tumor in the pons in FLAIR images (white arrow).**\n\n【27】**Figure 3B： Partial regression of the enhancing dural masses at the convexity in T1 images after contrast administration (white arrows).**\n\n【28】**Figure 4A： Subtotal regression of the hyper intense，non-enhancing tumor in the pons with regression of the mass effect and beginning atrophy in FLAIR images (white arrow).**\n\n【29】**Figure 4B： Subtotal regression of the enhancing dural masses at the convexity in T1 images after contrast administration (white arrows).**\n\n【30】**as complete regression of the signal alterations in the brainstem.

Currently， most guidelines favor interferon-alpha as first line therapy. TNFa blockers (infliximab)， tyrosine kinase inhibitors(E.g. imatinib) and recombinant inhibitors of interleukin-1 receptor(Anakinra) have been used successfully in selected cases \\[3\\]. More**\n\n【36】**recently， BRAF V600E mutations were detected in approximately50% of all ECD patients. Some patients have responded dramatically to therapy with the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib \\[4\\]. To date，there are no reports on other BRAF inhibitors such as dabrafenib. The current case describes the favorable toxicity profile and long-term efficacy of dabrafenib therapy in a patient with ECD， exceeding two years. As is the case with vemurafenib， the optimal dose of BRAF inhibitors in ECD is unknown， but might be lower than doses used in melanoma treatment. Our case underscores the efficacy oflower BRAF inhibitor doses and provides evidence of a durable effect with a daily dose of 75mg to 150 mg dabrafenib.**\n\n【37】**References**\n\n【38】**1\\.

Although sociocultural factors in cluding movement patterns， people's livelihood， and way of life have been demonstrated to influence SARS-CoV-2transmission dynamics， the role of environmental risk factors has not been adequately documented. The aim of the study was to investigate environmental risk factors contributing to the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in Zambia using a cross-sectional study.**\n\n【10】**Results： The positivity rates were 10.5% cell phones， 5.3% door knobs， 2.7% remote controls and2.6% beddings. All the other surfaces came out negative. The sex proportion of the respondents was55% and 45% males and females respectively. Regarding occupancy density， 37.5%(15/40) resided in a 2 to 3-roomed house， 32.5%(13/40) resided in a 4 to 7 roomed house and 30%(12/40) resided in >7-roomed house. Of the 40 respondents， 75%(30/40) used recyclable face masks while 25%(10/40) used non-recyclable face masks. For the non-recyclable face masks， 30% ofthe respondents indicated incineration as a disposal method. A correlation coefficient of 0.25 was documented for the association between occupancy density and surface contamination.**\n\n【11】**Conclusion： The study revealed that most environmental surfaces particularly mobile phones were rarely disinfected and were most likely to contribute to the transmission of SARS-CoV-2in the community. Furthermore， the majority of the respondents used recyclable face masks which are easily washable. However， those who used non-recyclable face masks disposed of them indiscriminately which has the potential of contaminating the environment and further lead to the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.**\n\n【12】**Keywords： Environment； Households； Risk factors； SARS-CoV-2**\n\n【13】**Abbreviations**\n\n【14】**BSL3： Biosafety Level 3； COVID-19： Coronavirus Disease 2019； PPE： Personal Protective Equipment； qRT-PCR： Quantitative Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction； RNA： Ribonucleic Acid； SARS-CoV-2： Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2； SPSS： Statistical Package for the Social Sciences； WHO： World Health Organization**\n\n【15】**Background**\n\n【16】**The COVID-19 pandemic， caused by the highly contagious SARS-COV-2， is a global public health problem and has caused a devastating impact on the immediate environment due to its quick spread from person to person \\[1\\]. Transmission occurs mainly via inhalation of respiratory or aerosol droplets from an infected person， produced via coughing and sneezing. Consequently， due to its rapid spread， a meeting held on January 30h，2020， as per the International Health Regulations(IHR， 2005)， World Health Organization declared the outbreak as a disease of Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) as it had spread to 18 countries with four countries reporting human-to-human transmission. Anadditional landmark occurred on February 26h，2020， as the first case of the disease， not imported from China， was recorded in the United States (US) \\[2\\].**\n\n【17】Evidence suggests that environmental factors play a significant role in influencing SARS-CoV-2\n\n【18】**transmission though there is still limited information regarding its spread into the environment. The major environmental factors that can lead to a quicker spread of SARS-CoV-2 include water， air， faecal matter，handling of used face masks， and other medical wastes according to the World Health Organization \\[3\\].**\n\n【19】**Even though most enveloped viruses are not usually excreted in faeces or urine， there is increased evidence that SARS-CoV-2，or at least their genomes， are excreted in faeces \\[4\\]. If infective viruses are excreted into the environment， faecal contamination could be a major transmission route and people could be exposed by interacting with water contaminated with untreated faecal matter \\[5\\]. Discarding face masks and empty bottles of hand sanitizers together with tissue papers results in a huge pile of medical waste in the environment. Discarding of face masks and empty bottles of hand sanitizers together with tissue papers results in a huge pile of medical waste in the environment. Workers involved in the collection of garbage and maintaining the city clean on a daily basis are at high risk of contracting the virus from respiratory shed droplets that could be on discarded masks \\[6\\].**\n\n【20】**Arising from this fact， it is therefore， imperative to explore the various environmental characteristics that would drive the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through a One Health approach and also identify potential environmental foci and how it may enhance the rapid spread of the infection among the human population. The potential environmental factors identified1wouldenable policy-makers to plan for sustainable collaborative environmental intervention strategies.**\n\n【21】**Lusaka being centrallylocated has the potential to drive the spread of SARS-CoV-2 to other parts of the country if effective and efficient sustainable interventions are not in place. Although sociocultural factors including movement patterns， people's livelihood， and way of life have been demonstrated to influence SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics， the role of environmental risk factors had not yet been documented. Against the evidence from the literature indicating environmental contamination， it was important to investigate the contribution of environmental risk factors in the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in Zambia.**\n\n【22】**Aim of the Studv**\n\n【23】**The aim of this study is to investigate environmental risk factors contributing to the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in Zambia.**\n\n【24】**Methods**\n\n【25】**A cross-sectional study was conducted in selected SARS-CoV-2-affected households in the Lusaka district from September to December， 2020. A purposive sampling technique was used to select SARS-CoV-2 affected households from Zambia National Public Health Institute (ZNPHI) database following positive SARS-CoV-2diagnosis. The rationale for selecting the affected households was to maximize the chances of identifying contaminated surfaces that plaved a critical role in the transmission of the virus and also describe the methods of disposal used for face masks. Furthermore， the Lusaka district was one of the epicenters having recorded a high number of SARS-CoV-2 cases.**\n\n【26】**Environmental samples were collected from door knobs/handles， taps， light switch， floor surfaces， work top surfaces， beddings， remote controls and mobile phones using the DaAnGene (2020) sample**\n\n【27】**collection， transport， and processing procedure for tissue and cytopathological analysis specimen preservation. In order to increase the positive predictive value of the environmental sampling process， multiple swabs were taken for each sampling area.

Real-time RT-PCR assays were carried out using The DaAnGene (2020) detection procedure was utilized to identify the presence ofSARS-CoV-2according to the manufacturer’s instructions. To ensure the safety of research assistants and research team members during the training， travel，and data collection process， the use of appropriate PPE and physical distancing was practiced. Extraction of RNA was done in a biosafety level -3 laboratory.**\n\n【29】**Epidemiological data were collected using a pre-tested close-ended questionnaire to capture exposure risk factors that could lead to household contamination such as the type of dwelling， household size， age， gender， occupation， and cultural practices such as funerals and religious gatherings. Further， the respondents were asked to provide information on methods of disposal of used face masks. Participants were identified by codes to ensure anonymity.**\n\n【30】**Data were analyzed using the statistical software package SPSS version 21 and all the statistical tests were determined at a5% significance level. The proportion of infected households was determined by dividing the number of positive householdsby the total number ofhouseholds tested similarly， the percentage contamination of surfaces or articles was estimated using the same approach.**\n\n【31】**Results**\n\n【32】**A total of 40 respondents as shown in Table 1 from SARS-CoV-2 affected households were interviewed with a breakdown of 55% (22/40) representing males while 45% (22/40) representing females. From this total， 37.5%(15/40) resided in a 1 to 3 roomed house， 32.5%(13/40) resided in a 4 to 7 roomed house and 30%(12/40) resided in >7 roomed house. A breakdown of face mask use was： 75% (30/40) disclosed using recyclable face masks while 25%(10/40) none recyclable face masks. Of the 38 pooled environmental surfaces swabbed and analyzed， 21.05% (8/38) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 contamination. The breakdown was as follows： - cell phones at 10.53%(4/38)， door knobs at 5.26%(2/38)， the beddings and remote control were 2.63%(1/38) and 2.63%(1/38) respectively. A. correlation coefficient of 0.25 was documented for the association between occupancy density and surface contamination.**\n\n【33】**Discussion**\n\n【34】**SARS-CoV-2 was detected in only 21.05% of all environmental samples tested. Among the environmental surfaces swabbed， mobile cell phones were more prominently significant to contain SARS-CoV-2 compared with the other environmental surfaces. These results show that there is a risk of transmitting SARS-CoV-2 via mobile cell phones if the appropriate SARS-CoV-2 health guidelines of hygiene are not maintained. A study conducted by Chin et al. \\[7\\]， reported that SARS-CoV-2 was viable in the environment at 4°C for a long time however this reduced with a raise in temperature， and at70°C the virus was inactivated in 5 min. This therefore shows that the environment and human behavioral conditions have a critical role in transmitting the virus. Thus， the risk of transmitting SARS-CoV-2**\n\n【35】**Table 1： Sociodemographic characteristics and SARS-CoV-2 environmental contamination.**\n\n| **Variable**  | **Mean (SD)/n (%)**  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Age**  | **28.43(13.13)**  |\n| **Gender**  |  |\n| **Males**  | **22(55%)**  |\n| **Females**  | **18(45%)**  |\n| **Marital status**  |  |\n| **Single**  | **8 (20%)**  |\n| **Separated**  | **6(15%)**  |\n| **Marriec**  | **25(62.5%)**  |\n| **Widow**  | **1(2.5%)**  |\n| **Number of Occupants per Household**  |  |\n| **1-3 Roomed House**  | **9(32.1%)**  |\n| **4-7 Roomed House**  | **11(39.2%)**  |\n| **Greater than7 Roomed House**  | **8(28.6%)**  |\n| **Type of Face Mask used**  |  |\n| **Recyclable**  | **30(75%)**  |\n| **None recyclable**  | **10(25%)**  |\n| **Disposal Method for None Recyclable**  |  |\n| **Incineration**  | **3(30%)**  |\n| **Indiscriminate**  | **7(70%)**  |\n| **Positive Environmental Surfaces**  |  |\n| **Remote control**  | **1(2.63%)**  |\n| **Beddings**  | **1(2.63%)**  |\n| **Door knob**  | **2(5.26%)**  |\n| **Cell phone**  | **4(10.53%)**  |\n\n【37】**from one person to another via contaminated environmental surfaces can be higher if appropriate disinfection measures are less rigorously respected and not adequately conducted upon detection of SARS-CoV-2 cases from different households.**\n\n【38】**Solid waste materials generated from households with infected or suspected SARS-CoV-2 cases may contain traces of SARS-CoV-2and could be a source of infection for people within and outside the households. As recently discovered， SARS-CoV-2 can stay on hard surfaces for long periods of time， specifically， 72 h on plastic， 48 h on stainless steel and 24 h on paper and cardboard. Therefore， a72-h-delay in the collection does not seem to be sufficient to ensure safety and may lead to SARS-CoV-2 infection amongst solid waste collectors. A poor management of solid waste can possibly increase the chances of SARS-CoV-2 spread in the environment due to transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 through respiratory means and physical touch. Apart from human-to-human transmission，droplets may also stay active on surfaces where the virus could remain viable. Thus， the immediate environment of an infected individual can serve as a source oftransmission \\[8\\].**\n\n【39】**The study had revealed that the majority of the respondents were using recyclable face masks. The research further established that almost all the closer contacts of SARS-CoV-2 cases at household level were putting on face masks to prevent any possibility of contracting and spreading the virus. This is in agreement with a study conducted by Nzediegwu and Chang， which noted that the total number of face**\n\n【40】**masks used during the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak had increased and this depended on the number of contacts closer to SARS-CoV-2 cases， number of occupants per household， face masks acceptance rate(percent) and average daily face masks per capita.**\n\n【41】**This research established that most of the SARS-CoV-2 cases were reported in both densely and low densely populated sub-districts and that most of the transmissions occurred between household members as described by Hui et al. \\[9\\]. Most of the SARS-CoV-2 cases were residing in a three-roomed household structure with an average family size of nine \\[10-12\\]. The occupancy density was noticed to be higher particularly in densely populated households thereby increasing the chances of SARS-CoV-2 transmission rates \\[13，14\\]. The findings clearly show the importance of testing close contacts of SARS-CoV-2 cases to promptly identify and isolate infections in the incubation period \\[5，16\\]. This would also be appropriate if the lower estimated transmission probability of SARS-CoV-2 during the illness period than during the incubation period could be partially attributed to self-distancing within households when the primary cases developed symptoms \\[17，18\\]. The estimated probability of daily SARS-CoV-2 transmission was higher in households of six people or less than in larger households (more than six people).**\n\n【42】**Study Limitations**\n\n【43】**This study was only done in Lusaka and particularly targeted households with affected cases of COVID-19. The results of this study cannot be generalized to the whole Zambian population however； the study provides initial scientific baseline data regarding the environmental risks contributing to the transmission of COVID-19factors. This can help in refining policies that will target the prevention of potential environmental surfaces that would enhance the further spread of COVID-19 in the population.**\n\n【44】**Conclusion**\n\n【45】**There is a need to ensure that active case finding and isolation in conjunction with comprehensive contact tracing and quarantine are instituted for preventing infected contacts from spreading the virus during their incubation periods. The positive samples documented were indicative of the presence of SARS-CoV-2 on environmental surfaces. It is thus， plausible to conjecture that the environment could have played a role as a source of infection for SARS-CoV-2in Zambia. There is a need to also explore the long-term association of environmental and climate indicators with the SARS-CoV-2pandemic and to study the inter-district and provincial responses towards the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak to provide a better outlook for understanding the spread of SARS-COV-2. Furthermore， we recommend that bank notes should also be investigated as environmental surfaces which significantly contribute to the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in Zambia.**\n\n【46】**Acknowledgem ent**\n\n【47】**We would to acknowledge the following institutions that supported this study namely； Eden University， University of Zambia， National Science for Technology Council， Ministry of Health， Zambia National Public Health Institute (ZNPHI).**\n\n【48】**Authors'Contribution**\n\n【49】**KC and LL Conceived and designed the research.
