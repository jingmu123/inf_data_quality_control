As injuries to the thoracic spine result from high-energy trauma， patients are generally in poor health and surgical treatment is usually delayed.

As a result， there are many cases in which surgery cannot be performed early after injury， and a consensus on optimal surgery timing has not been obtained. We undertook reconstruction and fixation of a thoracic dislocation fracture accompanying multiple trauma on the same day as the injury， which was useful for systemic management after surgery.**\n\n【21】**Case Presentation**\n\n【22】**A 74-year-old man was transported to our emergency department following a fall from a height of 6 m. Neurological examination revealed complete motor paralysis and sensory loss below thoracic level seven (T7)， with absent anal-bulbocavernosus reflexes. Radiographic and computed tomography imaging identified： Burst fracture of T4 (AO classification， 52-B2.3； load sharing classification， 7 points) \\[1，2\\]； fracture-dislocation of T5 (AO classification， 52-C1.3； load sharing classification， 9 points)； and spinal cord function， Frankel grade A . Associated injuries included acute subdural hematoma，traumatic aortic dissection， bilateral hemithorax， and bilateral clavicular fracture .**\n\n【23】**Emergency medical treatment comprised blood transfusion and thoracic drainage. After drain placement， cessation of bleeding into the chest cavity was confirmed via angiography； the patient underwent surgery for his spinal injuries 6 hours after sustaining the trauma.**\n\n【24】**Surgical Procedure**\n\n【25】**Following an incision along the thoracic spine， free bone fragments were excised. The T5vertebral arch was resected to decompress the spinal cord， and the damaged dura mater was repaired. Pedicle screws were inserted at the levels of T2 to T3 and T6 to T8 . The surgical time was 158 min， with an intraoperative blood loss volume of 748 mL.**\n\n【26】**Post-surgery， the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit for medical management. As the spinal injury had been stabilized early， postural drainage was possible and the patient's respiratory status and overall medical status improved. Three months post-surgery， the patient no longer complained of back pain. His motor paralysis and sensory loss had recovered to a Frankel classification grade B. He could maintain static sitting and could transfer into and out of a wheelchair with assistance.**\n\n【27】**Figure 1： Computed tomography imaging of the thoracic spine injury on admission： (a) sagittal plane；(b) coronal plane； (C) T4 axial plane； and (d) T5 axial plane.**\n\n【28】Figure 2： Computed tomography images of (a) the brain， showing an acute subdural hematoma； (b) chest， showing a traumatic aortic dissociation； (c) chest， showing a bilateral hemothorax.\n\n【29】**Figure 3： A， B)： Post-operative radiograph of the thoracic spine. C)： Post-operative computed tomography in the sagittal plane.**\n\n【30】**Discussion**\n\n【31】**Thoracic spine injury usually results from high-energy trauma， such as a fall from a height or motor vehicle accident. For our patient， all three columns had been disrupted by the fracture-dislocation， with compression of the spinal canal. Early decompression and stabilization was performed to allow early mobilization and rehabilitation. Several factors must be considered when determining the timing of surgical treatment of thoracic spine fractures： Patients’age， clinical symptoms， neurological injury and impairment， status of accompanying injuries， and type of stabilization required (anterior， posterior or combined stabilization) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3-7\\]</u>. An anterior approach allows decompression under direct vision， rigid reconstruction of**\n\n【32】**the anterior column， and sufficient correction of the spinal kyphosis. There is， however， a risk for increased bleeding from the vertebral bodies and epidural bleeding. A posterior approach is technically simpler than an anterior approach； the surgical stress on the patient is relatively lower. However， a posterior approach carries the risk for loss of the kyphosis correction and insufficient decompression. Although decompression of the spinal canal and stabilization should be performed as soon as possible， timing of the surgical treatment must be balanced with a patient's medical status. In trauma care of a patient with multiple fractures involving long bones， treatment is guided by the concept of Damage Control Orthopedic (DCO) surgery通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Similarly， the concept of Spine Damage Control (SDC) surgery**\n\n【33】**has recently been proposed for the management of patients presenting with multiple injuries including the spine， due to high energy trauma通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>， the priorities being hemodynamic and spinal stabilization and improving respiratory status. As a majority of patients with thoracic spine injury are in a poor general condition， it is often required to wait until the surgery. However， even in a case with poor general condition such as our patient， from the point of view of damage control surgery， surgery early after injury is useful.**\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【35】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**1\\.

The SELENA-SLEDAI is a validated tool for measuring disease activity in patients with SLE. This assessment can be completed to objectively assess the patient's current state of disease. All SLE-related descriptors (16 clinical manifestations and eightlaboratoryparameters) that are present at the time of the visit or within the previous 10 days are scored. Physicians also grade disease activity using a semi-quantitative scale where 0 is no disease activity and 3 represents severe disease activity.**\n\n【45】**Comorbidities were assessed as per the SLICC Damage Index and the Charlson Index. The Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics (SLICC) Damage Index (SDI) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u> documents cumulative and irreversible damage irrespective of its cause in 12 different organ systems. To be scored， each manifestation must be present for at least six months， unless otherwise noted in the instructions accompanying this instrument.**\n\n【46】**The Charlson's clinical comorbidity index 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u> is a weighted index that takes into account the number and the seriousness of comorbid diseases including 19 categories. The components of the weighted**\n\n【47】**index are then computed giving a final count that ranges from zero to 37， zero accounting for no comorbidity and 37 for the sum of all possible comorbidities included in the index. In this study， we used a modified version， deleting the connective tissue disease category； therefore， diminishing the maximum possible value of the sum to 36.**\n\n【48】**Finally，self-reported quality of life was ascertained with the Lupus PRO 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Lupus PRO is a disease-targeted，patient-reported outcome measure that was developed and validated in the United States of America among patients with SLE. Lupus PRO has two constructs：Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) and Non-Health-Related Quality of Life (Non-HRQoL). Individual domains， total HRQoL and total non-HRQoL scores range from 0 to 100， where higher scores indicate better health.

The relationship between socioeconomic-demographic， self-reported quality of life (as per the Lupus PRO) as well as clinical data (clinical manifestations， diagnostic criteria as per the 1987 ACR criteria， disease activity as per the SELENA-SLEDAI， damage as per the SLICC Damage Index， co-morbidities as per the Charlson Index) and work disability was examined with Chi-Square and Mann-Whitney U test. Variables with a p value ≤0.10 in these analyses were then examined by multivariable logistic regression with work disability as the dependent variable.

This number is certainly much higher among patients with SLE. Secondly， we performed a cross sectional study. This type of design may have precluded some variables to be associated with work disability， disease activity， among others. As deceased patients were not examined， it is also possible that both， the rate and the variables of work disability， would have been slightly different if this group of patients were analyzed.**\n\n【84】**In conclusion， in this sample of patients with SLE we found that almost a quarter of the patients become work disabled at any point of the disease course. None of the clinical variables were associated with this outcome. On the contrary， a lower socio-economic status and self-perceived quality of life influenced the patients' ability to work. Measures should be undertaken at the individual and， specially， the society level in order to lower the work disability rate among this population of patients.**\n\n【85】**Funding**\n\n【86】**Supported by a grant from the Argentine Society of Rheumatology.**\n\n【87】**Author Contribution**\n\n【88】**To Meenakshi Jolly， MD， MS -Rush University Medical Center， who shared the Lupus PRO with us for， which we are very grateful?**\n\n【89】**To Ana Echevarria Bertoli for her excellent performance as data entry.**\n\n【90】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【91】通用结尾删除-1:<u>1\\.

Also， there are relatively few literature data referring to the etiological hypotheses of this condition. This paper presents our results regarding the histopathological appearance highlighted in surgically resected venous aneurysm specimens that reveal the potential causes that lead to this condition onset， as well as a brief review the literature data. At the same time， current therapeutic options are discussed.**\n\n【12】**Keywords： Primary venous aneurysm etiology； Endophlebohypertophy； Endophlebosclerosis**\n\n【13】**Introduction**\n\n【14】**Isolated Venous Aneurysms (VA) can be defined as a focal dilation at least two or three times larger than the diameter of the venous trunk， and it should not be contained in a varicose vein segment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. VA is a relatively rare abnormality (literature data reveal a number between 300 and500 cases described around the world so far) \\[2，3\\]. However， the etiology of VA is uncertain. This article discusses possible hypothesis of etiology for VA by presenting our results obtained from morphological analysis of several specimens (surgically resected VA， optical microscopy analyses) and a brief review of literature.**\n\n【15】**Methodology**\n\n【16】**Seven specimens (surgically resected primary VA) from 7 different patients (4 females， 3 males， age： 44.6± 8.2 years， BMI： 29.1±3.4)， were analyzed by the Pathology Laboratory (Hematoxylin-Eosin and the Masson trichrome stain). Our results were compared with literature data searched in PubMed and Google Scholar database (publications in English written from the establishment of the database to September 2022).**\n\n【17】**Results**\n\n【18】**Sixgreat saphenous vein aneurysms measuring between 2.2/1.5 cm and5.5/3.8 cm，and one small saphenous vein aneurysm (2.3/2.1 cm) were analyzed. Histological examination demonstrated that the pathophysiological processes which occur once with primary venous aneurysm development， involve all layers of the vein wall. Irregular intimal surface with disrupted endothelial layer and marked cellular infiltration of the intimal layer was noted in most of the cases. For that reason， intima appears thicker than the media， due to the pronounced infiltration. Most affected seems to be tunica media， where there is significant degradation of collagen fibers， fibrosis， and a reduction in the number of vascular smooth muscle cells. Progressive loss of smooth muscle tissue is most likely due to inefficient reparative elastogenesis. In some places， the tunica media is replaced by hyalinized connective tissue， and the elastic lamina is damaged. At the level of the tunica media and tunica externa， an inflammatory reaction occurs with predominantlylymphocytes and macrophages，which form vascular-associated lymphoid tissue and develop vasa vasorum thickening. The inflammatory reaction is present in places， consists mainly of lymphocytes and macrophages， eosinophils， neutrophils， and plasma cells may be present . In 2 cases， a thrombus (adherent to the endo-vein surface) was noticed.**\n\n【19】**Discussion**\n\n【20】**Chronic Venous Disease (CVD) is a common pathology that significantly affects patient’s quality of life 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. However， on the opposite side， primary venous aneurysms are a relatively rare pathology. There are not many literature data related to the microscopic morphological appearance**\n\n【21】**of varicose veins 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>， and no regarding venous aneurysms and their etiology， either.**\n\n【22】**Morphological analysis of various surgically resected specimens revealedi an aneurysm venousSwall with thickened， fibrotic， moderately cellular intima adiacent to a densely fibrotic adventitia fragmentation， attenuation of the elastic lamellae， and loss of smooth muscle cells. In the case of thrombosis， medial fibrosis in areas of thrombus adherence was observed \\[1，6-8\\]. The cases we described present similarities with the microscopic morphology described in the literature. In the case of large venous aneurysms， the deposition of fibrous tissue between the smooth muscle lavers that explained the degeneration of the media can be considered the cause which led to their enlargement. There are theories that the development of VA is the result of the congenital absence of smooth muscle in the venous media 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>， associated with low amounts of elastin fibers and smooth muscle cells， fibrous connective tissue， and elastic fibers in the venous wall 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.Endophlebohypertophyand endophlebosclerosis，processes that occur with age， have also been considered to have a potential role in the development of aneurysms \\[9，11，12\\]. Considering the age of the patients included in this study， our results plead for endophlebohypertophy (marked cellular infiltration of the intimal layer，intima appears thicker than the media)and endophlebosclerosis(fibrous tissue dispersed between the circular and longitudinal muscle layers， excessive subendothelial collagen deposition) as the most probable hypothesis of etiology.**\n\n【23】**Even if treatment guidelines are not clearly established and thus treatment strategies vary， depending on the location and clinical manifestations， some principles have been described \\[10，11\\]. Some data recommend conservative treatment for uncomplicated or asymptomatic aneurysms， or with jugular， subclavian， thoracic， or visceral localization. There are also reported cases with iliac localization successfully treated conservatively by anticoagulant medication and inferior vena cava filter. In the case of symptomatic， complicated or growing aneurysms， or those located in the deep veins of the lower limbs， primary surgery is indicated. Interventions for aesthetic reasons have also been described. As surgical techniques， ligation/excision，tangential aneurysmectomyand lateral venography， resection of VA with interposition autologous vein graft can be practiced. The endovascular approach has also been described in some cases for subclavian VA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Cryostripping has been described as a feasible therapeutic alternative for the surgical resection of the venous segments containing the aneurysm 14.**\n\n【24】**Due to the decreased frequency of this disease， there are still insufficient studies that provide data for its etiology. For patients who are not in the first decades of life， we consider that the presence of aneurysms is due to the processes of endoflebosclerosis. The destruction of tunica media produced by the separation of the smooth muscle bundles and the significant deposits of fibrous tissue， which weaken the structure of the venous wall， allows aneurysmal dilatation. Multicentric studies which analyze more data about the VA etiology would be useful to reach a consensus. Regarding the treatment， most data， including our clinical experience， recommend venous aneurysm resection performed through different procedures as the first therapeutic option.**\n\n【25】**Acknowledgement**\n\n【26】**The Authors are grateful to the Editor of this Journal for the invitation to publish in it， and to Rene Brinley for the good collaboration and support.**\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>1\\.

No clear echocardiographic features of tamponade were present and no pulsus paradoxus elicited but in view of her resistant hypotension requiring inotropes despite adequate filling a decision was made to perform urgent pericardiocentesis. An urgent pericardiocentesis was performed and an immediate improvement in blood pressure was observed. The pericardial fluid had an unusual creamy color and slightly viscous consistency. Pericardial fluid cultures later confirmed the presence of Haemophilus Influenzae. A Mirena coil was inserted one month prior to admission. A high vaginal swab from the intrauterine mirena coil revealed H. Influenzae infection and prompted removal of the device and full recovery of the patient. We have reviewed PubMed and found 10 cases of H. Influenzae pericardial effusion and tamponade in adults. This appears to be the first reported case where the primary focus of Haemophilus Influenzae appears to have been related to an intrauterine device. It also illustrates the importance of considering tamponade where classical physical and echocardiographic signs are not present.**\n\n【5】**Keywords： Haemophilus influenzae； Pericarditis**\n\n【6】**Patient Presentation**\n\n【7】**OPEN ACCESS**\n\n【8】**_\\*Correspondence：Evangelos Tzolos， Department of_ _Cardiology Royal infirmary Edinburgh，51 Little France Cres， Edinburgh，_ _Scotland， EH16 4SA， UK，_**\n\n【9】**An otherwise healthy 47 year old lady was admitted to the medical admissions unit of our District General Hospital with a one week history ofpericarditis chest pain， followed by collapse.

It can be isolated or associated with other malformations. The diagnosis can be made antenatally by morphological ultrasound in the second trimester or postnatally. The associated malformations and the degree of hydrocephalus are the two essential criteria that condition the subsequent prognosis.**\n\n【12】**We report a case of Dandy-Walker malformation that was diagnosed during a first routine prenatal ultrasound at 17 weeks of gestation.

A normal ultrasound appearance of the cerebellum in the second trimester does not rule out certain pathologies of the posterior fossa since its structures are not yet established. The sonographer must be careful before making a definitive diagnosis of “Dandy-Walker variant”or“mega-tank magna”通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.**\n\n【18】**We are reporting a case of Dandy-Walker malformation which was diagnosed during a first routine prenatal ultrasound at 17 weeks of pregnancy.**\n\n【19】**Case Presentation**\n\n【20】**This is a 29-year-old patient， gravida 3， para 2， married for 7 years， non-consanguineous marriage. In her obstetrical history， there is a vaginal delivery of a full-term newborn in good health and a C-section for fetal macrosomia with a good neonatal outcome.**\n\n【21】**She did a follow-up at 18 weeks of amenorrhea. Antenatal ultrasound performed at this term showed dolichocephaly with cystic malformation of the posterior fossa measuring 28 mm×23mm x17 mm associated with agenesis ofthe cerebellum as well as significant hydrocephalus and agenesis of the corpus callosum found in sagittal section . All of these conditions are consistent with Dandy-Walker malformation. In addition， there is an intrathoracic stomach hernia (Figures1-3). An amniocentesis was performed showing a normal karyotype 46 XX. The case was presented in a multidisciplinary consultation meeting and a therapeutic interruption of the pregnancy was decided in agreement with the parents. Histopathological examination confirmed the ultrasound findings.**\n\n【22】**Discussion**\n\n【23】**Dandy-Walker malformation is a term that includes several anomalies of brain development. This anomaly is a congenital brain malformation usually involving the fourth ventricle and the cerebellum which was first described in 1914 by Dandy and Blackfan and was referred to as**\n\n【24】**Figure 1： Trans-cerebellar coronal slice showing a cystic malformation of the posterior fossa with agenesis of the cerebellar vermis.**\n\n【25】**Figure 2： Cavo-thalamo-cerebellar section showing dolichocephaly with cystic malformation of the posterior fossa and agenesis of the cerebellar vermis.**\n\n【26】**Figure 3： Axial thoracic section showing a right intrathoracic hernia of the stomach(E).**\n\n【27】**Dandy-Walker syndrome in 1954 by Benda， who also reported a familial origin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. The prevalence of Dandy-Walker malformation is approximately 1：30，000 live births with a slight female preponderance as is the case for our patient and is responsible for 4% to 12% of infantile hydrocephalus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.**\n\n【28】**A bibliographic search on the \"PubMed\" and \"ScienceDirect\"platforms concerning the antenatal diagnosis of Dandy-Walker syndrome was carried out； three articles were found during the period of 2011-2022. The studies involved 8 cases in total.**\n\n【29】**The Dandy-Walker malformation is frequently associated with other intracranial abnormalities such as agenesis of the corpus callosum found in our case. Also， to belooked for： Holoprosencephaly， occipital encephalocele and ocular anomalies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7-9\\]</u>. Extra-cranial anomalies are also to be sought and are in order of frequency：**\n\n【30】**Cardiac anomalies (38%)， facial dysmorphisms and cleft palate (26%)， dysgraphia， poly- and syndactyly (28%)， genital malformations-urinary (28%) and digestive (7%)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.**\n\n【31】**Other less common abnormalities include limb abnormalities， abdominal wall abnormalities and diaphragmatic hernia which are extremely rare and found in our clinical case. Sexual ambiguities have also been described \\[10，11\\].**\n\n【32】**Postnatal studies indicate that the incidence of associated malformations is between 50% and 70% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. The most common etiology is genetic.**\n\n【33】**Environmental factors， infections， including viral (rubella，CMV)， alcohol and diabetes also seem to play a role in the pathogenesis of Dandy-Walker malformation but the scientific evidence remains uncertain. In our patient， there does not seem to be any infectious， environmental or genetic factors， especially since the karyotype is normal. In the absence of an obvious cause， the risk of recurrence in subsequent pregnancies is 1% to 5%通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.**\n\n【34】**Prenatal ultrasound diagnosis of Dandy-Walker malformation is quite simple. However， it is important to differentiate with other posterior fossa anomalies such as mega cistern magna and retrocerebellar arachnoid cyst. For this， a set of ultrasound signs must be sought：**\n\n【35】**At the level of the Posterior Cerebral Fossa (PCF)**\n\n【36】**In the cavo-thalamo-cerebellar section： A cystic dilation of the V4 leading to widening of the FCP， anechoic， triangular with an external base. the cerebellar hemispheres， hypoechogenic， are pushed back laterally and anteriorly， more or less hypotrophic， symmetrically or not. The vermis， echogenic， is hypotrophic or even absent (25%).**\n\n【37】**In the sagittal section： The tentorium of the cerebellum is elevated； the vermis presents a more or less significant amputation of its lower part going as far as the complete absence of individualization. The lower part of the vermis can be extended towards the torcular by a linear image \"in the tail of a comet corresponding embryologically to the upper wall of the Blake pouch. The brainstem is normal.**\n\n【38】**On the supratentorial level**\n\n【39】**Anomalies are found in 70% of cases： Hydrocephalus (60%)， agenesis ofthe corpus callosum (15%)， migration anomalies， lipomas and interhemispheric cysts， encephalocele， holoprosencephaly 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>.**\n\n【40】**As for the MRI， it finds its place especially in case of diagnostic doubt with the other cystic malformations of the posterior fossa or if there is strong presumption of a form close to the Dandy-Walker malformation with vermian hypoplasia formerly called \"Dandy-Walker variant\".**\n\n【41】**It not only helps to refine the diagnosis initially screened by ultrasound， but it can also represent a useful imaging technique for confirming and characterizing the various cerebellar malformations thanks to the median sagittal sections of the posterior fossa. At an early stage (19 to 24 weeks of gestation)， it makes it possible to make the differential diagnosis between vermian malrotation and Dandy-Walker malformation by studying the biometry and morphology of all the structures involved \\[81.**\n\n【42】**Even in the second and third trimester， an inappropriate scan angle， can give the impression of excessive size of the cistern magna (great cistern) and even a vermian abnormality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. The retrocerebellar arachnoid cyst is a less frequent and more benign**\n\n【43】**anomaly than the Dandy-Walker malformation， because in this case， the overlying brain is normal. The cerebellar hemispheres are not separated by a cystic mass. Rather，they are moved en bloc 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>.**\n\n【44】**As the congenital anomalies of the posterior fossa are numerous with an important anatomical nuance， a new ultrasound prenatal screening method was mentioned by an Italian-Polish team： It is the measurement of the angle of the Brainstem-Vermis (B-V) from17 weeks of amenorrhea on the median sagittal slice. In this series， normal fetuses have an angle always less than 18°. For the Blake pouch cyst， this angle is less than 30°， unlike fetuses with a Dandy-Walker malformation which present an angle (B-V) always greater than 45°. An intermediate value is noted for vermian hypoplasia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>.**\n\n【45】**Early detection at 14 WA has been reported by measuring the angle (B-V) making it possible to perform a trophoblastic biopsy in search of chromosomal abnormalities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>.**\n\n【46】**Based on the available evidence， it is believed that prenatal ultrasound allows definitive diagnosis only of severe anatomical varieties of Dandy-Walker syndrome. These are characterized byboth a large cystic mass in the posterior fossa and agenesis of the cerebellar vermis， which is called the classic Dandy-Walker malformation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>.**\n\n【47】**It is difficult to dispel doubt before birth about the presence of a mega-cistern magna or a small lower vermis anomaly. This can only be resolved by postnatal imaging studies (magnetic resonance imaging) or findings by fetal pathology study.**\n\n【48】**Conclusion**\n\n【49】**Dandy-Walker malformation is a rareand\\]heterogeneous malformation involving the cerebellar vermis. The first ultrasound clue to the diagnosis is an enlargement ofthe cistern magna. Fetal MRI allows a better characterization of this malformation. This pathology is associated with CNS malformations and other genetic diseases， which is why a study of the karyotype and molecular analyzes are suggested. Prenatal diagnosis of DWM cannot predict the prognosis of the disease， on the basis of which the medical team and the parents must make a decision， especially since there is no consensus in the literature.**\n\n【50】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【51】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**1\\.

There are two theories which describe the origin of these cysts. First， at the time of notochordal development， failure of separation of notochord and foregut during the process of excalation leads to incorporation of endodermal cells with notochord which later becomes Neuroenteric cysts 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4-6\\]</u>. Second theory is of an endodermal diverticulum behind the oropharyngeal membrane called as Seesel pouch which may be a progenitor for midline supratentorial cysts \\[7，8\\].**\n\n【30】**These cysts are mostly seen in the spine but can be rarely seen intra cranially.

This NAA like peak is supposed to be secreted by celllining of the cyst wall and contains perchloric acid or sialic acid bound to macromolecules resonating at 2.02 ppm \\[12，13\\].**\n\n【34】**The main differential diagnosis of neuroenteric cyst are arachnoid cyst， epidermoid cyst， dermoid cyst rarely Rathke and colloid cyst. However imaging features can differentiate between these cysts. Arachnoid cyst is of CSF intensity on all the MRI sequences， epidermoid cyst shows restricted diffusion， Rathke and colloid cyst have different site of location. The presence of N-Acetyl Aspartate(NAA) like peak at 2.02 ppm is also considered as specific finding in neuroenteric cyst which is absent in other cysts \\[11，14，15\\].**\n\n【35】**Similar imaging features were noted in our case. In addition we found heavily T2W sequence like CISS 3D very useful in differentiating these cysts. IN CISS sequence we can clearly define the wall of the cyst and it appears hypo intense compared to surrounding CSF with smooth wall. The wall of epidermoid cyst however can appear irregular or frond like on CISS sequence 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. As a rare complication， these cysts can spontaneously leak slowly or rupture following trauma leading to aseptic chemical meningitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17-19\\]</u>.**\n\n【36】**The recurrentaseptic meningitis is calledasSMollaret**\n\n【37】**Figure 3： CISS sequence in A shows disappearance of the cystic lesion with thin floating membrane (arrow) and FLAIR in B shows no hyper intensity as was seen in Figure 1.**\n\n【38】**meningitis associated with CSF pleocytosis predominantly with polymorphonuclear cells and caused by virus however Mollaret meningitis due to slow leakage of epidermoid cyst are reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. Similarly Mollaret meningitis is also reported due to slow leakage from neuroenteric cyst 21.**\n\n【39】**In a ruptured dermoid cyst， fat globules can be seen in the subarachnoid space as hyper intensities on T1 weighted images， subtle sulcal FLAIR hyper intensities and leptomeningeal enhancement on contrast study due to chemical meningitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. Similar imaging picture can be seen in ruptured neuroenteric cyst. The chemical meningitis in neuroenteric cyst could be due to its enteric mucin contents 17，19，20.**\n\n【40】**In our case， patient initially presented with headache and vomiting probably suggesting leakage of neuroenteric cyst and aseptic meningitis however there was no obvious contrast enhancement on imaging. Subsequently，the neuroenteric cyst ruptured spontaneously during the hospital course causing chemical aseptic meningitis with sulcal and cisternal FLAIRhyperintensity and intense leptomeningeal enhancement. Following treatment with steroids， patient recovered completely within two days. Follow-up imaging showed near total resolution of the neuroenteric cyst. In our knowledge this is first case， showing near total resolution of the neuroenteric cyst following spontaneous rupture without any obvious trauma. We could not get the imaging follow up of the patient but telephonic follow-up suggested that patient was asymptomatic.**\n\n【41】**Conclusion**\n\n【42】**Clinical signs of headache and vomiting in a known case of neuroenteric cyst could be the warning sign of impending rupture and spontaneous rupture can occur leading to partial or complete resolution. Also CISS 3D sequence (heavily T2W) can be used additionally to further characterize the cystic lesions.**\n\n【43】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【44】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**1\\. Kubie LS FJF.

However， although the BMI is more often clinically used to define nutritional status， it does not differentiate between specific body-composition components. In addition， recent studies analyzed that the Fat Free Mass (FFM) is more strongly associated with lung function in CF compared to the BMI， and an abnormal or excessive accumulation of Fat Mass (FM)， according to World Health Organization(WHO)， places the individual at risk of cardiovascular and chronic lifestyle diseases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.**\n\n【16】**New therapeutic advancements have shown favorable effects on the quality of life and longevity among CF patients (pts). The advent of CFTR modulators， especially the most recent one， i.e.， the Elexacaftor-Tezacaftor-Ivacaftor (ETI)， has been demonstrated to reduce sweat chloride levels and risk of pulmonary exacerbations and improve respiratory function and nutritional status. This results in an increase in weight and BMI and，therefore， overweight and obesity， which are becoming areas of interest among clinical care and researchers for the first time in CF history 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.**\n\n【17】**Currently， CFTR modulators are known to improve nutritional status and increase anthropometric parameters， but very little is known about how they affect body composition over time 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Hence， the objective of this study was to assess the body composition of CF pts on ETI during their first year of treatment at Ancona CF center in order to prevent obesity and chronic diseases through adequate dietetic interventions.**\n\n【18】**At Ancona CF center， the nutritional status of CF pts who started the commercial triple combination ETI was monitored at fixed times (T0， T1， T3， T6， T12). In this study， we analyzed the weight and body composition of F508del/Minimal Function (F/MF) (n=15) and F508del/F508del (F/F)(n=12) pts over 12 years of age who completed the assessment at 12 months (T12). Weight，BMI， and body composition parameters， in particular FM and FFM， were analyzed using a Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA).**\n\n【19】**What about results? Variations (A)(T0-T6；T12-T6) in weight and bodycomposition parameters of CF pts on ETI were outlined in the following graphs.**\n\n【20】**Despite the limited number of pts， this monocentric study showed a consistent increase at T6and a moderate increase at T12 in weight， BMl， and FM in pts on ETI. The lowest increment in weight，BMI， and FM and the highest increment in FFM in the second semester are determined by a personalized dietary intervention and increased physical activity.**\n\n【21】**The results of this study show that pts on ETI appear to have an increased risk of developing overweight or obesity and， consequently， cardiovascular and metabolic diseases， especially if not properly followed by a specialized CF dietitian.**\n\n【22】**The effects of CFTR modulators on the increasing weight，height， and BMI in individuals with CF are known and highly dependent on therapy formulation (single or combined therapy)， clinical conditions， and targeted CFTR mutation. However， current evidence regarding the impact of CFTR modulation therapy， particularly ETI， on body composition remains undefined.**\n\n【23】**The advent of CFTR modulation therapy has revolutionized CF care， in terms of less-severe symptoms， higher quality of life，longer survival， lower rates of hospitalization， and better nutritional status in eligible pts. Many studies have shown how these drugs improve the nutritional status of CF pts by increasing weight， height， and BMI， while only a few of them have assessed the impact of CFTR modulators on body composition. Although BMI is commonly used as an indicator of nutritional status in clinical practice， it is not able to provide information regarding body composition parameters. Indeed， a BMI in the normal range can hide a condition of“sarcopenia”or“normal weight obesity\"通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Despite the strong correlation between BMI and lung function in CF， recent studies have demonstrated that a high content of FM is inverselyassociated with pulmonary function and， on the other hand， FFM positively impacts respiratory strength and lung function \\[8，9\\].**\n\n【24】**As therapeutic advancements have significantly improved， longevity has increased and overweight and obesity have become emerged issues among the CF population. The implications of excessive weight gain and adiposity on CF clinical outcomes are unknown but may produce similar health consequences and chronic diseases as those observed in the general population \\[5，10\\].**\n\n【25】**According to the scientific literature， our study showed that pts on ETI increased FM more than FFM， but this increment can be identified through regular body-composition assessment and controlled by individualized dietary intervention， constant physical activity， and correct lifestyle.**\n\n【26】**Current nutritional guidelines state that individuals with CF may need a higher energy intake than the general population through a high calorie and fat diet. Nevertheless， these recommendations may no longer be appropriate， especially in the era of CFTR modulators. Moreover， it is important to consider that the nutritional status of many CF pts remains suboptimal， even after starting CFTR modulation therapy， and， thus， a more energy-dense diet may be necessary 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.**\n\n【27】**In conclusion， the CF nutritional approach should meet each individual's dietetic requirements and focus on diet quality in order to promote optimal health outcomes and prevent other chronic lifestyle diseases. Further research is needed to understand which method of body-composition assessment can be recommended in CF clinical care and analyze longer-term metabolic consequences of ETI 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.**\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**1\\.

Tuberculosis is the responsible ofa respiratory chronic disease that spreads through the respiratory tract and has the lungs as primary target. The increase of new cases， mainly due to migratory flows， has led to the reappearance of aspects of the disease that are now forgotten. The aim of this paper8.3is focusing on a typical radiological sign indicative of progressive post-primary disease， actually no more considered in recent scientific literature， but well known to radiologists at the beginning of the 20\" century： The infiltrate of Assmann-Redeker. The recognition of this sign makes it possible the recognition of cases of early post-primary disease and the immediate implementation of the correct therapeutic procedure. Our paper consists of a series of four cases admitted to the Policlinico Umberto I in Rome， in which these findings were not initially recognized. Retrospectively this radiological sign was found on the chest X-ray. All Patients underwent chest CT to compare this finding. Diagnostic confirmation was finally obtained through laboratory investigations and one case histology proven， after surgery.**\n\n【12】**Abbreviations**\n\n【13】**CT： Computer Tomography； WHO： World Health Organization； TB： Tuberculosis； SARS-CoV-2： Severe Acquired Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2；PA： Posterior Anterior； LL： Latero-Lateral**\n\n【14】**Introduction**\n\n【15】**Tuberculosis (TB) is a chronic infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis， a Bacillus that spreads through the respiratory tract and most commonly has the lungs as target organs (80%).**\n\n【16】**According to data released in the World Report on Tuberculosis of 2018 by the World Health Organization (WHO)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>，this is one of the top ten deadly diseases worldwide and is the leading cause of death from a single pathogen. In 2014， the WHO proposed a global strategy to end tuberculosis epidemics around the world， estimating a 75% reduction in the death rate from tuberculosis in 2025and 95% in 20352\\].**\n\n【17】**However， one of the main obstacles to achieving this objective is represented by the migratory phenomenon， with great difficulty in visualizing an epidemic outbreak， making its management more complex and demanding. The epidemic is influenced by several factors， such as high mobility， low socioeconomic status， poor hygiene， and poor accessibility to the health service， which involves a prolonged time for the diagnosis and treatment oftuberculosis， favoring the spread of the disease.**\n\n【18】**The migrant population is， therefore， subject to a higher risk of tuberculosis， constituting high challenges for the prevention and control of the disease.**\n\n【19】**Although TB is not a rare disease， the reduced knowledge of some indications， that was once well known and then forgotten， can lead to a delayed diagnosis. While the Gohn's complex， the characteristic tuberculous caverns， or the Miliary dissemination belong to common knowledge， there are less known but still characteristic findings of tuberculous disease that must return to a distant part of the cultural background of the radiologist specialist.**\n\n【20】**We intend to highlight in particular， a radiological sign of progressive post-primary disease， the infiltrate of Assmann-Redeker， now almost totally disappeared from modern literature despite the frequency， in the course of tuberculous disease， have not decreased at all.**\n\n【21】**Materials and Methods**\n\n【22】**We considered four cases which underwent diagnostic evaluation in our Institute in a period ranging from 2017 to 2020.

It is the first level of investigation with the highest degree of appropriateness. In all cases of consolidation involving the upper lobes or the upper segments of the lower lobes， associated with mediastinal lymphadenopathy or cavitation， the diagnosis of TB must be considered 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.**\n\n【84】**Primary tuberculosis is mainly common in the pediatric population， although in low prevalence areas the adult population may represent more than a quarter of cases. This is because in many cases， primary tuberculosis has few or no symptoms； more often， only HIV patients can show clear signs of disease at this stage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.**\n\n【85】**The radiographic features described in the literature are：**\n\n【86】Lymphadenopathy which is the most common sign of primary TB， present in about one-third of cases.\n\n【87】**Pulmonary consolidation， often not so different from other bacterial forms.**\n\n【88】**Pleural effusion， typically unilateral， present in about 25%of adult cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.**\n\n【89】The Literature shows that chest X-ray has a high sensitivity but low specificity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【90】**Post-primary tuberculosis， on the other hand， represents the evolution of the disease after a variable long latent period. This is mainly due to a partially competent immune system which leads to the reactivation of the Bacillus， with consequent dissemination.**\n\n【91】**At this stage， a typical sign well known to radiologists， especially in the pre-antibiotic era but less considered in recent literature， is the so-called early Assmann-Redeker infiltrate. This sign (also called\"precocious subclavicular thysiogenic infiltrate\") was described during the 1930s by Assmann and was considered one of the earliest signs of post-primary disease in adults until the 1950s， even before manifesting symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. The importance of early diagnosis of this aspect of post-primary TB lies in the finding， widely documented since the time of the first description， of an evolution of the infiltrate towards the much more extensive and severe caseous phlebitis， in case of delay in the introduction of therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.**\n\n【92】**The infiltrate is described as a rounded opacity， mainly located at the infraclavicular level in correspondence with the upper lobes. The size may be variable and are not related to symptoms， while the density is similar to the hilar shadows but it never reaches the density of the mediastinum 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. The description given by Assmann concerned plan chest radiography. The evolution in caseous pneumonia was expressed with an extension of opacity to the whole lobe and the appearance of numerous small areas of cavitation， which provide the typical aspect defined as \"breadcrumb\".**\n\n【93】**In the CT era， as evident from literature， this infiltrate has never been distinguished by the severe post-primary TB， although this particular aspect may differentiate the advanced disease in which more extensive cavitations， present in about 50% of cases， represent the most characteristic sign 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>**\n\n【94】**The Assmann-Redeker infiltrate can be observed in CT as an area of parenchymal consolidation with blurred edges， mainly localized at the level of the posterior segments of the upper lobes and with a multiloculated appearance like a \"crumb of bread\".**\n\n【95】**Our first case is emblematic of the incorrect clinical/therapeutic management. In fact， the patient was initiallyconsidered oncological， thus conditioning the evolution of his disease. If a differential diagnosis with TB were immediately considered， prompt action would have been taken； avoiding the patient's worsening .**\n\n【96】**In the second case， the small cavitations due to caseous necrosis have been erroneously referred as cystic bronchiectasis. To rejoin the studies conducted by Assman at the beginning of the 204 century， in this case， the evolution of the disease was， precisely， what he described with the use of traditional radiology alone： Cavitation phenomena， typical of uncontrolled post-primary TB 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u> .**\n\n【97】**Learning Points**\n\n【98】**The Assmann-Redeker infiltrate at chest X-ray presents as a rounded opacity， mainly located at the infra-clavicular level in the upper lobes with variable size and a density similar to the hilum， observed in patients in an early stage of post-primary tuberculosis**\n\n【99】**CT scan， the second level exam， often reveals a typicallobar pneumonia with many areas of cavitation. This specific aspect is generally described as breadcrumb appearance.**\n\n【100】**When all these findings are presents， related to typical TB symptoms，radiologists should consider this infectious disease at first.**\n\n【101】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【102】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**l.

Laboratory studies revealed leukocytosis and mildly increased C-Reactive Protein(CRP). Neuroimaging studies including CT and MRI showed dural masses bifrontoparietal and a tentorial mass in the right cerebellopontine angle . Pathological examination of the biopsy revealed ECD with a BRAF V600E mutation as previously reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. After the pathological diagnosis was rendered， additional systemic lesions were detected by 18 F-FDG Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography (PET/CT) in the humerus， femur， piriform sinus， ilium， clavicles and mandible . Based on the BRAF V600E mutation， the patient underwent treatment with the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib at the dose of 960 milligrams per day. The patient showed clinical improvement of her neurological symptoms as well as general condition within eight weeks with mild to moderate side-effects.**\n\n【21】**During ongoing treatment， symmetric polyarthritis of the shoulder joint， wrist and ankle developed accompanied by joint effusions. The patient also noted generalized malaise， loss of appetite， mood alterations， which triggered poor compliance. At the request of the patient， therapy was discontinued. Subsequently， the patient’s arthritic symptoms completely resolved. Almost two months after the treatment was discontinued， the patient presented with increasing tiredness， fatigue and increasing respiratory distress. The patient’s symptoms correlated with radiographic evidence of progression of the underlying disease. The condition of the patient continued to deteriorate，leading to hospital re-admission. Consequently， Dabrafenib， 75 mg twice daily was started. The therapy was tolerated without further side effects under inpatient supervision. After three months of therapy at a single dose of 75 mg/day， the patient returned for follow-up evaluation. Although the patient complained of limited physical strength， the cranial MRI showed a significant regression of the**\n\n【22】**Figure 1A： Hyper intense diffuse tumor in the pons in FLAIR images (white arrow) without evidence of contrast enhancement.**\n\n【23】**Figure 1B： Enhancing dural masses at the convexity in T1 images after contrast administration  with moderate contrast enhancement atter partial resection.**\n\n【24】Figure 2： 18 F-FDG (Fluoro Deoxy Glucose) PET/CT： Maximum Intensity Projection (MIP) PET/CT scan shows diffusely increased FDG uptake in osteosclerotic bone changes in the mandible and in the diaphysis of both humeri， femora and tibiae as well as in the periarticular region of the knee joints .

Along with Echocardiographic investigation， the role of CT scan in localization of vegetation is highly appreciable. With the advancement in the CT-technology was recently Photon Counting CT system (PCCT) introduced. It is a form of X-ray Computed Tomography (CT) in which X-rays are detected using a Photon-Counting Detector (PCD). These photon-counting detectors have the potential to overcome the limitations of current CT detectors， by providing CT data at very high spatial resolution， less noise， improved contrast-to-noise ratio， low radiation dose and with intrinsic spectral information. They are much more dose efficient than other detectors， have smaller pixels， which can significantly increase the spatial resolution. Here， we can expect qualitative images that visualize very fine tissue structures with low radiation and less use of contrast agent. Photon-counting CT offers several significant advantages over other existing CT imaging techniques， which opens potential to scan cardiovascular patients， overcoming compromises in lung and bone imaging and imaging of other organs and systems \\[1，2\\]**\n\n【16】**_Asif MY， Dillinger D， Waldeck S，_ _Zielezinski T， Feyrer R.

The photon counting CT scan reduces radiation exposure， reconstructs images at a higher resolution， corrects beam hardening artifacts， optimizes the use of contrast agents and creates opportunities for quantitative imaging relative to other CT technology 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.

A full cardiac cycle CT investigation with a photon counting CT scanner was done to explore the vegetations on tricuspid valve.

It is postulated to be a reactivation of JC virus in a severely immunocompromised state， to manifest as a multifocal inflammatory white matter disease of the brain， commonest in supratentorial region. We present a case of subacute ataxia and bulbar weakness in an undiagnosed HIV patient， mimicking a lateral medullary infarct.**\n\n【11】**Case Details： A 57 year old patient， not previously undiagnosed to have HIV infection， presented with slurring of speech and imbalance， 3 weeks after COVID-19 pneumonitis. MRI brain showed diffusion restriction with corresponding FLAIR hyperintensities in right lateral medulla. However， patient had progressive worsening of dysarthria and sensorium， warranting us to dig deeper and unmask HIV disease and a low CD4 cell count， thus helping us clinching the diagnosis of infratentorial presentation of PML.**\n\n【12】**Conclusion： Isolated medullary involvement in PML is an even rarer presentation of this rare disease seen in immunocompromised individuals.**\n\n【13】**Introduction**\n\n【14】**PML is alytic infection of oligodendrocytes and astrocytes seen in an immunocompromised host， caused by reactivation of JC virus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The neurological deficits correspond to areas of demyelination in the brain. The most frequently affected regions are the cerebral hemispheres at the periventricular and/or subcortical white matter 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Infratentorial presentation is rare and when occurs， is seen typically in the middle cerebellar peduncles and pons. Isolated medullary involvement is even rarer (5% to 7%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. We present a rare case of infratentorial PML mimicking a lateral medullary syndrome in an undiagnosed HIV patient.**\n\n【15】**Case Presentation**\n\n【16】**57 year old male， no known comorbidities， presented with dysarthria， dysphagia and imbalance for 5 days. Patient had a past history of COVID pneumonia 3 weeks ago and was treated with oxygen with mask and remdesivir.**\n\n【17】**Patient had scanning speech and dysphagia， more to liquids. Examination revealed right gaze evoked nystagmus with right limb ataxia， with impaired tandem gait and swaying towards right side. MRI brain revealed multifocal areas of diffusion restriction and FLAIR hyperintensity involving the right half of thelateral medulla，left frontal and parietal lobes and right parietal lobe.MRI angiogram was normal .**\n\n【18】**_Citation：_**\n\n【19】**2D echo did not reveal any abnormality， and patient was discharged on dual anti-platelets and statins with a Ryle's tube.**\n\n【20】**After 3 weeks， patient presented with worsening of dysphagia and imbalance with visible tachypnea， pooling of oropharyngeal secretions and hypoxia. Patient needed elective intubation for airway protection. Repeat MRI showed expansion of right medullary lesion with FLAIR hyperintensity with peripheral diffusion restriction and a new frontal hyperintensity， involving subcortical U fibers with a sharply demarcated peripheral border and an ill-defined inner border， without contrast enhancement .**\n\n【21】**HIV by ELISA was detected to be positive with CD4 count 155 cells/ml. Serum toxoplasma IgM was negative. CSF showed protein 94 mg/dl， sugar 53 mg/dl with parallel blood sugar 98 mg/dl with2 cells， no atypical cells were noted.**\n\n【22】**Figure 1： MRI brain axial images (A， B， C-DW sequences； D， E，F-ADC sequences and G， H， 1-T2 FLAIR sequences) showing multifocal areas of diffusion restriction and FLAIR hyperintensity involving the right half of the lateral medulla， left frontal and parietal lobes and right parietal lobe. MR Angiogram (J-intracranial vessels and K-neck arteries) was normal.**\n\n【23】**The characteristic MRI picture and HIV positive status with low CD4 cell count pointed towards possibility of PML. Hence CSF John Cunningham Virus PCR was ordered and it turned out positive. Unfortunately， patient succumbed due to progressive brainstem involvement.**\n\n【24】**Discussion**\n\n【25】**PML is a white matter disease of immunocompromised host with predominant fronto-parietal involvement. It has been observed in a variety of immunocompromised states like HIV， SLE； post-chemotherapy， chronic kidney disease etc 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.**\n\n【26】**In a case report by Finelli et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>， misdiagnosis of PML as a stroke mimic was discussed， with case details of two patients who turned out to be HIV positive at a later date. One of these patients had a transient ischemic attack with retrospective evaluation of MRI showing subcortical white matter changes. The other patient had a left thalamic and left parietal lesion that was treated as a chronic infarct， with a diagnosis of a cryptogenic stroke. Both patients were**\n\n【27】**reevaluated at a later date in view of progressive worsening of clinical deficit and had a poor outcome.**\n\n【28】**Infant et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u> have reported a single case of infratentorial PML mimicking an acute ischemic stroke in a patient of chronic lymphocytic leukemia.**\n\n【29】**Initial presentation of PML as predominanttmedullary involvement mimicking lateral medullary syndrome was also observed in another case report by Durafort et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u> in a patient undergoing hemodialysis. This report highlighted the possibility of PML in an unconventional immunocompromised state such as chronic kidney disease.**\n\n【30】**Similar to this scenario， our patient did not have a known immunocompromised condition atpresentation， delaying the diagnosis of HIV and initiation of ART. The clinical presentation of bulbar weakness and ataxia with gaze evoked nystagmus coupled with a history of COVID pneumonitis in recent past prompted the consideration of a lateral medullary infarct. This clinical suspicion was further strengthened by the diffusion restriction in right lateral medullary lesion. As with other cases described in the literature， progressive worsening of bulbar weakness and sensorium prompted a repeat imaging and search for other etiologies.**\n\n【31】**In 2012， Liu et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u> have published an article from a neuroradiologists’ perspective of stroke mimics. They mention.1Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease CJD， PML and Herpes encephalitis as infections mimicking stroke clinically and radiologically. They noticed that an ADC bright signal in the diffusion restricted lesions should alert the clinician against the diagnosis of infarct.**\n\n【32】**MRI hasa superior sensitivity in the detection2and characterization of PML lesions though the diagnosis may be suspected by CT scan 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. However the diffusion restriction observed in PML lesions can mimic an infarct. On TiW sequence， the lesions are hypointense， due to apoptosis of virus infected oligodendorcytes. There may be an incomplete hyperintense rim on pre-contrast T1W images， representing lipid laden macrophages at the advancing edge of the lesion. T2 W images the lesions appear hyperintense due to demyelination， and typically involve the periventricular and subcortical white matter， having scalloped lateral margin when they involve the subcortical white matter predominantly in the parieto-occipital lobes. Lesions are more conspicuously visualized in the T2FLAIR sequences， appearing hyperintense against a background of suppressed CSF signal intensity. Mass effect is infrequently described and usually minimal and correlation with shorter survival when seen on initial studies. The pattern may be unilateral， but more often bilateral and asymmetrical with involvement of posterior fossa. PML may also involve the basal ganglia and deep white nuclei as there are white matter fibers in these regions. The lesions typically do not enhance as the blood brain barrier is intact. There have been some reports ofperipheral mild or diffuse enhancement suggestive of good immune response and hence improve prognosis. There have been reports with lesions having cystic component suggesting tumors or abscess4.**\n\n【33】**The CSF biochemistry and cytology is normal. Our patient showed raised proteins with normal sugar and no cellularity. In CSF， detection of JC virus by PCR is diagnostic. The sensitivity is 70% and specificity is 90% to 100%. If the PCR for JC virus is negative in a scenario with high degree of suspicion， a repeat CSF examination or brain biopsy is advocated which confirms the diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.**\n\n【34】**Figure 2： MRI brain during second admission. Axial images (A， B， C-DWI； D， E， F- ADC； G， H， I-T2 FLAIR；J，K，L-T1W pre-contrast and M， N， O-T1W post-contrast sequences) showed expansion of right medullary lesion with peripheral diffusion restriction and FLAIR hyperintensity with new frontal white matter hyperintensities， invalving subcartical U fibers with a sharply demarcated peripheral border and an ill-defined inner barder. None of the lesions showed any contrast enhancement.**\n\n【35】**Infratentorial involvement in PML is rare， till now 5 to 6 cases have been documented with brainstem/cerebellar involvement as a presenting feature of PML 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Typically， middle cerebellar peduncle， pons and cerebellum is involved clinically and radiologically. Pontine lesions may extend to the midbrain and medulla. Isolated medullary lesions are uncommon (5% to 7%). There is a single case report with bilateral medullary lesion by Matthew et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Our patient had a unilateral lateral medullary involvement， which gradually progressed to involve medial structures engulfing the cardiac and respiratory centers.**\n\n【36】**The delay in diagnosis of PML due to its presentation like a stroke mimic has been discussed by Finelli et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>， advising screening of all suspected stroke patients to be screened for HIV.**\n\n【37】**Conclusion**\n\n【38】**PML is an important differential for a stroke mimic， both clinically and radiologically. Characteristic MRI features help distinguish between these two clinical entities with separate treatment approaches.

It is characterized by a highly aggressive clinical course with a median survival of 15 months. PCGDTCL involves the subcutaneous fat and can often mimic both clinically and histologically other more indolent conditions such as Cytophagic Histiocytic Phagocytosis (CHP) and Subcutaneous Panniculitic T-Cell Lymphomas (SPTCL). In addition， diagnosis of PCGDTCL can be challenging due to aberrant expression of surface markers in the neoplastic cells and varied histologic presentation and multiple biopsies are required to make a correct diagnosis. This is a case report that the initial histopathologic findings were most consistent with CHP but with a very aggressive and uncommon clinical course and with extreme subcutaneous ulcerations.**\n\n【20】**Introduction**\n\n【21】**Cytophagic Histiocytic Panniculitis (CHP) lesions show histiocytic infiltration of adipose tissue with hemophagocytosis and lymphocytic invasion \\[1，2\\]. The clinical course of CHP may be indolent with intermittent exacerbations or rapidly fatal heralded by fevers， hepatosplenomegaly， pancytopenia， coagulopathy， and transaminitis \\[2，3\\]. Non-fatal， indolent CHP is responsive to immunosuppressive therapy whereas fatal CHP often requires cytotoxic therapy \\[2，3\\]. The presentation of fatal CHP is similar to Subcutaneous Panniculitis-like T-Cell Lymphoma (SPTL) with differentiation made by the presence of malignant lymphocytes on histologic review of lesions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. However， initial biopsies of SPTL are often consistent with CHP suggesting that CHP represents an indolent lymphoid malignancy \\[3，4\\]. The following case illustrates an extreme clinical presentation of SPTL initially diagnosed as CHP.**\n\n【22】**Case Presentation**\n\n【23】**A 63-year-old Caucasian female presented with a month history of daily fevers up to 39.4C， night sweats， increasing fatigue， bilateral lower extremity edema and multiple erythematous lesions on her extremities and back. The patient reported she had similar symptoms of a milder nature one year prior， that had resolved spontaneously after six weeks without a diagnosis. At the time of presentation， the patient was a febrile and vitally stable. Multiple erythematous， patchy lesions with associated deep ulceration， necrosis， and subcutaneous nodular lesions were noted on the bilateral upper and lower extremities， left breast， and back . Cardiovascular， respiratory， and abdominal examinations were normal and without hepatosplenomegaly. Her course progressed rapidly over the next several months with aggressive， deep ulcerative lesions throughout her extremities， breast， and abdomen with ongoing intermittent fevers and progressive fatigue.**\n\n【24】**Initial blood work reported normal hemoglobin of 11.6 with giemsa smear showing microcytic hypochromic red blood cells and normal white blood cell and differential and platelet count. Iron studies were indicative of anemia of inflammation (Ferritin 1，188； Iron 44； TIBC 298 and Iron Saturation 15%). Markers of inflammation were elevated including CRP 7.9 and ESR 55. The patient had a mild transaminitis (AST 106， ALT 77) that spontaneously normalized on repeat laboratory work up.**\n\n【25】**Figure 1： Ulcerative Panniculitis， left distal， medial leg. Figure 4： Left Leg.**\n\n【26】**Figure 2： Left Breast.**\n\n【27】**Figure 5： Left Leg.**\n\n【28】**Figure 3： Left medial foot.**\n\n【29】**Figure 6： Healed Ulcerative panniculitic following chemotherapy.**\n\n【30】**Skin punch biopsy oflesions on upper and lower extremities were obtained from outside facility. Outside pathology of all three biopsies were read as squamous cell carcinoma with a co-existent lobular panniculitis. Second review of the original pathology was read as ulcer and atypical squamous proliferation with lobular panniculitis and interface dermatitis. Repeat biopsies were completed due to high suspicion of possible SPTL， but the pathology confirmed a lobular panniculitis composed predominantly of epithelioid histiocytes with phagocytosis of red blood cells. There were also small lymphocytes and karvorrhectic cells. Normal CD4：CD8 ratio with histiocyvtic predominance did not support a typical lymphoma diagnosis. Overall， these findings were reported suspicious for Cytophagic Histiocytic Panniculitis (CHP). No malignant or infectious processes were appreciated on complete pathologic stains.**\n\n【31】**cardiolipin antibody， C-ANCA， P-ANCA， smooth muscle antibody， alpha-1-antitrypsin enzyme， angiotensin converting enzyme， and interleukin-2 receptor. However， mitochondrial antibodies were elevated at 1.31 with normal index value <0.91 and lipase was only mildly increased at 196. D-dimer was elevated at 1，214 ng/mL and fibrinogen was 556 ng/dL. Infectious disease and rheumatologic consults were obtained， both felt that an infectious or rheumatologic underlying process were unlikely.**\n\n【32】**Work-up for an underlying neoplastic process was performed. Computed Tomography (CT) of the chest， abdomen， and pelvis with contrast was obtained which noted mildly enlarged lymph nodes throughout the abdomen， pelvis， lower neck， mediastinum， and left axilla. Fat stranding of the subcutaneous soft tissues of the abdomen and pelvis and left breast were also reported. Mammography was reported as negative for malignancy.**\n\n【33】**Work-up for underlying causes ofCHP was performed. Infectious etiologies including HIV， EBV， CMV， Hepatitis B， Hepatitis C， Syphilis， andTuberculosis were excluded. Autoimmune and Vasculitis work-up was negative including Anti-Nuclear Antibodies(ANA)， SS-A/Ro and SS-B/La antibodies， Beta-2-Glycoprotein，**\n\n【34】**While evaluating for underlying etiologies，the patient was actively being treated for aggressive CHP as she continued to have progressive**\n\n【35】**deep cutaneous ulceration/panniculitis and systemic symptoms. She was started on prednisone 40 mg per day and hydroxychloroquine200 mg twice daily for treatment of CHP. While this treatment course initially achieved mild improvement of skin lesions and edema， the patient developed progression of symptoms with visual disturbance， ptosis， and left eye discomfort. CT scan of the orbits showed an enlarged heterogeneous lacrimal gland without bony erosion or fat stranding. The patient was changed to prednisone 60 mg per day with cyclosporine 500 mg per day. The patient experienced disease progression on this regimen， and then she was initiated on Anakinra100 mg subcutaneously daily.**\n\n【36】**Due to a worsening disease course despite immune suppression and concern that CHP may be masking and underlying SPTL， repeat multiple skin biopsies were obtained. The previous biopsies did not show abnormal T cells and PCR studies for TCR gene rearrangement were inconclusive. A final set of skin biopsies were then obtained. Pathology confirmed lymphocytes positive for CD3， TCR delta， CD56， and TIA positive， CD4， and CD8 negative. PCR identified a clonal TCR gamma gene rearrangement. These findings were consistent with Subcutaneous Panniculitis T-Cell Lymphoma(SPTL) gamma/delta type (Primary Cutaneous Gamma/Delta T-Cell Lymphoma (PCGDTCL)) presenting as cytophagic histiocytic panniculitis. Anakinra was discontinued and patient was referred to bone marrow transplant for further management. She received six cycles of EPOCH regimen with excellent response and healing of the large， deep cutaneous ulcers . She is currently receiving Pentostatin and being prepared for allogenic stem cell transplantation.**\n\n【37】**Discussion**\n\n【38】**Cytophagic Histiocytic Panniculitis (CHP) presents as ulcerating nodules or plaques based in the subcutaneous fat without antecedent infection \\[1，2\\]. CHP is defined histologically by infiltration of subcutaneous adipose tissue by benign appearing cytophagic macrophages and T-cell lymphocytes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1-3\\]</u>. The course of CHP may be indolent or aggressive with a fatal hemophagocytic disorder \\[3，5\\]. As in this case， an initial benign course can progress to a fatal hemophagocytosis \\[2，3\\]. This progression is often heralded by systemic findings including recurrent pyrexia， pancytopenia， consumptive coagulopathy and hemodynamic instability \\[2，3，5\\]. This patient did not have any cytopenias， liver or spleen abnormalities or a consumptive coagulopathy. Her clinical course was unusual in that she had a mild form of the disease one year prior that became latent.**\n\n【39】**Then， she developed progression of symptoms starting with cycling of fevers， fatigue， and multiple， large deep subcutaneous ulcers are not commonly seen to this extent in panniculitis. In addition， she developed orbital involvement that is also a rare finding in primary cutaneous gamma/delta T-cell lymphoma.**\n\n【40】**The systemic symptoms of aggressive CHP are also noted in SPTL通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Differentiation of CHP and SPTL is classically based on histologic findings， with SPTL displaying neoplastic T cell infiltrate into subcutaneous tissue involving fat septate and lobules \\[2，6\\]. However， a dominant benign inflammatory cell population accompanies neoplastic lymphocytes in SPTL， potentially obscuring them 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Furthermore， as documented in this case， initial biopsies of SPTL may be more consistent with CHP\\[3，6\\]. Thus， an indolent course of CHP with histology interpreted as benign cannot be assumed non-fatal， as neoplastic transformation or a missed diagnosis may occur 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.In addition， the heterogeneity of the lymphoma can make this diagnosis more difficult to confirm.**\n\n【41】**T-cell gene rearrangements have been examined in an attempt to definitely differentiate CHP from SPTL. Though T-cell monoclonal rearrangements are more frequently associated with SPTL， they have also been noted in CHP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Furthermore， T-cell clonality is sometimes observed in benign conditions， and therefore is a poor diagnostic marker 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. EBV positivity has also been studied with latent infection noted in both CHP and SPTL 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.**\n\n【42】**Given the similarity of clinical presentation， the lack of definitive molecular tests， and the transition of presentation， CHP and SPTL may be better characterized as a clinical spectrum rather than separate entities. This case provides excellent illustration of such disease progression and heterogeneity in the pathologic specimens. Maintaining a high suspicion of the development or an underlying cutaneous lymphoma is warranted in these rare cases. In addition， this case provides a reminder that patients with initial diagnoses of indolent CHP should be carefully monitored for neoplastic disease.

One of the most cutting-edge fields that show these changes is the interdisciplinary science of medical image processing. Approaches in this rapidly evolving field enable the entire data flow in modern medical imaging systems， from raw data collecting to digital image transfer. These systems now offer ever-increasing spatial and intensity resolutions as well as faster collecting times， resulting in a vast volume of high-quality raw image data that must be carefully processed and reviewed for correct diagnostic results.**\n\n【12】**Imaging in medicine has improved the quality of life for an uncountable number of people， and this trend is only going to continue. It is extremely important to recognize diseases in their early stages. If have reason to feel that something is wrong with the body， must undergo the diagnostic scans to find out whether or not there is cause for concern. It could very well end up saving our life.**\n\n【13】**Medical imaging techniques are incredibly useful for the diagnosis of many of the cancers such as cervical， brain， breast， leukemia blood cells etc. To increase a patient’s chances of surviving such a dreadful disease， it is crucial that they receive a diagnosis at the earliest feasible time. Medical imaging techniques enable the diagnosis of tumors at progressively earlier stages.**\n\n【14】**Currently， in the field of medical area nanotechnology has evolved rigorous applications and it is being applied to the development of novel imaging techniques for medical purposes. It is highly probable that the development of nano-scale imaging will advance medicine by enabling the creation of more comprehensive images of the activities of cellular components. The capabilities of currently existing medical imaging equipment are being enhanced so that they can be utilized at the nanoscale more effectively. In addition， contrast agents are being developed to facilitate the monitoring of implanted nanoparticles throughout the body. Especially， nanoparticle implantation helps in cancer like diseases to cure the particular area proliferated in the body instead of affecting other parts through the oral medicines. It can also apply in the process of protein detection， optical coding and cell manipulation etc.**\n\n【15】**_COm_**\n\n【16】**Molecular imaging agents based on nanoparticles are currently being manufactured. These nanoparticles will reveal whether there are mutations in cancer-causing genes or how tumor cell's function. It has been demonstrated that nanoparticles can be emploved therapeutically as anatomical structural contrast agents. This information can be used to suggest a treatment plan or modify an existing one. By altering their properties in response to biological stimuli or processes，bioactivatable nanoparticles serve as dynamic recorders of in vivo conditions， revealing how diseases evolve and the efficacy oftreatments.**\n\n【17】**In the fight against cancer， early detection is tantamount to gaining a decisive advantage. The development of new molecular contrast agents and materials， made feasible by nanotechnology， offers the path for an earlier and more accurate initial cancer diagnosis as well as continuous monitoring of cancer treatment. There are already a number of nanoparticle-based medical screenings and diagnostics available on the market. The most prevalent usage of nanoparticles， however， is in thetreatment of a wide range of medical conditions， including stomach and intestinal diseases， nerve and intestine obstructions， and many more can be captured by the capsule cameras.**\n\n【18】**For cancer prevention， nanodevices designed to capture blood-borne biomarkers are being explored. Biomarkers include cancer-associated proteins， spread around the tumor cells， tumor DNA， and exosomes produced by the tumor. Sensors enabled by nanotechnology are capable of readings with high sensitivity， specificity， and multiplexing. The next generation of diagnostic**\n\n【19】**technologies combines sample collection with genetic analysis to improve understanding of a patient's cancer， potential treatments， and disease progression.**\n\n【20】**In the field of image acquisition，hardware advances that improve the quality of raw data and increase its informational value are favorable. Integrated front-end solutions offer quicker scan times， higher resolutions， and unique structures， such as CT/PET/X-ray， ultrasound/mammography，and PET/MRI combination systems. An accurate automatic prediction based on the image processing faces many challenges like time consumption，efficiencythrough numerous trending technologies such as machine learning algorithms like naive Bayes， KNN， SVM etc. and deep learning algorithms such as CNN， RNN，LSTM，GAN (Generative Adversarial Networks)，RBFN(Radial Basis Function Networks)，SOM (SelfOrganizing Maps) are working in a way. This process involves particular steps like pre-processing， feature extraction， segmentation classification etc. Similarly， visual images face， expressions etc. and other images like EEG plays an imperative role in the fields of cognitive science and neuroscience to predict the behavior of the people. It is an admitted fact that despite giving good results， still we are unable to introduce fully in real-time applications as giving challenges in many aspects.**\n\n【21】**The most trending technologies like quantum computing and cloud storage can address the challenges which are given by existing systems over the year in terms of time complexity and massive storage. In fact， the results in some cases that take few years will be made in seconds. The imagery which is captured through the edge cutting technologies can be stored in the cloud. Due to these unparalleled services of aforementioned technologies on image processing brings the quality life nearer to the human life with the faster and pure services. Most of the largest countries are making the massive investments in the fields of above to solve the challenges towards the many fields in the society such as health care， finance， security， technology， forecasting etc.**", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

The true incidence is unknown. The available estimates in literature report the range from 1/1800 to 1/2500of all caesarean delivery performed \\[3，4\\]. The only risk factor is one or more previous caesarean sections. Vaginal bleeding of different degrees may be the first sign of a caesarean scar pregnancy， while pain is usually not a typical presenting symptom. Often the patient is asymptomatic and it is diagnosed when detected by the US. First-line imaging modality to diagnose caesarean pregnancy is transvaginal US especially in early pregnancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. The initial and early US (between 5 and 7weeks) are critical to avoid misdiagnosis. The differential diagnoses are： cervical pregnancy and a miscarriage in progress. US diagnosis criteria are： empty uterine cavity and emptyendocervical canal with detection of an early gestational sac and/or placenta in close proximity of the hysterotomy scar/niche， an absent or thin myometrial layer between the gestational sac and the anterior uterine wall and an abundant peri-trophoblastic blood flow at Doppler examination 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. In advanced pregnancy(above 12 weeks)， the US may not be decisive and final diagnosis is possible only during surgery. Moreover magnetic resonance imaging may also be useful in CSP diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>， but the US provides the precise diagnosis in almost all cases with no need for additional modalities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. If the pregnancy continues it may develop a placenta accreta or percreta， and it may cause very several outcomes that require lifesaving surgical procedures， such as vaginal or intra-abdominal bleeding， uterine rupture， hysterectomy and shock \\[5，7\\]. The optimal management of CSP has not been completely clarified yet 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. The commonest clinical practice is to offer termination of pregnancy to avoid the consequences of this condition \\[7-91.**\n\n【13】**Materials and Methods**\n\n【14】**A 25-year-old Sri Lanka woman， GP 1001， presented herself to Pontedera Hospital for blood loss at 6+6 weeks of amenorrhea with urine pregnancy test positive. She was sent to Pisa Hospital because it was finding a heterotopic pregnancy and one of the two gestational chambers was on the hysterotomy site of the previous caesarean. The woman did a caesarean section an year before in Sri Lanka. The pregnancy was studied with transvaginal and abdominal ultrasound exam that described：“Anteverted uterus， inside which is displayed a 21 mm gestational sac on the bottom with a single embryo with BCE， 7 mm CRL and biometry corresponding to 6+2 weeks. Area of organized hematoma of 42 mm x 37 mm. Another gestational sac of 18 mm at isthmic level that reaches the hysterotomy scar， with a single embryo with BCE， 5 mm CRL. The thickness of the myometrium above the scar is regular and not invaded by the trophoblast.\" Pregnancy arising on**\n\n【15】**the hysterotomy site was very dangerous for the mother and for the pregnancy itself. As pregnancy progressed， it could cause uterus rupture with consequent loss of the second gestational chamber and risk of death for the mother. Furthermore， between the two gestational chambers there was a large hematoma of unclear origin (detachment area?) which was probably the cause of the woman’s blood loss. The patient was hemodynamically stable. At first we waited three days to monitor the conditions of the woman and the twin pregnancy. The maternal blood loss progressively stopped， the two embryos grew regularly， both had a heartbeat and the hematoma between them remained stable compared to previous checks. The woman wished to continue with the intrauterine pregnancy， so we proposed her to perform selective voluntary abortion of the embryo located on the previous hysterotomy site. This attitude was intended to preserve the other pregnancy and to avoid bad consequences for the mother but it was not without risk. The abortion of the first embryo would have eliminated the risk of a future uterus rupture but could also lead to the abortion the second fetus. To carry out the abortion we decided to use aspiration of part of the sac contents and the injection of 2% KCl inside the gestational chamber because it minimizes the risks posed to the coexisting intrauterine pregnancy. We decided to abort the pregnancy on the caesarean scar but to leave the residual gestational sac in place to let it reabsorb on its own because removing it could cause the loss of the other pregnancy.**\n\n【16】**The operation was performed with local anesthesia and sedation. After a thorough disinfection of the vagina and external genitalia， the Criyagen transvaginal ultrasound probe was inserted and highlighted the two gestational chambers， one of which on the hysterotomy site and the hematoma organized between them. An oocyte retrieval needle was inserted through the posterior vaginal fornix with which5 cc of intracavitary fluid were aspirated and 1 cc of intracardiac KCl2 mEq/mL solution was injected into the embryo in the isthmus. We saw the arrest of the ECB of the embryo. At the end of the procedure， in the US exam the heartbeat of the embryo on the bottom was present .**\n\n【17】**After the procedure we carefully monitored the woman with serial clinical， blood chemistry and transvaginal ultrasound checks. The days after there was minimal blood loss that stopped after a few days. At the US exams was described on the bottom of the uterus a single embryo with BCE， increasing CRL corresponding to the weeks.**\n\n【18】**Figure 2： Gestational sac on the bottom.**\n\n【19】**Figure 3： Injection of intracardiac KCI 2 mEq/mL solution through an oocyte retrieval needle.**\n\n【20】**On the previous hysterotomy site there was a residual gestational sac in resorption. The thickness of the myometrium above the scar was regular and not invaded by the trophoblast. Upon discharge， the mother was sent back to normal pregnancy management by Pontedera Hospital. The pregnancy continued regularly， the growth of the remaining fetus was regular. The patient underwent an elective caesarean section at Lucca Hospital at 39 weeks and the fetal outcome was excellent.**\n\n【21】**Result and Discussion**\n\n【22】**The optimal management of CSP has not been completely clarified yet 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. It is a common clinical practice to offer termination of pregnancy in view of the reported high rate of morbidity associated\\[2，7，8\\]. Iftheembryohas noheartbeat， it can followa waitingprocedure because a spontaneous abortion could occur. If the heartbeat is present it is better to perform an interruption of pregnancy because the risks of uterus rupture and other complications become greater通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. There are pharmacological treatments and surgical treatments. Operative methods include laparotomy， uterine artery embolization， hysteroscopy and curettage with suction. Dilatation and curettage with subsequent intrauterine Foley catheter insertion may be simple**\n\n【23】**and effective but it is not recommended because it carries significant risk of bleeding and of secondary hysterectomy with fertility loss通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Pharmacological treatment options include systemic or local administration of Methotrexate (MTX)， local administration of hyperosmolar glucose solution， chloride potassium， prostaglandin or combination of the medications. These substances can be used in laparoscopic assistance or directly injected into the gestational sac. Some authors reported local or systemic methotrexate administration as a most effective treatment but systemic methotrexate treatment can’t be used on the routine due to relatively low efficacy (fibrous tissue is poorly vascularized and drug penetration is insufficient) and high risk of various adverse effects 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. It is believed that MTX treatment is effective when serum bHCG levels are lower than 5000mIU/ml 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12-14\\]</u>. Ultrasound imaging is not only used to diagnose but it is also used as a part of a combined approach. In fact， under ultrasound guidance， we can inject local methotrexate therapy in fetal sac (or both in fetal sac and in fetal pole) to end the pregnancyand to offer fertility preservation in asymptomatic pregnant patients without concomitant hemodynamic disorders 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. Ifthe CSP exceeding 3 cm， local methotrexate administration can be followed by laparoscopic or laparotomy surgical correction of the caesarean section scar通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. Promising results have also been obtained with the innovative HIFU technique that utilizes high intensity focused ultrasound通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. The most effective way to manage caesarean scar pregnancy is synchronous use of different treatment methods. The combination of local methotrexate with simultaneous aspiration of gestational tissues under ultrasound guidance seems one of the better and minimally invasive attitudes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. It is the technique that we choose：Intracavitary fluid was aspirated and 1 cc of intracardiac KCl 2 mEq/mL solution was injected into the embryo. We have been very careful to inject methotrexate only in CSP and we have tried to be minimally invasive： Not to break the gestation sac and not to stimulate uterine contraction or spontaneous expulsion to protect the other pregnancy. We couldn't use systemic methotrexate because there were two pregnancies. After this stage， the remaining gestational tissues could be removed hysteroscopically with later vascular coagulation of the implantation site. In our case the remaining gestational tissues couldn’t be removed without damaging the pregnancy on the bottom， so we decided to leave it in place and to have it reabsorbed over time. As time passed the gestational material gradually reabsorbed while the bottom pregnancy continued to grow steadily. With this combined minimally invasive approach we have therefore saved the woman's life and preserved her fertility.**\n\n【24】**Conclusion**\n\n【25】**A definitive consensus of CSP treatment hasn't established yet and the type of treatment method depends on many factors. It is necessary to adapt the treatment to each individual patient taking into account size of pregnancy， bHCG level， presence or absence of uterine continuity， patient’s hemodynamic state， other contemporary pregnancies and fertility preservation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>.**\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**1\\.

There are effective laser treatments for the prevention and therapy of OM， however， the lack of trained professionals difficult the use of this technique in Brazil's public hospitals， being necessary alternative treatments to circumvent this issue. Non-clinical studies conducted by our group to elucidate the mechanism of action of A. chica extract with further toxicity on genotoxicity and mutagenicity reports provided necessary data to apply for authorization to conduct clinical trial with the herbal gel containing 2.5%Arrabidaea chica Verlot standardized extract. The open-label clinical trial protocol aims to access safety issues of the herbal gel on oral mucosa of healthy research participants. This clinical trial was approved by the ethics committee of research in humans at the Faculty of Medical Sciences of University of Campinas (report no. 007891/2015). Results of this trial demonstrated that herbal gel is safe， which culminated in the approval of the phase 2 clinical studyprotocols.**\n\n【14】**Introduction**\n\n【15】**Clinical trials are a way to test new methods of diagnosing， treating， or preventing health conditions. The goal is to determine whether something is both safe and effective. Clinical trials take place in four different phases during which different questions are asked. Each phase provide evidence on safety and efficacy issues related to the intervention under study. Drug developments proceed throughout all four phases over a long period of time. With phase four being a surveillance phase after post marketing to monitor safety issues with broaden use. Phase I focuses on safety issues with participant groups that range from 20 to 100 research participants， generally with healthy individuals aiming to determine which is the highest dose humans can tolerate without serious side effects. Investigators monitor this phase closely to see the drug candidate's outcome on participants’health 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.**\n\n【16】**These studies are fundamental to identify new products for the relief of symptoms that cause patients suffering， seeking to improve patient’s life quality. Among diseases that are life-threatening with various side effects arising from treatment are neoplasia. Oral Mucositis (OM) is a frequent event in patients treated with radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy， which tends to appear in buccal and labial surfaces， the ventral surface of the tongue， the floor of the mouth， and the soft palate of patients. This side effect interferes in patient’s life quality since oral mucositis is associated with considerable pain and dysphagia which also complicates nutritional intake， increases susceptibility to infections， and leads to cancer treatment interruption， that has outcomes on total treatment increased cost 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2-6\\]</u>.**\n\n【17】**The Brazilian government published the RENISUS list that consist of plants that are of interest to further study for the purpose to apply in the public system of health (SUS) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Arrabidaea chica(Humb.& Bonpl.) Verlot， was included in this list as result of previous reports indicating healing and antiulcerogenic activity in preclinical studies \\[8，9\\].

In gastrointestinal tract mucositis and oral mucositis experimental models induced by5-fluoracil in mice and hamsters showed that animals treated with A. chica extract had an increase in survival lifespan in comparison with the negative control. Furthermore a decrease of diarrhea and increase of food intake was also observed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. Recently Wiziack Zago et al. reported that at low concentrations， A. chica extract showed promising cytoprotective effects against zoledronic acid induced damage.**\n\n【20】**These results contributed to the development of the phase I clinical study protocol with the objective of identifying possible adverse events and toxicity signs of the herbal medicine containing A. chica extract applied to healthy participants.**\n\n【21】**Clinical Experience with Phase 1Studies**\n\n【22】**In the order to evaluate the safety of an herbal gel containing 2.5%Arrabidaea chica Verlot standardized extract on the oral mucosa of healthy research participants a phase 1 clinical trial protocol submitted to the Research Ethics Committee (CEP) was developed. This clinical trial was approved by the ethics committee of research in humans at the Faculty of Medical Sciences of University of Campinas(report no. 007891/2015).**\n\n【23】**Twenty research participants were selected after laboratory， clinical， and dental evaluation. Ten men and ten women， who were framed within the concept of healthy individuals. Following Resolution 466 of December 2012 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>， participants signed the Informed Consent Form (ICF) before entering the open-label study carried out during 30 days. On May 19h， 2016， after medical， dental， and pharmaceutical anamnesis， 1 pump pack containing the herbal medicine (the study object) was dispensed. The herbal medicine was given to participants every 10 days within 30 calendar days.**\n\n【24】**The instructions were to use the gel three times a day， morning， afternoon， and night， in 4 different oral mucosa regions (palate， right and left cheek， under the tongue). Before each application， participants were guided to sanitize the oral cavity by brushing and flossing teeth with no further water and food intake for 30 min after product application. The participants remained in their routine activities and maintained their normal general diets.**\n\n【25】**Each participant had a paper file for registering any discomfort or pertinent observation， during the 30 days of gel application， such as burning， use of concomitant medication or even forgetting to apply the gel. Weekly， the participants were submitted to clinical pharmaceutical， medical， and dental evaluations. At the end of the30 days of gel application， all the participants repeated the laboratory tests which， together with the diary and the clinical annotations of the medical records were analyzed to evaluate the possible adverse events generated by the use of the herbal medicine.**\n\n【26】**There are no reports of adverse events found in the literature for the crude extract of Arrabidaea chica， therefore， for patient follow-up， the events described in the package insert of a mucoadhesive herbal gel already commercialized and prescribed for mucositis， such as dry mouth， rash， itching， coughing， redness in the face， among other hypersensitivity reactions that could arise were monitored. The extract's red coloring was also taken into account， since the extract could stain mucosa and teeth. Also any discomfort caused by the**\n\n【27】**texture of the gel associated with the sweet taste due to the natural sugars present in the extract was assessed regarding the presence of nausea and even vomiting at the time of application. For security monitoring purposes， the participants were monitored daily and any and every report thoroughly analyzed.**\n\n【28】**According to the report of all the at the application sites， the oral mucosa， as well as the nearby teeth， were stained with “bright”red， but after a few hours， this color was no longer visible. During the study，the following adverse events were observed：**\n\n【29】**\\* A participant， displayed throat inflammation after medical evaluation that was promptly treated with anti-inflammatory drugs， nevertheless this event after a thorough clinical evaluation was proven not to have relationship with the test medication.**\n\n【30】**\\* Complaint of migraine， from a participant after using the herbal medicine for the first time. As the first application of the gel was assisted by the research team， the medical and dental evaluation was immediate， where the use of an analgesic was advised. The second application was then carried out under the supervision ofthe research investigator and there was no further complaint. The adverse event， after clinical evaluations， therefore did not have relationship with the use of the gel.**\n\n【31】**\\* Report of unpleasant taste by a participant but without signs of nausea or rejection of the gel.**\n\n【32】**\\* A participant reported that the gel had better grip on the cheeks and felt a numbness in the region of the tongue. After dental evaluation， this reported event may be related to the use of the test medication.**\n\n【33】**\\* A participant reported pain in the dental arch after the tenth day of the study. Self-medicated with an analgesic and reported pain improvement. The day after the report， a dental evaluation was performed and this event was not related to the use of the test medication， but to a tension in the dental arch.**\n\n【34】**These results were submitted to the CEP， through a report for the evaluation of the execution of the study as well as of all medical， dental， and pharmaceutical clinical evaluations carried out and of the cases of the reported adverse events. The report was approved culminating in the development of the Phase 2 study protocol，which， after approval by the same ethics committee， is undergoing for the assessment of safety and efficacy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.**\n\n【35】**Conclusion**\n\n【36】**The complexity of developing a clinical protocol coupled with low financial investment in the areas of research on natural products discourages translational progress from pre-clinical to clinical phases. Therefore， herein insight to the importance of investing on the discovery of new products for the relief of patients' suffering， seeking life quality is a positive influence for the treatment of diseases of life-threatening neoplasia with the various side effects resulting from treatment. Furthermore， data provided herein permitted to apply for the ongoing phase II trial， stimulating research progress with products from natural sources.**\n\n【37】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**Acknowledgment**</u>\n\n【38】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**The authors would like to thank the pharmacist Ana Carolina Logatto Costa Cete for giving space in its compounding pharmacy， FarmaDrugPharmacyIHandling LTDA， to handlingthe**</u>\n\n【39】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**mucoadhesive gel.

While awaiting the remainder of his evaluation， the patient decided to light up a cigarette. This resulted in an immediate combustion reaction and significant facial burns. The emergency room team quickly removed the patient’s oxygen and extinguished the fire. The patient was noted to have facial， nasal， and oropharyngeal burns as well as edema.

Especially during the COVID-19 pandemic， a dedicated team of anesthesiologists to undertake the work of establishing artificial airways for severely infected people who require mechanical ventilation. This phenomenon is mainly due to the anesthesiologists havingthe most experienceintracheal intubation. It is undeniable that the anesthesiologist is necessary in the emergency airway management team in the hospital. However， many doctors have a misunderstanding and believe that the endotracheal intubation in-hospital onlyneeds to be completed by the anesthesiologist. In this text， we emphasize the task and role of the anesthesiologist in in-hospital airway management.**\n\n【12】**The point repeatedly mentioned in other departments is that tracheal intubation is a complicated and risky operation， and only doctors with rich experience can properly predict and deal with potentially difficult airways. As one sentence says，professional han dles professional affairs. Especially during the COVID-19 pandemic， the effect of a dedicated tracheal intubation team is significant on infection control. Skilled doctors can complete the intubation in the shortest time， and reasonable induction ofanesthesia can reduce the release of droplets and aerosols during operation. In addition， excellent anesthesia management can ensure that the critically ill patients with fragile lungs of survive from the hypoxic period before the artificial airway is established. The efforts of anesthesiologists have provided patients with safe and reliable in-hospital airway management， but it has also led to the dependence of other departments on anesthesiologists. People often don't realize that tracheal intubation is a technique that must be mastered in the training of residents. The lack of training and practical opportunities for tracheal intubation in many departments has led to young physicians being unskilled in this skill.**\n\n【13】**Anesthesiologists have practiced countless difficult airway cases in operating rooms for centuries. They have summarized the procedures and strategies for dealing with various special situations. These procedures have direct significance for the practice of endotracheal intubation， and most fatal risks can be avoided. At present， domestic experts， including Professor Wu-Hua Ma， spare no effort to promote and train the latest guidelines for airway management to general practitioners，but these courses are often unable to be used by them in practice. It is difficult to change the status quo of intubation in the hospital only from the education aspect， and their inherent concepts must be changed from the hospital management aspect.**\n\n【14】**In addition to physicians in other departments， some anesthesiologists also misunderstand their identities. Their role in airway management is not only as a tracheal intubation operator， but also as a manager for the patient’s entire period of airway management. For example， their job includes assessing the patient’s airway and cardiopulmonary function， choosing sedation and tracheal intubation methods， even include determining whether the patient really needs tracheal intubation. This kind of identity change anesthesiologists will have more initiative to avoid unnecessary intubation. Some decision to intubation only comes from specialist considerations. Anesthesiologists can provide more risk-avoidance options including supraglottic ventilation or tracheotomy.**\n\n【15】**As anesthesiologists’ work move to the operating room， except providing patients with operating techniques， they must also contribute more of their experience and wisdom in physiology and pathology. As an expert in airway management， anesthesiologists play a leading role in the in-hospital emergency airway management team， not just intubation. The team role requires experts from various disciplines to perfect its rationality， including otolaryngologists and emergency**\n\n【16】**doctors. Moreover， hospital managers should strengthen the training of basic skills for specialist physicians. Because in a hospital with a shortage of manpower， a dedicated emergency airway team is**\n\n【17】**extravagant. This requires specialists to have the ability to deal with the critical moment of the disease， rather than waiting for the help of the same busy anesthesiologist.**", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

These complications range from epistaxis and sinusitis to pneumothorax and pharyngo-esophageal perforation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. In a recent integrative review， eight case reports described the occurrence of esophageal and/or pharyngeal perforation related to the insertion of the NGT 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Here we report an unusual case of oropharyngeal perforation opposite the left tonsillar compartment while trying to insert a NGT tube under general anesthesia.**\n\n【11】**A 58-year-old woman with arterial hypertension Was scheduled for ar esophagogastroduodenoscopy to explore dysphagia. During the procedure， the patient presented with major facial emphysema without hemodynamic failure， leading to an emergency intubation. A chest scan was performed finding diffuse mediastinal emphysema， without visible perforation. Probabilistic antibiotic therapy was started with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. Due to the persistent suspicion of esophageal perforation， a new CT scan was performed. It found a nasogastric probe in the left para-pharyngeal space along the jugulo-carotid arteries following a probable perforation of the oropharynx opposite the left tonsillar compartment . There was a subcutaneous emphysema， pneumomediastinum and pneumoperitoneum of contiguity. However， a secondary esophageal perforation couldn’t be excluded， though not visible on the CT scan. The nasogastric tube was removed in the operating room by the ENT team. An endoscopic examination was realized， finding ulcerations of the oropharynx without visualizable entry point. Treatment with PPI was started and the initial antibiotic therapy was continued.**\n\n【12】**The patient was finally extubated after 14 days of mechanical ventilation under the cover of suitable analgesia， after corticosteroid systemic therapy. She also had antibiotic therapy with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and fluconazole for 14 days to cover a possible mediastinitis. After extubation， the evolution was quickly favorable on the ENT and respiratory level with complete weaning in oxygen，and withoutlaryngeal dyspnea. In terms offood， the ENT opinion recommended the abstention of oral food for at least 7 days， apart from the gelled water which is allowed， to help healing of the pharynx. On the infectious level， the patient was treated with cefepime for nosocomial _pneumonia caused by Serratia marcescens and Klebsiella oxytoca._**\n\n【13】**NGT tube insertion is considered a simple and innocuous procedure，yet it isassociatedwithsevereadverseevents. Complications can include perforation of the pharyngo-esophageal region. An iatrogenic parapharyngeal abscess in an eelective laparoscopic cholecystectomy， which developed after several attempts of NGT insertion， was reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Another case report described how a nasogastric tube perforated the posterior nasopharynx in the midline and had dissected along the posterior mediastinum entering the left pleural space and causing pneumomediastinum 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.Misplacing NGT tube occurs because of the lack of consensus on a standard method of this device insertion and placement assessment. Also monitoring the insertion of NGT tube with the help of technologies such as electromagnetic device or the endoscopy method is topical， in order to reduce the incidence of these iatrogenic avoidable complications.**\n\n【14】**Authors Contribution**\n\n【15】**Bernard Allaouchiche and Charles-Herve Vacheron have given substantial contributions to the conception or the design of the manuscript， Olivia Vassal and Florent Wallet to acquisition and interpretation of the data.

The diagnosis is usually made using cystoscopy with biopsy. Here we report a case about a tumor-like eosinophilic cystitis in a 36 vear old man.**\n\n【15】**Case Presentation**\n\n【16】**A 36 year old smoking man， with history of psoriasis since the age of 20， was admitted December2018 in our department with hematuria， suprapubic pain and frequency evolving for 2 months. The patient had no known an atopic disease nor drug allergies.**\n\n【17】**On physical examination he was afebrile and hemodynamically stable with hypogastric tenderness. He was passing hematuria with clots. Skin examination revealed erythema-squamous lesions on the elbows and knees. Blood Cell Count (BCT) showed neither eosinophilia nor anemia. Renal function was normal. Urinalysis showed no infection.**\n\n【18】**Computer Tomography (CT) scan  revealed a large budding lesion with a large implantation base without secondary lesion.**\n\n【19】**He underwent cystoscopy which found a large solid tumor on the right side of the bladder dome that was partialy resected. Pathology  reports on the tissue biopsy indicated dense and polymorphic inflammatory reorganization with eosinophilic predominance of the mucosa without signs of malignancy.**\n\n【20】**The diagnosis ofEC was retained. Postoperative recovery was unremarkable， urine was cleared， and corticosteroids 20 mg/daywere administrated for 4 weeks associated with topical corticosteroids. We performed a second cystoscopy for complete resection. A follow up 20 months later revealed an asymptomatic patient on the urological and skin level，and ultrasound examination and cystoscopy showed no evidence of disease recurrence.**\n\n【21】**Literature Review**\n\n【22】**Eosinophilic cystitis is an inflammatory condition defined as the infiltration of the bladder by eosinophilic cells.**\n\n【23】**The etiology of EC is still unknown， but some conditions were blamed， such as transitional-cell carcinoma，intravesicalimmunotherapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>，allergic diseases (asthma，rhinitis)，autoimmune diseases(psoriasis as in our case， coeliac disease)， certain medications (sulfonamide， cyclophosphamide) parasitic disorders， eosinophilic enteritis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u> and allergyto chromic catgut suture.

Cystoscopic abnormalities include inflammatory lesions (edema， erythema and velvety red lesions)， ulcerations and tumors. None is pathognomonic. Therefore，biopsy is needed to confirm the diagnostic. Basically， transmural inflammation predominantly with eosinophils is found， suggesting EC.**\n\n【30】**Cystoscopy in not only the gold standard in diagnostic， it has a major role in therapy， it allows transurethral resection of the lesions， preferably in the same time of taking biopsies \\[31.**\n\n【31】**Studies proved that the allergen eviction is a safe strategy to cure patients； therefore， we suggest that it's legitimate to try to find the allergen in cause by skin tests and specific immunoglobulin search.**\n\n【32】**Antibiotics are only recommended in case of a urinary tract infection or distension.

AIHA is a severe hematological manifestation ofCMV infection. AIHA is an erythrocyte (RBC) hematologic disorder that is rarely seen in infants and young children. Most cases are associated with viral or bacterial infection， but the immunologic events leading to hemolysis are poorly understood. We report two cases of infants who presented with severe anemia and CMV infection. The first infant had chronic refractory mixed AIHA and the second infant had anemia directly attributable to CMV infection.**\n\n【13】**Introduction**\n\n【14】**Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection presenting as severe anemia in infancy is rare. Auto-Immune Hemolytic Anemia (AIHA) is characterized by the presence of auto antibodies that bind to RBC membranes and lead to their premature destruction. It can be classified as primary or secondary AIHA. The latter is due to lymphoproliferative and autoimmune diseases， drugs， and severe injuries. Bacteria and viruses can be associated with AIHA in children \\[1，2\\]. Amongst its various hematological manifestations， Cytomegalovirus (CMV) can cause transient neutropenia with thrombocytopenia or more severe， such as AIHA and pancytopenia. We report two cases of infants who presented with severe anemia， thrombocytopenia， and CMV infection. The first infant had chronic refractory mixed AIHA and the second infant had severe anemia and thrombocytopenia directly attributable to CMV infection.**\n\n【15】**Case Series**\n\n【16】**Case 1**\n\n【17】**_Citation：_**\n\n【18】**A six-month-old male child born out of third-degree consanguineous marriage presented with new onset progressive paleness of the body and worsening respiratory difficulty in the last 20 days. He received 7 aliquots of packed RBC every 2 to 3 days in the past 20 days and was started on syrup prednisolone at 2 mg/kg/day with no response. His physical examination was remarkable for severe tachypnea (54/min)， tachycardia (166/min)， pallor， icterus with moderate hepatosplenomegaly. CBC at admission showed severe anemia with thrombocytopenia with a hemoglobin of 3.1 g/dl with a platelet count of 43，000/uL. The corrected total leukocyte count was 18，600/uL with 30%neutrophils， 68% lymphocytes， and 2% myelocytes and metamyelocytes each. Peripheral smear showed numerous spherocytes with reticulocytosis of 23%. There was indirect hyperbilirubinemia， LDH was 2150 U/L and Direct Coombs Test (DCT) was strongly positive (4+). DCT positivity was due to IgG (titer ≥ 1000) of subclasses IgG1 (titer >100) & IgG3 (titer >100) coating the red cells along with C3d， a very weak coating with IgM was also seen. A diagnosis of AIHA was made. Serologic and virologic testing revealed CMV IgM and CMV IgG positive. CMV PCR blood and urine showed 200 copies and 2120 copies， respectively. Flow cytometry for double negative TCRaB+T cells was negative.**\n\n【19】**He was started on intravenous ganciclovir (dose calculated as 3 x BSAx Creatinine clearance) daily for 10 days. He also received IVIg at 1g/kg daily for 2 doses with methylprednisolone at 2 mg/kg for 3 days followed byprednisone at 2 mg/kg for 2 weeks followed by a slow taper of 0.25 mg/kg/week. At discharge he was shifted to Valganciclovir. His hemolysis continued with persistent requirement of blood transfusion. He had a poor response to steroids and was started on weekly rituximab at375 mg/m. Peripheral blood PCR for CMV DNA came negative after 3 weeks of valganciclovir. His hemoglobin stabilized at 10.8 g/dl， platelet count normalized， LDH was 568 U/， and bilirubin was**\n\n【20】**0.8 mg/dl after 3 weeks of rituximab.Steroids were slowlytapered and stopped as he was in complete remission. He relapsed after 2 months of stopping steroids and 6 months after rituximab therapy. He was restarted on steroids followed by mycophenolate mofetil at a dose of400 mg/m’as the steroid sparing agent. He started responding within1 month and the steroids were tapered slowly and stopped. At his last visit to the OPD in June 2021，he was 1 year and 8 months of age， his parameters were- hemoglobin 14 g/dl， LDH 368U/L， bilirubin 0.53mg/dl.MMF is planned to be tapered slowly .**\n\n【21】**Case 2**\n\n【22】**A five-month-old male child was symptomatic from 2 months of age with pallor， decreased activity with decreased feeding. There was no history of fever， jaundice， or any bleeding. He had received 4 PRBC transfusions in the past 2 months. On examination he had pallor with moderate hepatosplenomegaly. Blood investigations revealed hemoglobin of 3.9 g/dl， normal total leukocyte count of 17100/uL， platelet count of 23，000/uL， and absolute reticulocyte count 45，000/uL. His serum bilirubin was 2.3 mg/dl， with indirect bilirubin 1.3 mg/dl， LDH was 590 U/L. DCT was negative. A bone marrow biopsy was done and revealed marked erythroid hyperplasia with unremarkable megakaryocytes and myeloid cells.**\n\n【23】**Presence of anemia with hepatosplenomegaly with hepatitis with marked erythroid hyperplasia in bone marrow， differential of thalassemia； CDA and infection related (TORCH) was kept. TORCH profile was positive for CMV IgM and IgG antibodies. CMV PCR revealed 2130 copies/uL. A diagnosis of CMV infection causing recurrent anemia was made. He was started on ganciclovir and received it for 18 days. He became transfusion independent and his liver and spleen regressed on ganciclovir.**\n\n【24】**Discussion**\n\n【25】**In this case series， we report two infants both with CMV infection with severe anemia， thrombocytopenia， and moderate hepatosplenomegaly. The cause of anemia in case 1 was mixed autoimmune hemolytic anemia and on the other hand， the cause of**\n\n【26】**anemia in case 2 was attributed directly to CMV infection. In both these cases， thrombocytopenia improved with treatment of CMV infection. The mixed AIHA in case 1 was steroid refractory and required rituximab as secondarytreatment， further during the course， relapsed and required steroid sparing immunosuppressive therapy(mycophenolate mofetil). We would be discussing case 1 in detail.**\n\n【27】**Heisel et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u> evaluated prognostic factors in childhood AIHA and concluded that there are two distinct varieties of AIHA in children， the acute disease generally occurred in 2 to 12 years of age， had a sudden onset of symptoms， showed low reticulocyte counts and had normal platelet counts. This acute disease variety responded well to steroids and the disease resolved within 6 months without mortality. On the other hand， children with chronic AIHA were generally less than 2 or greater than 12 years of age， had a more prolonged onset of symptoms， had increased reticulocyte counts， and had decreased platelet counts. These children with the chronic variety had a variable response to steroids， frequently requiring other modalities of treatment and had a mortality of 25%. It also seems to be the scenario as in case number 1，he had a poor response to steroids and relapsed 6 months after Rituximab， warranting maintenance of second line steroid sparing immunosuppressive therapy.**\n\n【28】**Literature was reviewed regarding CMV as the cause of AIHA in children. In the largest series of pediatric AIHA patients， Aladjidi et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>， we evaluated 265 children with AIHA and reported 6 patients with Cytomegalovirus as the causative agent for AIHA. Naithani et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>， reported 26 patients (range， 0.2 to 17 years) with AIHA. Secondary AIHA was seen in 9 (35%)patients， with only 1 patient with CMV as the etiology. Thatikonda et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>， in their study evaluating50 childhood AIHA patients， CMV was the causative etiology in 1patient only. In a study by Fan et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>，7 patients out of 68 cases were EBV/CMV positive. Few case reports of CMV with AIHA are reported \\[7，8\\]. All these studies suggest that CMV is a rare cause of AIHA in children. Comparing with adults， Rafailidis et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>， we performed a systematic review of 290 immunocompetent patients with severe CMV infection， 25 patients were found to have various**\n\n【29】**hematological manifestations among them only five were found to have hemolytic anemia， so AIHA secondary to CMV infection is a rare event in adults.**\n\n【30】**Efficacy of Rituximab in steroid refractory AIHA in children has been reported in small case series. Zecca et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>， reported data of fifteen children (range， 0.3 to 14 years) with AIHA who were given rituximab， 375 mg/m²/dose for a median of 3 weekly doses. Three responders relapsed at 7， 8 and 10 months after rituximab infusion. Quartier et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u> reported five children with refractory idiopathic AIHA who received rituximab. All children remained in complete remission for 15 to 22 months after receiving rituximab. In adult patients， the median duration of response after Rituximab is 20 months. In our case number 1， the infant started responding to rituximab after the 3 weekly dose but relapsed after 6 months. Rituximab use is associated with absence of circulating B cells and hypogammaglobulinemia，which have implications for vaccineefficacy especially in infants. Ideally inactivated vaccines should be completed at least 1 week prior， and any live-attenuated vaccines should be completed a minimum of 4 weeks prior to commencing treatment.

Immunosuppressive drugs， with the exception of cyclophosphamide， are an appropriate second-line treatment， as they can be used as steroid-protective drugs in steroid-dependent patients. Given that these drugs require a long time to elicit a response， in fact， they should be infused early with the help of powerful drugs， such as steroids. Mycophenolate mofetil， a potent inhibitor of the enzyme containing 5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase， is the most widely indicated in steroid-dependent patients to reduce the dose of steroids.

Therefore，this novel combination therapy may be an excellent alternative for the treatment of persistent or chronic autoimmune cytopenia's in the pediatric population. In our patient， MMF with steroids was started and the patient achieved complete response on MMF and steroids could be tapered. He tolerated MMF and had no side effects and remains in complete remission.**\n\n【32】**Conclusion**\n\n【33】**CMV infection should be considered when evaluating patients with severe anemia and thrombocytopenia. AIHA may be primary or secondary to other diseases， including infections， autoimmune**\n\n【34】**disorders， and malignancies. The mixed AIHA in our case was secondary to CMV infection. It was steroid refractory and relapsed after 6 months of rituximab therapy and received MMF as the steroid sparing immunosuppressive therapy. The patient had no side effects to MMF. MMF may be an excellent alternative for the treatment of chronic AIHA in pediatric patients. Vaccination should be carefully planned in children， especially infants receiving rituximab.**\n\n【35】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【36】通用结尾删除-1:<u>1\\. Heisel MA， Ortega JA.

While an additional in vasive diagnostic work up is sometimes warranted，it is not always feasible. Upon recognition of non-significant coronary artery disease further diagnostics， including coronary imaging and acetylcholine provocation testing for vasospastic angina， had to be delayed due to the arrival of another acute STEMI. Repeat coronary angiography was denied by the patient for now. Hence， potential differential diagnosis includes vasospastic angina， coronary artery dissection， plaque rupture/erosion or thromboembolism.

At present， it occurs in approximately 5% to 6%of cases with acute myocardial infarction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. However， there is a large variability in its reported prevalence (up to 15% in selected studies)， which may be attributed to the lack of a universal definition of the disease. The introduction of the Fourth Universal Definition of myocardial infarction finally offered specific diagnostic criteria**\n\n【38】**for MINOCA， which were revisited by a scientific statement paper from the American Heart Association (AHA) in 2019 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. The three key diagnostic criteria for MINOCA include the presence of acute myocardial infarction (a rise and fall pattern of troponin and clinical evidence of ischemia)， non obstructive coronary arteries (including moderate coronary atherosclerotic stenosis of up to 50%) and the absence of an alternate diagnosis for the clinical presentation， such as sepsis， pulmonary embolism or myocarditis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.**\n\n【39】**Coronary angiography is the main diagnostic tool in the initial workup of patients with chest pain and myocardial infarction. After exclusion of significant coronary artery stenosis， coronary vascular imaging and coronary function assessment should be performed. Intra Vascular Ultra Sound (IVUS) and Optical Coherence Tomography(OCT) allow visualization of plaque disruption， coronary thrombi or emboli and coronary artery dissection. Provocation testing with intracoronary acetylcholine may help to facilitate the diagnosis of coronary vasospasm 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. While an acceptable level of safety has been reported recently for provocativetesting，significant arrhythmicevents occur in up to 6% of cases (including 3% ventricular arrhythmias) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. If coronary angiography remains inconclusive， left ventriculography should be performed to assess left ventricular function and look for wall motion abnormalities，resembling Takotsubo Syndrome or other cardiomyopathies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.**\n\n【40】**The following non-invasive diagnostic work-up should include echo cardio graphic assessment as well as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) in most cases. While availability is still a concern in some regions，cardiac MRI has emerged as a key diagnostic tool in the evaluation of patients with MINOCA. Myocarditis and Takotsubo syndrome， which is rather its own entity than a part of MINOCA， are the most frequent conditions mimicking MINOCA and can be diagnosed by MRI based on specific late gadolinium enhancement patterns and imaging findings 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.**\n\n【41】**Management of MINOCA is diverse and should be individualized based on the specific etiology， such as calcium channel blockers for vasospastic angina， antianginal therapies for micro vascular dysfunction， anticoagulation for coronary embolism and cardio protective therapy in accordance with current AMI guidelines for plaque disruptions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.**\n\n【42】**Conclusion**\n\n【43】**MINOCA is an important differential diagnosis in the work-up of patients with acute myocardial infarction.

Alzheimer's disease as a frequent neurodegenerative condition of the geriatric population demonstrates an estimated prevalence of 36.5 million in the Western world. Alzheimer's disease chiefly affects the brain although retina is often incriminated and typically displays a significant impairment of retinal neurovascular coupling. Degenerative alterations within the retinal ganglion incumbent to Alzheimer’s disease can be appropriately analyzed in order to categorize the incipient neurodegenerative process. As neuronal modifications are predominant in Alzheimer’s disease and mild cognitive impairment， cogent neuropathology and neuroimaging investigations can be beneficially employed to depict alterations arising within the adjacent， associated cerebral microvasculature \\[1，2\\].**\n\n【11】**Mild cognitive impairment depicts an enhanced probable emergence of Alzheimer’s disease. Thus， adequate clinical characterization ofthe disease is crucial with theenunciation of contemporary diagnostic parameters which indicate the transition of mild cognitive impairment to full blown Alzheimer's disease. Alzheimer’s disease is accompanied by minimizing of blood circulation within the deep-seated vascular plexus. Specific criterion of evaluating retinal vasculature can deliver significant information and provide beneficial biomarkers for assessing the preliminary or final diagnosis， monitoring transition of mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer’s disease or to predict disease progression \\[1，2\\].**\n\n【12】**Disease characteristics**\n\n【13】**Vascular alterations， as an intrinsic component or a coexistent pathology， can interrelate with pathogenic manifestations of Alzheimer’s disease such as neurodegeneration along with cognitive impairment in order to constitute the “vascular cognitive impairmentmanifestation. Pathological symptoms of the implicated vasculature are enunciated in around three fourths (75%) subjects with dementia. Vascular alterations are comprised of White Matter Hyper-intensities (WMHs) which appear on account of chronic ischemia of the sub cortical region with incrimination of miniature blood vessels， infarcts within vessels of higher calibre， appearance of lacunar infarcts as in the thalamus， coexistent arteriosclerosis and atherosclerosis and proportionate instances of Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy (CAA) \\[2，3\\]. Intravascular deposition of Amyloid Beta (AB) within the vessel wall is exemplified as cerebral amyloid angiopathy， a process which is accompanied by micro-hemorrhages and micro-infarcts. CAA demonstrates an incidence of roughly 20% to 40% within the non-demented elderly and approximately 50% to 60% in the demented geriatric population. Alzheimer's disease is intensely concurrent with cerebral amyloid angiopathy and can be discerned in a majority (85% to 95%) instances 2，3\\].**\n\n【14】**Disease pathogenesis**\n\n【15】**Declining cerebral blood flow and relevant modifications of the blood-brain barrier are incriminated in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer’s disease in association with a probable inopportune clearance of Amyloid Beta (AB) protein. Retina is contemplated as a pertinent generator of vascular biomarkers which can indicate the emergence of Alzheimer's disease. Retinal vasculature can be subjected to noninvasive imaging at miniature， micro-meter levels with various imaging modalities such as fund us photography， assessment of choroidal thickness with Enhanced Depth Imaging Optical Coherence Tomography (EDI-OCT) and Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography(OCTA) \\[3，4\\]. Alzheimer’s disease is a complex disorder and enunciates multifactorial aetiologies. Several factors are implicated in disease pathogenesis and progression and preliminary factors significantly contribute to a continuum of the deteriorative process. Aberrant， entangled Amyloid Beta (AB) protein filaments and hyper-phosphorylated tau protein are aggregated into**\n\n【16】**cogent neurofibrillary tangles. Accumulation of aforesaid debris can initiate a cascade of secondary manifestations such as inflammation， oxidative stress， vascular abnormalities or neuronal decimation. Disorganized miniature vascular structures of the brain are incumbent in the pathological evolution of Alzheimer’s disease and mild cognitive impairment. Aforesaid neurodegenerative conditions are accompanied by preliminary neurovascular dysfunction and a consequently dysregulated vascular flow which contributes to disease pathogenesis. Assessment of vascular density of peripheral ring of the macula along with cogent scoring of white matter hyper-intensities can be achieved with magnetic resonance imaging in Alzheimer’s disease \\[3，4\\]. Functional modifications appear as a preliminary reaction and commonly precede decimation of retinal neurons.**\n\n【17】**Proportion of Amyloid Beta (AB) protein exemplified in cerebrospinal fluid is concordant to degree of arterial dilatation. Elevatedlevels ofamyloid beta inthe cerebrospinalfluid are concurrent with superior neurovascular coupling. Percentage of vascular amyloid beta in combination with neurofibrillary morphological abnormalities are inversely concordant with Amyloid Beta (AB) and directly interrelated to phosphorylated- tau protein values within the cerebrospinal fluid. Thus， marked protein accumulation in the brain and retina can directly influence neurovascular coupling \\[4，5\\].**\n\n【18】**Confirmed instances of Alzheimer's disease can be denominated with specific biomarkers such as amyloid deposits discerned on Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scan. Additionally， Fractal Dimension of arteriolar network (FDa)， Central Retinal Vein Equivalent (CRVE)， Central Retinal Artery Equivalent (CRAE)， fractal dimension of venular network， Curvature Tortuosity of arterioles (cTORTa)， choroidal thickness， vessel density， Foveolar a Vascular Zone (FAZ) and curvature tortuosity of venules can be assessed in Alzheimer’s disease. Instances of primary vascular aetiology or the concurrence of a vascular co-pathology instead of features of Alzheimer's disease require demarcation. Alzheimer's disease contingent to amyloid deposition can depict alterations as detected with clinical， neuroimaging and fluid-based biomarkers. Variable choroidal thinning is cogitated on Enhanced Depth Imaging Optical Coherence Tomography (EDI-OCT) \\[4，5\\]. Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography (OCTA) employed for assessing dimensions of vascular density in amyloid-deposited Alzheimer's disease or within the Foveolar a Vascular Zone (FAZ) is identical in preclinical and clinical disease.**\n\n【19】**Tortuosity of venules is inversely concurrent with scoring of white matter hyper-intensities as discerned with Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Inverse correlation of macular vessel density and white matter hyper-intensities score in Alzheimer's disease can indicate modifications within the microvasculature as cogitated in chronic cerebral micro-infarctions. However， concurrence of parameters of retinal vascular assessment to indicative biomarkers of cerebrovascular fluid or Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) is lacking \\[5，6\\].**\n\n【20】**Clinical elucidation**\n\n【21】**A transitional phase of variable duration precedes the clinical emergence of symptomatic Alzheimer’s disease. Implicated geriatric individuals display a heterogeneous cognitive andfunctional impairment usually defined as beneath the symptomatic threshold of dementia. Aforesaid manifestation is denominated as“mild cognitive impairment”where incriminated subiects demonstrate an enhanced possible emergence of dementia， particularly Alzheimer’s disease.**\n\n【22】**Figure 1： Alzheimer's disease - modifications of cerebral vessels is concordant with modifications of retinal vessels.**\n\n【23】**Figure 2： Alzheimer's disease demonstrating variable pathogenesis with accumulation of amylaid beta and tau proteins.**\n\n【24】**Figure 3： Alzheimer’s disease with retinal vasculature mimicking the alterations of cerebral arteries.**\n\n【25】**The dementia characteristically depicts a severe decline of cognitive functions with ensuing socio-behavioral manifestations. Individuals with Alzheimer's disease can delineate symptoms such as visual impairment， narrowed visual field， dyschromatopsia， deficiency in contrast sensitivity， aberrant eye motility and modifications of visual-**\n\n【26】**Figure 4： Alzheimers disease depicting variaus mechanisms of generation with amyloid， p-tau， neuronal loss and inflammation.**\n\n【27】**evoked potentials \\[5，6\\].**\n\n【28】**Histological elucidation**\n\n【29】**Alzheimer’s disease demonstrates a decline in quantification of retinal ganglion cells and associated axons within the retinal nerve fiber layer. Reduction of retinal ganglion cells are contingent to occurrence of extracellular plaques and accompanying intracellular deposition of Amyloid Beta (AB) as enunciated within the retina of individuals with Alzheimer’s disease. Ganglion cell layer is attenuated within central and temporal regions in Alzheimer’s disease as discerned with Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT). Centric zone of the retina within the dimension of 0 mm to 2 mm is majorly(97%) composed of neurons and residual (3%) is constituted by displaced amacrine cells. Alzheimer’s disease maximally implicates the segment of retinal ganglion cells， designated as M-cells， which are principally aggregated within the temporal macula \\[1，2\\].**\n\n【30】**Amyloid Beta (AB) protein is aggregated within and surrounding the cerebral blood vessels， the circulation of which is challenging to investigate in vivo. Thus， evaluation of retinal micro-vasculature as a determinant of Alzheimer's disease is adopted although assessment of disease progression is limited. Retinal vessels can be considered as surrogate indicators of cerebral microcirculation， thus histological elucidation and imaging studies are beneficial.**\n\n【31】**Functional reaction of retinal vessels， as a component of cognitive impairment， is observed in Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment. Investigation with Dynamic Vessel Analyzer (DVA) demonstrates a characteristic response curve to flicker light impulse on account of primary vasodilation and secondary vasoconstriction， as exemplified in the aforesaid disorders. Vasodilation occurs as a consequence of stimulation of photoreceptors with a subsequently enhanced retinal blood circulation. The process which mediates aforementioned vascular response is denominated as “neurovascular coupling”\\[1，2\\]. Representation and amplitude of the typical biphasic response can categorically indicate the quality of auto-regulation. Comprehensive reduction of vessel response can significantly impact arterial vasodilation. As cerebral and retinal micro-circulation is reduced in Alzheimer’s disease， chronic hypo-perfusion can impair endothelial function along with production of nitric acid， which is critical for vasodilation.Declining vascular response arises on account of enhanced rigidity of retinal arteries and cerebral vasculature in Alzheimer’s disease in addition to a characteristically thickened**\n\n【32】**Figure 5： Alzheimer's disease with enunciation of amylaid pathway and tau pathway in disease pathogenesis.**\n\n【33】**basement membrane. Diminishing vascular response can also be secondary to neuronal degeneration with a consequently decreased metabolic requirement \\[5，6\\] .**\n\n【34】**In vestigative Assay**\n\n【35】**Although miniature cerebral vessel disease is incriminated in the generation of Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment， assessment of cerebral microcirculation is a challenging task. Cerebral and retinal vasculature is identical in embryology， origin anatomical and physiological properties. Thus， evaluation of retinal vessels can provide insights into the generation of Alzheimer’s disease and mild cognitive impairment. Functional and morphological characteristics of retinal vessels are contemplated as cogent indicators of disease progression. Decisive descriptions are contingent to fund us photography and contemporary techniques which permit pertinent， topographic， qualitative assay and quantitative assessment of magnitude of retinal vessels at varying levels of depth- resolution. Microvascular networks of retina， as discerned with uninvolved and disease-specific state， can be assayed with devices such as Dynamic Vessel Analyzer (DVA) and Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography (OCTA). However， evaluation of extensive functional and morphological characteristics of macular microvasculature in Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment is currently lacking\\[6，7\\]. OpticalCoherenceTomography Angiography(OCTA) delineates adequate morphological characterization of retinal and anterior choroidal blood vessels in the absence of a dye. Employment of OCTA demonstrates a superior depth resolution， superlative visualization of deep-seated vascular layers besides an amplified vascular elucidation of diverse ocular and systemic disorders. A competent Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) can be contemplated as a contemporary biomarker is discerning vascular alterations characteristic of Alzheimer's disease. Vascular alterations can also be assessed with recently elucidated biomarkers which can complement the currently applicable system designated as Amyloid(A)， Tau (T) and Neurodegeneration (N) or the ATN system \\[6，7\\]. Retinal vascular alterations of Alzheimer’s disease， as described with fund us photography， comprise of enhanced venous diameter， reduced arterial diameter and a decline in the fractional dimension. Additionally，choroidal thinning enhanced Foveolar Avascular Zone(FAZ) with a declining vessel density and blood flow is cogitated in clinical and preclinical Alzheimer's disease.**\n\n【36】**Ophthalmological enuinciation of associated， usually asymptomatic co-morbid conditions can impact retinal vascular magnitude. Thus， a comprehensive ophthalmological screening is recommended. Evaluation of retinal biomarkers in categorical instances of Alzheimer’s disease exemplify as cortical atrophy and occurrence of amyloid and tau protein in the cerebrospinal fluid. Also， application of amyloid Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scan can endorse the clinical diagnosis and permit comparison of contemporary biomarkers to existing “gold standards”\\[7，8\\]. Non invasive retinal vascular biomarkers for assaying Alzheimer's disease are constitutedbyenhanced CentralRetinalArteryEquivalent(CRAE)， reduced Central Retinal Vein Equivalent (CRVE)， diminished fractal dimension， minimal choroidal thickness， minimized vessel density and augmented Foveolar a Vascular Zone (FAZ). Interrelation of retinal vascular parameters with white matter hyper-intensities can also be examined with magnetic resonance imaging. Retinal vascular parameters are evaluated by fund us photography， EDI-OCT and OCTA.

In this case study we discussed about a 65 years old male patient received prolonged immunosuppression therapy emphasized on risk factors and the mechanisms which induces the reactivation of HBV and helps to understand and quantify the risk ofHBV reactivation and its consequences.**\n\n【12】**We report an observation of an immunodeficient patient in whom viral B reactivation occurred one year after renal transplantation.**\n\n【13】**Keywords： Reactivation of viral hepatitis B； Renal transplant patients； Immunosuppression**\n\n【14】**Introduction**\n\n【15】**Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) reactivation is defined as the increase in viremia (>1 log10 IU/ml) in a known patient with chronic or HBV-resolved infection. Since Covalently Closed Circular Deoxyribonucleic Acid (cccDNA) is not removed from the hepatocytes， any event affecting the immune status promotes viral reactivation， sometimes severe or even fatal.**\n\n【16】**Serological profiles combining significant titles of anti-HBs and anti-HBc antibodies have long been considered as serological scars indicating a former HBC viral hepatitis. However， the development of PCR techniques has revealed the persistence of the Hepatitis B genome (HBV)， which is a potential source of viral reactivation.**\n\n【17】**Case Presentation**\n\n【18】**Male patient aged 65， followed since 2005 for renal failure in the Nephrology department. In2010； the patient had received a kidney transplant. A pre-transplant assessment revealed a level of anti-HBs Antibody at 50 IU/ml associated with HBc Ab’s defining post-contact immunization against HBV.**\n\n【19】**One year after the kidney transplant， during which the patient has received immunosuppressive treatment， the evolution was marked by the appearance of hepatic cytolysis (ALAT： 230UI/ml). The markers of acute hepatitis A (anti-HAV IgM)， hepatitis E (anti-HEV IgM) and hepatitis C were negatives. Acute infection or reactivation of Herpesviridae (cytomegalovirus， Epstein-Barr virus， varicella-zoster virus， and Herpes simplex virus) has been eliminated. In contrast， the serology confirmed the diagnosis of active viral hepatitis B (positive HBs antigen and anti-HBc antibodies) with high viral replication confirmed by quantification of viral DNA using real-time PCR COBAS AmpliPrep/COBAS TaqMan HBV (8.45 log IU/ml； 284，000，000 IU/ml). The antigen and anti-hepatitis Delta antibody were negative. The diagnosis of reactivation of the hepatitis B virus in relation to immunosuppression was retained； the patient was put under Entecavir. The evolution was marked by a rapid biological response with un detectable viral DNA.**\n\n【20】**Discussion**\n\n【21】**HBV reactivation can be classified into two broad categories based on the initial serologic profile： reactivation of HBV in patients who are positive for Hepatitis B Surface Antigen (HBsAg) in serum with or without the presence of HBV DNA. The reverse seroconversion is defined as the reappearance of viral DNA and HBsAg in an individual's serum， which was initially negative for**\n\n【22】**both before immunosuppression.**\n\n【23】**The HBV reactivation maybe variable depending on the status of the host， the underlying disease， and the type of immunosuppressive therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. This can occur either early in the first two weeks after the beginning of chemotherapy or more than one year after the end of immunosuppressive therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Understanding the risk factors and the mechanisms that may induce the reactivation of HBV helps certainly to understand and quantify the risk of HBV reactivation and its consequences 3\\].**\n\n【24】**The grafted patient has multiple risk factors favoring the development of active hepatitis B： transfusion contamination， transmission by a chronic carrier donor of HBV， or reactivation of a latent B virus in an asymptomatic carrier or in a patient who is nevertheless immunized as in our observation 4\\].**\n\n【25】**It is， therefore， necessary to evaluate the infectious risk due to ciclosporin and corticosteroids that these patients receive after the transplant， which may decrease the immune reaction of the body. As in our observation， it is only at the time of the immune rebound at the end of the intense and prolonged immunosuppressive treatment， that hepatitis has manifest itself， sometimes dramatically considering a large number of infected hepatocytes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.**\n\n【26】**This immune revival can sometimes lead to the elimination of the virus， but in other cases， such as in our case， the selection pressure may favor the appearance of a mutated B virus in the pre-C region\\[1，5\\].**\n\n【27】**These reactivations are potentially serious： risk of fulminant hepatitis， cirrhosis or even death， increased risk of veno-occlusive disease or graft vs. host disease， but the evolution is most often favorable with even cases of spontaneous elimination of the virus despite the immunosuppression context通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.**\n\n【28】**The management of HBV reactivation is centered on the likelihood of the risk of reactivation based on the risk factor profile of an individual patient 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. All patients who are either at high or moderate risk of HBV reactivation should be considered candidates for prophylactic anti-HBV therapy. Usually， we recommend starting anti-HBV therapy before starting immune-suppressive therapy and a baseline complete metabolic profile， complete blood count， prothrombin time， and serum HBV-DNA levels are recommended通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. It is important to evaluate if the patient has chronic hepatitis B and should be a candidate for the treatment of CHB based on serum ALT level， AST level， albumin level， platelet count， and other laboratory parameters and physical examination 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. In endemic areas， if a patient presents with increased ALT level in the setting of immunosuppressive therapies， it is prudent to consider checking for serum HBV DNA. We also recommend routine monitoring with the earlier-described tests every three months while on anti-HBV**\n\n【29】**therapy. Consideration of referral to either hepatology or infectious disease specialist before cancer chemotherapy in those at risk of hepatitis B reactivation is recommended 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.**\n\n【30】**Conclusion**\n\n【31】**Prevention after transplantation in a patient with positive anti-HBs and anti-HBc antibodies requires regular monitoring of the anti-HBs Ab title. In case of a significant decrease of this one， several approaches can be discussed： active immunization by vaccination 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2-10\\]</u>， passive immunization by regular injection of specific anti-HBs immunoglobulins， or daily oral administration of antivirals capable of inhibiting the replication viral 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.**\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>1\\.

Today it is known that strength training (TF) has benefits such as decreased fasting glycemia， glycated hemoglobin， stimulates translocation of GLUT4 in skeletal muscle， increases insulin sensitivity， restoring metabolic control. The objective of this research was to observe the glycemic responses of a type 1 diabetic who underwent strength training at different intensities.**\n\n【15】**Methods： A 26-year-old woman with type 1 Diabetes Mellitus participated in this research， with a trained diagnosis time of 22 (twenty-two)years. The volunteer participated in three non-consecutive days of intervention at the first visit. The evaluation was performed with a test of Maximum Repetition (1RM) in the following exercises： Bench press； Knee extension on the device； Peck Deck； Front high pulley with cable； Leg 45；Low row with triangle. On the second visit to the laboratory， the TF session was performed at 40% of 1RM. On the third visit， the session was performed at 80%of 1RM， capillary blood glucose was collected before， during and immediately after each strength training session.**\n\n【16】**Results： The results observed showed that the exercise of less intensity， at 40% of 1 RM， showed a greater drop in capillary glycemia during and immediately after the TF session.**\n\n【17】**Conclusion： Different intensities will result in different physiological responses. It is important to highlight the need for blood glucose monitoring before， during and after training.**\n\n【18】**Keywords： Type 1 Diabetes； Blood Glucose； Strength Training**\n\n【19】**Introduction**\n\n【20】**Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (DM1) is concentrated between 5% and 10% of the total number of people with diabetes. In most cases， DM1 arises as a result ofautoimmune destruction of pancreatic B cells causing complete deficiency in insulin production，being diagnosed more frequently in children， adolescents and young adults， equally affecting men and women， although its pathophysiology is not fully known. It is known that it is a polygenic disease， thus genetic and environmental factors trigger the autoimmune response 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.**\n\n【21】The treatment of DM1 has historically followed the insulin/food/physical exercise triad. Currently， the triad should switch to insulin/diabetes monitoring/education， including education in nutrition， exercise and guidance for patients and their families 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【22】**Among the treatments， physical exercise offers different methods for controlling DM1， such as aerobic training， which is the most used， since strength training before 2005 was not suitable for DM1 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Today it is already known that strength training has benefits such as decreased fasting blood glucose， glycated hemoglobin， visceral fat， and body weight； stimulates GLUT4 translocation in skeletal muscle， increases insulin sensitivity and， consequently， restores metabolic control 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Insulin injected by the DM1 carrier acts on the IRS-1 and IRS-2 receptors， promoting a cascade of intracellular signaling that results in the translocation of GLUT4 and the entry of glucose into the cell， physical exercise enhances the phosphorylation of IRS-2， which results in a greater PI3K activity causing an increase in Akt protein phosphorylation， which promotes an increase in the**\n\n【23】**translocation of GLUT4 to the cell membrane， consequently greater glucose entry into the cell， decreasing circulating glycemic levels通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u> strength training also minimizes cardiac risks， increases muscle strength and is a good strategy to improve health， physical fitness and performance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>， justifying its inclusion in the treatment ofDM1.**\n\n【24】**However， studies relating strength training in isolation and type1 diabetes are still scarce in the literature， in the same way studies that show the efficiency of different intensities under individuals with DM1 are a great gap in which little has been investigated. Comparing different intensities could clarify the benefits of strength training and provide support for practical applications and recommendations regarding the adequate and safe prescription of strength training for glycemic control in DM1， in addition， the little information on strength training related to DM1 demonstrates the need for further studies that address the topic， in order to elucidate the acute and chronic responses of DM1 through this training method \\[6，7\\]. In this sense， the objective of this research was to observe the glycemic responses of a type 1 diabetic who underwent strength training at different intensities.**\n\n【25】**Materials and Methods**\n\n【26】**Participants**\n\n【27】**This research was characterized as a case study and is linked to the Project Doce Vida - Supervised Physical Exercise Program for Diabetics， held at the Higher School of Physical Education at the University of Pernambuco.

For the strength training session at 40% of 1RM，02 sets were performed with 16 repetitions in each exercise， with a recovery interval of 60s between sets and 120s between exercises. For the strength training session at 80% of 1RM， 02 sets were performed with 08 repetitions in each exercise with an interval of 90s between sets and 120s between exercises.

The study found a significant drop in glycemia during the training sessions， the authors associate the glycemic drop with a greater activity of the GLUT4 protein， physical exercise promotes an increase in energy expenditure and associated with this there is an increase in the AMP： ATP ratio， this mechanism promotes the activation of AMPK， which is associated with translocation of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane \\[5，6\\].**\n\n【60】**The activation of the AMPK enzyme may explain the reduction in glucose during the training intensities performed in this study， as it is one of the precursors of activation of GLUT4， in addition， exercise promotes the suspension of the mTORC1/S6K1 protein**\n\n【61】**that is capable of phosphorylating IRS1 into serine and interrupting the insulin signaling cascade 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Thus， a greater phosphorylation of AMPK and Akt protein occurs， a mechanism that activates GLUT4through an insulin-independent signaling cascade \\[5，13\\].**\n\n【62】**A study carried out with type 2 diabetes conducted by Moreira， compared the acute effect of strength training exercise of different intensities of lower cardiovascular-metabolic stress on glucose control， intensities of 23% 1RM and 40%1RM were used， while end of the study it was concluded that both intensities were effective in reducing glycemia in individuals with type 2 diabetes， demonstrating that even at low intensities， the muscle contraction performed by exercise can promote GLUT4 translocation and in the reduction of capillary glycemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>.**\n\n【63】**The increase in capillary glycemia during training to 80% of1RM and a smaller drop immediately after training compared to a session at 40% of 1RM may be related to hormonal and metabolic responses antagonistic to the decline in blood glucose stimulated to high-intensity exercise 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. Guelfi et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u> state that， metabolic and hormonal responses， elevated catecholamine and growth hormone levels， may contribute to avoiding a decline in blood glucose levels at the beginning of recovery， since these hormones stimulate increased hepatic glucose production and inhibits insulin-mediated glucose通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. One study that compared responses to glucose levels in high-intensity interval aerobic training vs. moderate-intensity aerobic training demonstrated a drop in blood glucose in both protocols， but glucose levels in interval training high intensity remained stable during recovery due to the hormonal versus regulatory response， which it did not occur in moderate training， where glucose levels continued to fall 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>.**\n\n【64】**Despite the benefits of physical exercise， one of the biggest concerns when relating physical exercise and DM1 patients is the risk of hypoglycemia \\[16，17\\]. However， unlike continuous mild to moderate exercise， in high-intensity exercise the occurrence of hypoglycemia does not is frequent 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. Exercises with anaerobic component (weight lifting/resistance exercises， sprints and high intensity interval training) reduce the risk of hypoglycemia during and after physical exercise in DM1通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.**\n\n【65】**Processes regulated by independent insulin mechanisms are generally preserved when people with diabetes engage in high-intensity work. These processes include normal increases in glucose production and disposition during and immediately after exercise， as well as a normal rate of decline in glucose production after exercise. Since glucose production is mainly controlled by catecholamine’s， current data suggest that physically fit patients with insulin-dependent diabetes can exercise vigorously and exercise require high-intensity workloads 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u> Catecholamines (epinephrine， nor epinephrine， dopamine) exhibit effects excitatory and inhibitory effects of the peripheral nervous system and actions in the Central Nervous System(CNS)， in addition to modulation of endocrine function， such as insulin secretion and glycogenolysis rate \\[17，18\\].**\n\n【66】**The findings of the present study revealed that in strength training at 40% 1RM， glycemic levels showed a continuous drop in the moments during training and immediately after training which occurred due to muscle contraction that is one of the factors responsible for the greatest GLUT4 activity. However， in the 80%1RM strength training session there was an increase in capillary glycemia above pre-workout levels， which can be justified by the**\n\n【67】**regulatory action of the hormones responsible for the production of liver glucose， even so， the higher intensity strength training was able to promote glycemic drop at the end of the training session to lower levels than with the pre-workout moment. Strength training can also be prescribed because it has a lower risk of hypoglycemia in addition to promoting increased muscle strength and cross section that only the high intensity of strength training can promote 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>.**\n\n【68】**Conclusion**\n\n【69】**It is concluded that in this case study， for this participant， both training protocols showed a drop in capillary glycemia values at the end of the training session， however the protocols showed different behaviors during the session， where the strength training at 40% of1RM. The fall happened continuously， while in strength training at80% of 1RM there was an increase in blood glucose during the session and then a fall in capillary blood glucose levels， which demonstrate that different intensities will result in different physiological responses. It is important to emphasize the need for blood glucose monitoring before， during and after training， in order to obtain greater safety for the diabetic and reduce the risks ofhypoglycemic events.**\n\n【70】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【71】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**1\\.

The CT-scan revealed a giant tumor in right mediastinum compressing heart and adjacent structures. The echocardiography showed a circular pericardial effusion and no other abnormality. For therapy， the patient was referred to our hospital.**\n\n【20】**Here， we performed an additional MRI thorax， which showed a tumor measuring 10.3×13.5 in the anterior mediastinum adjacent to the right atrium and aorta consisting of calcifications， cystic， solid and fatty parts. The hormone status was normal.**\n\n【21】**The patient underwent surgery through median sternotomy and the tumor was removed safely. The quick histopathology showed no malignancy but a mature teratoma. The tumor measured 13.0cm x 10.5 cm x 6.0 cm and weighed 207.6 g， with multiple cysts consisting of grayish-yellow and reddish material.**\n\n【22】**Under the microscope， the cystic parts showed well-developed，keratinized squamous epithelium with skin appendages.

Also， there was no statistical difference between the both eyes intraocular pressures， as shown in Table 5 and Figure 5.**\n\n【63】**Discussion**\n\n【64】**In recent， the use of prone position ventilation is becoming more widespread as an important measure in the treatment of ARDS. Upon meta-analysis of 8 randomized controlled trials over 12 vears， Munshi et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u> found that prolonged prone position ventilation (at least 12 h， or even longer than 16 h) reduced death rate of patients with moderate to severe ARDS (oxygenation index <200 mmHg) and that prone position ventilation was safe and feasible. However， during their treatment， changes in intraocular pressure due to prone position and even the resulting development and progression of glaucoma disease should be of concern to the majority of intensivists and ophthalmologists**\n\n【65】**Glaucoma is a group of eye diseases characterized by irreversible optic nerve damage and visual field defects that can lead to permanent impairment of visual function and even blindness in patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Studies have found that optic nerve damage caused by glaucoma is mainly because of mechanical compression and ocular blood supply disorder induced by pathological increased intraocular pressure通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. In the long-term high intraocular pressure or large fluctuations**\n\n【66】**in intraocular pressure， patients may have different degrees of eye distension， vision loss， headache on one side， and even nausea and vomiting， and in the advanced stage， patients may have irreversible visual field narrowing in the affected eye， tubular vision， night blindness， which will seriously affect patients lives 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Intraocular pressure refers to the tissue pressure against the wall of the eyeball， and under normal physiological conditions， the intraocular pressure of most people is maintained at 10 mmHg to 21 mmHg， with a difference between left and right eyeballs that is not greater than 5mmHg and a fluctuation between day time and night time that is not greater than 8 mmHg 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. The stability of intraocular pressure is mainly dependent on the dynamic homeostasis between production and drainage of aqueous humor， and both increased production or obstruction of aqueous humor can cause increased intraocular pressiire.**\n\n【67】**In the above test results， it can be seen that there is a statistical difference between the intraocular pressure measured in the prone groups and supine groups. In the study of intraocular pressure during position change in the prone group， patients in the prone group had lower intraocular pressure when changing from prone to supine position and higher intraocular pressure when changing from supine to prone position. Also， during the period when the patients were in the prone position， the intraocular pressure increased further with the prolongation of the prone position. And the range of intraocular pressure changes caused by patients in prolonged prone position exceeds the physiological data in the 2017 Glaucoma Diagnosis and Consensus \\[121.**\n\n【68】**According to current studies， the main factors of changes of intraocular pressure caused by postural changes may include advancement of iridolenticular diaphragm， venous pressure of episclera， blood pressure， ocular perfusion pressure and hormones通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. The patients in this testing process were all severe ARDS patients in our ICU. In treatment， the blood pressure and hormones were controlled stably. The venous pressure of episcleral， however， is mainly dependent on the relative position between eyes and heart通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. In this experiment， due to the illness of patients， all patients in the two groups were always in lying position， the relative position between eyes and heart at supine position and prone position was virtually the same? Therefore， there was no clinical difference in terms of venous pressure of episcleral. So， we considered that the difference of intraocular pressure between the two groups and the change of intraocular pressure within the same group after change of body position were mainly caused by obstruction ofaqueous humor due to anterior displacement of the crystalline iris septum in the prone position. When a patient is at prone position， there is anterior**\n\n【69】**displacement of crystalline lens because of gravity which causes anterior displacement of the crystalline iris septum and reduced the depth of anterior chamber. As a result， the anterior chamber angle is narrowed and the lens is widely and tightly connected to the iris forming a pupillary block caused obstruction of aqueous humor， resulting in increased intraocular pressure， as shown in Figure 6.**\n\n【70】**There was also similar report of this idea in the study by Anderson et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>， who also found higher intraocular pressure and shallower the anterior chamber depth in the prone position compared to the supine position， the same results as our test， and they found no significant change in the anterior chamber depth between the supine and prone position. Prior to this， Lam et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u> considered that the proneposition did notlastlongenough (4min) to cause changes in the anterior chamber depth. But in our study， some patients with ARDS have to be ventilated in prone position ventilation for a long time due to the necessity of their treatment， it means they had to suffer high intraocular pressure for a long term but cannot avoid the significant fluctuation of intraocular pressure caused by change of body position. Although the body maintains hemodynamic stability after a change in body position through a series of regulatory mechanisms， including self-regulation and venous and arterial systems， and neurological reflexes， which regulate intraocular pressure to some extent 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. However， prolonged exposure to such pathologically high intraocular pressure and frequent large fluctuations in intraocular pressure may cause damage to the optic nerve cells， affecting visual acuity and visual function and causing irreversible glaucoma damage. And in the treatment of ARDS patients， besides paying attention to the systemic prognosis， their long-term complications and quality of life are also something we cannot ignore. Therefore， for ARDS patients who have to receive prone position ventilation and patients with high risk of glaucoma， early predication and diagnosis of eye diseases should be performed before serious visual impairment is caused， so as to give corresponding treatment 18\\].**\n\n【71】**In summary， throughout the testing process， some ARDS patients have had their intraocular pressure altered beyond normal physiological standards due to the need to maintain a special body position for long periods of time. Since the increased intraocular pressure and its significant fluctuation caused by unfavorable body positions cannot be avoided， it's a major problem to be addressed in guaranteeing effective treatment to patients while reducing or avoiding increased intraocular pressure and the irreversible impairment to optic nerves and visual field. At last， we hope that this study will provide some reference for clinicians to alert relevant departments that need to perform prone ventilation on patients， so that more physicians will be aware of the changes in intraocular pressure and the increased risk of glaucoma in these patients.**\n\n【72】**Author Contributions**\n\n【73】**BL and ZC planned and designed the study.

Its quick identification in its typical presentation， the elimination of the most severe alternative diagnosis and its management must be known in order to be adapted to the athlete's sporting objectives. Atypical forms with slow recovery are rare and represent a real diagnostic challenge. We report the case of a professional rugby player who presented an atypical Stinger injury and detail its management. This original case is an opportunityto provide a comprehensive review of the different forms and presentations of these traumatic plexopathies and their management.**\n\n【15】**Keywords： Plexus brachial； Sport traua； Stinger；COVID-19**\n\n【16】**Introduction**\n\n【17】**Two main types of brachial plexus injuries are traditionally described： Obstetric brachial plexus paralysis and adult stretch injuries. Both are serious and require specialized care. A third case exists：The traumatic plexopathy of the brachial plexus， better known as Stinger injury or Burner injury. It is little known to the orthopedic surgeon， yet it is a very frequent and common injury in high-level contact athletes. Owen Farrell， England rugby halfback， said when he refused to come out on suspicion of a knockout during a match at the 2021 Six Nations Tournament： \"It’s just a stinger； it has nothing to do with me.\"**\n\n【18】**The classic injury mechanism is a direct impact on the shoulder involving the upper limb on one side and the head on the opposite side. This corresponds to the classic move made by a tackler in rugby. This result in compression and stretching of the brachial plexus， which in some cases can lead to a transient plexopathy of the brachial plexus called a stinger injury 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Stinger in French \"dard\"refers to the symptomatology of the injury. The Stinger injury is described as an electric discharge running through the upper limb. The symptoms are generally resolved in 1 min to 2 min. They are characterized by an immediate sensation of burns and electric discharges going through the entire upper limb associated with an important weakness， even with a total paralysis of the upperlimb. In some cases， weakness of the upper limb persists over time， especially in the muscles innervated by the proximal roots (C5 and C6)； these symptoms may persist for several days or weeks 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.**\n\n【19】**The 2020/2021 COVID-19 epidemics highlight a certain neurotropism of this type of coronavirus. This tropism can be manifested by mononeuropathy or multifocal neuropathy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Beside the known attacks of the central nervous system and their symptoms such as anosmia or ageusia， a tropism of this virus for the nervous elements composing the brachial plexus has been highlighted \\[4，5\\].**\n\n【20】**Case Presentation**\n\n【21】We present the case of a professional rugby player with a long recovery traumatic plexopathy in an athlete who was infected with the COVID-19 virus.\n\n【22】**We then propose， based on the literature data， an update on the Stinger lesion in high-level athletes.**\n\n【23】**We present the case ofa professional rugby player of the \"Stade Francais”evolving as secondline in the French professional league. On November 29h， 2020 in a match following a tackle on the right shoulder ， he presented a Stinger injury characterized by a transient paralysis**\n\n【24】**Figure 1： The Tackle.

Within minutes of the accident， an almost complete regression of symptoms was noticed. Unlike the usual evolution of the Stinger injury， the patient presented persistent discomfort during training and weakness of the right upper limb motivating a consultation3 months after the trauma. During our clinical examination， we observed： Hypoesthesia of the shoulder stump， pain and muscle weakness major on the external rotators of the right shoulder， we also noted an irritative syndrome (pseudo-Tinel sign of the supra-clavicular region)， the overall being compatible with incomplete C5， C6 involvement.**\n\n【28】**Standard X-ray of the cervical spine， dynamic bilateral positional Doppler ultrasound，electroneuromyogram of both upper limbs and MRI ofthe right brachialplexus were performed in order to document the lesions and to eliminate a differential diagnosis (Parsonage Turner syndrome and thoracic-brachial outlet syndrome).

The diagnosis slow recovery Stinger lesion is therefore retained. The treatment consisted of rehabilitation in order to open the cervico-thoraco-brachial clamp associated with the prescription of low-dose pregabalin to treat the irritative syndrome. At 6 months after the trauma， the patient was seen in consultation. He presented a total regression of symptoms with， in particular， a strength in external rotation at 5/5 (symmetrical isometric test) as well as a normal sensitivity of the shoulder stump. However， there is still a mild supraclavicular irritation syndrome. The return to competitive sport was performed at 6 months with a “pad\" on the right shoulder as protective gear.**\n\n【32】**Discussion**\n\n【33】**Focus on the Stinger injury in high-level athletes**\n\n【34】**Kawasaki et al.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u> have shown that 33.9% of professional rugby players experience at least one Stinger injury in a season， with a recurrence rate of 37.0% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Nevertheless， as these lesions are well known and commonplace among contact athletes， their incidence is probably underestimated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.**\n\n【35】**The mechanism involved in most cases combines downward traction of the upper limb and forced lateral flexion of the head on the side opposite the injury. This mechanism leads to a stretching of the brachial plexus associated in certain cases with a foraminal compression of the nerve roots of the brachialplexus. These traumatic stretch injuries of the brachial plexus are classified according to the Seddon Sunderland classification 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. They are in the majority of cases type 1 (Neurapraxia) and rarely of type 2 (Axonotmesis). Type3 lesions (Neurotmesis) are not part of the Stingerlesions and belongs to the well-known management of tear out lesions of the brachial plexus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.**\n\n【36】**Grade 1 lesions lead to a demyelination process without axonal**\n\n【37】**damage. In grade 2 lesions， the axons and myelin sheath are affected leading to a process of Wallerian degeneration， but the Schwann cells as well as the perinerve and epinerve remain intact. As previously mentioned， the Stinger injury corresponds to an immediate sensation of burning and electrical discharges running through the entire upper limb associated with significant weakness or even total paralysis of the upper limb. In some cases， weakness persists in the upper limb， more marked in the muscles innervated by the proximal roots (C5and C6)， but it can also affect any of the muscles of the upper limb； these symptoms can persist for several weeks or even months 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.**\n\n【38】**Clinical examination and management**\n\n【39】**The context， the description of the symptoms， the spontaneous resolving character in less than two minutes and the experience of the lesions by the athlete easily allows to make the diagnosis of Stinger injury. In case of atypical symptoms (bilateral damage， damage to the lower limbs) or in case of doubt， it is needed to consider the trauma as a cervical spine damage (immediate immobilization with a cervical collar and exit on a stretcher) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. The acute clinical examination should initially focus on eliminating differential diagnoses， such as cervical spine trauma or a shoulder girdle injury. Secondly， a complete motor and sensory examination of the upper limb concerned must be carried out， paying particular attention to the muscles innervated by the C6 and C7 roots， which are the most frequently affected.**\n\n【40】**As a matter of course， even in the typical injury cases， a complete clinical examination must be repeated after the game and regularly during the first two weeks. Indeed， a normal clinical examination in the acute phase does not prevent the occurrence of symptoms in the hours or days following the trauma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. In case oftypicallesions，there is no indication to carry out further investigations. On the other hand， if the symptoms persist， the clinical examination must be repeated. It will try to asses' pain in the cervical spine， a sensory or motor deficit in the upper limb， the presence of a supra or infra clavicular pseudo Tinel's sign， an asymmetry of the radial pulse or a muscular atrophy especially in the shoulder (Deltoid， supra and infraspinous fossa) in order to eliminate a differential diagnosis.**\n\n【41】**After careful palpation of the cervical spine， a Spruling test is performed. If there is associated neck pain， the diagnosis can be guide to a cervical radicular damage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. The Spruling test consists of applying compression，rotation and homo-lateral tilt to the lesion. The maneuver is positive when it triggers radicular symptoms in the upper limb. Patients with Stinger injury have no neck pain and a negative Spruling test 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.**\n\n【42】**The value of complementary investigation in Stinger injury is controversial. In cases of typical lesions with quick resolving symptoms， no further investigation is indicated.On the other hand， in case of persistent or recurrent symptoms or in case of doubt， imaging and electro-neuro-myograms can help to document the lesion and eliminate differential diagnoses.**\n\n【43】**Standard and dynamic cervical X-rays， as well as cervical MRI， are used to identify a spine facture， as well as cervical roots damage. Literature data seem to highlight anatomical predispositions of the cervical spine to the occurrence of Stinger injuries 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Indeed， a higher incidence of foraminal or cervical canal stenosis has been found in athletes with repetitive Stinger injuries 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.**\n\n【44】**In case of persistent symptoms， we perform a dynamic arterial and venous positional Doppler ultrasound in order to rule out a cervicothoracic outlet syndrome.**\n\n【45】**The ENMG performed after 6 weeks in case of \"long stinger\"allows on the one hand to eliminate a pre-ganglionic damage of the brachial plexus and on the other hand to specify， if any， the level of the damage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>.**\n\n【46】**Brachial plexus MRI is also only performed in cases of \"long Stinger\" and if all other investigations are normal. Hypersignal of the involved roots is currently found in stretch lesions of the brachial plexus14.**\n\n【47】**Management and return to sport**\n\n【48】**The management of these injuries is mainly based on physical rest， pain management and rehabilitation.**\n\n【49】**Feinberg et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u> propose an algorithm of management and return to sport according to the type of injury following the Sunderland classification 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>.**\n\n【50】**Grade 1 lesions (Neurapraxia) are divided into three categories related to the severity of the symptoms. The lesion known as \"mild grade 1\" is defined by an immediate regression of the symptoms. In this context the sports activity can be continued immediately. In the case of \"moderate grade 1\" injuries， the symptoms persist during the sporting activity and end after the match， while in the case of \"severe grade 1\"injuries， the symptoms persist for over 24 h. In moderate or severe injury， the sport activity must be stopped， the clinical exam must be repeated regularly and the paraclinicals investigations in order to eliminate a trauma of the cervical rachis must be carried out. The return to sport can be considered as soon as the symptoms disappear.**\n\n【51】**For Sunderland's grade 2 lesions， sports activity must be stopped immediately for 15 days minimum. The clinical exam must be repeated.**\n\n【52】**Paraclinical investigation are performed for cervical spine trauma， an EMG should be performed if symptoms persist for more than 15days. The return to sport can be considered as soon as the symptoms regress and paraclinicals investigations are normal.**\n\n【53】**In order to reduce the incidence of spine and nerve injuries， sports federations have progressively changed the rules of high-risk sports by being more and more restrictive and by sanctioning risky behaviors more severely. For example， at rugby，head-on tackles， high tackles and tackles above the waist are now prohibited in France and in most international competitions.**\n\n【54】**Regardingequipment， although their benefits are not scientifically validated， wearing \"pads\" on the shoulders in order to absorb shocks and the use of medical devices limiting hyperextension such as the“Cowboy-Collar\" for American soccer players are becoming more and more common 16.**\n\n【55】**Conclusion**\n\n【56】**The damage to the nervous system due to the neurotropism of COVID-19， although still unknown， seems to be more and more described and documented， the most common disorders are anosmia and agueusia. In addition to these， mononeuropathy or multifocal peripheral neuropathy have been described. Plexus lesions in patients with severe covid-19 infection were initiallyanalyzed as \"resuscitation neuropathies\"and consequences of prone sessions. The existence of a few cases of the upper limb deficits in patients who have not had any prone sessions has suggested the existence of a COVID-19 tropism for the nervous elements of the brachial plexus.**\n\n【57】**In our case the athlete had a positive COVID-19 PCR test on9/11/2020，during a systematicscreening of an official competition.He had no symptoms and was able to return to training and competition as soon as the regulatory isolation was over.**\n\n【58】**The occurrence of a stinger lesion in a professional athlete who played rugby intensively andhad neverpresented this symptomatology， brought us to search an additional subjacent lesion. The MRI showed diffuse damage to the roots of the brachial plexus.**\n\n【59】**We are unable to state that the lesion developed by the player is related to his contamination by COVID-19. But this leads us to wonder： \"Did a neurotropism of the COVID-19 virus in the brachial plexus facilitate the occurrence of a Stinger lesion and slow down his recuperation?**\n\n【60】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【61】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**1\\.

Hypercoagulability and venous stasis during the perinatal period increase the risk of thrombosis. Iliac Vein Compression Syndrome (IVCS) is caused by compression of the left common iliac vein by the right common iliac artery and lumbar vertebra，leading to left common iliac vein stenosis， fiber adhesion and ultimately iliac vein thrombosis. IVCS is the main cause of acute iliac-femoral vein thrombosis. Herein， we report a case of a 38-year-old woman who was pregnant for 5 weeks and 5 days. She suddenly experienced swelling and pain in her left lower limb and was initially diagnosed with DVT and then IVCS upon further examination.**\n\n【12】**Keywords： Early pregnancy； Perinatal period； Gestation； Deep vein thrombosis； Iliac vein compression syndrome； Abortion**\n\n【13】**Introduction**\n\n【14】**Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) is a disease caused by abnormal blood coagulation in deep veins. Affected individuals can present lower limb swelling， pain and dysfunction due to obstructed blood flow. Thrombus detachment can cause a Pulmonary Embolism (PE)，leading to gas exchange disorder， pulmonary hypertension， right ventricular dysfunction， and even dyspnea， shock and death in severe cases. DVT and PE are collectively called Venous Thromboembolism (VTE). A series of changes during the perinatal period， such as hypercoagulability， uterine enlargement that compresses the inferior vena cava and pelvic vein， and venous stasis， increase the risk of thrombosis.**\n\n【15】**IVCS， alsoknown as Cockett syndrome or May-Thurner syndrome， is caused by the compression of the left common iliac vein bythe right common iliac artery anterior to it and the lumbar vertebra posterior to it， leading to left common iliac vein stenosis， fibrous adhesions after repeated intimal injuries， and finally iliac vein thrombosis. IVCS is one of the reasons why DVT is more common in the left lower limb 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Some patients may have right iliac vein compression， and a small number of patients may have bilateral iliac or inferior vena cava involvement.**\n\n【16】**Although the relationship between gestation and DVT is known， there are few cases of iliac-femoral vein thrombosis during early pregnancy and the perinatal period.**\n\n【17】**Case Presentation**\n\n【18】**Medical history**\n\n【19】**A 38-year-old woman had 28-day menstrual cycles， 5 days of menses and 40 days of menopause. Color Doppler ultrasound revealed a fetal sac (1.7 cm x1.7 cmx0.8 cm) and a visible yolk sac in the uterus. The patient had a history of cesarean section 12 years ago and was usually anemic without other chronic diseases. The diagnosis was early pregnancy (5 weeks and 5 days of gestation). The pregnancy was unplanned， and the patient requested an abortion. Preoperative examinations showed a D-dimer concentration of 832 ng/ml (normal reference range： ≤250 ng/ml) and no other abnormalities. An abortion was scheduled for 1 week later. At 6 weeks and 3 days of gestation， she experienced swelling in her left lower limb in the morning， which became painful after getting out of bed. Therefore， she visited our hospital for emergency treatment. The physical examination revealed obvious swelling in her left lowerlimb，with red skin， high skin temperature， excessive skin tension， and Homans’ sign (+)； the circumference of the left calf was 4 cm larger than that of the right calf， and the circumference of the left thigh was 10 cm larger than that of the right thigh (Figure1). The patient was preliminarily diagnosed with DVT of the left lower limb， and the possibility of IVCS could not be excluded. The patient’s D-dimer concentration was 2495 ng/ml.

A stent shadow is observed in the left iliac vein， with good stent morphology and no stenosis in the lumen of the vein.**\n\n【24】**ultrasound indicated thromboses of the left iliac vein， femoral vein， popliteal vein and intermuscular veins of the calf. She denied past and family history of VTE and did not take oral contraceptives containing estrogen.**\n\n【25】**Diagnosis and treatment plan**\n\n【26】**Vascular surgeons and obstetricians and gynecologists jointly determined to first perform temporary inferior vena cava filter placement as emergency treatment to prevent a fatal PE， followed by an emergency abortion， anticoagulation treatment if there was no serious bleeding after the abortion， and last thrombectomy.**\n\n【27】**Diagnosis and treatment**\n\n【28】**1) Temporary inferior vena cava filter placement was performed， and the distal thrombosis of the inferior vena cava was found by intraoperative angiography. (Radiation dose： 12 mGy). 2) The patient was immediately transferred to the obstetrics and gynecology operating room for an induced abortion. Because the patient had**\n\n【29】**approximately 6 cm H，O， and that in the left external iliac vein was approximately 15 cm H，O. Considering the severe compression of the left iliac vein， a 14 mm to 40 mm balloon was inserted to predilate the stenotic segment of the iliac vein， and a 14 mm-100 mm self-expanding stent was implanted in the stenotic segment. Postoperative angiography showed satisfactory removal of the venous thrombosis in the lower limbs， a good blood flow rate， and no obvious luminal stenosis . The pressure in the left external iliac vein was approximately 7 cm H，O (radiation dose： 180 mGy). No significant vaginal bleeding was observed during the operation. 5) Enoxaparin sodium (6000 IU， q12h) was administered after thrombectomy. 6) A thrombophilia-related examination was performed. Protein S activity was 38.7% (reference range 63.5%-149%)， and there were no abnormalities in antithrombin III， protein C， and APS-related antibodies. The result of the thrombophilia-related gene test was negative. Eight days after thrombectomy， both lower limbs were not swollen， with equal circumferences ， and the D-dimer concentration was 116 ng/ml； color Doppler ultrasound showed no thrombosis in the veins of both lower limbs and patent blood flow through the left iliac vein stent. 7) Eight days after thrombectomy， the inferior vena cava filter was removed， and enoxaparin sodium(6000 IU q12h) was administered postoperatively. 8) Thirty days after thrombectomy， the D-dimer concentration was 47 ng/ml； color Doppler ultrasound showed no thrombosis in the veins of both lower limbs and patent blood flow through the left iliac vein stent； contrast-enhanced CT showed satisfactory shape and location of the left iliac vein，patent blood flow through the stent， and relief of compression of theleft iliac vein . The patient was administered rivaroxaban(20 mg qd) as an anticoagulant.9) The examination at 3 months after thrombectomy showed no swelling in the lower limbs. The patient no longer felt heavy， sore or swollen legs， and her menstrual flow was normal. The D-dimer concentration was 45 ng/ml. Color Doppler ultrasound showed no thrombosis in the veins of both lowerlimbs，no deep venous return， and patent flow through the left iliac vein stent.**\n\n【30】**Discussion**\n\n【31】**Increased risk of DVT during gestation**\n\n【32】**A series of changes during the perinatalperiod， such as hypercoagulability， uterine enlargement that compresses the inferior vena cava and pelvic vein， and venous stasis， increase the risk of thrombosis. VTE is the leading cause of maternal death， and the incidence of VTE is 4 to 5 times higher during gestation than in the non-gestation period and is even higher during puerperium. DVT accounts for 75% to 80% of VTE during the perinatal period， and it often involves the iliac-femoral vein and occurs more commonly in the left lower limb 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. The lack of timely and accurate identification of risk factors for VTE is main reason that the incidence of and mortality associated with maternal VTE have not continued to decline worldwide over the past 2 decades.**\n\n【33】**IVCS**\n\n【34】**IVCS is common in women of childbearing age， among whom women aged 20 to 40 years account for 60% to 85% of all IVCS patients. Compared with men， women are more prone to PE 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Women are in a hypercoagulable state during gestation. During middle to late gestation， the enlarged uterus compresses the inferior vena cava and iliac vein， causing blood stasis in the veins of the lower limbs. The presence of IVCS further increases the risk of DVT. The severity of iliac vein stenosis varies with posture. Iliac vein stenosis is more severe in supine positions； therefore， the risk of thrombosis is**\n\n【35】**higher in pregnant women who need to stay in bed most of the time to prevent miscarriages 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.IVCS is the leading cause of acute iliac-femoral vein thrombosis， with a true incidence rate of 18% to 49%. However， IVCS is often overlooked. Past medical history of VTE has been included as the main risk factors for VTE during the perinatal period， but the detection of IVCS has not been included in routine prenatal examinations， and the accurate identification of IVCS is essential for the prevention of VTE during the perinatal period. For women with a previous VTE or women with no previous VTE history but with the IVCS symptoms， color Doppler ultrasound or MRI should be performed to determine the presence of IVCS. For pregnant women with IVCS， preventive measures for VTE should be actively taken to reduce the incidence of DVT，but IVCS has not been listed as a risk factor in existing guidelines； therefore， related research should be designed and implemented to provide more evidence for inclusion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.**\n\n【36】**Post-thrombosis syndrome (PTS) should not be neglected**\n\n【37】**In addition to leading to PE， if not treated effectively and in a timely manner during the acute phase， DVT can also cause venous return disorders of the limbs due to deep vein occlusion. In the process of organized repair， damaged venous valves lead to venous return， causing venous hypertension of the lower limbs and often severe sequela， known as PTS.Long-term high venous pressure in the lower limbs leads to tissue edema， the accumulation of metabolites and tissue malnutrition， mainly manifesting as heaviness， discomfort and swelling in the lower limbs， symptoms that aggravate after long-term standing or activity. Some patients may present with pain， increased muscle tension， varicose veins， pigmentation in the feet and lower legs， thickening and rough skin， pruritus and eczema-like dermatitis in/on affected limbs. Recurrentorprolonged chronic ulcers may occur in patients with severe cases. These symptoms seriously affect quality of life and result in high medical costs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Once DVT is diagnosed in the perinatal period， active treatment is needed to reduce the occurrence of PTS or acute DVT， prompt and effective anticoagulation treatment together with rapid thrombus removal can quickly restore venous return and improve valve function， which are important means to treat DVT and prevent PTS.**\n\n【38】**Abnormal increase in D-dimer**\n\n【39】**D-dimer is a coagulation and fibrinolysis marker that is used to rule out VTE in patients with low to moderate clinical suspicion of VTE， and D-dimer levels gradually increase significantly during gestation， peaking during late gestation. However， the use of this biomarker in pregnant women has limitations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. The patient reported herein had an unplanned pregnancy. Her coagulation tests prior to the abortion revealed a significant elevation in D-dimer， but the elevation in D-dimer was not addressed. The patient had severe DVT 5 days later. Abnormally high D-dimer concentrations in women should not be ignored， and VTE management should be pursued for women who wish to undergo an abortion and those who have undergone abortions. A VTE risk assessment should be conducted at the earliest possible time for all pregnant women 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.**\n\n【40】**Conclusion**\n\n【41】**This case indicates that clinicians should be alert to the risk of DVT during early pregnancy and attach great importance to DVT management during the perinatal period. It is of great significance to screen for IVCS for the prevention and treatment of DVT. Once VTE occurs during the perinatal period， clinicians should closely monitor and actively treat such patients， so as to reduce the mortality rate and**\n\n【42】**the occurrence ofthrombosis recurrence and PTS.**\n\n【43】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【44】通用结尾删除-1:<u>1\\.

The common genetic factor that is associated with T2D is single nucleotide polymorphism. The aim of the present study was to assess the association between rs5219 of the KCNJ11 gene and rs11196205of the TCF7L2 gene with diabetes type 2. Total of 300 samples (150 T2DM patients and 150 non-diabetic controls) together with demographic factors were taken from public and private hospitals of the Southern Punjab. This was a case-control study and contained 150 T2D patients and 150controlled samples. To analyze the polymorphisms in KCNJ11 and TCF7L2， PCR-RFLP and Tetra-arm PCR were used. The findings of this study were that in KCNJ11 gene， homozygous AA genotype was predominant (83.33%) than the GG genotype (14%) and heterozygous genotype GA was present in very a small amount (2.66%) while in case of TCF7L2 gene， CC 28.00%， GG 27.33%and GC 44.67%. The insignificant statistical association was found between rs5219， rs11196205 and T2D as p-value of KCNJ11 (rs5219) is 0.4125 and TCF7L2 (rs11196205) is 0.6. The conclusion of this study is that rs5219 of the KCNJ11 gene and rs11196205 of TCF7L2 gene are not associated with diabetes type 2 in the Southern Punjab population.**\n\n【14】**Keywords： KCNJ11； TCF7L2； PCR-RFLP； Tetra-arm PCR； Insignificant**\n\n【15】**Introduction**\n\n【16】**Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus is a chronic multifactorial disorder described by high blood glucose level (hyperglycemia)， which is due to the resistance of insulin or lower insulin secretion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Both genetic and environmental factors play a significant role in the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Environmental factors are age， obesity， lack of physical activity， hypertension， diet， and smoking 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. International Diabetes Federation reported that in 2017， the number of patients with diabetes was 425 million and this ratio will increase to 629 million in 2045 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Pakistan is South Asia Country and diabetes and obesity is more common in South Asia. 12，000 deaths are noted every year in Pakistan due to diabetes. Different studies revealed that people in urban areas are more affected by this disease due to lack of physical activity， hypertension， and intake ofhigh-calorie food 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. For diabetes， Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) identified different susceptibility genes. Genetic factor is more involved in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus because of Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Different studies found many genes that are associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Among these genes， the potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily J member 11 (KCNJ11) gene and TCF7L2 gene are the main candidate genes for the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus. KCNJ11 gene is situated on the human chromosome at 11p15.1 and consists of one exon with no intronic sequences 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Inward rectifier potassium ion channel (Kir6.2) protein is encoded by this gene. KCNJ11 gene plays a significant role in the secretion of insulin. Kir6.2 protein with Sulfonylurea Receptor 1 (SUR1)， forms K， channel 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. In the K channel， when these two proteins are combined then it mediates the secretion of insulin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. When the level of glucose increases then it results in the closing ofthe K， channel and activation of voltage-gated calcium channels. The Channel of K allows the potassium ions entry. The Intracellular level of calcium ion increases when the cell membrane becomes depolarized due to the increased amount of potassium ions and result in insulin secretion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Insulin production and its secretion are controlled through glucose metabolism by the K， channel. Many KCNJ11 gene SNPs have been identified and among these SNPs， rs5219 has been gaining more consideration for its association with type2 diabetes mellitus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. KCNJ11 gene polymorphism rs5219 is caused when at codon 23， glutamic acid is substituted into lysine amino acid 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. In this variation， guanine is changed into adenine. The Sensitivity of the potassium channel is reduced due to this variation and this substitution caused**\n\n【17】**insulin resistance and leads to diabetes mellitus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.**\n\n【18】**The genes which are elaborate in the cell multiplication and distinctness are regulated by the Transcription Factor 7-like 2 genes(TCF7L2) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. This gene contains the High Mobility Group (HMG) box and also elaborates in the Wnt signaling channel that plays the principal role in galactose stability and this gene is the master regulator of the proinsulin a nuclear receptor for B-catenin is encoded by this gene that involved in lipid metabolism. Variants of TCF7L2gene increased the risk of T2DM with an impaired insulin secretion showed a strong association 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. Wnt wave channel is essential during normal functioning and this function is done by the same receptors in which Frizzled (Fz) and LDL receptor-related proteins are included 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. B-catenin is also important for the activation of many genes when it binds to the TCF receptor. In which Glucagon-Like-Peptide-1(GLP-1) is also included in this way the beta-catenin level is increased and also increased the growth of beta cells. When the mutation in the TCF7L2 gene impaired the secretion glucagon-like peptide-1 due to which production of insulin is low and beta-catenin level also reduced， also disturb the beta-cell proliferation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>.**\n\n【19】**Objectives of this study was to determine the SNP association with body mass index， fasting blood glucose， random blood glucose in controlled and cases subiects.

Allele consisting of lysine in KCNJ11 gene is not responsible for affecting the K， channel activity and thus not related to diabetes. Our research work manifests that transcription factor 7 like 2 rs11196205polymorphisms are not linked along with a risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Systemic manifestations are rare. We present the case of a middle-aged man with polyarthralgia and constitutional syndrome under study. He underwent diagnostic imaging tests that helped establish the differential diagnosis as SAPHO syndrome without skin involvement. To ourknowledge， this is the first reported case ofSAPHO syndrome that debuted as a constitutional condition， and this syndrome should be considered in the diagnostic spectrum.**\n\n【23】**Introduction**\n\n【24】**SAPHO syndrome (Synovitis， Acne， Pustulosis， Hyperostosis and Osteitis) is an autoimmune-autoinflammatory disorder. It is linked to genetic determinants associated with Human Leukocyte Antigens (especially HLA-A26，HLA-B27，HLA-B39， HLA-B61)，infections (e.g.，Propionibacterium _acnes， Staphylococcus aureus， Haemophilus parainfluenzae， Actinomyces)， and immunological_ factors (e.g.， increased Th17 cells in the peripheral blood， undetectable plasma IL-10 levels) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.**\n\n【25】**Epidemiologically， the annual prevalence of SAPHO syndrome ranges from 0.00144 per 100，000people (in Japan) to nearly 10 in 100，000 (in people of European descent) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. It generally affects people in middle age and is more frequent in women. Despite its low prevalence， the syndrome can be masked by other diseases， such as invasive neoplasms， so it is important to be familiar with it and know which diagnostic tests are the most appropriate to identify it. Among the available tests， we focus on PET-CT due to its usefulness in supporting and establishing the differential diagnosis(ruling out seronegative spondyloarthropathies， psoriatic arthritis， anterior chest wall syndrome， and neoplasms)， since SAPHO syndrome can be considered a diagnosis of exclusion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3-10\\]</u>.**\n\n【26】**Case Presentation**\n\n【27】**We present the case of a 51-year-old man with an unremarkable pathological history who presented with a constitutional syndrome， following three weeks of joint pain and bouts of fever of up to 39·C. Physical examination revealed pain at the level of the bilateral sternoclavicular junction and in both tibiotalar joints， as well as weakness in the shoulder and pelvic girdle. The patient had no skin changes or other accompanying symptoms.**\n\n【28】**Blood tests showed leukocytosis (14，700 cells/pL)， neutrophilia (76% neutrophils)， C-reactive protein of 14.63 mg/dL，and an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 65 mm in the first hour. Muscle enzymes (CPK，LDH， aldolase，GOT，GPT) and tumor markers were normal. ANA (<1/80)，ASMA(<1/80)， and anti-LKM(<1/80) titers were negative， as was anti-citrullinated peptide antibody (<1**\n\n【29】**Figure 1： Thickening of both sternoclavicular joints on the CT.On performing a right shoulder arthrocentesis， a fluid with inflammatary characteristics was obtained， with 30，000 leukocytes (84% neutrophils)， glucose of 89 mg/dL， and negative culture.**\n\n【30】**Figure 2： With increased uptake of the radiotracer at that level in the PET study.

There was a dramatic increase in the Doppler flow in both metacarpophalangeal joints and an increase in the adjacent soft tissues. The cervical-thoracic-abdominal CT showed bilateral thickening of the sternoclavicular joints ， with increased uptake in the PET images  along with signs of arthropathy in the dorsal column and two instances of spinous apophysitis.**\n\n【33】**On suspicion of SAPHO syndrome， a bone scintigraphy was requested， confirming increased uptake in the sternoclavicular joints， predominantly the right one .**\n\n【34】**Discussion**\n\n【35】**We present a clinical case of an adult male with polyarthralgia and constitutional symptoms， fever， increased acute phase reactants， and imaging tests that helped guide the clinical judgment and establish the differential diagnosis. SAPHO syndrome is an entity that affects middle-aged adults and presents as frequent osteoarticular pain. In most cases， there is true axial and peripheral arthritis (which most frequently affects the sternoclavicular joints)， sternoclavicular and spinal hyperostosis， and recurrent foci of osteitis \\[3，4，7，8\\]. The syndrome may be accompanied by skin lesions such as acne， palmoplantar pustulosis， and hidradenitis suppurativa. In fact， skin involvement usually precedes the onset of joint symptoms， although it can occur at any time during the disease. The epidemiology of this entity is difficult to define given its low prevalence (approximately1/10，000 people， with a certain predominance of middle-aged women)， and it frequently goes undetected or has a delayed diagnosis\\[1，10\\].**\n\n【36】**Diagnostic imaging techniques help to establish a differential diagnosis. CT can show the presence ofhyperostosis， bone hyperplasia at the insertion points of the costoclavicular ligament， foci of osteitis， and other chest wall abnormalities at an early stage of the disease通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11-14\\]</u>. Whole-body bone scintigraphy can show the classic “bull's head sign\"in approximately a third of patients (reflecting the elevated uptake at the level of the sternal angle and sternoclavicular joint)， which helps to confirm the suspected diagnosis of SAPHO syndrome\\[11，15，16\\]. Bone scintigraphy is especially important for diagnosing atypical or incomplete forms of SAPHO syndrome (for example， in the absence or atypical presentation of skin lesions) \\[9，17\\]. In early stages of the disease， 85% to 95% of cases will present hyper-uptake of the tracer in the anterior part of the thoracic cavity and the characteristic inflammatory involvement of the sternoclavicular and costosternal joints， with true arthritis in 90% of cases \\[2，8-14\\]. The chest X-ray was normal in our patient， as is typical in the initial stages ofthe disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>.**\n\n【37】**In recent years， the use of PET-CT for the differential diagnosis of SAPHO has increased notably. These scans can reveal multiple skeletal lesions in the anterior or spinal chest wall，low-moderate FDG uptake，**\n\n【38】Figures 3： A and B) Bone scintigraphy with increased uptake of the radiotracer in bath sternaclavicular jaints， predaminantly in the right one.\n\n【39】**and the coexistence of osteolysis and osteosclerosis. The convergence of the functional information on 18FDG uptake demonstrates the presence of anatomically located active inflammatory lesions. Diagnostic PET-CT is also useful to determine the stage of SAPHO syndrome. Early-stage disease is characterized by osteolytic bone destruction with increased FDG uptake， whereas the bone lesions are inactive in the late stage， resulting in normal FDG uptake. 18FDG-PET/CT also allows us to differentiate benign lesions from metastatic bone lesions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18-20\\]</u>. In our case， the FDG uptake shown in the PET-CT was low/moderate， which allows the differential diagnosis with other diseases.**\n\n【40】**In our case， no skin lesions were observed. The appearance of these lesions is not essential for reaching the diagnosis， as they can appear after arthritis in 30% to 60% of cases， especially if the patient does not start and maintain adequate treatment. Typical skin involvement includes palmoplantar pustulosis， persistent conglobata acne， and hidradenitis suppurativa \\[2，3\\].**\n\n【41】**Following the initiation of treatment with a descending regimen of prednisone 30 mg and follow-up in outpatient clinics， the patient reported adequate pain control andpresented synchronous resolution of polyarthralgia and constitutional symptoms. Acute phase reactants showed normalization on successive visits， with no appearance of skin lesions to date. The course of the disease is usually chronic and eventually resolves spontaneously.**\n\n【42】**In patients who present constitutional syndrome associated with polyarthritis， especially with joint involvement in the anterior part of the thorax， and elevated acute phase reactants， SAPHO syndrome must be included in the differential diagnosis， even without skin alterations. Bone scintigraphy， CT， and PET/CT will help establish the definitive clinical judgment. To the best of our knowledge， this is the first case of SAPHO syndrome presenting as a constitutional syndrome.**\n\n【43】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【44】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**l.

It is brought on by car accidents， falls， and assault. The primary insult of TBI occurs at impact， which leads to subsequent damage and a cascade of cellular processes. Other variables that contribute to subsequent TBI insult include excitotoxicity， neuroinflammation， apoptosis， necrosis， mitochondrial malfunction， and lipid peroxidation. Secondary damage during TBI must be treated in order to avoid its development and additional neurodegeneration. However， no specific drug is available to prevent secondary insult in TBI， but alternative medications such as anti-inflammatory， diuretic， and corticosteroids are preferred. There are various diagnostic markers used to confirm the injury stage and its progressions such as HMGB1， Tenascin-c，S100B proteins， ghrelin，UCHL-1，and others. We investigated the causes of TBI， the prognostic relevance of biomarkers， and the current treatment strategies in this review.**\n\n【14】**Keywords： Trauatic brain injury； Biomarkers；HMGB1；UCHL-1； Diagnostic techniques**\n\n【15】**Abbreviations**\n\n【16】**TBI： Traumatic Brain Injury； HMGB1： High Mobility Group Box-1； S100B： Calcium Binding Protein Tenascin-c Ghrelin； UCHL-1： Ubiquitin C terminal Hydroxylase； NLRP1： Nucleotide-Binding Oligomerization Domain； GCS： Glasgow Coma Scale； ROS： Reactive Oxygen Species**\n\n【17】**Introduction**\n\n【18】**Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is a significant health problem that affects millions of people worldwide. In India， the bulk of TBI cases (60%) are caused by car accidents， falls (20% to 30%)， and violence (10%)， among other things 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)， 1.7 million individuals in the United States suffer from TBI each year， with an additional 5.3 million living with TBI-related disability 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. It is one of the most common causes of morbidity， death， and medical complications in modern countries； around 70% to 90% of TBI are moderate， and only a tiny fraction of individuals are sent to the hospital as a result， The National Institute of Health (NIH) declared in 1999 that mild TBI is a major health problem because majority of peoples suffers from post- traumatic related disabilities such as retrograde amnesia， migraine， behavioral changes， lack of attention， and neurological problems such as Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson's disease， the probability of PD occurrence after TBI has been increased 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. The process behind TBI is the transmission of external stresses to brain tissue， which can induce brain damage. The main damage is produced by an impact and contusion，laceration， and diffuse axonal injury as a result of shearing， tearing， or stretching. The severity of injury is determined by the originating forces as well as the location， direction， and amount of the force 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.**\n\n【19】**According on the location of the damage， it can be either diffuse or focal. Focal brain injuries affect a specific part of the brain， but diffuse brain injuries can penetrate deep and impact various parts of the brain depending on the severity. Because they are caused by penetrating foreign bodies that can occasionally be left there and seriously impact the brain， skull， and cranial cavity， focal brain injuries can be acute or blunt. Similarly， diffuse brain injury is classified into two types： Cerebral contusion and diffuse axonal injury 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Diffuse axonal in jury will penetrate inside the skull， causing the foreign body to remain inside the brain； this is also known as penetrating injury， and it can cause further damage inside the brain and ultimately cause death 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Whereas in the case of blunt focal injury， external forces play an important role， when a high acceleration force strikes the head， the brain is accelerated further， moving inside the cranial cavity and impacting on the opposite side of the skull， causing further injury on the opposite side of the skull 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Blunt damage to the rear of the**\n\n【20】**_cited._**\n\n【21】**head， speeding the brain and smashing within the foot’s skull. Whereas diffuse brain damage is further classified into two types： Cerebral contusion and diffuse axonal injury. In the case of cerebral contusion， cerebral refers to the brain， and contusion refers to a bruise. When any tissue is damaged， the small blood vessels are disrupted， causing blood to leak out into the tissue spaces， so a contusion or a bruise is simply bleeding from small blood vessels， resulting in blood in the tissue spaces 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. However， in the event of diffuse axonal injuries， when an external force is applied to the head， the brain suffers from acceleration and deceleration， causing the brain's top section to move in both directions， but the brain stem part remains constant or fixed in the same position and due to the movement of the upper portion axons present in the brain stem are damaged because these axons are very sensitive to shearing， they got injured that means consciousness might still be generated because consciousness is generated from the brain stem， but when axons are injured TBI injured patient suffered from impaired consciousness and became confused 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.**\n\n【22】**TBI's pathogenic process comprises both primary and secondary brain damage. The Primary brain injury is also called phase 1 injury occurwithin minutes ofprimary insult which damage meninges， glial-limitans， and parenchyma cells of the brain such as ATP (Adenosine Triphosphate)， HMGB-1. These signals binds with the PAMP(Pathogen-Associated Molecular Pattern) or DAMP (Damage-Associated Molecular Pattern)， Inflammation is initiated by PAMP or DAMP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. They induce inflammation to eliminate infection or for healing wounds. An example of DAMP or PAMP is TLR (Toll-Like Receptor)and Purinergicreceptor that induce immediate activation of resident myeloid cells like (Microglial cells and NALP1) that promote the generation of IL-1B and IL-18. NF-KB (Nuclear Factor Kappa B) is also activated which further induce immunological response and translocate to the nuclei of cells and persuade immunological program involving cellular proliferation and release inflammatory marker such as chemokines， cytokines， NO (Nitric Oxide) and ROS(Reactive Oxygen Species) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. NF-KB play important role as anti-**\n\n【23】**apoptotic agent， inhibit the apoptosis in TNF pathway. when TNF-a molecule bind to its TNFR1 receptor and initiate the apoptosis process by increasing the activity of SODD (Silencing of Death Domain)， but if SODD is not activated or TNF-a unable to bind with its receptor then TRAF-2 (TNF Receptor-Associated Factor) is recruited on the SODD site due to which apoptosis process is skipped and we will move towards the NF-KB pathway， TRAF (TNF-Receptor Apoptosis Factor) complex further recruits IAP protein (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein) and binds with the TRAF， further TRAF also recruits rip protein(receptor-interacting protein kinases)， this IKK (Inhibitor of nuclear factor Kappa-B subunit alpha) protein has kinase activity. This IKK molecule phosphorylate Inhibitor of Kappa B (IK-BA) due to which NF-KB dislocated from IKBA and NF-KB molecule become free and able to enter inside the nucleus， drives the expression of pro-inflammatory genes and anti-apoptotic genes and cytokines production 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.**\n\n【24】**Aswe detect secondarybrain damage， it frequentlyprogresses from hours to months or years. It refers to the full set of phases or stages of cellular，tissue，chemical， orblood vascular alterations in the brain that may exacerbate brain tissue damage. Variables such as excitotoxicity， mitochondrial dysfunction， oxidative stress， neuroinflammation， axon degeneration， apoptotic cell death， and lipid peroxidation will all contribute to the secondary insult 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. It has been shown that glutamate and aspartate assist to generate cellular alterations during secondary damage. Excess glutamate after TBI is caused by a lack of glutamate re-uptake owing to glutamate transporter malfunction. Furthermore， some studies show a 40% reduction in the expression of astrocytic sodium-dependent glutamate transporters GLAST and GLT-1 within 24 h of TBI， resulting in a considerable decrease in glutamate resorption. These are excitatory amino acids that play a crucial role in the activation of both ionotropic Glutamate Receptors(iGluRs) and metabotropic Glutamate Receptors (mGluRs) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. The N-Methyl-D-Aspartate (NMDA) receptor and -Amino-3-hydroxy-5-Methyl-4-isoxazole Propionate (AMPA) receptors are examples of**\n\n【25】**Figure 2： Role of glutamate in TBl and its role in apoptosis and neurodegeneration.**\n\n【26】**(iGluRs)， which are ligand-gated ion channel receptors that enable the inflow of Na+，k+， and Ca2+ upon binding to glutamate，causing membrane depolarization in neurons. Excess glutamate activates both AMPA and NMDA receptors， affecting ion homeostasis in postsynaptic neurons by increasing calcium and sodium ion influx. Glutamate activation of NMDA receptors increases the formation of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) and Nitric Oxide (NO)， which can trigger secondary brain damage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u> .**\n\n【27】**Accumulation of Ca2+ and ROS impairs mitochondrial function， which is one of the defining events of TBI because it causes severe metabolic and physiologic abnormalities， ultimately leading to cell death. Excess calcium andiron influx into the mitochondria cause the formation of ROS， inhibit the synthesis of ATP， and depolarize the mitochondrial membrane，resulting in the breakdown of the electron transport chain and disruption of the oxidative phosphorylation process， affecting the restoration of metabolic reactions for cell survival and calcium cycle regulation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. When the inner membrane protein Adenine Nucleotide Translocator (ANT) interacts to cyclophilin D， the conformational shift causes the mPTP to open， increasing the inner membrane permeability 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. TBI contains particular proteins that target mitochondrial activity， causing mitochondria to enlarge by spilling apoptotic effectors over the mitochondrial membrane. These proteins are tiny mitochondria-derived activator caspases that are released into the cytosol and attach to the inhibitor of apoptosis protein， preventing apoptosis inhibition. Furthermore， cytochrome C is released from the mitochondria， where it binds to APAF-1 and ATP to form apoptosomes. These apoptosomes then cleave pro-caspase into caspase 3， resulting in cell death 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>.**\n\n【28】**Preclinical TBI Biomarkers**\n\n【29】**Biomarkers are biological substances present in the blood and other bodily fluids that can play an essential role in providing**\n\n【30】**objective and quantitative information regarding the process behind neurological impairments and the degree of the damage. In the case of TBI， biomarkers such as HMGB1， S100B protein， MMP (Matrix Metalloproteins)， TIMP， LGALS3， ghrelin， UCHL-1， Tenascin-C， and HSP proteins are utilized to aid in the diagnosis and prognosis of the condition.**\n\n【31】**Role of HMGB1 protein in TBI**\n\n【32】**HMGB1 (High Mobility Group Box-1) is a ubiquitous nuclear protein that is an architectural chromatin-binding factor that can be involved in the maintenance of nucleosomes as well as the regulation of gene transcription 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. It has two DNA binding domains known as the A and B box domains. A box has a binding site for the HMGB1receptor， but the B box has been identified as a pro-inflammatory domain， suggesting that it might be a functional biomarker of TBI通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. During the primary insult， BOX protein is produced in the form of alarmin signals from the injured meninges and parenchyma cells； these signals then bind to the DAMP (Damage-Associated Molecular Pattern\\]OI _PAMP(Paracrine-AssociatedMolecular Pattern\\]_ (Pathogen-Associated Molecular Pattern) TLR (Toll-Like Receptor) is an example of a DAMP. These receptors also trigger or activate microglial cells and NLRP1 (Nucleotide-Binding Oligomerization Domain)， which can accelerate the creation of an inflammasome， which initiates pro-inflammatory cytokine production and causes an inflammatory response. HMGB1 has been shown to disrupt the Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB)， resulting in cognitive impairment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. It has been observed that TBI is related with neuroinflammation and cognitive abnormalities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>， and HMGB1 has been shown to increase or begin neuroinflammation. In experimental models of TBI， treatment with an HMGB1 antagonist had a positive impact 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. BOX protein is released after 30 min of damage and its expression decreases between one and six hours after TBI 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>. BOX protein has been linked to increased intracranial pressure in patients and the**\n\n【33】**promotion of cerebral edema following injury， with the hazardous impact of box protein aided by microglial activation. When compared to a normal control， the amount of HMGB1 following trauma increases up to thirty-fold within the first hour of damage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>.**\n\n【34】**Role of Heat Shock Protein (HSPs) in TBI**\n\n【35】**HSPs are basically chaperones that allow proteins to fold and accelerate the refolding of denatured proteins. They are increased inside cells when they are subjected to extreme stress， such as heat， cold， UV radiation， or damage. In the event that a protein is substantially misfolded， HSP has the capacity to destroy it 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u>. Stress on the cells occurs during TBI as a result of a blow to the head and trauma， and at the time of the primary insult， 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u> these proteins are released in the form of alarmin signals and bind with the DAMP proteins， inducing a cascade of events and allowing the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>. HSPs are classified based on their molecular mass， and each one performs a unique set of functions. For example， HSP40 is involved in the breakdown of damaged proteins， whereas HSP70 has been shown to enhance neurological outcomes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u>. It has been observed that HSP70protects brain cells from experimental brain damage during TBI， but HSP70downregulation has different results， and HSP70 activation reduces protein aggregation. HSP induction is mediated by the Heat Shock Factor (HSF)， which binds to all HSP genes. HSF is essentially a transcriptional factor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[28\\]</u>. Under normal settings， HSPs are found intracellularly and coupled with HSF1， but when cells are subjected to stress， such as injury or trauma， this causes protein dissociation from HSF， causing these HSPs to linktothe denatured proteins 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[29\\]</u>.HSP70overexpression decreased the degree of brain bleeding and Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB) disruption， which will lessen BBB damage in TBI and suppress MMP production， improving neurological outcomes通用删除6(英):<u>\\[30\\]</u>. HSP70 also plays an important role in apoptosis， influencing the recruitment ofprocaspase 9 and Apoptosis protease factor1 (Apaf-1) and so inhibiting the intrinsic apoptotic pathway 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[31\\]</u>. It has also been discovered that HSP70 suppresses NF-kB activation， which affects the**\n\n【36】**generation of pro-inflammatory cytokines 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[32\\]</u>.**\n\n【37】**Role of MMP (Matrix Metalloproteinases) and TIMP (Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase) in TBI**\n\n【38】**MMPs are extracellular enzymes that can play a significant role in the destruction of extracellular matrix proteins， 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[33\\]</u> they have been found in the Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) of TBI patients in several investigations. MMPs have a role in proper growth， wound healing. and development； they are generally released as latent enzymes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[34\\]</u>. In the event of TBI， inflammation develops， which increases BBB permeability and， as a result， the number of MMPs greatly increases通用删除6(英):<u>\\[35\\]</u>. MMP-9 (Gelatinase-B) and MMP-2 (Gelatinase-A) levels rise during injury， which can lead to BBB breakdown， while MMP-3(stromelysin-1) contributes to the degradation of BBB basal lamina and tight junction proteins 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[36\\]</u>. However， a larger concentration of MMP-9 has been found in the CSF of TBI patients， indicating the severity of the damage； they are an essential CSF biomarker for predicting the clinical fate of TBI patient 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[37\\]</u>. As a result， while a rise in MMP concentration after TBI may be advantageous， a larger concentration might have negative consequences. It has also been claimed that MMPs are implicated in subsequent brain damage. MMP-9 levels are increased in neurological disorders， and its activation causes excitotoxicity， mitochondrial malfunction， and apoptosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[38\\]</u>. The level of MMP-9 increases on the first day of the primary injury and is increased for seven days following the insult. Its concentration is greater in the TBI patient's cerebral cortex and hippocampus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[39\\]</u>， and it has also been observed in blood plasma. It has been suggested that a high level of MMPs leads to the development of Post-Traumatic Epilepsy (PTE)， and that inhibiting MMP-9 may bebeneficial in guarding against PTE 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[40\\]</u>. The molecular mechanism of MMP and its function in TBI are . MMPs contribute to apoptosis， they activate the TNF-a which further activate TRADD and FADD， results in caspase-3 activation which induce apoptosis41.**\n\n【39】**Tissue Inhibitors of Metalloproteinase (TIMPs) are balancing**\n\n【40】**proteins that modulate the activity of MMPs. TIMPs are classified into four kinds (1， 2， 3， 4). They all have diverse mechanisms of action and operate on different MMPs to modulate their activities， such as TIMP-1 controlling MMP-9 or MMP-3 activity and TIMP-2 inhibiting MMP-2 activity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[42\\]</u>. TIMPs are dimers composed of an N-terminal domain and a smaller C-terminal domain that are stabilized by three disulfide bonds. The n-terminal domain of TIMP non-covalently binds to MMPs substrate unit at the zinc-binding site， which can be useful in inhibiting MMP activity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[43\\]</u>.TIMP-1is an inducible form whose upregulation is dependent on factors such as TGF， IL-1， IL-6， epithelial growth factor and leukemia inhibitory factor， oncostatin， retinoids， etc. TIMP-1 is known to induce neuroprotective effects in the CNS by maintaining the BBB， suppressing apoptosis， and inhibiting excitotoxic cell death of neurons， whereas TIMP-2 and TIMP-3 are soluble non-glycosylated proteins that are expressed constitutively，and TIMP-3 is an insoluble protein that will bind to ECM components， and it is the only MMP that will inhibit TNF-a通用删除6(英):<u>\\[44\\]</u>.**\n\n【41】**Role of ghrelin in TBI**\n\n【42】**Ghrelin is a peptide that is released inside the stomach. Its main function is to control food and metabolism， and it also has some neuroprotective properties. It also stimulates the production of growth hormone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[45\\]</u>. Ghrelin Receptors (GHS-R1a) are situated inside the brain and trigger growth hormone release. It also has certain extra-hypothalamic neuronal activities such as learning， memory， stress， and motivation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[46\\]</u>. Ghrelin has the ability to cross the BBB and has significant beneficial effects in TBI， particularly reducing the poor results of subsequent brain injury 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[47\\]</u>. Following a first injury， numerous proteins are produced，which may contribute to later brain damage such as increased apoptosis and neuronal inflammation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[48\\]</u>. However， it has been reported that ghrelin has anti-apoptotic activity， and the mechanism behind this is that during the primary insult， proapoptotic BAX protein is stimulated and anti-apoptotic BCL-**\n\n【43】**2 protein is suppressed， causing cytochrome-C to be released from the mitochondria due to the opening of the MPTP and interacting with APAF-1 protein 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[49\\]</u>. This will then interact with procaspase-9， resulting in the activation of the procaspase-9 molecule， which will then activate caspase-3， and apoptosis will begin； however， ghrelin also inhibits the activation of the BAX protein， which plays a crucial role in apoptosis. It will also activate ERK1/2， the protein kinase C pathway， and the protein kinase-A pathway， as well as enhance the production of mitochondrial Uncoupling Protein (UCP-2). Long-term inflammation is also a key source of secondary damage after TBI， although ghrelin will have a favorable impact by regulating inflammation and decreasing the production of TNF-or IL-1，making it appears to be advantageous in TBI 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[51\\]</u>.**\n\n【44】**Role of galectin-3 in TBI**\n\n【45】**Galectins are a protein family with 15 members， each with a unique function. Galectin-3 is one of the proteins present inside the nucleus or cytoplasm， and it will become the master regulator of inflammatory response in neurodegenerative illness 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[52\\]</u>. In general， active microglial cells produce galectin-3； moreover， it is required for resident microglial activation and proliferation in response to damage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[53\\]</u>. Galectin-3levels in plasma are linked to the severity and prognosis of severe TBI； it is involved in cell adhesion， proliferation， migration， activation， apoptosis， and phagocytosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[54\\]</u>. Galectin-3plays an important role in the regulation of brain inflammation and neurodegeneration； its level in the CSF is significantly increased within 24 h of injury； microglial cells express this protein in the presence of brain trauma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[55\\]</u>； and it has been observed that during the time of primary insult， the BBB is immediately disrupted， resulting in substantial leakage of Galectin-3 from the parenchyma cell into the CSF 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[56\\]</u>. It will bind to the Toll-Like Receptors (TLR)， which are DAMP (Damage-Associated Molecular Pattern) that will induce activation of microglial cells， resulting in the release of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1， TNF-， and NF-kB， which**\n\n【46】**can further promote neurodegeneration， so neutralizing antibodies against Galentin-3 provide a beneficial effect， inhibiting the activation of microglial cells and the formation of inflammatory cytokines and promotes neuroprotection in head injury. TLR receptor inhibition has also been shown to be advantageous. According to research， Galactin-3 acts as an alarmin signal in TBI， and a high quantity of Galectin-3 in the CSF suggests a significant degree of damage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[57\\]</u>.**\n\n【47】**Role of S100B protein in TBI**\n\n【48】**S100B protein is a calcium-binding protein present in the cytoplasm that is involved in a variety of activities such as cell differentiation and cell cycle progression 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[58\\]</u>. It is an essential blood biomarker protein that plays a key role in TBI after the primary insult， these proteins are quickly released from the injured glial cell into the circulatory system， and it is an important tool that may be utilized as a proxy of imaging in TBI in contrast to MRI.**\n\n【49】**The mechanism underlying S100B in TBI is that during the primary insult， the BBB is damaged， causing S100B to be immediately released from the damaged glial cells. Following this， microglial cells are activated， and ROS production begins， which increases the production of proinflammatory cytokines and may lead to cell death and neuronal dysfunction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[59\\]</u>. It also increases RAGE signaling activation in neurons， which can lead to neuronal death. Changes in the expression of this marker have been linked to the severity of the injury and neurological consequences. It has been observed that in patients with severe damage， the concentration of S100B in blood is greater than 1.13 ng/ml， which is associated with an increase in mortality and morbidity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[60\\]</u>.**\n\n【50】**Role of UCHL-1 in TB**\n\n【51】**Ubiquitin C-terminal hydroxylase is a blood biomarker protein that is present mostly in neurons throughout the brain after TBI 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[61\\]</u>. It can be used to detect the severity of injury because it is a promising TBI biomarker that belongs to the family of deubiquitinating enzymes that recycle ubiquitin monomers and has the ability to promote the aggregation of a-synuclein， during the time of injury neurons are injured and then UCHL-1 are released into the CSF， it can also be detected in the systemic circulation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[62\\]</u>. UCHL-1 shows some favorable effects， such as mending the axons or neurons after injury by eliminating the aberrant protein via ubiquitin-proteasome pathway， which can keep the axons intact 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[63\\]</u>. During the time of brain injury， various unpleasant lipid proteins are released， such as cyclopentenone and prostaglandin， which interact with the UCHL-1and hinder its activity. It has been shown that after moderate TBI， only a temporary increase in the level ofUCHL-1 has been seen 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[62\\]</u>， however in severe TBI， the level of UCHL-1 in CSF is too high， and the level ofthis protein in the CSF or serum may be measured within7 h to 9 h after severe TBI. It can be identified by using the sandwich ELISA technique， and it is an essential biomarker that may be used to distinguish between minor and severe TBI. The half-life time(t1/2) of UCHL-1 in mTBI is around 7 h， but that of severe TBI is approximately 10 h通用删除6(英):<u>\\[64\\]</u>.**\n\n【52】**Role of Tenascin-C in TBI**\n\n【53】**TNCs are matricellular proteins that are important inducers of inflammatory cascades in response to various stimuli and tissue injury 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[65\\]</u>. TNCs， which are MCPs (Multicellular Proteins)， are significantly expressed throughout embryonic development. Theyare triggered by glial cells and astrocytes and play a vital part in brain development 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[66\\]</u>， performing a range of activities including as**\n\n【54】**neuronal progenitor cell maturation， cell proliferation， proper CNS development， and maintaining synaptic plasticity， among others.**\n\n【55】**TNC levels have been significantly increased in brain parenchyma cells such as neurons and astrocytes during TBI， indicating multiple deleterious events such as BBB disruption， apoptosis， activation of the MAPK pathway， and NF-KB pathway activation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[67\\]</u>， which can further increase the severity of the injury. It will also raise the likelihood of first injury， which may increase the likelihood of subsequent damage. TNC will activate the TLR-4 receptor， which is basically a DAMP signal， which will further induce the activation of the microglial cells and inflammasomes， which will promote the generation of proinflammatory cytokines like IL-1and NF-KB， which can promote the generation of ROS and enhance the inflammation通用删除6(英):<u>\\[68\\]</u>. TNC will also upregulate the production of MMP-9 by activating the MAPK pathway， resulting in secondary brain damage. Excitotoxicity， mitochondrial malfunction， and apoptosis will follow\\[691. Patients with TBI had increased TNC levels in their CSF and plasma， indicating severe TBI 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[70\\]</u> .**\n\n【56】**Role of tau protein in TBI**\n\n【57】**Tau protein is a microtubule-associated protein that is found in the neurons and helps in maintaining the morphology of neurons， they will play important role in signal transduction or vesicular transport 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[71\\]</u>. The normal physiological function of tau protein is to promote the formation of microtubules. It will undergo post-translational changes， such as phosphorylation， which is essential for their proper functioning and is controlled by the balance of kinase and phosphatase activity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[72\\]</u>. This will affect the affinity of microtubules binding. Tau proteins become hyperphosphorylated during TBI because the microtubule by which tau protein binds is disintegrated during primary injury， resulting in the formation of neurofibrillary tangles of tau protein， which accumulate inside the brain and increase a cascade of events that show harmful effects such as increased oxidative stress because mitochondria is damaged and ROS formation is increased 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[73\\]</u>. Tau proteins will also boost glutamate activation via the NMDA receptor， resulting in an increase in calcium influx into the cell， which will exacerbate excitotoxicityand neuronal death 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[74\\]</u>. It also activates glial cells， which can boost the production of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1 and TNF-a. These cytokines further exacerbate neuroinflammation， which eventually leads to neuronal death. These variables occur because tau protein hyperphosphorylation ameliorates subsequent damage in TBI while eventually worsening the situation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[75\\]</u>.**\n\n【58】**Diagnostic techniques for TBI**\n\n【59】**Diagnosis of TBI is itselfa chalengingtaskbecausein TBI different signs and symptoms have been seen with respect to time and different diagnostic techniques have been implemented， the mildness of injury is difficult to identify. Patients suffering from TBI report complex neurocognitive， neuropsychological， and physical symptoms these symptoms differ with respect to the severity of injury (e.g.， dizziness， motor problem，blurred vision，irritability， sensitivity to noise or light， the problem with memory or concentration， transient neurological abnormalities， sleep disturbance， nausea and behavioral/emotional symptoms (e.g.， depression， anxiety， aggression， impulsivity). whereas in case of severe TBI symptoms have been worsened like loss of consciousness， severe headache， short term memory loss， seizures or convulsions， coma， locked-in syndrome， and brain herniation have been seen. Therefore， clinicians have evaluated the severity of the injury and facilitate the diagnostic management for each patient**\n\n【60】**different diagnostic tool have been employed and practically used for the assessment of TBI \\[761.**\n\n【61】**Evaluation of Consciousness**\n\n【62】**Different tools have been used to check the level of consciousness.**\n\n【63】**Glasgow coma scale**\n\n【64】**The Glasgow coma scale is a useful instrument for providing an initial evaluation score by monitoring a persons degree of consciousness following a TBI 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[77\\]</u>. GCS evaluates a patient's ability to do the visual movement， motor movement， and verbal test； these three characteristics assist clinicians in determining the severity of the damage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[78\\]</u>. GCS scores range from 1 to 15， if the patient score is 1to 3， it indicates that the patient's condition is worsening or that the injury is more severe because the patient is completely unconscious\\[791. If the patient score is 13 to 15， it indicates that the patient has a mild TBI and is not in danger 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[80\\]</u>； with the help of this scoring scale， clinicians can determine the severity of the injury.**\n\n【65】**Evaluation of Cognitive Function**\n\n【66】**For assessment of cognitive function different tests have been conducted like-**\n\n【67】**King-Devick test**\n\n【68】**King-Devick is a concussion screening test used to assess the patient's cognitive health because after TBI， the hippocampus， also known as the memory store， is disrupted， resulting in post-injury cognitive impairment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[81\\]</u>. If the patient's cognitive function is disrupted， it indicates the severity of the damage because it has been seen that in severe TBI， cognitive or memory function is impaired82.**\n\n【69】**The doctor analyses the patient’s cognitive performance with the assistance of this KD test， which consists of several cards with numbers printed on them， and the patient reads the number aloud. This test takes less than 2 min to complete， and the clinician scores the patient based on the time required.**\n\n【70】**Evaluation ofMotorFunction**\n\n【71】**Balance Error Scoring System (BESS)**\n\n【72】**BESS is an important tool for evaluating the patient's postural stability and motor function； in this subject， perform some simple activities such as opening the eyes， falling out of the initial position， movement of the hands， lifting the toes， remaining out of the same position for more than 5 sec， simply walking in a straight line， and so on. Clinicians use these functions to assess the patient's motor function and postural stability 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[83\\]</u>.**\n\n【73】**Blood biomarker analysis**\n\n【74】**These are crucial tools in the diagnosis of a TBI. Using these blood biomarker tests； clinicians may quickly evaluate the degree of the damage and the status of the TBI. Various biomarker analyses， such as levels of S100B， MMPs， HMGB1， TAU protein， and Galentin-3， can be performed. If the level of these protein biomarkers in the bloodstream significantly increases， it indicates the severity of the injury because these protein biomarkers are somehow involved in the injury， some of which are released from the damaged cell and further ameliorate the injury condition， and some of which are involved in worsening the primary injury to secondary injury and at that time通用删除6(英):<u>\\[84\\]</u>. These biomarkers are released into the bloodstream or CSF by blood plasma analysis. These proteins are identified in an excessive**\n\n【75】**amount， indicating the severity of the damage， and are utilized as a diagnostic tool.**\n\n【76】**Neuroimaging for diagnosis of TBI**\n\n【77】**Neuroimaging techniques can be used for the diagnosis of brain injury these are of various types and they will provide injury status of the brain 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[85\\]</u>，andtheamount of injury received by the brain generally Computed Tomography (CT)， Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)， Positron Emission Tomography (PET) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[86\\]</u>. CT is a widely used neuroimaging technique for the diagnosis of brain injury because it is a fast and highly accurate process in the detection of skull fracture and hemorrhage， it is generally indicated for moderate and severe TBI where GCS score is less than or equals to 12 (GCS ≤ 12) and for the patient who is suffering from persistent headache， seizures， amnesia， loss of consciousness， etc. CT is able to reflect the size， shape， and distribution of the brain tissue， but there is a limitation with the CT that it is unable to detect all types of brain injury 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[87\\]</u>**\n\n【78】**The second widely used neuroimaging technique is MRI， it can provide detailed information of the concussion， tissue injury， and hemodynamics， by the help of MRI clinician is able to detect the minute bleeding， contusion or it is able to detect changes in the brain function. Nowadays PET imaging technique has increased attention clinically in detecting the condition of the brain after TBI in this radiotracer is used to detect the injury generally， Fluorodeoxyglucose(FDG) is the most widely used radiotracer， by the help of (PET) clinicians are able to analyze a single biomarker like TAU protein level in the brain， amyloid-B level， etc.， 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[88\\]</u>.**\n\n【79】**Current drug therapy used in TBI**\n\n【80】**TBI is a serious problem all over the world. Generally， at the time of impact， primary injury occurs， which is unpreventable； however， if the patient remains untreated or undiagnosed，the condition worsens and leads to secondary brain injury， which is the leading cause of death； various factors are involved in secondary injury， which can exacerbate the injury.**\n\n【81】**Many drugs that can undergo clinical trials and have the ability to reduce the incidence and disastrous effect of secondary injury， many of them inhibit secondary injury and increase the chance of the patient becoming healthy， these are some drugs that can be used in TBI like N-acetyl cysteine， minocycline，phenserine， progesterone， Erythropoietin， Glibenclamide、 Iminocycline， propranolol， Tranexamic acid， Valproic acid， simvastatin， Cyclosporine.**\n\n【82】**N-acetyl cysteine**\n\n【83】**N-acetyl cysteine is a key neuroprotective drug thatTcan increase the level of GSH in the brain because GSH possesses (ROS) scavenging characteristics 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[89\\]</u>.NAC will also lower Tau proteins and amyloid-deposition in the brain and serve as an anti-inflammatory agent.

MINO is also known to decrease microglial activation and IL-1 release， both of which can contribute to an inflammatory response and exacerbate damage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[92\\]</u>. It will also diminish TBI-induced locomotor abnormalities， which will enhance long-term results post-TBI. At a dosage of 100 mg BID for 7 days， MINO will drastically lower S100B and NSE levels 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9331\\]</u>.**\n\n【86】**Cyclosporine A**\n\n【87】**Cyclosporine is a commonly used immunosuppressant medicine with a neuroprotective effect because CsA suppresses apoptosis and the mitochondrial permeability transition pore， preventing mitochondrial damage after TBI， 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[94\\]</u> CsA’s neuroprotective impact is dose-dependent， and its therapeutic window lasts up to 24 h after damage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[95\\]</u>.

Hypercalcemia develops in approximately 10% of the sarcoidosis patients while it has also been described in patients with other granulomatous diseases such as tuberculosis. This abnormality of calcium metabolism is caused by the dysregulated production of calcitriol by activated macrophages in the granulomatous foci of sarcoidosis. Undetected hypercalcemia may have deleterious sequela in sarcoidosis patients， especially without a previous diagnosis， such as nephrocalcinosis and renal failure. This metabolic defect may be exacerbated by sun exposure，phosphorus or vitamin D intake.**\n\n【12】**We present seven cases of sarcoidosis to define the clinical features of such patients who are prone to develop hypercalcemia induced by vitamin D treatment. While only two of our patients had a previously diagnosed sarcoidosis， it was detected in the others while investigating the cause of hypercalcemia. Given the rarity of hypercalcemia due to sarcoidosis and its crucial consequences， it is an imperative that the clinicians should definitely consider the possibility of sarcoidosis before commencing vitamin D treatment to their patients. The sarcoidosis features of our case series reveal the criteria required for clinicians to suspect a possible sarcoidosis disease antecedently and to determine the diagnosis before iatrogenic hypercalcemia develops.**\n\n【13】**Keywords： Sarcoidosis； Hypercalcemia； Vitamin D； Iatrogenic hypercalcemia**\n\n【14】**Introduction**\n\n【15】**Hypercalcemia is a relatively common clinical problem that results when the entry of calcium into the circulation exceeds the excretion of calcium into the urine or deposition in bone. It has been described mostly in patients with granulomatous diseases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1-3\\]</u>. Among them， sarcoidosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4-10\\]</u> and tuberculosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11-15\\]</u> are probably the most common. Sarcoidosis is a chronic granulomatous disorder of unknown origin characterized by the presence of non-classified granulomas in various organs including lung disease in 95% of the patients while eyes， skin and lymph nodes are other commonly involved organs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16-17\\]</u>. Hypercalcemia occurs in 4% to 11% of the sarcoidosis patients caused by the increased conversion of 25-hydroxyvitamin D to 1，25-hydroxyvitamin D by the enzyme 25-hydroxyvitamin-D-1a-hydroxylase in the macrophages of pulmonary alveoli and granulomas \\[5-7，18\\].**\n\n【16】**_1173._**\n\n【17】**We report seven cases of sarcoidosis patients who presented with hypercalcemia due to prior vitamin D treatment. Hypercalcemia is a well-known metabolic feature of sarcoidosis that may lead to serious clinical consequences if undetected. In patients with a previously known or unknown sarcoidosis diagnosis， clinicians should be meticulous for hypercalcemia in regard to its significant challenges before commencing vitamin D treatment to their patients. In this case series， the clinical manifestations of sarcoidosis patients with iatrogenic hypercalcemia are investigated. Our aim is to define the clinical features of sarcoidosis patients who are prone to develop a possible iatrogenic hypercalcemia thereby to predict and prevent the occurrence of high serum calcium levels beforehand in patients with or without a previously known sarcoidosis diagnosis.**\n\n【18】**Case 1**\n\n【19】**_cited._ A 42-year-old male presented with a 2-weeks history of fever and dysuria.

It has also been described in granulomatous disorders such as sarcoidosis， tuberculosis， berylliosis and leprosy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1-4\\]</u>. Sarcoidosis is a chronic disease characterized by granulomatous inflammation and the presence of non-classified granulomas in the involved organs， mainly the lungs， lymph nodes and skin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16-18\\]</u>. Hypercalcemia is detected in approximately 10% of the sarcoidosis patients due to the abnormal calcium metabolism secondary to increased synthesis of calcitriol by macrophages 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4-7\\]</u>. We present seven cases ofiatrogenic hypercalcemia due to vitamin D treatment in patients with or without a previously known sarcoidosis diagnosis.**\n\n【40】**The most crucial feature of these patients was the presence of sarcoidosis associated hypercalcemia that was exacerbated due to the prior vitamin D treatment commenced for osteoporosis or vitamin D deficiency. The second point was the presence of advanced sarcoidosis designated as stage III in all patients. The third hallmark was the existence of three organ sarcoidosis in these cases. Following steroid treatment， the clinical course of sarcoidosis became stable while the calcium levels returning to normal in each patient. The triangulation point of these cases was the necessityto undergoa thorough evaluation in terms sarcoidosis， that may lead to iatrogenichypercalcemia， for all patients who are be treated with vitamin D since it is well-known that unnoticed or in discriminable hypercalcemia may lead to deleterious effects. As the results of our study indicate， some clinical features of sarcoidosis appear to be useful in predetermining the probability of iatrogenic hypercalcemia that may develop following vitamin D treatment in sarcoidosis patients with or without a previous known diagnosis.**\n\n【41】**hypercalcemia in sarcoidosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. Albright et al. have shown that hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria in sarcoidosis was due to the elevated levels of vitamin D 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. Bell et al. have revealed that levels of 1，25-dihyroxy vitamin D was the cause for abnormal calcium metabolism in sarcoidosis patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>. Since vitamin D production is substrate-dependent， the development of hypercalcemia due to vitamin Dtreatment in patients with sarcoidosis is a great possibility. It is well-known that special care is required in sarcoidosis patients who are to be supplemented with vitamin D or calcium 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u> and thereby close monitoring of serum calcium levels is required to prevent the occurrence ofhypercalcemia in these patients. Seven cases developed hypercalcemia due to the vitamin D treatment while only one of these had a previously diagnosed sarcoidosis in our case series. Presence of unidentified sarcoidosis in patients to be treated with vitamin D appears to be a crucial risk for iatrogenic hypercalcemia. Such a possibility should always be considered by clinicians.**\n\n【42】**In patients with a medical history of sarcoidosis in their background， the effects of vitamin D treatment can be easily monitored. The problem arises inpatients with a previously undiagnosed sarcoidosis when exogenous vitamin D supplementation is commenced. The deleterious outcome of high serum calcium may occur through organs such as the heart. Drawback becomes extremely crucial especially if patients are in an asymptomatic clinical profile for sarcoidosis that may lead to severe consequences if unnoticed or if a delay occurs for diagnosis. In our case series of seven patients， the greatest problem was that only two of the patients had a previously identified sarcoidosis while all of the patients were completely asymptomatic and did not even show the slightest clue relevant to sarcoidosis. The hallmark of these cases is that it may be necessary to evaluate patients for sarcoidosis before starting vitamin D treatment to avoid the serious clinical side effects of iatrogenic hypercalcemia.**\n\n【43】**There are some points associated with the weakness of our case series size. The first is the small sample size consisting of only seven patients. This is probably related tothelow incidence ofhypercalcemia in sarcoidosis patients. The other point is that all patients in our series were of Caucasian origin. It is well-known that sarcoidosis may exhibit many different manifestations according to race or genetic differences in terms of the clinical profile， involved organs，treatment response and disease course. Consequently， studies including a large number of patients from different races with distinct genetic characteristics are required to achieve more precise and explicit results. Whether the patients had a previous diagnosis of sarcoidosis or not， it would be extremely useful to define the clinical criteria to predict the probability of iatrogenic hypercalcemia in such cases， as only two ofthe patients had a previously identified sarcoidosis.**\n\n【44】**The important hallmark of our case series is the common features and the mutual clinical profle shared by all ofour sarcoidosis patients who developed hypercalcemia due to vitamin Dtreatment. The first is that they had advanced sarcoidosis compatible with stage III disease. Second， each subject had a chronic and persistent sarcoidosis profile that required steroid treatment. The third point was that the patients had three organ involvement including lung， eye， skin or lymph node. The fourth and perhaps the most interesting aspect of our cases was that the patients presented with atypical symptoms or with a bizarre clinical profile that were not easily to be attributed to sarcoidosis although they had stage III disease. Hypercalcemia in sarcoidosis is caused by the abnormality of the calcium metabolism induced by the increased synthesis of calcitriol or vitamin D by macrophages**\n\n【45】**of the granulomatous lesions. High levels of active vitamin D due to hydroxylase activity in macrophages is the most probable cause of hypercalcemia but overproduction of bone resorbing cytokines and parathyroid-related peptide may also play a role 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23-25\\]</u>. As hypercalcemia is due to the abnormal calcium metabolism secondary to increased synthesis of calcitriol by macrophages that are abundant in granulomas， patients with multiple organ involvement appear to carry a more significant risk of hypercalcemia due to the high load of granulomatous tissue. As clearly seen from our cases， the risk of hypercalcemia in sarcoidosis may have arisen due to the high granuloma load due to three organ involvement. The hazard of may also be associated advanced sarcoidosis stage. The presence of these two aforementioned criteria appears to be extremely helpful to anticipate hypercalcemia in such patients. Sarcoidosis associated hypercalcemia can present with an insidious clinical picture that may cause a diagnostic challenge for the clinician and thereby requires a great suspicion for its identification. Existence of previously undiagnosed sarcoidosis should always be considered for patients for whom vitamin D treatment is to be commenced.Common clinical features of sarcoidosis patients in our case series appear to be useful in predicting or identifying the patients who carry a risk of iatrogenic hypercalcemia.**\n\n【46】**Conclusion**\n\n【47】**Sarcoidosis may occur unnoticed due to its asymptomatic and insidious clinical nature. In patients with a previously diagnosed or undiagnosed sarcoidosis， clinicians should bear in mind the possibility for the existence of this disorder because vitamin D treatment may lead to significantly high serum calcium levels that may cause deleterious effects. Hypercalcemia of sarcoidosis is due to the abnormal calcium metabolism secondary to increased synthesis of calcitriol by macrophages that are abundant in granulomatous lesions or tissues. Consequently， advanced disease and triple organ involvement in sarcoidosis patients appears to carry a significant hazard for vitamin D induced hypercalcemia due to the higher burden of granulomas comprising numerous macrophages that lead to increased synthesis of calcitriol. Clinical features of sarcoidosis identified among our sarcoidosis case series can be useful to identify patients that carry a high risk of developing iatrogenic hypercalcemia who are to be treated with calcitriol whether or not they present with a prior diagnosis of sarcoidosis. Clinicians should also bear in mind that patients may be completely asymptomatic， may appear with symptoms or a clinical profile that cannot be easily predicated to sarcoidosis.**\n\n【48】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【49】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**1\\.

Iatrogenic vascular injury to the jugular and carotid vessels and branches of the neck during surgery is usually the cause for major bleedings during the immediate postoperative period， lasting up to 3 days. Delayed bleeding is usually the result of tracheal erosion by a major artery，leading to pseudoaneurysms or fistulae 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. In most cases， the innominate artery is involved， resulting in Trachea-Innominate Artery Fistula(TIAF)， with mortality rates reaching 100% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. In some cases， sentinel bleeding， hemoptysis， or pulsation around the cannula may precede. In the past， the only treatment options for acute and delayed bleeding were open surgery to repair， ligate or resect the damaged vessels. Once the bleeding is controlled， repair of the tracheal fistula is indicated. Reported success rates following surgical repairs are low， with high morbidity and mortality of more than 75% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. In recent years， an endovascular approach is replacing the need for surgery， with higher survival rates of over 70%and fewer complications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. We sought to describe our experience with endovascular treatments for immediate and delayed post-tracheostomy hemorrhage.**\n\n【22】**Methods**\n\n【23】**The Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guidelines for reporting observational studies and the Case Report (CARE) guidelines were followed in the study.**\n\n【24】**Design and settings**\n\n【25】**After receiving the Institution Review Board (IRB) approval， a retrospective chart review was conducted. Three patients who were treated for acute life-threatening post-tracheostomy bleeding with endovascular stenting during 2014 to 2016 qualified.**\n\n【26】**Participants**\n\n【27】**All patients were admitted to the Emergency Department (ED) after stomal bleeding had already commenced at home and were treated in a single medical center with a multidisciplinary team of professionals from head and neck surgery， vascular surgery， and Interventional Radiology (IR) departments. Diagnostic imaging studies were performed on all patients and included CTA scans. Follow-up period was of up to one year with no evidence of recurrent bleeding in any of presented patients.**\n\n【28】**Interventional angiography**\n\n【29】**Emergent interventional angiography was performed through a 10Fr. sheath via a brachial or femoral approach. Stent grafts were used in all patients (Bard Fluency， C. R. Bard， Inc. New Jersey，USA)， with the additional use of a balloon expandable stent (Medtronic Assurant Cobalt， Medtronic Inc. Minneapolis， USA) in some. After the procedure， patients were closely monitored in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for several days before being discharged home.**\n\n【30】**Brief patient presentations and clinical findings**\n\n【31】**PatientA： A72-vear-old male with ischemic heart disease treated with a coronary bypass 5 years ago， developed acute pulmonary edema and respiratory distress due to severe aortic stenosis. He was intubated and later underwent tracheostomy. On the 40h day following surgery (POD 40)， the patient presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with an active bleeding exiting the stomal area. Immediately upon arrival to the hospital the tracheostomy cuff was inflated. The patient was rushed to CTA， followed by an urgent diagnostic angiography in the IR unit. A large right subclavian artery pseudoaneurysm was detected . Through a 10Fr. sheath right brachial artery approach， three stent grafts sized 12 mm to 13.5 mm， were placed in an overlapping manner. Next， a 10mm balloon expandable stent was placed in the subclavian artery origin， followed by remodeling with 12 mm balloon inflation. The patient was then transferred to the ICU and was discharged after a week.**\n\n【32】**No complications due to the angiography were seen. Six months following the procedure， the patient remained asymptomatic.**\n\n【33】**Patient B： A 75-year-old woman was brought to the ED following a sentinel bleeding from the tracheostomy cannula. She had been put on assisted ventilation and underwent tracheostomy 3 months prior due to a right-sided hemisphere stroke. Upon arrival to the ED， acute intractable bleeding begun. The patient was immediately transferred to the Operating Room (OR)， for laryngotracheoscopy. During the procedure the bleeding had already stopped， and the origin was not traced. She was then transferred to CTA， which demonstrated the source of the bleeding from a TIAF . The patient was rushed to the IR unit， where a 12 mm stent graft was inserted to the innominate and subclavian arteries， covering the right common carotid artery origin， through a 10Fr. sheath right brachial approach. A control of the bleeding was achieved. As the patient had already suffered from a right sided stroke， no sequela following the procedure was seen. A post procedural CTA demonstrated accurate stent position without evidence of residual bleeding. In the ICU the patient had undergone a successful cardiac resuscitation following an arrest， due to significant blood loss. The patient was weaned from mechanical ventilation 3 days after the procedure. On follow-up， 9months after the incident， she remained asymptomatic.**\n\n【34】**Patient C： An 80-year-old woman presented had undergone tracheostomy following prolonged intubation 8 months ago. She was admitted to the ED due to acute and significant bleeding from the stomal area. Hemostasis was achieved by inflating the tracheostomy balloon and local dressing pressure. An emergency angiography demonstrated TIAF . Through a 10Fr. sheath right femoral approach， a 13.5 mm stent graft was placed in the innominate artery， followed by 14 mm balloon inflation. Control of the bleeding was achieved. The patient was discharged from the ICU after a week. On one year follow-up the patient remained asymptomatic.**\n\n【35】**Discussion**\n\n【36】**Anysignificantbleedingfollowinggtracheostomyy。eeither immediate or delayed is a potential life-threatening complication. Peak incidence and the risk for bleeding are found during the first6 weeks after surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Most of delayed postoperative bleedings are the result of TIAF and in more than 50% of cases， a sentinel bleeding occurs. Risk factors associated with an increased risk for TIAF are low tracheal ring incisions (lower than 3ring)， which lead to cannula-induced constant arterial pressure， surgical site infection and overinflated cuff that can cause pressure necrosis to the tracheal wal 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Following angiography， all three patients survived the procedures， without re-interventions. No neurological sequala was**\n\n【37】**Figure 1： A).

Follow-up period was of up to one year with no evidence of recurrent bleeding in any of presented patients.**\n\n【41】**Surgery to control early and delayed postoperative bleeding in general， and specifically in cases of TIAF， is still considered the treatment of choice. Ligation or resection of the innominate artery and repair of the fistula is usually performed via a median sternotomy approach， with the use of grafts if needed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Complications following surgery include cerebral hypoperfusion that may lead to stroke， graft infection， high risks of re-bleeding and poor survival rates. Wang et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u> reported a 7% 1-year survival rate following a surgical TIAF repair 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.**\n\n【42】**Taechariyakul et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u> published in a recent literature review of 260 cases， a comparison between surgical and endovascular interventions for TIAF. Endovascular approach was associated with significantly lower complication rate of 30%， compared to 50%in open surgery. Significantly lower 30-day mortality rate of 9% in endovascular approach was also seen， compared to 23% in open surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.**\n\n【43】**In a recently published systematic review by O'malley et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u> covering 27 patients who underwent endovascular interventions for**\n\n【44】**TIAF， 23% of patients were hemodynamically unstable， and 96%were treated with stent grafts. They reported re-bleeding in 19% of patients， that required re-intervention， and rescue sternotomy in11%.Overall mortality rate was 30% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.Our results support the use of endovascular treatments for post-tracheostomy bleeding， as a safe alternative to surgery， and further contribute to the growing body of evidence published in the literature.**\n\n【45】**Conclusion**\n\n【46】**Post tracheostomy bleeding， either acute or delayed， is a life-threatening complication that require prompt diagnosis， as well as immediate assessment for respiratory and hemodynamically instability in the patient. A multidisciplinary teamwork is needed to decide on the proper treatment in each patient， to maximize the odds for survival.

Diagnosis of RE is based on clinical and neuro-radiological criteria based on European consensus criteria proposed on 2005 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Progressive neuroimaging deterioration indicates the chronic inflammatory nature of the disease.**\n\n【34】**This disorder is rare and usually affects children with median age of onset 6 years， but our patient presents at early age. Delayed presentation may also reported by Klaa et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. There is no gender preference. RE almost in every patients involved one hemisphere of brain which progressively atrophied in the course of time， typical disease course usually follow the pattern of variable prodromal period which is usually contains minor sign and symptoms of viral fever then the patients enters in to the acute stage which is characterized by progressive deterioration of functions of the affected hemispheres like hemiparesis， hemianopia， cognitive deterioration， aphasia and predominantly intractable unilateral focal motor seizure with or without secondary generalization 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6-8\\]</u>. Epilepsia Partialis Continua (EPC) in the form of focal myoclonic twitching of facial muscles or muscles of distal extremities persisted for more than one hour with seizure free interval less than ten seconds is one of the characteristics features of RE that may present among half of the patients. Some patients may present without any evidence of seizures. Acute stage of the disease usually persists around 8 to 10months thereafter a phase of residual stage came which have a stable neurological deficit but seizure activity remains high but low**\n\n【35】**compared to acute stage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8-10\\]</u>. Several studies has been carried out to search the etiology of RE，Rasmussen and their colleagues in their index paper suggested slow viral infection as a causative factors but still it is neither established nor excluded as a causal association 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Antibody mediated pathogenetic hypothesis originated in 1994， antibodies to subunit 3 of the AMPA receptor (Glu R3 antibodies) had been suggested to dominate pathogenesis. Other anti-neuronal antibodies such as Munc-18， and the alpha7-acetylcholine receptor were identified in some patients with RE 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12-14\\]</u>. Function of cytotoxic T cells is now considered in the pathogenesis of RE， where affected hemispheres found to be infiltrated with cytotoxic CD8+T cell， astrocytic degeneration caused by cytotoxic T lymphocyte attack give rise to neuronal cell death and seizure induction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. Abnormal Electroencephalography (EEG) as slow background with slow focal and epileptic abnormalities in the lesion hemisphere present in the acute stage later on interictal abnormal discharge may appear on unaffected hemispheres 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. Brain MRI is one of the best tools for diagnostic evaluation and to assess the prognosis of the disease， at the early stage unilateral hyper intensity in T2， FLAIR image noticed in the cortical， subcortical region， then unihemispheric atrophy sets on， our case typically follow those changes. Most of the tissue loss happens from the 12 months onset of symptoms. Usually post contrast enhancement less commonly present in RE. Functional imaging like Flurodeoxyglucose-Positron Emission Tomography(FDG-PET) shows diffuse hypometabolism of affected segment\\[17，18\\]. Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) studies showed decreased N-Acetyl-Aspartate (NAA) levels and increased or normal choline peaks resulting in a decreased NAA/Cho-ratio suggestive of neuronal loss or dysfunction \\[7，19\\].**\n\n【36】**As the etiology is still clearly not known so the treatment is aimed to symptoms and inflammation， to control seizure and to prevent further deterioration of neurological deficit effective AEDs， immunotherapy and surgery are the main modalities of treatment. Immunosuppressive， immunomodulatory and antiviral treatment approaches have been tried in different studies， among them corticosteroid found to be effective on seizure control and neurological improvement. Forlong term steroid therapy started with bolus methylprednisolone 20 mg/kg to 30 mg/kg， followed by oral prednisolone 1 mg/kg to 2 mg/kg for months then slow tapering. Here in our patients we followed the regimen with significant improvement in seizure remission and also there is improvement observed in motor， speech and cognitive domain. IVIG and IVIG plus steroid other modalities of immunotherapy also found effective by some reports 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. Tacrolimus also found as superior outcome regarding neurological function but not found as effective as seizure control 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>. Other immunotherapies targeting to T-cells like cyclophosphamide， natalizumab and alemtuzumab helps to reduce the inflammatory reaction of RE patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. Epilepsy surgery may consider in case of refractory epilepsy for seizure control but neurological deficit could not be avoided. Functional hemispherectomy and hemispherotomy are associated with lower complications compared to anatomical hemispherectomies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.**\n\n【37】**As the etiology of the disease is still controversial so specific managementapproach detected at _F_ pathogenic factors， most work is now directed to the activation of infiltration CD8+ T cells and microglia to ensure the alternative of surgical management. Early suspicion at early stage with proper management to halt the inflammatory process will help to prevent neurological deficits.**\n\n【38】**Conclusion**\n\n【39】**Rasmussenencephalitis is a rarechroni1cCprogressive unihemispheric inflammatory disease manifested with recurrent focal seizure， hemiparesis and neurocognitive deterioration. Neuroimage， EEG findings， early suspicion with exclusion of possible differential diagnosis may help to diagnose the patients earlier and will add better prognosis.**\n\n【40】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【41】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**1\\.

Although Thyroglobulin (TG) is rarely expressed in MTC， our previous studies found that there was a certain percentage of TG-positive MTC in clinical practice. We hereby aimed to explore the clinicopathological features of MT'C cases with positive expression of TG.**\n\n【14】**Methods： We conducted a retrospective study from June 2006 to October 2017. All the recruited cases were divided into two groups： TG-positive group and TG-negative group. Demographics， clinical profiles and pathological details were reviewed and following immunohistochemical analyses were conducted for recruited cases.**\n\n【15】**Results： Of All patients included， 25 were female and 25 were male， with a medium age of 46.7 years old. The proportion of cases with a tumor mass smaller than 1 cm in diameter in the TG-positive group was significantly higher than that in the TG-negative group (46.15% \\[6/13\\] vs. 5.56%\\[2/36\\]， P=0.001). The proportion of clinical stage I and stage II MTC cases in the TG-positive group was significantly higher than that in the TG-negative group (53.85% \\[7/13\\] vs. 11.11%\\[4/36\\]，P=0.001). In addition， the number of patients with lymph node metastases in the TG-positive group was significantly smaller than that in the TG-negative group (P=0.016). And the TG-positive group had a lower rate of calcium salt deposition than the TG-negative group (7.14%\\[1/14\\] vs. 36.11%\\[13/36\\]， P=0.045). The TG-positive groups had also lower rate of tumors with Amyloid deposits than the TG-negative group (50% \\[7/14\\] vs. 83.3% \\[30/36\\]，P=0.016). Immunohistochemical tests showed that TG-positive cells were not only limited to the follicular structures， but also expressed in non-follicular structures such as nests， cords and sheet structures. TG-positive cells showed partially synchronous immune response to CT， CgA， Syn and CEA， which could be differentiated from mixed medullary follicular carcinoma， suggesting that TG positive cells are not the remnants of the thyroid follicular cells. MTC cells showed the ability to express TG and CT， CgA， Syn， CEA simultaneously.**\n\n【16】**Conclusion： TG-positive MTC cases had significantly smaller size of tumor， lower rate of lymph node metastasis， earlier clinical stages， and better prognosis than TG-negative MTC cases in this study.**\n\n【17】**Keywords： Medullary thyroid carcinoma； Thyroglobulin； CT； CEA； CgA；Syn**\n\n【18】**Introduction**\n\n【19】**Medullary Thyroid Cancer (MTC) is the third most common thyroid malignancy. It is an independent clinicopathologic entity， with unique incident rate and specialized methods for diagnosis and treatment. It originates from the parafollicular or Calcitonin-producing cells (Ccells) and maintains the features ofthese cells \\[1，2\\]. Computed tomography assay is of great significance to the diagnosis of thyroid myelin cancer. However， pathological diagnosis is currently considered to be the gold standard for the diagnosis ofthyroid myelin-like cancer， and with the popularization and application of new molecular detection techniques in pathological practice， pathological diagnosis has developed into the era of organic combination of morphological diagnosis and molecular pathology diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Thyroglobulin (TG) has been used as a marker for thyroid carcinoma for many years due to its high sensitivity and specificity to different thyroid carcinomas. TG is**\n\n【20】**expressed in more than 95% of papillary and follicular carcinomas， but usually reduced in poorly differentiated carcinoma and absent in anaplastic carcinoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4-6\\]</u>. Hales et al discovered TG-positive immunoreaction in MTC that does not produce TG normally通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Scholars had different interpretations on it， but the biological significance ofthe TG in MTC is rarely discussed. There was a report that conducted clinicopathological and prognostic analysis of the MTC with immunoreaction to TG in China 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>， but it was speculated that the TG-positive cells were in the remnants of thyroid follicular cells or the atypical follicular carcinoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.**\n\n【21】**In this study， TG-positive cells were not only limited to the follicular structures， but also present in non-follicular structures such as nested， bundle-like and fluke structures as well. Thus， we compared similarities and differences of clinical， histological and immunohistochemical features between the TG-positive and the TG-negative MTC groups， and then discussed possible clinical treatments and prognosis.**\n\n【22】**Patients and Methods**\n\n【23】**Patients**\n\n【24】**A total of 210 cases of MTC were surgically and pathologically diagnosed in Zhejiang Cancer Hospital from June 2006 to October2017， from which only 50 cases were included in the retrospective statistical analyses，excluding 160 cases that do not meet the diagnostic criteria .**\n\n【25】**The inclusion criteria were as follows： 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> WHO performance status of I to II； 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> serum calcitonin (CT) level ≥ 500 pg/Ml； 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> Pathological diagnosis met MTC standards； 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> The patient had a serum TG test. The exclusion criteria were as follows： 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> There was no pathological tissue examination or the clinical data were incomplete；通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> the patient had significant cardiac， hematopoietic， hepatic， or renal dysfunction or received chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy within 4 weeks before random assignment.**\n\n【26】**All patients provided written informed consents. This study protocol was consistent with the ethical guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Institution of Anji Hospital， Zhejiang University (IRB number： 2018AN0381).**\n\n【27】**Demographics， levels of serum CT， TG and other biomedical indicators， pathological diagnostics and clinical data of all the recruited patients were collected. The clinical manifestations， TNM stages \\[9，10\\]， pathological characteristics and prognosis were summarized. Pathological analysis was carried out by Hematoxylin-Eosin (HE) pathological staining and immunologic tissue chemistry.**\n\n【28】**Immunohistochemistry**\n\n【29】**Formalin-Fixed _d_ Paraffin-Embeddedd(FFPE)tissie sections were stained with HE for histologic examination. Immunostaining was performed to the FFPE sections using antibodies against thyroglobulin (TG， 1：600， DAKO)， Calcitonin (CT， 1：150， DAKO)， Chromogranin A (CgA， 1：600， DAKO)， Synaptophysin (Syn， 1：150， DAKO)， Thyroid Transcription Factor-1(TTF-1， 1：1500， DAKO)， Ki-67(1：1000， DAKO) and Carcinoembryonic Antigen (CEA，1：600， DAKO) using an indirect immunoperoxidase technique. All antibodies were from DAKO (Denmark). For antibody staining， sections were heated for antigen retrieval for 5 min at 120°C in 0.01M citrate buffer pH 9.0. The immunohistochemical method was an indirect method for peroxidase labeling. The positive staining of TG， CT， CgA and Syn was localized in the cytoplasm， the positive staining**\n\n【30】**of CEA was located in the capsule， and the positive staining of TTF-land Ki-67 was located in the nucleus. Brown indicated positive， while no staining indicated negative.**\n\n【31】**Statistical methods**\n\n【32】**Values are presented as Mean ± SEM. Statistical analyses were conducted using Graph Prism software (SAS Institute). Statistical comparisons between groups were analyzed for significance by two-tailed t test or one-way ANOVA with Chi-square test.

The TG-positive group (10 females and 4 males) accounted for 71.43%，and the TG-negative group (15 females and 21 males) accounted for41.67%. The medium age of TG-positive group was 52 years， while the medium age of the TG-negative group was 48 years. However， there was no statistical significance between two groups in gender or age. Among all cases， 8 had a tumor smaller than 1 cm in diameter，41 larger than 1 cm in diameter， and 1 with unknown tumor size. Among cases with a tumor smaller than 1 cm， 6 were TG-positive， accounting for 46.15% of all TG-positive cases， and only 2 were TG negative， accounting for 5.56% of all TG-negative cases (P=0.001). Among all cases， 11 were diagnosed with Stage I or II MTC， and38 with Stage III or higher. Among all Stage I and II MTC cases， 7were TG-positive， accounting for 53.8% of 13 TG-positive cases， and4 were TG-negative， accounting for only 11.1% of all TG-negative cases (P=0.001). The results showed significant differences between the TG-positive and the TG-negative groups in tumor size and MTC staging. However， there was no significant difference between the two groups in mass number， the range of the affected thyroid gland and the level of calcitonin .**\n\n【36】**Pathologic characteristics between the TG-positive and the TG-negative groups**\n\n【37】**The pathological diagnosis of MTC remains the gold standard.

However， the study on expression of TG in MTC is rarely reported worldwide.**\n\n【58】**This study retrospectively analyzed 50 MTC cases with TG tested， in order to further understand characteristics and biological significance of TG-positive MTC， and to speculate that whether TG could be used as an indicator of the prognosis for MTC.**\n\n【59】**In this study， we found that there were more females than males in 14 cases of TG-positive MTC， and the average age of onset was**\n\n【60】**Figure 4： A) The immunohistochemical tests of CT， which was strongly positive expressian in cancer-cytoplasm of MTC (x100)： B： The immunohistochemical tests of CgA， which was weakly pasitive expression in cancer- cytoplasm of MTC (x100)； C： The immunahistochemical tests of CEA， which was strangly pasitive expressian in cancer-cytoplasm of MTC (x100)； D： The immunahistochemical tests of Syn， which was strangly pasitive expressian in cancer-cytoplasm of MTC(x100)： E： The immunohistochemical tests of TTF-1， which was strangly positive expression in cancer-nucleus of MTC(x100)； F： Ki-67 The immunohistochemical tests of ki-67， which was sporadic positive expression in cancer-nucleus of MTC (x100).**\n\n【61】**46.7 years old， which is in agreement with the Tumors of Endocrine Organs， 2006 WHO in which the average age of onset of sporadic cases was 50 years old， with slightly higher incidence in females. We also found， 46.15% of cases in the TG-positive group have a tumor smaller than 1 cm in diameter， much higher than 5.56% in the TG-negative group. The number of cases with a tumor size more than 1cm was 0 in TG-positive MTC group and 7 in the TG-negative group. It is widely believed that the survival time of the MTC patients is shorter and the prognosis is poor when the tumor is larger than 4 cm in diameter. The proportion of late stage MTC (stage III or higher) in the TG-positive group was lower than that in the TG-negative group (46.15% vs. 88.89%， P=0.001)， which may indicate that TG positive MTC has better prognosis. According to some reports 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>， both a primary tumor diameter more than 4 cm and thyroid capsular invasion， which are both indicators of Stage III MTC， have an effect on the prognosis of MTC patients.**\n\n【62】**Pathological diagnosis is the gold standard. Microscopically， the tissues of the MTC are mainly composed of polygonal cells and spindle cells. The typical medullary carcinoma can be either well-defined or directly infiltrating the surrounding thyroid tissue. Nested， bundle-like and fluke structures can be found arranged in the tumor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. There are more or less fibrous septums full of vessels between tumor cell nests. Amyloid structure can be found in the intercellular space of the tumor and interstitial cells， which is composed of eosinophilic and amorphous substance produced by cancer cells through a variety of methods. In this study， the rate of the Amyloid substance deposition in tumor of the TG-positive group was significantly lower than that of the TG-negative group(50% vs. 83.33%， P=0.001). According to the histological structure， MTC can be divided into several histological types， which are often mixed. The diagnosis of MTC is mainly according to a variety of permutations composed of spindle cells and epithelioid cells， and combined with immunohistochemical expression of CT， CgA， Syn， CEAandTTF-1.Both TG-positive MTC and TG-negative MTC have a variety of structures： follicular structures also appear in the fluke type； glandular-like and follicular-like structures are mixed in nesting type； most of them have neuroendocrine structures. The proportion of follicular structures in two groups was similar， which indicates that the tumor cells of follicular structure may not necessarily express TG. The TG-positive cells are not necessarily the remaining thyroid follicular cells or the atypical follicular carcinoma.**\n\n【63】**Xu Lai et al. reported that the 15-year survival rate of MTC with nodular goiter was significantly higher than that of MTC without nodular goiter， indicating that the prognosis of MTC with nodular goiter was excellent 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. The proportion of nodular goiter in the TG-positive group was higher than that of the TG-negative group (64.3%vs.36.1%)， although there was no statistical difference， which could be due to small sample size and insufficient follow-up time in this study. The main route of MTC metastasis is regionallymph node metastasis. With the increase of tumor volume，the rate oflymph node metastasis is increased gradually. The most common sites of metastasis are tracheoesophageal groove lymph nodes and cervical lymph nodes， followed by upper mediastinal lymph nodes. Research showed that cervical lymph node metastasis is an important prognostic factor for MTC \\[13，14\\]. However， a multifactor analysis revealed that cervical lymph node metastasis might not be an independent risk factor for prognosis.**\n\n【64】**The rate of lymph node metastasis in the TG-positive group was significantly lower than that in the TG-negative group (50%**\n\n【65】**vs. 83.33%， P=0.016). One patient in the TG-positive group and5 patients in the TG-negative group had upper mediastinal lymph node metastases. Upper mediastinal lymph node metastasis is a characteristic of MTC. The upper mediastinal lymph node metastasis may spread from VI region lymph nodes along recurrent laryngeal nerve or from the pretracheal or paratracheal lymph nodes through lymph circulation. And the upper mediastinal lymph node metastasis may be an important cause of lung metastasis. No pulmonary metastases were found in patients of the two groups in this study.**\n\n【66】**The invasion of the thyroid capsular and vessel is related to a decreased survival rate of MTC patients. The TG-positive group had lower rate of capsular invasion (35.71% vs. 55.56%) and vascular invasion (14.29% vs. 16.67%) than the TG-negative group， but there was no significant difference. Tumor with vascular invasion is prone to distant metastasis. The most common distant metastatic sites are lung，liver， bone and brain. In this study， one case ofthe TG-negative group had lumbar and sacral metastases， but no distant metastases were found in the TG-positive group.**\n\n【67】**In the present， most of studies on MTC refer to CT and CEA， including serum level and immunohistochemical expression in tissue cells. Calcitonin is a sensitive and specific marker of MTC，and it is also an important indicator for preoperative diagnosis and postoperative follow-up. The high level of serum CEA>50% is reported to be high level in serum. The expression level of CEA is synchronous with CT通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. Previous study discovered that the combination of CT and CEA could increase the diagnostic sensitivity of MTC to 95.7% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. There are lot similarities between MTC and other thyroid tumors in the morphological characteristics； therefore， the diagnosis of medullary cancer by optical microscopy alone has certain risks and limitations. Immunohistochemical stainingis an important means of examination for auxiliary diagnosis. The commonly used markers include CT， CEA， CgA， Syn and TTF-1. A large majority of MTC tumor cells express CT. In this study， almost all cases of MTC expressed CT， except for one TG-positive case that was CT-negative， and one TG-negative case whose CT was unmeasured. In the TG-positive group， CT was mostly weakly or partially positive； indicating that CT may also be an important indicator of MTC prognosis， which supported the findings of our previous article in 2017， but the prognosis in MTC was still unclear 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. In this study， except for one CEA-negative case in each group， all other cases were positive for CEA. Positive immunoreactions to several neuroendocrine substances including CgA and Syn were detected in both TG-positive and TG-negative groups， which confirmed that MTC is endocrine-derived.**\n\n【68】**TTF-1 can be used as a marker of thyroid neuroendocrine carcinomas， such as medullary carcinoma. In this study， 2 cases in the TG-positive group and 5 cases in the TG-negative group showed negative results for TTF-1 staining， whereas the other cases were positive for TTF-1. TTF-1 was a more sensitive marker of thyroid carcinoma than other markers \\[17，18\\]. It is expressed in more than 90% of thyroid carcinomas， with the exception of anaplastic carcinoma in which its sensitivity is close to zero.**\n\n【69】**Few studies have focused on the expression of TG in MTC. Hales et al.， for the first time， proposed that TG is expressed in the MTC. Some researchers had conducted clinicopathological and prognostic analysis of MTC and found immunoreaction to TG 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>， which is consistent with the findings in this study that immunohistochemical TG-positive cells was not only limited to the follicular structures， but also present in non-follicular structures such as nested， bundle-like**\n\n【70】**and fluke structures， with partially synchronous immune response to CT， CgA， Syn and CEA as well， whereas the normal thyroid tissue wrapped around MTC did not show corresponding positive reactions.**\n\n【71】**MTC often invades the surrounding tissues and causes lymph node metastases. Therefore， early operation is the key to the treatment. Other therapeutic options including different extent of thyroidectomy， radiotherapy and chemotherapy schemes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20-22\\]</u>； however， few of them are effective in curing MTC. In recent years， great progress has been made in molecular targeted therapy. The 5years survival rate of MTC is about 60% to 75%； with early diagnosis and standardized treatment， the survival rate can reach 90%. This study found that， compared with TG-negative MTC， TG-positive MTC was significantly smaller in tumor size， had a lower rate of lymph node metastasis， and was inclined to be categorized into earlier clinical stages， which indicated better prognosis. There was one death 3 years after operation in the TG-positive group and one death five years after operation in the TG-negative group. There was no significant difference between two groups in survival rate， which may be due to the limited follow-up time. From our study， it can be speculated that TG can be an indicator of the prognosis of MTCand provide a theoretical basis for molecular targeted therapy.**\n\n【72】**There are some limitations in our study， including the limited number ofpatients and region， which cannot represent all MT'C cases globally. Furthermore， only a few patients got genetic tests due to financial limitations， so we did not carry out the analysis of molecular genetic characteristics. Nevertheless， so far there has been a very limited research on TG expression in MTC. This studyretrospectively analyzed a number of MTC cases with TG expression and found a relationship between pathological morphological characteristics and clinical prognosis of TG-positive and TG-negative MTC. Further studies with larger sample size and extended follow-up time combined with molecular biology indicators are required in the future to fully understand the biological significance of TG expression in MTC，and improve prognosis and clinical evaluation of treatment of MTC.**\n\n【73】**Acknowledgement**\n\n【74】This work was supported by the Department of Pathology， Zhejiang Cancer Hospital.\n\n【75】**Funding**\n\n【76】This Study was funded by public welfare research project of Huzhou Science and Technology Bureau (NO.2017GY61).\n\n【77】**Availability ofData and Material**\n\n【78】**All data generated or analyzed during this study are included in this published article.**\n\n【79】**Authors'Contribution**\n\n【80】**JS performed the majority of experiments and drafted the paper.

These bad habits include alcoholism， deep-frying， barbecue， high-salt and high-fat diet， coupled with environmental changes and fast life rhythm， such as staying up late， high-load work and other factors， which damage the body's immune defense function and lead to the occurrence of benign and malignant tumors including polyps 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.

However， so far there are no relevant researches on the distribution of TCM syndromes and related risk factors of patients with colorectal polyps in Shenzhen. Therefore， this paper discussed the distribution of TCM syndromes in patients with colorectal polyps in Shenzhen， and analyzed the correlation between related risk factors and TCM syndromes.**\n\n【23】Methods Complicating diseases\n\n【24】**Case data**\n\n【25】**This was a case retrospective study design. The patients who underwent electronic colonoscopy in the Department of Traditional Chinese Medicine (People's Hospital of Shenzhen Baoan District) were collected according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria from January 2016 to June 2021. The basic information including registration number， age， sex， admission diagnosis and TCM syndromes were recorded. A total of 296 eligible patients aged 27 to83 (52.62±9.85) were researched in this study， including 174 male patients (58.8%) and 122 female patients (41.2%).**\n\n【26】**We also collected the complicating diseases， that is， whether there Was hyperglycemia，hypertension， hyperlipidemia and Hyperuricemia (4H). The diagnostic criteria of the diseases were as follows： hyperglycemia (fasting blood glucose >6.1 mmol/L)， hypertension (systolic blood pressure >140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure >90 mmHg)， hyperlipidemia (total cholesterol>5.17mmol/L or triglyceride >1.43 mmol/L).**\n\n【27】**Statistical analysis**\n\n【28】**Diagnostic criteria**\n\n【29】**Diagnostic criteria of TCM： TCM syndrome types refer to “Diagnostic Criteria for Common TCM Syndrome”通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>， and“Internal Medicine of Traditional Chinese Medicine”published by Zhou Zhongying 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.

The measurement data was presented by mean and standard deviation. One-Way ANOVA was used for comparison of age among multiple groups， and LSD method was used for multiple comparisons among groups， the correlation of age with TCM syndromes was analyzed by Pearson Correlation Coefficient. The qualitative data including sex and complicating diseases were presented by proportion， and the overall distribution among groups was analyzed by Chi-square test， and the correlation was evaluated by Spearman Coefficient. P<0.05was considered to be that the difference was statistically significant.**\n\n【31】**Diagnostic criteria of western medicine： Colon polyps or rectal polyps were diagnosed according to electronic colonoscopy.**\n\n【32】**Result**\n\n【33】**Inclusion criteria Basicinformation of patients with various TCM syndromes**\n\n【34】**These patients had no household registration and lived in Shenzhen for more than 5 years， and conformed to the diagnostic criteria of colorectal polyps. The age was over 18 years old. Allpatients had been examined by electronic colonoscopy.**\n\n【35】**Exclusion criteria**\n\n【36】**These patients had ahistory ofcolonic polyps in the past but could not provide a detailed examination report or did not find polyps after colonoscopy again. Patients had incomplete case data or familial adenomatous polyposis or colon cancer confirmed by pathological diagnosis.**\n\n【37】**A total of 296 eligible patients with colorectal polyps were collected in this study. Eighty patients were deficiency-syndrome，and the highest proportion of patients (33%) was deficiency of spleen and stomach energy， followed by deficiency-cold of spleen and stomach(cold-syndrome due to deficiency of spleen and stomach-yang) and deficiency of yin fluid， each accounting for 24% . There were 179 patients with sthenia-syndrome， among which the highest proportion was the stagnation of phlegm-wetness (55%)， followed by stagnation of vital energy and damp-heat or phlegm-heat， which were15% and 12% respectively . Among them， damp-heat/phlegm-heat was mainly wetness-heat in large intestine or phlegm-**\n\n【38】**heat stagnation in lung. There were 37 patients with Asthenia-Syndrome Accompanied with Sthenia-Syndrome (ASASS)， of which the highest proportion was deficiency of vital energy and blood stasis， accounting for 35%， followed by deficiency of spleen energy and phlegm dampness/dyspepsia syndrome， accounting for 32% (Figure1C).**\n\n【39】**Appearance of intestinal polyps of all patients under electronic colonoscope**\n\n【40】**As shown in Figure 2， appearance of intestinal polyps of all patients under electronic colonoscope was different. The polyps in the patients with asthenia-syndrome were light， pale and tender， especially in these with deficiency of spleen and stomach energy， deficiency-cold of spleen and stomach， and deficiency of both vital energy and blood. While the intestinal mucosa was thin and the blood vessels were obviously exposed . On the contrary， significant hyperemia and edema was be found in the colon mucosa of the patients with sthenia-syndrome ， especially in the patients with wetness-heat or phlegm-heat stagnation， and heat-evil of liver and stomach. The blood vessels in the mucosa were purple and visible in the patients with blood stasis. As for the patients with ASASS， the mucosa was obviously marked with edema， while the polyp in the colon with phlegm-wetness with deficiency of yin fluid was red and swollen， and the blood vessels were clearly visible (Figure**\n\n【41】**2C).**\n\n【42】**Comparison of age and sex distribution of all patients**\n\n【43】**The results revealed that there were more men {47 cases) than women (33 cases) in the deficiency-syndrome group ， but there is no statistical difference in the overall distribution of gender among various deficiency syndromes， and there is no statistical difference in the average age between each group. As shown in Table2， there were 102 male patients in the sthenia-syndrome group， which was higher than 77 female patients， but there is no significant difference in the overall distribution among the groups. Although the age of patients with wetness-heat and phlegm-heat stagnation was lower than that of patients with other syndromes， there was no significant difference in the mean value among the groups. Similarly， there were more male patients than female patients in ASASS group(P>0.05)， however， there was a significant difference in age between each group (P<0.05)， and had certain correlation (Pearson coefficient was -0.451，P=0.005). As shown in Table 3， the patients with deficiency of spleen energy and phlegm-dampness/dyspepsia syndrome are the youngest， and significantly lower than those with deficiency of vital energy and blood stasis (P<0.05) and sthenia of liver yang (P<0.05).

The proportion of hypertension patients with sthenia of liver yang was higher than that of other syndromes (P<0.05)， but there is little correlation between hypertension and ASASS syndromes (Spearman correlation coefficient was 0.078，P>0.05).**\n\n【53】**Discussion**\n\n【54】**According to the results of epidemiological investigation， a colorectal polyp is a very common disease in clinic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Most patients have no clinical manifestations， only found during physical examination or treatment of other diseases. Although most of colorectal polyps are benign lesions， some polyps also have canceration tendency 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Therefore， early resection and identification of colorectal polyps are of great significance.**\n\n【55】**Although there is no name for colorectal polyps in Chinese medicine， as early as in ancient China， there are records and descriptions about the etiology and pathogenesis of polyps. For example， primitive theories documented by “The Yellow Emperor’s Canon of Internal Medicine (722-221 B.C) (Huangdi neijinig)\"point out that the occurrence of polyps was related to invasion of exogenous evils. Stagnation of cold-wetness evil (a pathogenic factor blended by evils of cold and wetness) results in obstruction in the channels and stasis of vital energy and blood， leading to occurrence of polyps.(Huangdi neijinig) said， \"Healthy energy (referring to the resistance of the human body against diseases) existed inside， but evils could not be done\"， suggesting that deficiency of healthy energy is also an important factor in the occurrence of colorectal polyps in addition to exogenous evils.**\n\n【56】**Guangdong in China belongs to the Ling nan region. Some statistics studies on TCM syndromes of patients with colorectal polyps in Guangdong have performed， and found that deficiency of spleen-energy and evil wetness accounted for the highest proportion， followed by asthenia of the spleen and stomach and wetness-heat and blood stasis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. These researchers considered that deficiency of spleen-energy is the root of trouble and phlegm-evil and blood stasis are the causes of the disease. Our study found that the proportion of patients with asthenia of the spleen and stomach was the highest in all colorectal polyps'patients with asthenia-syndrome in Shenzhen， which is consistent with other research results \\[13，14\\]. Our observation revealed that the proportion of patients with phlegm-evil was the highest， up to 55%， followed by stagnation of vital energy and phlegm-wetness or wetness-heat evil. Shenzhen is a southern city in Guangdong Province， and located in Ling'nan region which has a unique climate with heavy humidity and heat. These results have suggested that， tangible sthenia-evils including phlegm-wetness and blood stasis can be produced in the human body living in Shenzhen.**\n\n【57】Table 4： Distribution and comparison results of \"4H\" diseases in patients with deficiency syndrome groups.\n\n| **Groups (80 cases)**  | **Hyperglycemia (N/Y)**  | **Hypertension (N/Y)**  | **Hyperlipidemia (N/Y)**  | **Hyperuricemia (N/Y)**  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Deficiency of spleen and stomach energy (27 cases)**  | **22/5**  | **20/7**  | **14/13**  | **17/10**  |\n| **Deficiency-cald of spleen and stomach (19 cases)**  | **19/0**  | **17/2**  | **11/8**  | **17/2**  |\n| **Deficiency of both vital energy and blaod (15 cases)**  | **13/2**  | **13/2**  | **8/7**  | **10/5**  |\n| **Deficiency of yin fluid (19 cases)**  | **15/4**  | **15/4**  | **11/8**  | **9/10**  |\n| **Pvalue**  | **0.221**  | **0.55**  | **0.969**  | **0.052**  |\n\n【59】Note： “4H\" represented Hyperglycemia， Hypertension， Hyperlipidemia， and Hyperuricemia. \"N\" represented no \"4H\"， and \"Y\"mean existence of \"4H\" (The same below)\n\n| **Groups (179 cases)**  | **Hyperglycemia (N/Y)**  | **Hypertension (N/Y)**  | **Hyperlipidemia (N/Y)**  | **Hyperuricemia (N/Y)**  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Wetness-heat or phlegm-heat stagnation (22 cases)**  | **18/4**  | **17/5**  | **22-Oct**  | **17/5**  |\n| **Retention of cold-wetness (8 cases)**  | **8/0**  | **7/1**  | **6/2**  | **7/1**  |\n| **Stagnation of phlegm-wetness (99 cases)**  | **88/11**  | **76/23**  | **43/56**  | **66/33**  |\n| **Depression of vital energy (27 cases)**  | **26/1**  | **25/2**  | **14/13**  | **21/6**  |\n| **Blood stasis (17 cases)**  | **14/3**  | **15/2**  | **7/10**  | **8/9**  |\n| **Heat-evil of liver and stomach (6 cases)**  | **5/1**  | **6/0**  | **2/4**  | **4/2**  |\n| **Pvalue**  | **0.478**  | **0.305**  | **0.565**  | **0.22**  |\n\n【61】**Table 6： Distribution and comparison results of \"4H\" diseases in patients with ASASS groups.**\n\n| **Deficiency of vital energy and blood stasis (13 cases)**  | **Hyperglycemia (N/Y)**  | **Hypertension (NY)**  | **Hyperlipidemia (N/Y)**  | **Hyperuricemia (N/Y)**  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Deficiency of vital energy and blaad stasis (13 cases)**  | **12/1**  | **11/2**  | **7/6**  | **8/5**  |\n| **Sthenia of liver yang (7cases)**  | **6/0**  | **1/6**  | **2/5**  | **4/2**  |\n| **Spleen deficiency with phlegm-wetness/ dyspepsia (12 cases)**  | **9/3**  | **9/3**  | **4/8**  | **10/2**  |\n| **Phlegm-wetness with deficiency of yin fluid (5 cases)**  | **5/0**  | **5/0**  | **3/2**  | **4/1**  |\n| **Pvalue**  | **0.252**  | **0.003**  | **0.52**  | **0.648**  |\n\n【63】**These tangible evils can block the functional activities of vital energy for a long time， leading to depression of vital energy and further heat-syndrome resulting from disorder of vital energy. In this case， phlegm-heat or wetness-heat evil is formed， further stagnating the functional activities of vital energy in turn. Depressed vital energy， phlegm-evil and blood stasis in conflict with each other within gut and leads to occurrence of polyps. Therefore， deficiency of spleen-energy， phlegm-wetness， blood stasis and depression of vital energy are the important pathological factors of colorectal polyps \\[15，16\\]. Our study found that， in the patients with stagnation of wetness-heat， some patients suffered from stagnation of phlegm-heat in the lung， which may be due to the fact that the lung and large intestine share s paired relationship， phlegm-heat evil in the lung can enter the large intestine along the channel system and block the functional activities of vital energy in gut， further affecting the blood circulation. This consequence leads to the stagnation of phlegm， depressed vital energy and blood stasis in the local intestine， resulting in formation of polyps.**\n\n【64】**It is considered that the occurrence of colorectal polyps is the results of many risk factors. Although these factors are related to histological type of polyps and family history 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>， other risks have been paid more and more attention. Some studies have shown that age is considered as one of the risk factors related to the occurrence of colorectal polyps 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18-20\\]</u>. The older the age， the higher the incidence of colorectalpolyps， especially after 40 years old 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>. This is consistent with the observation of our study. We found that the average age of polyp patients is over 50 years old. This may be related to the decrease of intestinal peristalsis， intestinal flora imbalance and weakened immunity with increasing age 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>. The age of patients with deficiency of spleen-energy and stagnation of wetness-evil， and deficiency of yin-fluid and phlegm-wetness syndrome (average age was lower than50 years old) was lower than that of other syndromes (average age was higher than 55 years old). This suggests that the patients younger than 50 years old should be paid more attention to invigorating the spleen and eliminating wetness-evil during determination of treatment based on the differentiation of symptoms and signs. While eliminating wetness， we should take care of nourishing yin fluid， and we should not use drugs that are too pungent and dry. The results of**\n\n【65】**this study also found that the proportion of male patients was more than that of female patients， which is consistent with the results of big data analysis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. It may be that men prefer smoking and drinking， and work and life are more stressful than women.**\n\n【66】**In this study， we found that some patients with colorectal polyps were complicated with Hyperglycemia， Hypertension， Hyperlipemia and Hyperuricemia (4H). Whether these complicating diseases are related to the formation of asthenia- and sthenia-syndrome of colorectal tumor? Although some studies have suggested that there was no direct correlation between the number of colonic polyps and hyperglycemia， hypertension and hyperlipidemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>， a research by Yunfeng Dong shown that the high risk factors of adenomatous rectal polyps are eating fat and having high triglyceride/cholesterol通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u>. Our research results also shown that， in the colorectal polyp patients with asthenia-syndrome， the asthenia of spleen and stomach， and deficiency of yin fluid in these with hyperuricemia accounted for a large proportion. Although the difference was not statistically significant， drugs for reducing uric acid can be complemented each other while invigorating vital energy and spleen and nourishing yin fluid for such patients in clinic.**\n\n【67】**In view of the recurrence of colorectal polyps， based on the theory of insidious toxin (a pathogenic factors) in Traditional Chinese Medicine， some studies suggest that the primary cause of colorectal polyps is that the insidious toxin deeply invaded the intestinal collaterals. Therefore， the insidious toxin and chronic consumption of essence and blood are the key mechanisms of occurrence and recurrence of colorectal polyps 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u>， which indicates that toxic evil is also a pathological factor in the occurrence of intestinal polyps. In our study， we found that the patients with wetness-heat or phlegm-heat evil also accounted for a large proportion， while the patients with cold-wetness only accounted for a small proportion， which may be related to the unique climate environment in Shenzhen. Therefore， invigorating spleen， clearing away heat and eliminating wetness has become a strategy to prevent and treat colorectal polyps 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26-31\\]</u>. Consistent with previous studies， it is easy to appear the syndrome of vin fluid deficiency because toxic and heat evil can consume essence and blood. As shown in our study， the syndromes of deficiency of yin fluid including yin-deficiency of liver and kidney， deficiency of**\n\n【68】**stomach-yin， deficiency of lung-yin， and deficiency of both vital energy and yin also occupied a large proportion in the asthenia-syndrome. After statistical analysis， we found that there was no significant difference in the “4H” diseases between the patients with sthenia-syndrome， suggesting that there is no significant correlation between sthenia-syndromes and “4H”diseases.**\n\n【69】**Clinically， the occurrence of diseases is often presented by Asthenia-Syndrome Accompanied with Sthenia-Syndrome (ASASS)； therefore， there are quite a few patients with the ASASS in this study. Among them， deficiency of vital energy and blood stasis was the major ones， followed by deficiency of spleen-energy and phlegm-wetness syndrome. Ultimately， asthenia is still rooted as the occurrence of intestinal polyps， with phlegm-wetness， blood stasis and stagnation of vital energy as the symptomatic manifestation， which is consistent with the treatment thinking of supplementing vital energy and invigorating the spleen， and promoting blood circulation and removing blood stasis to treat colorectal polyps 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[32\\]</u>. A large number of studies have suggested that most patients with hypertension presented the syndrome of sthenia of liver-yang， and a significant correlation existed between the sthenia of liver-yang and hypertension 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[33-35\\]</u>. Therefore， in this study， we also found that the difference ofhypertension in the syndrome of ASASS was statistically significant. The proportion of patients with hypertension and sthenia of liver-yang was more than other syndromes， so it is necessary to pay attention to the prevention and treatment of hypertension in the therapy of colorectal polyp patients with sthenia ofliver-yang.**\n\n【70】**Conclusion**\n\n【71】**Deficiency of vital energy of spleen-stomach and stagnation of phlegm-wetness are the primary syndromes for the patients with colorectal polyps in Shenzhen， and the pathological factors involve phlegm-wetness， blood stasis and stagnation of vital energy. Yin-deficiency is mainly caused by liver， kidney，lung and stomach. There is no obvious correlation between sthenia-syndrome and age， Sex，“4H”. Age should be considered in the treatment of patients under 50years old with ASASS syndrome. The patients with sthenia of liver-yang syndrome often have hypertension， thus， hypertension should also be considered for such patients.**\n\n【72】**Acknowledgement**\n\n【73】**This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China 通用删除7(英):<u>(81903985)</u>.**\n\n【74】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【75】通用结尾删除-1:<u>1\\.

This unforeseen event has led to the temporary suspension of traditional， in-person training sessions in numerous hospitals. This is particularly the case during the periods of surging demand， putting additional strain on the already stretched healthcare resources. In light of these challenges， this study has taken an innovative approach by developing an interactive digital learning game. This resource is available anytime， anywhere， providing users with the flexibility to engage in learning at a pace and timing that suits their individual schedules and commitments.**\n\n【7】**OPEN ACCESS**\n\n【8】**The primary objective of this study is to tackle the problem of inventory accounting oversights in the management of medical supplies. To measure the efficacy of the proposed intervention， the researchers established a benchmark based on the number of missed accounts in the two months before and after the implementation of the digital learning tool. Moreover， the study seeks to evaluate the impact of this digital game-based learning approach as compared to traditional teaching methods. It examines their respective effects on the self-directed learning and overall learning outcomes of nursing staff. This includes a comparative analysis of changes in test results between the experimental group， who used the digital learning tool， and the control group， who relied on conventional instruction methods.**\n\n【9】**_\\*Correspondence：_**\n\n【10】**_Koong Hao-Chiang Lin， Department of_ _Information and Leaming Technology，_ _National University of Tainan， Tainan，_ _Taiwan，_**\n\n【11】**_E-mail： koonglin@gmail.com_**\n\n【12】**Received Date： 25 May 2023**\n\n【13】**As we navigate the rapidly evolving landscape of the medical field， with advancements in healthcare technologies and an ever-growing range of medical supplies， there is a critical need for effective inventory management. All medical institutions are recognizing the necessity to minimize the wastage of valuable medical resources and to explore strategies for reducing healthcare costs. Such initiatives can lead to an increase in the overall revenue generated by the hospitals.

In January 2017， a patient quarreled with the neighbor over a land issue. After a few days， the patient started telling caregivers that the neighbor was tryingtoharm him and was following him. Additionally， the patient also claimed that the co-workers at his workplace were talking badly about him and discussing him， which he used to cross-check with his friends. Despite the friends telling him that it was not true， the patient argued and believed that they were talking about him and plotting against him. Patient had a physical fight with them as well， following which he took leave from work and went to his hometown. After a few days， when parents inquired about his job， he got angry and assaulted them. Subsequently， when the patient went back to work， he fought again with co-workers for trying to harm him due to their suspicion， left the job， and went back home. When he was at home， he was abusive and quarreled with family upon enquiring about his job. The patient’s father’s friends informed the family that the sudden behavioral changes in the patient were probably the result of black magic by the neighbors， secondary to theland issues. Hence， it was advised to take him to the temple and the faith healer in the village. The patient's family took him to various faith healers， and he was less disturbing for a few days after such visits. Symptoms were reported to have worsened close to the full moon days. When the patient became unmanageable， his parents took him to different temples suggested by his relatives. They also involved him in religious ceremonies for a year. Though they spent around 1.5lakhs， the patient’s symptoms were fluctuating and unmanageable. During the symptomatic phase， the patient also demanded to get married because his friends got married. A few neighbors' families pushed this idea to get him married. After a few days of marriage in May 2019， the patient and his wife moved to Bengaluru for employment. Though marriage was consummated， after 3 months， there were frequent quarrels with his wife， including physical abuse. A few days later， the patient suspected his wife of having extramarital affairs. Accusing her of having extramarital affairs. Secondary to this， he used to be physically abusive to the wife. Due to this， the wife went back to her family of origin. Patient biological， social， and occupational functioning was also impaired. With these complaints， he was brought to the hospital and admitted on 8/26/2019.**\n\n【27】**Family environment before the onset of illness： Family routine usually starts at 6 a.m. in the morning. Mother did all household chores，including preparing meals. Father did outside household work- cleaning the ground and feeding the cattle- and after that he went to the field. All family members used to attend functions together. Every week， the family went to the temple and ate together. Father took the decisions in consultation with the rest of the family， and the family followed them. The interaction among them was cordial. The**\n\n【28】**patient was contributing financially as well as in the day-to-day affairs of the family.**\n\n【29】**Family environment after the illness： The family routine was disrupted. Family stopped attending functions that used to happen in extended family. Routines were disrupted， and everyone appeared confused. The family environment became disorganized， with fights， disagreements， stress， and a high noise level. The brother stopped coming home regularly， the wife went back to her home， and communication within the family became need-based. The patient used to wake up late and did not engage in any family activities， except watching TV， eating， and sleeping. He also stopped going out and said nothing about his life.**\n\n【30】**Family dynamics**\n\n【31】**Boundaries： Since there were a lot of arguments， family members involved less as family. Relatives reduced visiting them. There were a lot of talks about his mental illness and that made the family to withdraw from social gatherings. However， there were a very few good neighbors and relatives who supported them. Family tried to keep the fights less and hence spoke less， and accommodated the demands of the patient. Father also started preferring to take support from extended relatives during the crisis and when the patient was unmanageable. Family had to listen to the influencing neighbors and relatives. The decision making was taken over by others. The family took all the suggestions given by others. Family got the patient married because of the influence of the neighbors and relatives.**\n\n【32】**Leadership and decision making-everybody took their own decisions： More confused and chaotic as the family environment kept changing with the symptoms of the patient. Majority of the decisions were taken by the younger brother and father supported it.**\n\n【33】**Role structure andfunctioning： Fatherperformedthe instrumental role while mother performed expressive role. Father and younger brother were the primary bread winners of the family. Father accompanied patient for the treatment everywhere and hence his role to contribute financially was affected. Nobody else took the charge of caregiving and he was tired of being with the patient. The younger brother took charge of the situation and started contributing more， mother continued to take care of the household affairs.**\n\n【34】**Communication： Conversation among the family members decreased. Patient communicated his needs through the mother to father. Brother and patient did not communicate at all. Patient spoke only to the mother. Both parents communicated to each other. The quarrels and arguments of the patient increased the noise level at home.**\n\n【35】**Reinforcement： Thetfamilyyexercised variousformI：SCof reinforcement when the family had young children. However， father used praise and support with patient to maintain self-care and hygiene. Though many times， appreciations were not said and given， acknowledgements of roles were evident.**\n\n【36】**Family rituals： Meeting together， talking to each other at home， visiting relatives together， eating together， celebrating festivals at home， and going for fair， were almost stopped. They also stopped visiting the temple as a family but they continued individually.**\n\n【37】**Cohesiveness： Wife separated from him. There were no efforts initiated to work with the marriage. Though the brother took charge of financially supporting the family， he reduced visiting them because of the fights.**\n\n【38】**Table 1： Psychiatric and psychosocial diagnosis.**\n\n| **F & Z Category**  | **Diagnosis**  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **F.20**  | **Schizophrenia**  |\n| **Z65**  | **Problem related to employment**  |\n| **Z60**  | **Problem related to social environment**  |\n| **Z60.4**  | **Social exclusion and rejection**  |\n| **Z63.0**  | **Problems in relation spouse with partner**  |\n\n【40】**Family development stage six： Family with lunching young adults 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.**\n\n【41】**Adaptive patterns and coping strategies： The whole family was not able to deal with the crisis well. They though， sought help from others， it did not help them. They had difficulties to selecting the best care for the patient. They were carried away with the demands of the patient and encouragement of neighbors in getting the patient married. They did not disclose about the mental illness to the wife’s family. Only during the admission of the patient， wife was contacted.**\n\n【42】**Social support system： Family had adequate primary and Tertiary support； however， secondary support was inadequate.**\n\n【43】**Social analysis and diagnosis**\n\n【44】**Patient is hailing from a family that is rooted in religious beliefs， rural background and healthy parental and sibling subsystems. Members had healthy interaction among them； they were supportive to each other， shared healthy communication and was a cohesive unit. Family had adequate rituals to be together. However， changes started seen after the patient became mentally ill. History reveals that， the interaction of family members affected， family members involved less as family and withdrawal from socializing. Family followed magico-religious beliefs and practices its hindered early treatment of the patient it's impacted the family functioning. Father started preferring to take support from extended relatives. During the crisis and when the patient was unmanageable， the family system started changing especially，the boundary system becoming diffused， leadership changing， communication pattern becoming need based， and involvement of several others in the family affairs. Family environment became， more confused， stressful， conflictual and chaotic. Illness also affected the decision-making role of the patient and the younger brother became more powerful in decision making. Father had Care giver burden role in the family. Patient also went through a marriage without disclosing about his illness that has also contributed in aggravating his condition as well as affecting the wife and marriage. The whole family was not able to deal with the crisis well， and they did not receive adequate guidance which prolonged the psychiatric consultation，impact of mental illness of the patient. The pathological family situations or disorganizations could be attributed to the impact of mental illness .**\n\n【45】**Psychosocial interventions**\n\n【46】**Goals and interyentions：**\n\n【47】**To establish rapport with the patient and family**\n\n【48】**Psychoeducation**\n\n【49】**Supportive psychotherapy**\n\n【50】**Family Intervention**\n\n【51】**Normalizing the family routine**\n\n【52】**Expressed Emotions**\n\n【53】**Addressed Caregiver burden**\n\n【54】**Pre discharge counselling**\n\n【55】**Intervention Offered**\n\n【56】**Psychoeducation： Assessed the knowledge of the patient and caregivers about etiology， treatment， and prognosis and provided information about etiology， symptoms of schizophrenia， the importance of medication， and treatment compliance.

The long duration of illness and its potential effect on members potential stress-related issues in family's potential perception by the patient as a burden to his family encouraged them to resume the daily routines that were present before the illness； helped them to make a daily routine that included time for leisure； celebration of festivals； birthdays； marriage ceremonies； family time and advised them to attend to the needs of other family members.**\n\n【62】**Addressed expressed emotions： identified criticality from the brother and father 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.**\n\n【63】**Explained the effect ofexpressed emotions on mental illness. There was discussion about the father's and brothers emotional reactions to the patient's symptoms. Validated their emotional responses and educated them about the role they play in relapses. Helped them understand these reactions as normal for such experiences. However， they needed handling because it speeds the recovery. Once they were able to relate to the patient as a person with illness， their attitude and behavior changed. We appreciated their understanding and changes.**\n\n【64】**Addressing the family caregiver burden： As the family belongs to a lower socioeconomic class and faces lots of financial issues， it adds to the family’s caregiver burden issues， which adds to the family’s burden. They followed the magico-religious practices and spent more than one lakh rupees on these practices. The patient's father was staying with the patient in the hospital， while other family members were less involved due to other commitments. The caregiver burden was addressed with the father， and the therapist encouraged the other family members to get involved in the patients treatment， which reduced the caregiver burden in the family.**\n\n【65】**Pre-discharge counselling： The emphasis was given to improving**\n\n【66】**the client's treatment adherence.

Anatomical characteristics of women's genitalia and physiological characteristics make it more likely to lead to gynecological infections， which significantly affect women's health and spirit 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Therefore， LGTIs are important health issues that need to be concerned， monitoring and improved， especially in areas with a high prevalence of LGTIs.**\n\n【18】**Existing studies reported the prevalence of LGTIs in Vietnam to be widely ranging from 20%to 70% between regions \\[2，7，8\\]. According to CDC 通用删除7(英):<u>(2003)</u>， the incidence and prevalence of various Reproductive Tract Infections (RTIs) vary greatly between countries and even between regions within a country. However， the epidemiological data suggest that RTIs are common in almost all of the developing countries in which they have been investigated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.**\n\n【19】**Khmer community is a minority ethnics population that mainly stays in Southern Vietnam. Due to different living habits， personal hygiene， and environmental conditions， Khmer women have weak awareness of those diseases， along with their limited rate of access to education and knowledge. They also have psychological concerns in having the gynecological examination as well as attempt to ignore symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Moreover， in many cases， LGTIs patients were undiagnosed since the signs and symptoms of LGTIs are not notable and specific 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Therefore， data on the prevalence of LGTIs of the Khmer women population are very limited.**\n\n【20】**To fill in the gap， we carried out the study to determine the prevalence of LGTIs in reproductive age among Khmer women， clinical forms， and related factors. A total of 830 Khmer women was recruited to participate in the study， was performed clinical examinations and subclinical testings. Survey data collected plays an important role in providing the scientific basis for the reproductive health care of Khmer women in Vietnam.**\n\n【21】**Methodology**\n\n【22】**1511.**\n\n【23】**A community-based， cross-sectional survey was conducted among 830 Khmer women of reproductive age in Can Tho city. All participants were interviewed， followed by gynecological examination and laboratory tests.**\n\n【24】**Results**\n\n【25】**The average age of participants was 38.05. Of these， women of the age group <20 accounted for the lowest proportion (0.8%)， followed by the 20 to 29 years-old group with 174 people (21.0%)， the30 to 39 years-old group with 320 people (38.6%). There were 329 people aged ≥ 40， accounted for**\n\n【26】**the highest rate (39.6%). The main occupation of the participants in the study was farmer， accounted for 65.0%. The others were at low rate.**\n\n【27】**According to statistical results of clinical examinations， 477Khmer women accounted for 57.5%， diagnosed with lower genital tract infections. Women in the age group of above 40 accounted for the highest rate (70.5%) of LGTIs compared to other age groups. The difference was statistically significant (p<0.05).**\n\n【28】**There were 281 out of 830 (33.9%) women diagnosed with cervicitis， accounted for 58.9% of the total of 477 cases of LGTIs. Vaginitis cases had 186 out of 830 cases in total (22.4%)， accounted for 38.9% of 477 cases of LGTIs. Besides， 10/830 cases (1.2%) were diagnosed with vulvitis， accounted for 2.1% of 477 cases of LGTIs.**\n\n【29】**Study on 4 age groups showed that the prevalence of vulvitis was100.0% in women under 20 years old. The women of sexually active age had a relatively high rate of cervicitis. The prevalence of cervicitis changed with age. Accordingly， the survey at age groups 20 to 29years old and 30 to 39 years old indicated a relatively high rate of cervicitis (p<0.05) among those groups. Besides， the rate of vaginal infections and vaginitis was higher with age increase.**\n\n【30】**There was a relationship between residence and the prevalence of LGTIs (p<0.05).In which， the group of LGTIs living in the rural areas accounted for the highest proportion with 76.1%. Besides， there was also a low prevalence of LGTIs in women living in urban areas (8.1%) and on boats and riverside areas (15.7%).**\n\n【31】**Among 477 Khmer women whose clinical examination showed manifestations of LGTIs， the high rates of cervicitis among women living on boats and riverside areas (84.0%) had a statistically significant difference (p<0.05) in comparison with rural and urban areas. Besides， the rate of vaginitis was lowest in this group (12.0%).**\n\n【32】**There was a relationship between occupation and the prevalence of LGTIs (p<0.05). Women diagnosed with LGTIs that worked as farmers accounted for the highest proportion with 68.9%. Besides， there was also a low prevalence of LGTIs in women who were petty traders (8.6%)， housewives (8.2%)， employees/workers (6.1%)， and others (8.2%).

The relative content of T-lymphocytes and their main subpopulations was determined on a flow cytofluorimeter FACS Calibur (Canada) by phenotyping lymphocytes with monoclonal antibodies (BECKMAN COULTER， USA) to surface membrane differentiation antigens (CD)： CD3+19- (pan T-cells)， CD4+-8+-(T-helpers/inducers)，CD4-8+(cytotoxic T lymphocytes)， CD3-16+(natural killers). To identify the imbalance of immunoregulatory subpopulations ofT cells， the immunoregulatory index was calculated - the ratio of the number of CD4+8-Lf and CD4-8+ Lf. To calculate the absolute content in the peripheral blood of individual populations of Lf， leukogram indicators determined on the hematological analyzer ABH-miscros60， France were used. The proliferative activity of lymphocytes was evaluated in cultures of whole blood in the reaction of blast transformation of these cells with morphological accounting of the results. Statistical processing of the obtained data was carried out using licensed software products included in the Microsoft Office Professional 2007package，license Russian Academic OPEN No Level No. 43437596 in Excel.**\n\n【11】**Conclusion： In moderate asthma， the frequency of pathological changes in the T-system of immunity did not depend on the presence of comorbid pathology， as a rule. In severe asthma， an increase in the content of pan-T cells occurred 1.2 times more often than in moderate asthma， but this was not observed in people with concomitant pathology. In this group， the frequency of increasing the content of T-helpers and decreasing the content of cytotoxic T-cells in patients with severe asthma without concomitant diseases was 1.3 times more frequent than in patients with comorbid pathology. No pathological changes in the T-system were detected in patients with controlled asthma. In partially controlled asthma， these changes were registered 1.5 times more often than in controlled asthma， and in its uncontrolled course， the prevalence of pathological changes in the T-system of immunity was much higher than in the two previous groups. In patients with concomitant diseases， these changes， as a rule， had a higher frequency than in patients without comorbid pathology.**\n\n【12】**Keywords：Comorbid pathology； Immunity； Exacerbation of asthma**\n\n【13】**Introduction**\n\n【14】**In the last two decades， researchers have paid considerable attention to the problem of comorbidity in bronchial asthma BA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1-4\\]</u>. Comorbidity is a combination of several chronic diseases in one patient， which mutually affect each other. It has been proven that the interaction of diseases， their pathomorphosis and age significantly changes the course of the main disease， the nature and severity of complications， worsens the patient's quality of life， limits or complicates the treatment and diagnostic process. It is known that patients with comorbid pathology， including the gastrointestinal tract， which is very common among this category of patients，have an increased risk of developing asthma exacerbations and a greater severity of their course. Comorbidity negatively affects the prognosis of the disease and significantly increases the probability of a fatal outcome. The presence of comorbid diseases leads to an increase in the length of hospitalization， causes disability，**\n\n【15】**and prevents the implementation of rehabilitation measures 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5-12\\]</u>. Discrepancies in the data of different authors regarding the prevalence of comorbid pathology in patients with asthma， in particular the digestive organs， and its influence on the course of asthma and the features of immunological changes determined the purpose of the work - to investigate immunological changes in patients with exacerbation of bronchial asthma with different severity and controllability depending on the presence comorbid pathology.**\n\n【16】**Materials and Methods**\n\n【17】**The work is based on the analysis of the anamnesis data and comprehensive clinical examination of 337 patients with exacerbation of BA and 255 patients who underwent immunological research in the laboratory of clinical immunology. The distribution of patients with exacerbation of BA with different severity and controllability by gender and age is presented in the . The analysis of these data showed that in all groups the majority of patients were women， which corresponds to the gender characteristics of this disease. Most of the examined patients with moderate and severe asthma were ofworking age (86.3% and 87.2%， respectively)， while with mild BA - only 46.7%(p<0.05).**\n\n【18】**There was no statistical difference between the fates of patients of different age categories with controlled and partially controlled asthma； however， in the group of patients with an uncontrolled course of the disease， there was a 2.4-fold decrease in the percentage of young and middle-aged patients and a 1.3-fold increase in the number of people elderly (p<0.05)， which corresponds to the well-known features of BA. Concomitant diseases were recorded in 252of 337 (74.8%) people， 144 (42.7%) of them had pathology of the digestive organs， and the absence of comorbidity was observed in85 (25.2%) patients. Among this group， there were 15.4% more men than among the group of patients with concomitant diseases (40.0%and 24.6%， respectively； p<0.05). There was no difference in the age composition between the groups .**\n\n【19】**To assess the severity and controllability of asthma， we used criteria based on international recommendations (GINA， 2014) and given in the unified clinical protocol of primary， secondary(specialized) medical care \"Bronchial asthma and adapted clinical guidelines for bronchial asthma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13-15\\]</u>.Average severity of asthma exacerbation was determined in 125 (65.8%) patients， severe - in 65(34.2%).18(9.5%) patients had a controlled course of the disease，**\n\n【20】**131 (68.9%) partially controlled， uncontrolled 41 (21.6%) patients. Comorbid pathology of digestive organs was recorded in 83 (43.7%) patients with exacerbation of BA. The most common diagnosis was cholecysto-cholangitis， which was present in 63 (75.9 %) patients， gastritis， duodenitis and reflux esophagitis were noted in 31 (37.3%)， pancreatitis in 12 (14.5%)， hepatitis in 6 (7.2%)， gastric or duodenal ulcer - in 4 cases (4.8%)， intestinal candidacies was established in 2cases. It should be noted that almost a third of these.**\n\n【21】**Patients had a combined pathology of the digestive organs. The remaining 107 (56.3%) persons with exacerbation of asthma had no comorbid diseases. They were included in the comparison group.The relative content of T-lymphocytes and their main subpopulations was determined on a flow cytofluorimeter FACSCalibur(Canada) by phenotyping lymphocytes with monoclonal antibodies (BECKMAN COULTER， USA) to surface membrane differentiation antigens(CD)： CD3+19-(pan T-cells)， CD4+8-(T-helpers/inducers)， CD4-8+ (cytotoxic T lymphocytes)， CD3-16+ (natural killers). To identify the imbalance of immunoregulatory subpopulations of T cells， the Immunoregulatory Index (IRI) was calculated - the ratio of the number of CD4+8- Lf and CD4-8+ Lf. To calculate the absolute content in the Peripheral blood (PC) of individual populations of Lf， leukogram indicators determined on the hematological analyzer ABH-micros 60， France were used.

To confirm the reliability of the difference in the obtained frequency indicators， the method of alternative variation was used with the determination of the student's two-tailed t-test.

In severe BA， an increase in the content of pan-T cells occurred 1.2 times more often than in moderate AD， but this was not observed in people with concomitant pathology. In this group， the frequency of increasing the content of T-helpers and decreasing the content of cytotoxic T cells in patients with severe BA without concomitant diseases was 1.3 times more frequent than in patients with comorbid pathology. No pathological changes in the T-system were detected in patients with controlled BA. In partially controlled BA， these changes were registered 1.5 times more often than in controlled BA， and in its uncontrolled course， the prevalence of pathological changes in the T immune system was much higher than in the two previous groups. In patients with concomitant diseases， these changes， as a rule， had a higher frequency than in patients without comorbid pathology.**\n\n【51】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【52】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**l.

In 2012， WHO classification of breast tumors was defined as breast cancer with low malignant potential， morphologically similar to adenoid cystic carcinoma occurring in salivary glands， which can be cured by simple mastectomy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Adenoid cystic carcinoma was classified into rare tumors and salivary gland tumors in the fift edition of WHO classification of breast tumors published in 2019， and its diagnosis was consistent with that of adenoid cystic carcinoma of the salivary gland 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5-7\\]</u>. Invasive ductal carcinoma is the most common type of invasive breast cancer without specific types通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. It is extremely rare for both of them to be independently and originally from unilateral breast cancer. In the process of domestic literature review， only a case of bilateral primary breast cancer with unilateral adenoid cystic carcinoma reported by Xiao Xuewen et al. was found 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>， and a case of mixed adenoid cystic carcinoma and ductal carcinoma of breast cancer reported by Kontos et al. was found in foreign literature search 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. In addition， individual cases of adenoid cystic carcinoma mixed with small cell carcinoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u> and spindle cell melanoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u> were reviewed and analyzed. Independent primary adenoid cystic carcinoma and invasive ductal carcinoma of the same breast were rarely reported.**\n\n【43】**Thehistological characteristics ofbreast adenoid cystic carcinoma in frozen sections are often not obvious， and due to the limitations of frozen material extraction and production， it is often difficul to distinguish it from other benign and malignant breast tumors，leading to misdiagnosis. Among the 8 cases of adenoid cystic carcinoma of the breast reported by Liu Yufei et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>， 5 cases underwent intraoperative rapid freezing examination，and only 1 case was clearly diagnosed. This case of intraoperative freezing was also a tumor with a descriptive cribriform and trabecular tubular arrangement， which was not clearly diagnosed； when the tumor mainlypresents as a sieve-like structure， the following types need to be identified： 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> Invasive sieve-like carcinoma： An invasive carcinoma with a significant sieve-like structure， often accompanied by tubular carcinoma components， with mucoprotein secretions and dead bodies visible in the sieve pores. The tumor cells lack neoplastic myoepithelial cells， mainly glandular epithelial cells， with immunohistochemical ER and PR positive， and CD117 and myoepithelial markers negative. Adenoid**\n\n【44】**cystic carcinoma exhibits invasive growth and heterogeneous tissue structure. Tubular， trabecular， and ethmoidal structures， as well as basement membrane like or mucoid substances in the lumen， are important clues for diagnosis. Morphological glandular epithelial cells are mixed with myoepithelial and basal like cells， with typical immunohistochemical ER and PR negative， and positive staining for CD117， myoepithelial Calponin， and p63 are helpful for differential diagnosis； 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> Sieve shaped ductal carcinoma in situ： Intraductal lesions in which the glandular epithelium exhibits a sieve shaped neoplastic proliferation. The tumor cells are relatively consistent and both ER and PR are diffusely positive. Myoepithelial cells exist around the duct， and myoepithelial cells such as p63，Calponin， and SMA are positive， while CD117 is negative， which is helpful for differential diagnosis.**\n\n【45】**The main diseases that need to be differentiated from invasive ductal carcinoma include 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> sclerosing adenopathy： A tubular adenopathy with lobular hyperplasia accompanied by fibrosis and sclerotic interstitial hyperplasia that constitutes a pathological change in the conscience， but its gland/tubule compression is obvious， making it difficul to identify the double layer cellular structure， and its growth pattern is similar to nerve invasion， especially in intraoperative rapid freezing and biopsy of small specimens， which is difficul to distinguish. Diagnosis needs to be very careful， and can be made with the help of calponin immunohistochemical staining of muscle epithelium such as p63 was used to label the remaining lobular structures on the muscle epithelia to assist in diagnosis. 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> Invasive lobular carcinoma： The classic type often presents a private like or target circular arrangement， and the atypical morphology of the two often overlaps， making it difficul to distinguish. Immunohistochemistry P120 and E-cadherin can be used to assist in the differential diagnosis： Both invasive ductal carcinomas are positive for cell membrane； the cytoplasm of lobular carcinoma P120was positive， while E-cadherin was negative.**\n\n【46】**In differential diagnosis， it can be seen that immunohistochemical CD117 can be specifically expressed in adenoid cystic carcinoma， mainly related to regulatory genes. Research has found that C-KIT is one of the downstream genes regulated by MYB， and C-KIT mutations can be detected in adenoid cystic carcinoma at different sites such as salivary gland and breast， and their protein products express CD117 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. At the same time， the literature suggests that about half of adenoid cystic carcinoma is accompanied by the MYB-NFIB fusion gene， but the use of the C-KIT targeted drug imatinib has poor efficac in treating adenoid cystic carcinoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>， So the treatment is still primarily surgical. The treatment of invasive ductal carcinoma has shifted from surgery+hormone+neoadjuvant treatment to neoadjuvant treatment+surgical treatment， provided that HER2 testing is positive and trastuzumab can be used for targeted treatment.**\n\n【47】**In summary， simultaneous independent primary adenoid cystic carcinoma and invasive ductal carcinoma of the unilateral breast are extremely rare， with unique histomorphology，immunohistochemical characteristics， and biological behavior. It is necessary to accumulate case summary diagnosis and treatment experience.**\n\n【48】**Acknowledgement**\n\n【49】**This research was partialy sponsored by Natural Science Foundation ofXinjiangUygurAutonomous Region.

In the current study we analyzed the level of seminal zinc concentration in various group of infertile males and to link it with sperm concentrations， inactive， active and immotile fractions of seminal constraints， with an obiective to begin the role of zinc. The present five years descriptive study was conceded in the Public Health Laboratory， Department of Reproductive Health， National Institute of Health， and Islamabad， Pakistan from 2006 to2010. Outcomes of our study showed that semen zinc was several folds higher in polyzoospermic as compared to other group while lower in Azoo， oligo and oligoasthenozoospermia group. Concentrations of seminal zinc were 598.48±12.95，617.54±9.55，702.92±10.60，710.36±7.87 and762.06±8.99 in oligozoospermic， asthenozoospermic， azoospermic，teratozoospermic and proven father group respectively.

Male infertility made by zinc limited diet is not yet fully understood because of complexity of its mechanism， however， zinc is believed to be involved in several assimilated processes linked with reproduction and has been stated seminal zinc concentration was lower in patients with idiopathic sub fertility than in normal control 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.**\n\n【28】**In another study， it has been observed that geometric means of the seminal plasma zinc concentration was found to be significantly lower (p<0.05) in the infertile group compared with those in the fertile group 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. In contrast， other authors had reported normal and even increased seminal plasma zinc levels in infertile males， but such studies are very low in magnitude. The probable explanation could be that zinc in semen is responsible for motility， therefore， it may not effect in both oligozoospermic and azoospermic groups\\[13，14\\]. We also found decrease level of semen zinc in azoospermic， oligozoospermic， asthenozoospermic and oligozoospermic groups.**\n\n【29】**High zinc content had also been reported in seminal plasma and has been associated with a high degree of sperm cell motility 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>， it has also been reported that extra cellular zinc performances as an inhibitor of human sperm motility and acrosome reaction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>.

Whereas， we in our study found that seminal plasma zinc in those subjects having more than 50% of motility had significant increased concentration than those having decrease (<50%) of motility.**\n\n【30】**In the present study， we observed significant decrease in seminal plasma zinc level in asthenozoospermic group.

So it is important that carefully administration of zinc should be in those patients who have normal sperm motility but having low sperm count. In such cases seminal plasma zinclevel should be measured before treatment， since adequate seminal plasma content of zinc is required for normal sperm function.**\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**1\\.

Topiramate is a first line agent for migraine prophylaxis； however25% of migraine sufferers are unable to tolerate its side effects. Topiramate can cause fatigue and cognitive dysfunction mimicking the symptoms of CFS/ME therefore there is uncertainty if this group is able to tolerate Topiramate.**\n\n【11】**Aim： To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of Topiramate in Migraine prophylaxis in CFS/ME patients**\n\n【12】**Design： A retrospective study.**\n\n【13】**Methods： Data was gathered from two specialist CFS/ME rehabilitation services who serve a population of >600.000 in the north of England. Patients started on Topiramate for migraine prophylaxis were contacted and their feedback regarding Topiramate including current dose， efficacy， side effects and reason for withdrawal if appropriate were noted.**\n\n【14】**Results： 27 patients were started on Topiramate. 24 were females with a mean age of 37(SD27). The dose ranged between 25 mg to 125 mg with mean 79 mg daily.5 patients (18.5%) could not tolerate Topiramate because of increasing fatigue； cognitive side effects and paresthesia. 3 patients had side effects of self-limiting paresthesia and continued with the medication. All remaining 22 patients reported improvement in their migraine frequency： 10 (39%) with no attacks， 9 (33%) experienced more than 50% reduction and 3(17%) experienced less than 50% reduction.**\n\n【15】**Discussion： Our cohort of patients with CFS/ME experienced better response rate and tolerability compared to the reported pooled data from RCTs. Concern regarding intolerance and side effects of Topiramate in CFS/ME patients suffering from migraine is unjustified. Offering clear clarification of the benefits， explanation of potential side effects and providing ongoing support may explain these positive results.**\n\n【16】**Keywords： Topiramate； Chronic fatigue syndrome； Myalgic encephalomyelitis； Migraine**\n\n【17】**Introduction**\n\n【18】**_Citation：_**\n\n【19】**Chronic Fatigue Syndrome/Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME) is a common condition with an unexplained etiology 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. As the physical examination and investigations are invariably normal 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>， the diagnosis is made using diagnostic criteria such as Fukuda criteria 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u> or Canadian consensus criteria 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Symptoms such as debilitating fatigue which is not relieved by rest and is associated with post exertional malaise are the hallmarks of the illness 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Other symptoms such as unrefreshing sleep， physical pain and cognitive impairment are also common. All diagnostic criteria include headaches as a common feature of CFS/ME. Headaches can present in different forms such as tension headaches， episodic or chronic migraines 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. More than two thirds of Migraine sufferers fulfill the criteria for diagnosis of CFS/ME 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u> and more than 80% of CFS/ME patients complain of migraine 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Recent advances in the understanding of the two conditions suggest that a common pathology may explain such strong association 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.**\n\n【20】**The focus on a vascular phenomenon as the primary pathology of migraine has proven an inadequate explanation as the complex interplay between the peripheral trigeminal vascular and the complex central networks are suggesting a much more complex pathology 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Recent research has also shown that the approach to CFS/ME as a solely functional disorder with psychosocial factors**\n\n【21】**Table 1： Comparison between our cohort and the pooled data analysing topiramate use 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>.**\n\n|  | **Studied cohort**  | **Topiramate pooled data 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>**  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **\\>50% reduction in frequency of migraine attacks**  | **19/27(70%)**  | **46%**  |\n| **\\>75% reduction in frequency of migraine attacks**  | **10/27(39%)**  | **25%**  |\n| **Average dose**  | **79mg**  | **100mg**  |\n| **Topiramate discontinued (not tolerated)**  | **5/27(18.5%)**  | **25%**  |\n| **Side effects (total**  | **8/27 (29%)**  | **\\>50%**  |\n\n【23】**predisposing， precipitating and also perpetuating the condition is a simplistic explanation for this common and disabling condition. The persistent symptoms can be at least partially explained by a central sensitisation process， a process shared with migraine， fibromyalgia and Gulf War Illness 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.**\n\n【24】**Such strong correlation between CFS/ME and migraine is not just of interest to neuroscientists but also has significant implications in clinical practice. Stress and anxiety are strong perpetuators of both conditions and a successful reduction of its burden is likely to help both conditions \\[12，13\\]. Pharmacological management of the2 conditions can be a challenge in some patients with many CFS/ME patients either having several medications to manage other symptoms such as physical pain， insomnia or mood disorders 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. Paradoxically， some CFS/ME patients find it difficult to tolerate many medications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u> especially with associated conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome， idiopathic environmental intolerance or because of the medications impact on already depleted energy levels.**\n\n【25】**Propranolol and Topiramate are suggested as the first line migraine prophylactic treatment in patients older than 12 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. We could not identify any scientific literature reporting on the use of either drug in migraine patients suffering also from CFS/ME. In this short paper we are reporting our experience using Topiramate in a cohort of CFS/ME for migraine prophylaxis.**\n\n【26】**Methods**\n\n【27】**Two specialist services for CFS/ME management serve a population of more than 600.000 residents (Wigan， Bolton and Bury) in the north west of England. The first author provides medical input for both services. The standard practice is to use Topiramate as a first line treatment with Propranolol and Pizotifen occasionally used if specifically needed for a clinical reason. All CFS/ME patients prescribed migraine prophylaxis in a period of 24 months were identified from the patients'electronic records. Those patients were contacted either by phone or face to face during a clinical review. The patients demographics and type of medication prescribed were documented. The patients still on the medication prescribed were asked about their response (no attacks， more than 50% improvement in frequency， less than 50% frequency or no improvement)； the patients were asked about any side effects and what the dose they are on. The patients who decided to discontinue the drug prescribed were identified and asked about the main side effects that led to discontinuation of the drug.**\n\n【28】**Results**\n\n【29】**Prophylactic management wasFprescribed for 37Ppatients but only 33 could be contacted. 3 patients decided not to start the medication. Two patients were started on Propranolol as they had poorly controlled anxiety and Propranolol was deemed uniquely suitable to tackle the anxiety as well. Both patients reported reduction of migraine frequency ofaround 50%. Another patient was started on**\n\n【30】**Pizotifen because of an associated nutritional problem. The Pizotifen reduced the migraine frequency by more than 50%. Full data was available for 27 patients who started Topiramate. Their age ranged between 18-62 years with a mean 37 (SD11.9). 3 were males. 5 patients(18.5%) could not tolerate Topiramate and discontinued it (2 because of paraesthesia and 3 because of cognitive impairment).**\n\n【31】**Patients 22 (81.5%) on Topiramate were on doses of 25 mg to125 mg daily 79 (SD27.9). Only 3 reported self-limiting paraesthesia and the other 19 (70%) denied having any side effects. 10 patients(39%) reported complete control of their migraine， 9 (33%) reported more than 50% improvement in frequency whilst 3 (11%) reported less than 50% improvement.**\n\n【32】**Discussion**\n\n【33】**Three double blind randomised controlled trials published in 2004reported the positive impact of Topiramate in Migraine prophylaxis通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17-19\\]</u>. MIGR 1 MIGR 2 showed Topiramate to be significantly better than placebo whilst MIGR 3 demonstrated the equivalence of both Topiramate and Propranolol in migraine prophylaxis. A daily dose of 100 mg was superior to 50 mg dose which failed to significantly improve migraine control， whilst 200 mg daily had a similar impact in the frequency of attacks. A dose of 100mg/day was duly recommended as the standard recommended dose for migraine prophylaxis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>.**\n\n【34】**The pooled data from the 3 trials was presented by D'amico in2006 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>. The data suggested that almost half of the patients on Topiramate should expect at least a 50% reduction in the frequency of migraine attacks. On the other hand， the pooled data highlighted the problems many of the patients may experience with side effects especially paraesthesia which affects half of the subjects； other side effects such as fatigue， speech problems and cognitive impairment are also common complications of Topiramate use. The severity and refractory nature of the side effects resulted in a high level of intolerance ofthe drug with roughly quarter of the subjects having to discontinue the drug according to the pooled data.**\n\n【35】**Such high levels of intolerance of Topiramate may discourage clinicians from prescribing it especially in a patient group such as CFS/ME sufferers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. Problems with drug intolerance， fatigue， cognitive impairment and/or chronic pain are cardinal features of the disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>； therefore， concerns about Topiramate worsening these symptoms seems to be a valid issue when consideringtreatment strategies.**\n\n【36】**The comparison between the outcomes and tolerance of our cohort in comparison with the pooled data reported by D'Amico shows in . The comparison suggests at least a similar favorable response to Topiramate if not a superior control of the migraine frequency. Less patients in our cohort reported side effects or discontinued the drug compared to the pooled data as well.**\n\n【37】**Several aspects in our clinical practice and the nature of CFS/ME patients may explain such a positive result. Our standard practice is to initiate pharmacological management simultaneously with the CFS/ME rehabilitation programmed which often includes concepts such as stress management， relaxation techniques， pacing among other strategies that may have a positive impact on migraine management通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u>. The patient also receives detailed information about the potential side effects with explicit recommendations to build up the dose slowly with an offer for support from the team if needed. The potential for weight loss as a common side effect 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u> is also highlighted. One would expect some patients to welcome such side effect especially that many CFS/ME patients find it difficult to control their weight because of lack of physical activity or side effects of other medications (e.g. GABA agonists)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>.**\n\n【38】**We also feel that the similarities between the common side effects of Topiramate and the main symptoms of CFS/ME may paradoxically help some patients tolerate these side effects as they experience it readily. A migraine sufferer experiencing paraesthesia or cognitive impairment for the first time to may be more concerned about such symptoms and more likely to report them or discontinue the drug.**\n\n【39】**This is a short retrospective study reporting the outcomes of a small number of subiects. We would like to stress the caution that must be exercised when interpreting the results or attempting to generalize the conclusions. The authors are the clinicians treating the subjects so a bias from both sides (patients and clinicians) cannot be excluded. Having said that， we feel that our observations should be in the public domain to at least encourage further evaluation of the pharmacological management in such complex population of overlapping co-morbidities.**\n\n【40】**In conclusion， we feel that reluctance to use Topiramate for migraine prophylaxis when associated with CFS/ME because of the concerns about intolerance is unjustified. Further research evaluating pharmacological interventions in patients with complex co-morbidities is needed to provide more informed guidance for clinical practice.**\n\n【41】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【42】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**1\\.

This diagnosis was based on both immunohistological and PET/CT findings.**\n\n【16】**Case Report**\n\n【17】**A 62-year-old male with no medical history complained of left orbit pain and decreased visual acuity for a period of 6 months. Physical examination was negative.**\n\n【18】**Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a homogenous relatively well-defined intraconal mass lesion in the left orbit isointense on T1 sequences and hyperintense on T2 sequences (Figure1). The patient underwent a left orbitectomy and histopathological examination of the excised mass was consistent with metastatic adenocarcinoma with an immunohistological profile suggestive of lung or thyroid origin (CK+， TTF1+， CK20-). Serum tumor markers were negative. PET/CT performed as a part of the initial process revealed a mild IF-FDG uptake in an apical nodule of the upper right lobe with pretracheal lymph nodes involvement and lytic bone metastasis on the right temporal bone and the sternum . Thyroid gland was normal on both F-FDG PET/CT and ultrasound examination. A diagnosis of primary malignancy in the lung with metastases was made based on immunohistological profile of the orbital mass and FDG PET/CT findings， since lung biopsy had not been made. The patient was treated with 6 courses of palliative chemotherapy according to the protocol paclitaxel and carboplatine， followed by radiotherapy on the orbital lesion(30 Gy spread over 10 sessions). Follow up F-FDG PET/CT showed recurrence of the left orbital mass that appears hypermetabolic . The patient is still alive 10 months after the diagnosis of his metastatic cancer.**\n\n【19】**Discussion**\n\n【20】**Carcinoma of unknown primary (CUP) represents a heterogeneous group of metastatic malignancies for which no primary site of the tumor can be identified 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.

These efforts to detect the primary tumor ar often time consuming， expensive and so unsuccessful.**\n\n【24】**Because of its high sensitivity， IF-FDG PET/CT may be an interesting alternative to other radiological investigations in detecting the unknown primary tumor. Elective use of PET-CT is currently limited to patients with squamous-celllymphadenopathy of the neck(cervical carcinoma of unknown primary site). In these patients， PET-CT may guide the biopsy， determine the extent of disease， facilitate the planning of radiation therapy， and help with surveillance通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. In contrast， the value ofF-FDG PET/CT is less well studied in CUP patients with extra cervical metastases. Moller et al. reviewed the utility of lF-FDG PET/CT as a diagnostic test in patients with extra cervical CUP site.BF-FDG PET/CT detected the primary tumor site in 39.5% patients with extra cervical CUP. The lung was the most commonly detected primary tumor site， accounting for 50% of all cases. The pooled estimated sensitivity， specificity， and accuracy for LBF-FDG PET/CT in the detection of the primarytumor site was 87%，88%， and 87.5%， respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.**\n\n【25】**Orbital metastases from malignantt tumors are relatively uncommon. Their incidence has been estimated in several studies between 1% and 13% of all orbital tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. One third of cases don’t have any history of a primary malignancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Breast and lungs are the most common sites of the primary tumor followed by prostate， melanoma and colorectal cancers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Metastatic adenocarcinoma is the most frequent histological type 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.**\n\n【26】**Typical manifestations of orbital metastasis include a palpable mass causing displacement or proptosis， pain， inflammation， bone involvement， chemosis， and eyelid swelling 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.**\n\n【27】**Figure 3： Transaxial fallow up FDG PET/CT showing recurrence of the left arbital mass that appears hypermetabalic (arrow).

For orbital pulmonary metastases treatment is usually palliative， with the intent of both local tumor control and preservation of vision. Systemic chemotherapy has proved curative effect in most cases， but radiotherapy may be the mainstay for orbital metastases， with objective response rates up to 79% and the ability to save the quality of vision in 80% of cases without an invasive procedure which can decompress the compressive optic nerve \\[5，9\\]. Palliative fractionated radiation to the orbit at doses of 30 Gy to 40 Gy is commonly employed which should be given with caution so as to prevent eyelashes loss and lachrymal apparatus injury 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.**\n\n【29】**Prognosis is bad in most cases and depends on the type and location of the primary tumor. Out of 245 cases of orbital metastasis published in medical literature， mean rate of survival since metastasis was detected amounted to 9.3 months 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.**\n\n【30】**Conclusions**\n\n【31】**In up to 25% of patients with orbital metastatic lesions， orbital metastasis is the initial presentation of previously undiagnosed cancer.

Research in patients with cerebral palsy undergoing cell therapy has shown improvements in the functionality and quality of life of patients. Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is an essential tool that may objectively evaluate the morphological changes in the cerebral tracts after this kind of intervention.**\n\n【18】**Description of Cases： Three children with a medical history of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy were presented. These patients were treated with intrathecalautologous bone marrow total nucleated cells. All three patients demonstrated clinical improvements in their neurological functions. Additionally， fMRI was performed 6， 9， and 10 months， respectively， after the intervention. An increase in anisotropy fraction was observed when evaluated by specialized MRI radiologists， which correlated with their improvements.**\n\n【19】**Discussion： It has been demonstrated that hematopoietic progenitor cells promote neurogenesis and angiogenesis in brain tissue affected by hypoxic-ischemic injury. This report seeks to add the idea of using fMRI to evaluate improvements after interventions where stem cells are used. However， it is necessary to extend the number of patients to determine if it is the best objective evaluation method for these patients.**\n\n【20】**Keywords： Functional MRI； Cerebral palsy； Stem cell therapy； Clinical improvement**\n\n【21】**Introduction**\n\n【22】**Cerebral Palsy (CP) is a non-progressive condition secondary to an insult to the central nervous system during its development.

The total amount of BM TNCs infused was11.76×10° ofCD34+ cells， as measured by flow cytometry.**\n\n【47】**Six months later， the patient could reduce the anticonvulsant dose per kilo of weight， interact with the environment， and has a social smile.**\n\n【48】**Discussion**\n\n【49】**TNCs have a minimal capacity for transdifferentiation into neurons compared with other progenitor cells. So， how can we explain the improvement of patients with therapy? Evidence suggests that the benefits obtained through treatments such as this one is due to immunomodulatory effects since they migrate to sites where there is inflammation and cell damage and have a chemotactic impact 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>， secrete many bioactive molecules that promote cell regeneration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u> and angiogenesis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.**\n\n【50】**This has been evidenced by the fact that this type of cell has been used successfully in therapies of another nature， where the damaged tissue is not of the hematopoietic lineage， such as neurons 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>， skeletal muscles， and kidneys 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.**\n\n【51】**Conventional imaging methods have not proved to be useful for objectively measuring improvements in patients with CP. The fMRI is a more sensitive and invaluable tool that can impartially dimension the changes and improvements after stem cell therapy. In addition， this can give us better evidence of neurogenesis and angiogenesis.**\n\n【52】**Because CP does not have a conventional or specific treatment owing to its complexity and does not boost regardless of standard treatments， as rehabilitation， stem cell therapy could be a therapeutic option to improve the quality of life of these patients and their families.**\n\n【53】**We decided to use the IT route as the route of administration for several reasons. Although the IV route is better in terms of safety，**\n\n【54】**the number of cells administered IV that can cross the blood-brain barrier still needs to be clarified. In addition， it must be considered a loss of cells distributed in other organs (e.g.， liver， lung， etc.) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. When cells are administered IT， more of these cells are concentrated in the hypoxic areas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. The IT route has proven to be safe and tolerated， with side effects such as fever， headache，nausea， vomiting， and stiffness of the neck， which do not last for more than six days5，12.**\n\n【55】**fMRI is a tool that can objectively identify changes and improvements after cell therapy， as in the 3 patients mentioned above. Unfortunately， conventional imaging methods have not proven to be very useful since the size of ischemia or edema reduction does not directly correlate with the clinical improvements observed in patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Currently， more sophisticated methods such as fMRI， which， through anisotropy， is more sensitive and allows analysis of the restructuration of the white matter and its fascicles，provide more evidence of neurogenesis and angiogenesis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. Although that brain fMRI did not show evidence of morphological changes， an increase in the anisotropy fraction of the cortical tract was found compared to the study performed before treatment . Furthermore， it was also observed an increase in white matter formation.**\n\n【56】**Conclusion**\n\n【57】**CP is a condition that does not improve despite current treatments. The application of BM-TNC can enhance neurogenesis and angiogenesis in affected hypoxic-ischemic brain tissue， which could result in an alternative treatment for patients with this condition. This was demonstrated by fMRI in the cases above and can become a powerful tool to obiectively evaluate changes in the central nervous system， specifically in the white matter tracts. However， this must be confirmed in large， comparative， randomized， blinded studies.**\n\n【58】**Acknowledgement**\n\n【59】**The information contained in this manuscript was partially**\n\n【60】**presented as a poster at the annual meeting of the ISCT (International** Society of Cellular Therapy) 2019 in Melbourne， Australia.\n\n【61】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【62】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**1\\.

However， a variety of side-effects including death were also reported not infrequently \\[3，4\\]. These side-effects， probably immune-related， involved several organs， including the kidney 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. The spectrum of vaccination-related kidney injuries was widely distributed， including glomerulonephritis， interstitial nephritis， and vasculitis and may present as acute kidney injury \\[6，7\\]. Herein， we report a case of acute kidney injury after 3 doses of mRNA-1273 vaccine (Moderna).**\n\n【15】**Case Presentation**\n\n【16】**A 58-year-old male visited our emergency room in March 2022， because of an abrupt onset of dizziness and general malaise. Physical examination revealed that he was afebrile with no cardiopulmonary distress， a blood pressure of 128/84 mmHg， heart rate； 74/min， normal heart sound and breathing sound， and normal abdominal examination. Neurological examinations were also unremarkable. Unexpectedly， a serum creatinine of 3.1 mg/dl (eGFR： 22.1 ml/min) was found. The other laboratory studies were unremarkable， including a normal urinalysis. The kidney sonography revealed normal size of both kidneys with normal echogenesity. His past history included hypertension and dyslipidemia； both were under satisfactory control at our cardiovascular clinic for more than 5 years. Notably， he received 3 doses of Covid-19m RNA-1273 vaccine(Moderna) in August 2021， November 2021 and February 2022， respectively. On December 74，2021， he received a routine check-up for a Pre-Scheduled Panendoscopy (PES)， which showed a normal serum creatinine of 1.1 mg/dl (eGFR： 73.08 ml/min)， but there was microscopic hematuria(urinalysis： RBC： 50-99/HPF， WBC： 0-2/HPF). He recalled that there was an episode of painless gross hematuria a few days ago， nearly one month after the second shot of vaccination. It subsided spontaneously. The PES disclosed gastric ulcers and a proton pump inhibitor (lansoprozole) were prescribed. Because there was no grosser hematuria， he did not pay attention to his kidney condition and was not followed up at our Nephrology Clinic until this visit to the emergency room. Under the impression of acute kidney injury 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u> with unknown etiology， he was admitted for a kidney biopsy. After admission， a series of immune studies were performed ， which showed an ANA titer of 1：160， normal Complement 3 (C3) and C4， negative for anti-ds-DNA， anti-glomerular basement antibody and anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody. The complete blood count was essentially normal except for a mild anemia (hemoglobin： 10.5)， and the liver function were also normal. A urinalysis again showed negative finding with no hematuria. The Urine Protein Creatinine Ratio(UPCR) was 93.6 mg/g Creatinine (Cr).**\n\n【17】**Pathologic finding**\n\n【18】**A kidney biopsy was done on the next day of admission. The sample was sent for Light Microscopy (LM)， Immunofluorescence study (IF) and Electron Microscopy (EM) examinations. There were 9 glomeruli in the specimen. Under LM ， the glomeruli appeared to be grossly normal with normal cellularity and capillary walls， except for mild focal thickening of Bowman capsule and enlarged Bowman’s space. The proximal tubules showed hyaline to foamy change with some tubules showing flattening of the lining epithelium and luminal dilatation. There were some calcifications in the tubular lumina and foci of tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis. The IF study was negative for all staining， including IgG， IgA， IgM， C3， kappa and lambda. The EM showed**\n\n【19】**Table 1： Laboratory examinations.**\n\n| **Item**  | **12/7/2021**  | **12/21/2021**  | **3/3/2022**  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Serum creatinine (mg/dl)**  | **1.1**  |  | **3.1**  |\n| **Urinalysis (RBC)**  |  | **50-99/HPF**  | **0-5/HPF**  |\n| **Urinalysis (WBC)**  |  | **0-5/HPF**  | **0-5/HPF**  |\n| **UPCR\"(mg/g Cr)**  |  |  | **93.6**  |\n| **UACR(mg/g Cr)**  |  | **30**  |  |\n| **LDH\\*\\*(U/L)**  |  |  | **146**  |\n| **ANA**  |  |  | **0.152777778**  |\n| **Anti-dS-DNA**  |  |  | **1：10**  |\n| **C3 (mg/dl)**  |  |  | **79.7**  |\n| **C4(mg/dl)**  |  |  | **23.7**  |\n| **lgG (mg/dl)**  |  |  | **1210**  |\n| **IgA (mg/dl)**  |  |  | **96.5**  |\n| **gM (mg/dl)**  |  |  | **113**  |\n| **ANCA#**  |  |  | **Negative**  |\n| **Anti-GBM&antibody**  |  |  | **Negative**  |\n\n【21】High power field； Urine pratein/creatinine ratio (mg/g)Urine albumin/creatinine ratio； \\*Lactic dehydrogenase； \\*Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibady； glomerular basement membrane\n\n【22】**Figure 1A： Light microscopic examination.

The patient's serum creatinine rose from 1.1 mg/dl to 3.1 mg/dl in 3 months but the kidney sonogram looked normal， implying a disproportionately higher rate of renal function deterioration. Althougha normal renal sonography might be found in some patients with chronic kidney diseases， like diabetic nephropathy， it is our usual experience that the renal sonogram should revealed either a decrease in kidney size or an increase in echogenesity bilaterally if the patient’s kidney disease was attributed to be “chronic\" because an eGFR of 22.1 mg/min meant a significant loss of renal function and it will take a substantial time to develop. Rapidly Progressive Glomerulonephritis (RPGN) could manifest with a rapid deterioration of renal function and a normal appearance of renal sonogram. However， RPGN usually**\n\n【26】**Figure 1B： Light microscopic examination. Periodic acid-Schiff stain， 200x revealed mild focal thickening of Bowman capsule and enlarged Bowman's space. The proximal tubules showed hyaline to foamy change with some tubules showing flattening of the lining epithelium and luminal dilatation(arrow). There were some calcifications in the tubular lumina and faci of tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis (arrowhead).**\n\n【27】**presented with microhematuria and proteinuria， which was unlikely， subsided without aggressive treatment. Our patient had a completely normal urinalysis at the time of biopsy， making the diagnosis of RPGN unlikely. Likewise， thrombotic microangiopathy， which has also been reported in the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>， can be ruled out based on the same reason. The kidney biopsy disclosed focal flattening of the lining epithelium and luminal dilatation， implying acute tubular injury. There was no glomerulosclerosis and no significant interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy， making the diagnosis of a “chronic\" kidney injury very unlikely. Because there was a gap of 3 months between the onset of gross hematuria and the kidney biopsy， we speculated that an intensive glomerular or tubular injury could have occurred during the 3 months although the patient was asymptomatic. The current biopsy findings thus may only represent residual changes of the injury. Alternatively， a sampling error of the biopsy encompassing the relatively “normal\" portion of the tissue might explain the dissociation of clinical and pathologic findings. Previous reports about COVID-19 vaccination associated kidney injuries included various kinds of glomerulonephritis， including IgA nephropathy， minimal change disease \\[9，10\\]， RPGN 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u> and others\\[6，12，13\\]. Our case had normal appearance of glomeruli， thus the diagnosis of proliferative glomerulonephritis is unlikely at the time of biopsy. However， our patient experienced an episode of painless gross hematuria one month after his second dose of vaccination. Surgical hematuria such as urothelial tumor and urolithiasis were carefully ruled out. Electron microscopy examination also revealed partial loss of podocytes foot process. Thus， we cannot exclude a transient glomerulonephritis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u> had occurred during the disease process. Minimal change disease could manifest with acute kidney injury通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. However， the hallmark of minimal change disease is nephrotic-ranged proteinuria and general anasarca， which were not present in our patient. Acute Interstitial Nephritis (AIN) also had been reported in association with COVID-19 vaccination 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. We cannot exclude the possibility that AIN had occurred in our patient during the 3 months， because of the presence of foci of tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis seen in LM. Our patient also took a Proton Pump Inhibitor (PPI) (lansoprozole) following the finding of gastric ulcer in PES examination. Acute interstitial nephritis and chronic kidney disease have been reported in patients taking PPI \\[17，18\\]. However， the cases reported were extremely rare. Given the huge population taking this drug， the evidence linking PPI use and kidney injury is**\n\n【28】**still controversial. Moreover， the pathologic finding in our patient was not in support of this diagnosis.**\n\n【29】**In summary， we reported a case of acute kidney injury after 3doses of mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccinations. Although the causal relationship is difficult to establish， like most of the reported cases in the literature， we failed to find other disease entities to explain the clinical features 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>， neither it is De novo or relapsing diseases\\[12，14\\]. The discovery of a specific biomarker of vaccination-related disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u> may help to elucidate the question.**\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>1\\.

There was a gradual onset of pain and it was aggravated by doing overhead activities and relieved by rest. No other signs of heaviness， tingling or numbness were present. No history of recent injury or trauma was reported by the girl. According to mother-child was full term and C-section was done followed by an immediate birth cry. The mother didn’t have any postnatal complications.A vaccination course was completed. There was no history of delayed milestones Child started walking at age of 10 months. The child was having satisfactory physical and mental performance in the school as per parents and teachers. She was independent altogether activities of daily living.

Self-correction exercises and active exercises for both upper limb and neck were explained to the patient. After3 weeks of physiotherapy intervention， the patient was reassessed. The pain was reduced to a VAS score of 0. Exercises help to improve mobility and reduce the stiffness in the neck. Postural correction also helps to create self-awareness. Every day physiotherapy sessions helped the girl not only to develop the habit of regular exercise and well being but also boost the confidence level of the child.**\n\n【62】**Klippel-Feil syndrome remains asymptomatic many times and intervention is only given only when symptoms are present. Due to altered biomechanics， hypomobility at one level will be compensated by the hypermobility at the other level of the spine which can lead to secondary complications and functional impairment. Early intervention with physiotherapy will help to maintain the strength and mobility of the joint and prevent secondary degenerative changes.**\n\n【63】**In 1985 a study was done where 11 children with Klippel-Feil**\n\n【64】**syndrome were classified into 3 categories， Group 1 patients with an unstable fusion pattern， Group 2 patients with craniocervical abnormalities Group 3 patients with cervical spinal canal stenosis.

To treat discogenic neck pain，Intradiscal Pulsed Radiofrequency (ID-PRF) could be used in management of chronic CDNP.**\n\n【13】**Objective： This study aimed to investigate the efficacy of percutaneous ID-PRF in chronic CNDP.**\n\n【14】**Methods： In this retrospective study， thirty-four patients were included and allocated into two groups according to the duration time of the PRF procedure they underwent (7 min group = 16vs.15 min group =18 patients). The principal outcome measures were pain score， evaluated with the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS)， and the Oswestry Disability Index(ODI) at three different time points：Baseline， at 2 weeks after the procedure 2-weeks and at 6-month after. The degree of achievement was determined as a reduction in NRS of2 50% or an ODI reduction of≥ 40%.**\n\n【15】**Results： At 2 weeks and 6 months after the procedure， retrospectively， NRS was found to be significantly reduced (P<0.05) in both groups， but no significant differences were found between the groups.

If degenerative change occurred in the disc， disc innervating nerve potentially extending into the internal third of the annulus fibrosus and the nucleus \\[5，6，26\\]. It was can cause discogenic neck pain.**\n\n【49】**The mechanism of ID-PRF is not fully understood. It could be possibly suggested that ID-PRF may reduce nociceptive input derived from the intervertebral disc and the induce of a cellular and immune response and inhibit evoked synaptic activity \\[27，28\\].

It was not easy to distinguish discogenic pain from facet pain，or muscle/ligament pain， etc.**\n\n【51】**This study is limited in that it has small sample size and the lacks control group. We may also not fully full rule out the pain from facet pain or muscle pain. Evaluation with MRI should be not conducted in follow-up to assess the potential of ID-PRF to prevent or to aggravate disc degeneration.**\n\n【52】**It is concluded that the application of ID-PRF is efficient for the conduct of discogenic neck pain regardless of ID-PRF application duration (7-min vs. 15-min).**\n\n【53】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【54】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**1\\.

There are limited studies that explore health professionals’views on screening or perceived barriers to the screening process.**\n\n【14】**Aim： The aim of this study was to discuss the health professionals’views of psychosocial screening and assessment who work in the private obstetric sector.**\n\n【15】**Methods： Semi-structured face-to-face interviews were completed with 11 midwives， 1 social worker and 2 obstetricians. Three hospital sites were chosen， of which only one currently screens women for psychosocial risk factors. Thematic analysis was applied to interview transcripts. Three researchers then discussed reoccurring themes and a consensus in themes and subthemes was reached.**\n\n【16】**Results： Only one hospital was screening women and had midwives trained in psychosocial assessment including depression screening. There were mixed views on the process and barriers to screening were identified， e.g.， lack of support systems， cultural barriers， inaccurate answers， power barriers with obstetricians， husband interference， fear and powerlessness. Benefits were recognized： early identification of difficulties， standardization and patient-focused care. Concerns were，however， also evident： suicide ideation， intrusiveness of questions， whether women responded honestly， not wanting to screen all women.**\n\n【17】**Conclusion： There was an identified concern by midwives that obstetricians did not take seriously any concerns highlighted by the midwife about women’s psychosocial problems. There was a sense of a lack of ownership'of the women， therefore a feeling of helplessness in addressing their needs. Suggestions were made： appropriate education and training of midwives， flagging high risk women， more in-house resources and external resources/community links and employing a central midwife with interest and expertise in psychosocial screening.**\n\n【18】**Keywords： Psychosocial assessment； Private sector； Health professionals**\n\n【19】**Introduction**\n\n【20】**Women are not universally or routinely screened ante-or postnatally for psychosocial risk factors， depression and anxiety in the private sector in Australia.

As the researchers conducted the interviews， they kept field notes that were used to contextualize the data and contributed to the commencement of data analysis.**\n\n【23】**Results**\n\n【24】**Group 1： Booking-in midwives**\n\n【25】**The midwife includes the psychosocial assessment as part of her usual antenatal clinical interview. Her role is to assess all women at booking-in for psychosocial risk factors and offer referral as needed. The booking-in visit is conducted in a private room with the woman， her partner and midwife present. The partner could be asked by the midwife to leave the room to ensure privacy.**\n\n【26】**Only those midwives who had attended the Perinatal Mental Health Assessment (Introductory Training) could participate in the study， enroll women to the study， gain their consent and conduct the screening using the Clinical Care Guideline package. During the booking-in visit， women who had consented to be part of the study were asked a series of psychological questions and also given an Edinburgh Perinatal Depression Scale to complete 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.**\n\n【27】**It is generally accepted that， in an English-speaking population， an EPDS score of 10-12 suggests the respondent may meet criteria for minor depression； a score 13-18 suggests she would probably meet criteria for depressive illness： 19-30 indicates a higher degree of distress and complexity， possibly including depressive illness， but also including other factors， such as a positive score on question 10(self-harm). Women are offered follow-up according to established referral pathways.**\n\n【28】**Group 2： Obstetricians and other health professionals**\n\n【29】**_Health_ professionals (obstetricians， midwives， general practitioners， social workers， psychologists， early childhood nurses) involved in delivering care to study participants as above were asked to contribute their views on the effectiveness/suitability of the clinical care guideline package following implementation， using semi-structured interviews.**\n\n【30】**Midwives and obstetricians were then interviewed in focus groups or individually to ascertain the appropriateness of the psychosocial screening questions， as well as any concerns， suggestions and other issiles.**\n\n【31】**Group 3： Private hospital midwives**\n\n【32】**Interviews were commenced with midwives working at other private hospitals (in addition to the primary study site) to ascertain their views on the effectiveness/suitability of antenatal psychosocial questioning. Early detection and appropriate referral are the main aims of data collection， with a view to establishing Commercial-in-Confidenceevidence for implementing routine， universalscreening in this setting. Midwives at each facility (as well as those at the study site) were invited to share their experiences of the antenatal psychosocial and depression screening of women through voluntary participation in semi-structured qualitative interviews .**\n\n【33】**Them es**\n\n【34】**Benefits of psychosocial screening**\n\n【35】**We need to know： A dominant theme among all midwives consenting to interview was related to the benefits of screening women for psychosocial issues. The midwives indicated that this type of information was not only helpful but necessary for them to give the best possible care to women.**\n\n【36】**Midwives spoke of the “need to know” to be able to provide a comprehensive service and holistic care to women. They felt the experience of questioning women offered the opportunity to ask**\n\n【37】**questions， to debrief and provide tailored care.**\n\n【38】**For example， midwives spoke of answers to the psychosocial questions giving them a “heads up”(M1) or\"flags going up\"(M2) or“opening things up”for further discussion.**\n\n【39】**Midwives comments； “We get the heads up that there are issues”“It is invaluable”. We can put supports in place for women， it opens things up\". It allows us to look for issues and explore them with the women\"(midwife 1).**\n\n【40】**Yes， apart from looking after the body， we are looking after the spirit and mind as well. These women are not stupid： mostly career women (midwife 2). Yes，\"If you don’t ask， you won’t know\"(midwife3).**\n\n【41】**Consistency： Another major sub-theme within the benefits of screening concerned the consistency of approach in asking the questions. For example， “We can display empathy for the women if we are aware of their issues\". The benefit of a consistent approach rather than self-selecting who to interview was evident， “Women are consistently asked the questions， all on the same page. It gives them the opportunity to disclose\"(midwife 5).**\n\n【42】**“It is less threatening if it is standardized**\n\n【43】**“It helps us tailor the care to meet their needs”**\n\n【44】**Risks of not screening： Midwives were asked directly about the benefits and risks of not screening. Midwives indicated that the benefits outweighed the risks. For example： Yes， “There are no risks， only benefits， if we don’t ask and they have a history of self harmits our duty\". (Midwife 1) and， “No benefits in NOT asking them. If we don’t we miss someone at risk\" (midwife 3). Although there was an expressed sensitivity around asking the screening questions，“However， they may be uncomfortable being asked these questions\".“If we don’t ask， we won’t know， for example-DV. We can plead ignorance if we don’t ask， as we are not aware\" (midwife 4) “I’m in two minds， as some women want to disclose and others dont. I think that they should given a choice/elect to answer the questions\".“The risk of not asking them is that they will get no help， may have prolonged PND or suicide\"(midwife 5).**\n\n【45】**Barriers to screening**\n\n【46】**No training/experience in how to screen： Midwives identified a lack of training and experience in how to screen women. Only one of the three sites had received any training in psychosocial screening. For example， “Staff feeling uncomfortable and being inexperienced. There is no antenatal clinic. No staff with mental health training. An antenatal clinic would allow rapport building. Also， the husbands are present”(Midwife 3). Some midwives noted that they needed to screen regardless of their lack of training and therefore relied on experience or a “gut feeling. “We have to rely on our experience to detect issues”.“But some of the midwives don't have the experience to do this”.**\n\n【47】**“I think that the postnatal midwives needtraining， they administer an EPDS but often don't know how to score it or what is considered high risk and when to refer\".**\n\n【48】**The husband： Some midwives highlighted the issue of the husband being present. Some husbands stayed in the room to interpret for the woman or were not asked to leave by the midwife.“The problem is that often the husbands come and we don't ask them to leave， that’s the way we have always done it； the booking in. “We**\n\n| **Table 1： Themes.**  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Theme**  | **Subtheme**  | **Quotes**  |\n| **Benefits of psychosocial** **screening**  | **We need to know**  | **\"We would know where they are at， so that we can help them\".** **It you don't ask， you won't know.**  |\n|  | **Consistencv**  | **\"lt helps us tailor the care to meet their needs'** **\"The advantage is having that background information on the woman\".No benefits in NOT asking them.

There was a concern expressed by midwives that they often could not speak to the women on their own as the husbands refused to leave when the woman was being interviewed.**\n\n【51】**The obstetrician：Attimes，the obstetrician was viewed as abarrier by the midwives in their attitudes. For example， “The obstetricians， they are often defensive\"， “the obstetricians， they have a sense of ownership of the women\". There was also a concern that when the midwife did in fact high light a woman’s psychosocial issues to the obstetrician that it was not taken seriously.“Sometimes they fob vou off when you identify an issue and alert them- the obstetricians\"，“We are often left in the dark about a woman’s problems\"， “We rely on the obstetricians to document but they often write nothing.**\n\n【52】**Other themes**\n\n【53】**They lie/fear： There was a reported concern by midwives that women were not honest with the results of questioning. For example， However， some women lie， they will talk if they want help，“The women can lie and not admit that they have problems”(midwife1). Woman may also fear any potential consequences of disclosing issues，“Some women don’t want to know about community services as there is a fear attached，i.e.，DOCS (FACS)”，“They hide their issues， some come here to hide from DOCS， they come under a false name and don’t want to go to the public system because of DOCS”. This is referring to FACS-Family and community services who have to capacity to remove the baby from the mother).**\n\n【54】**They don’t want to disclose- the women， they are high powered38 to 40 year old women that often run big businesses/are high flyers and are used to being in control\".**\n\n【55】**Midwife barriers： Some midwives expressed concern about the psychosocial questions. “Some questions are a bit odd： that is**\n\n【56】**awkward'(Midwife 2). There was also concern about discomfort in asking the questions or receiving uncomfortable answers， difficult responses include： mother passed away； patient estranged from family； half a dozen said abused as a child； someone with trauma in first delivery so has come to private hospital this time； infertility； lack of support. Interestingly some midwives indicated that they could either determine which women warranted asking the psychosocial questions， or that women should indicate that they wanted to be screened. “I don’t think that we should screen all women， the odd one may say that they wanted to be asked the questions”.**\n\n【57】**A social worker expressed concerns with the booking-in process at a hospital.“Certain midwives are more receptive to assisting women than others. Most women here dont seem to disclose at booking in. I get the majority of referrals postnatally when they stay for 3-4 days and a more attuned midwife picks up that there might be a problem. Things need to change here”(SW). The answer-“Change the booking in midwife and educate the midwives.**\n\n【58】**Lack of awareness： Another sub-theme indicated a concern that women were neither attuned to the psychosocial questions nor understood their relevance， “They are often unaware of the connection between their past history and their present status/effect\".**\n\n【59】**Language can be a barrier， e.g.， some Asian women： a few women are very business-like (midwife 2).**\n\n【60】**Lack of time： Time was seen as an additional pressure in psychosocial screening. “It takes a long time to screen the women”(midwife 1). “They book in online” “The pressure on staff， time”(midwife 5).**\n\n【61】**Enough supports**\n\n【62】**A subtheme emerged around a lack of resources and supports for women once positively screened. “We don’t have a social worker； we don’t have enough supports for the women\". When asked**\n\n【63】**whether there was enough support for women one midwife replied，“Sometimes you need to call the obstetrician several times before something is done to help the women， but you just need to keep onto them， the obstetricians.**\n\n【64】**General comments**\n\n【65】**“The psychiatrist may retire soon and I don’t know if she will be replaced”(midwife 4).**\n\n【66】**We only have 1 useless psychiatrist and 1 social worker； they help a bit at least(midwife 3).**\n\n【67】**\"We need better follow-up”**\n\n【68】**“We can’t refer； we just let the obstetrician know”**\n\n【69】**“We do follow-up with the child and family health nurse and flag women if we are concerned”**\n\n【70】**Further suggestions about the psychosocial screening process/procedure?**\n\n【71】**As mentioned by the NUM， it would be good to talk to the women more postnatally， including debriefing (midwife 2).**\n\n【72】**“Ongoing support/training so that staff can repeat the EPDS\". We need an update(midwife 3).**\n\n【73】**“More access to public health services would be helpful”(midwife4).**\n\n【74】**“Sometimes the fathers look depressed； I suppose we could also give them an EPDS?”**\n\n【75】**“I think that we could re-administer the EPDS during antenatal classes at 32/40 approx， as often concerns come up in the classes. These concerns may not have been there at 12-20 weeks when we book them in”.**\n\n【76】**“Our midwives are older here and attuned to women's needs due to their life experience， they have been there， done that， had their families”However， the postnatal midwives would not know how to score； use or flag an EPDS score so need training”.**\n\n【77】**“If we are concerned postnatally we often ask the husband what the woman is normally like”**\n\n【78】**“We need a social worker， just for this unit**\n\n【79】**“We need a community link for the women”**\n\n【80】**“We need to be clear of the referral pathways to help a woman， instead of feeling lost\".**\n\n【81】**“The antenatal classes may be an opportunity to educate the women about psychosocial issues， however， we have such a poor**\n\n【82】**attendance at these classes， as women view them as only for a woman wanting/booking in for a natural birth， not a C/S. Midwives in the obstetricians’ rooms could screen/support the women also. The women need to book in earlier and if they are identified as at risk we could see them again\"(Midwife 3).**\n\n【83】**Discussion**\n\n【84】**At the time of the study， only one other private hospital in Sydney was screening women and their midwives were trained in psychosocial assessment. There were mixed views on psychosocial screening and barriers to screening were identified. Benefits were also identified：early identification of problems， standardization and patient-focused care. However， midwives also expressed concerns： suicide ideation， intrusiveness of questions， “some women lie\"， not wanting to screen all women， lack of support systems， cultural barriers， and inaccurate answers， power barriers with obstetricians， husband interference， fear and powerlessness. Relevant suggestions were made： appropriate and adequate education， training and support of midwives； flagging high risk women； more in-house resources and external resources community links， and employing a central midwife with interest and expertise in psychosocial assessment and screening. Midwives had various views on the program. Some felt that it was within their work role， others did not. Some were fearful of what could be revealed by the woman and how to deal with it. There was an identified concern that obstetricians did not take seriously any concerns highlighted by the midwife about a woman's psychosocial difficulties. There was a sense of a lack of ownership’of the women， therefore a feeling of helplessness in addressing their needs. Some midwives indicated an interest in a woman's perinatal mental health/psychosocial risk factors；however others expressed a concern that this was not part of their role. This highlights the need to educate and support midwives working in the private sector on their important role in enhancing the perinatal mental health of women in their care. Their role includes potential for prevention， early intervention and health promotion to benefit not only the woman but her child， partner and family.**\n\n【85】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【86】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**1\\.

Investigation pointed to Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA)and hypokalemia. The patient underwent neuroimaging studies and Magnetic Resonance (MRI) showed a pituitary macroadenoma with suprasellar invasion. Growth Hormone (GH) and IGF-1 (Insulin Growth Factor-1) levels were increased and diagnosis of acromegaly was then established. In the fifth day there was a peak of Creatine Kinase (CK) with progressive decrease. After 12 days of hospitalization， with resistant hyperglycemia， proximal flaccid tetra paresis and global hyporeflexia (MRC score of40 points) was noted. Clinical diagnosis of Critical Illness Myopathy (CIM) was established. After 30days of hospitalization， he was discharged with MRC score of 50 points and improves in CK levels.**\n\n【13】**Discussion： The presented case shows a CIM， a type of ICUAW. Some important risk factors are endocrine logical (thyroid diseases， diabetes， adrenal and pituitary dysfunctions). The patient presented hyperglycemia and underwent a prolonged period of hospitalization and use of glucocorticoid medications， increasing the risk of the disease. With clinical management and physiotherapy the patient regained autonomy.**\n\n【14】**Conclusion： ICUAW can bring long-term consequences， so that early identification and management as well as preventive measures are primordial to minimize chronic disability and morbidity.**\n\n【15】**Introduction**\n\n【16】**Intensive Care Unit-Acquired Weakness (ICUAW) is a growing problem in critically ill patients and is associated with a longer duration of mechanical ventilation， greater permanence and in-hospital mortality， in addition to higher costs to the health system. Preventing its risk factors， therefore， becomes fundamental in the approach to the critical patient 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.**\n\n【17】**Case Presentation**\n\n【18】**Male， 45 years old， with no known comorbidities or use of medications， entered the Emergency Service of Santa Casa de Sao Paulo， with a drop in general condition， fluctuation in consciousness and dehydration. Upon admission， Glasgow 14， severe dehydration and pale. Ectoscopy showing acromegalic facies， enlarged extremities， acrochordons in the cervical region， macroglossia and skin sweating. Vital signs： Blood pressure 100 mmHgx60mmHg， HR 100 bpm， SatO，97% in room air， capillary blood glucose above 500 mg/dL. Laboratory tests were performed， of which alterations are reported： plasma glucose 503 mg/dL (RV 70-99)， glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) 9.8%(RV<5.7%)， creatinine 1.9 mg/dL (RV 0.6-1.1)， plasma sodium 175 mEq/L (RV 135 to 145)， potassium 3.4mEq/L (RV 3.5 to 5.1)， CPK 8023 U/L (RV 38 to 174) and arterial blood gases： pH 7.2，pCO2 19， HCO3 6.3，BE-3.2 and lactate 3.9. Type 1 urine with 3 ketonuria crosses.**\n\n【19】**The patient was diagnosed with Diabetes and Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA)， starting treatment for DKA，prioritizing intravenous hydration， with care not to reduce acute sodium levels， in addition**\n\n【20】**to an intravenous insulin pump， after correction of hypokalemia. Due to the fluctuation in consciousness， the patient underwent a cranial tomography， showing a lesion in the pituitary topography， progressing the investigation with Magnetic Resonance (MRI)， which showed a Pituitary Macro adenoma with suprasellar invasion， compressing optical chiasma， measuring in its largest axis 6.1 cm.**\n\n【21】Pituitary hormone measurements were performed： GH>200mcg/L， IGF-1 476 ng/mL (RV 112 to 282)， Prolactin 21 mcg/L (RV up to 24)， ACTH 28p g/mL， Basal cortisol 23 mg/dL (RV>15)， TSH1.2 mUI/L (RV 0.45 to 4.5) and free T4 0.5 ng/dL (RV 0.6 to 1.3).\n\n【22】**Diagnosis of Acromegaly due to hormonal changes， lesion in adenohypophysis and suggestive phenotype. Treatment with a somatostatin analogue (Octreotide) 20 mg monthly was started， in addition to a dopaminergic agonist (Cabergoline) 1.5 mg/week.**\n\n【23】**One day after admission， the patient evolved with a decrease in the level of consciousness requiring Orotracheal Intubation (OTI). He maintained high sodium levels， but already improving DKA. He was kept under OTI for 4 days， being extubated after normalization in sodium levels.**\n\n【24】**The patient refused the surgical procedure for the treatment of acromegaly. He remained with difficult glycemic control during the period of hospitalization， with improvement in intra hospital glucose levels after about 15 days of admission， using high doses of insulin (2 ui/kg/day). He also received treatment with corticosteroids(hydrocortisone 300 mg/day for 8 days， followed by prednisone 40mg/day for 18 days) due to the airway infection associated with the condition (sinusitis).**\n\n【25】**After 12 days of hospitalization， a picture of flaccid tetra paresis of proximal predominance (total MRC score of 40 points)， associated with global hyporeflexia， without changes in cranialnerves， sensitivity or in other modalities on neurological examination， was noted. Cerebrospinal fluid was normal. On the fourth day of hospitalization，he presented a Creatine Kinase (CK) of 12665， with a peak on the fifth day of 12888， followed by a gradual decrease during hospitalization. In the two weeks following extubation， the patient showed progressive clinical improvement in the peripheral nervous system， especially after better glycemic control. Due to the presence of generalized muscle weakness after severe， diffuse， symmetrical， flaccid pattern and without involvement of cranial nerves， associated with a sum of MRC less than 48 points， a diagnosis of myopathy of the critically ill patient was then established.**\n\n【26】**At the time of hospital discharge， 30 days after admission， the patient had a sum of the MRC score of 50 points， good glycemic control， using insulin， improvement in CPK， creatinine and sodium levels. Maintained GH 195 mcg/L (RV<1)and with refusal of surgical procedure. Referred to the endocrinology clinic to follow up on the diagnoses of acromegaly and diabetes； and the neurology outpatient clinic for follow-up of the diagnosis of myopathy.**\n\n【27】**Given the current epidemiological context， we emphasize that throughout the hospitalization period， the patient did not show any signs or symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 infection.**\n\n【28】**Discussion**\n\n【29】**In the case in question， the patient had multiple risk factors for the development ofICU-Acquired Weakness (ICUAW)and had a course of Critical Illness Myopathy (CIM). Although the pathophysiology of CIM is still being studied， the likely mechanisms include**\n\n【30】**inhibition of protein synthesis， mitochondrial dysfunction， changes in the ubiquitin-proteasome system， oxidative stress and changes in intramuscular calcium homeostasis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Hyperglycemia associated or not with the use of steroids， uise of neuromuscular blockers and sepsis are the main risk factors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.**\n\n【31】**Myopathy is worsened by multiple endocrine logical and metabolic factors. Among them， thyroid diseases， diabetes， adrenal dysfunctions and acromegaly stand out 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. The patient in question had hyperglycemia， with DKA，and was diagnosed with acromegaly during hospitalization. Acromegaly， characterized by high plasma levels of GH and IGF-1， has pituitary adenomas as its main etiology. It usually causes slowly progressive proximal myopathy and normal CPK levels 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Myopathy presented by the patient probably was not due to the acromegaly， once there was clinical neurological improvementdespitee maintaining activity cof this disease， documented by the presence of high GH levels， even after therapy with somatostatin analog.**\n\n【32】**Diabetes is associated with multiple presentations of neuropathy and muscle involvement. Pathophysiology may be associated with microvascular changes in muscle and nerve regions， but neuropathies arenot common in the first years ofthe disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Theytendtoappear after 10 years of diagnosis and are commonly associated with other micro vascular lesions typical of this disease， such as retinopathy and nephropathy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Regarding the clinical muscle condition， it has been documented in some cases that the cause of the injury is probably due to focal myonecrosis， followed by micro vascular injury 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.**\n\n【33】**Low carbohydrate diet and hydration should be instituted， in addition to the measurement of glycated Hemoglobin (HbA1c)， aiming at the previous diagnosis of diabetes， in those patients with in-hospital hyperglycemia in addition to assisting in the management of the disease at hospital discharge 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. The insulin prescription should ideally be performed according to the protocol of each institution or with the help of a specialist. Glycemic control aims at an intra-hospital goal between 140 and 180 mg/dl 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6-8\\]</u>. These measures reduce overall mortality and the risk of developing polyneuropathy in critically ill patients. Values below 100 mg/dL are correlated with increased mortality， due to the risk of severe hypoglycemia and， therefore， should be avoided \\[8，9\\].**\n\n【34】**Myopathy mainly affects the proximal and axial muscles and makes weaning from mechanical ventilation and recovery of normal respiratory function difficult. It can be associated with elevation of muscle enzymes， such as increased Creatine Kinase (CK)， which can assist in diagnosis， as occurred in the case reported. However， CK values within normal levels can be found in mild cases or at the beginning of muscle involvement and， therefore， should not exclude the diagnosis in the face of a strong clinical suspicion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.**\n\n【35】**In the Electroneuromyography exam， changes such as the reduction of the amplitude and duration of the action potentials of the motor unit with early recruitment stand out， in which there may be， in some cases， fibrillations and positive acute waves. In nerve conduction studies， the result is usually normal， but there may be a reduction in the amplitude of the Compound Muscle Action Potential(CMAP) with prolonged duration， suggesting MDC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.**\n\n【36】Muscle biopsy shows signs of myopathy with loss of myosin， severe atrophy of type 2 fast-twitch fibers and loss of the myosin heavy chain. Findings such as accumulation of inflammatory cells， glycogen or lipids are not typical of MDC and indicate the need for\n\n【37】**investigation of differential diagnosis， such as immune-mediated inflammatory myopathies， dystrophic or metabolic myopathy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.**\n\n【38】**The patient persistently refused to perform invasive exams， as he progressed with evident clinical improvement. Such complementary exams were not performed and a diagnosis was established based on clinical criteria：“Generalized weakness developing after the onset of a serious illness； diffuse weakness (affecting the proximal and distal muscles)， symmetrical， flabby and sparing cranial nerves； the sum of the MRC-SS score <48 points， more than once with an interval>24h； and other causes of weakness unrelated to serious illnesses have been ruled out.”**\n\n【39】**Conclusion**\n\n【40】**ICUAW canbring long-term consequences. It is important to pay attention to identify it， in the ICU environment， and provide early rehabilitation in order to minimize chronic dysfunctions，morbidity and disability.**\n\n【41】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【42】通用结尾删除-1:<u>1\\. **Burtin C， Clerckx B， Robbeets C， Ferdinande P， Langer D， Troosters T， et** **al.

The virus has since spread all across the world. Fever， fatigue， and respiratory problems， which can progress to pneumonia， are some of the symptoms. Symptoms usually emerge between 2 days and14 days.**\n\n【13】**Since being exposed to said virus， patients develop new， persistent or recurrent chronic health problems known as post-COVID diseases. Even Patients who did not suffer COVID-19symptoms in the days or weeks following their infection may also develop post-COVID issues. These conditions， also known as Long COVID，long-haul COVID， post-acute COVID-19， might manifest themselves as various combinations of health issues throughout days or weeks. Long term complications of these conditions include issues of cardiovascular system， respiratory system， neurologic system， psychiatric conditions etc.**\n\n【14】**Dysarthria is one of the reported post COVID condition. ASHA refers to Dysarthria as “a group of neurogenic speech disorders characterized by \"abnormalities in the strength， speed， range， steadiness， tone， or accuracy of movements required for breathing， phonatory， resonatory， articulatory， or prosodic aspects of speech production\" 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. These abnormalities are due to one or more sensorimotor problems-including weakness or paralysis， in coordination， involuntary movements， or excessive， reduced， or variable muscle tone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.**\n\n【15】**Typically dysarthria is caused due to any pathophysiological altercations in the nervous system like cerebrovascular incidents， neural infection， and degenerative conditions etc. Dysarthria following COVID-19 infection is predominantly caused either due to stroke 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2-4\\]</u>， or due to infections ofnervous systems like meningitis and encephalitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5-7\\]</u>. However， very rarely COVID-19virus by itself directly damages the speech musculature thus causing dysarthria. Even though some authors have reported skeletal muscle pain and weakness in cases post-COVID-19 \\[8，9\\]， it is seldom reflected in the speech and language functions. In this report， we present such a case that did not have marked motoric weakness but had significant dysarthric component post COVID.**\n\n【16】**Objectives**\n\n【17】**Report the in depth evaluation of case with Dysarthria Post COVID-19 infection.**\n\n【18】**Detail the relationship between post-COVID condition and dysarthria.**\n\n【19】**Methods**\n\n【20】**A 52-year-old male with a history of COVID-19 came to our department after 8 months of post-infection. The client reported progressive slurring of speech， left-sided tongue deviations， and swallowing difficulty following COVID-19 infection. The client underwent objective as well as subjective evaluation for all the speech and language parameters.**\n\n【21】**Screening MRI of brain was done followed by nerve conduction study. The client underwent detailed subjective evaluation of all the speech subsystem during which each speech subsystems namely； respiratory， phonatory， articulatory，resonatory and prosodic， were assessed using various task. Respiratory subsystem was assessed by observing the client's breathing at rest as well as during speech. To assess the patient s respiration， he was instructed to take a deep breath in via the mouth and let it out slowly. The patient was instructed to count to 20 as rapidly as possible on one breath to assess respiration in speech. During this the client’s breathing pattern， effort， capacity etc during expiration and inspiration was recorded. Phonatory subsystem was assessed by asking the client to**\n\n【22】**produce /a/， /i/， /u/ sound at length as well as during conversation with the client. The duration to which the client can prolong the vowel is jotted together with the pitch， loudness and quality of client’s voice. Pitch and loudness scaling was carried out to assess pitch and loudness range. The first task for assessing articulatory subsystem included conversing with the client while the second task included picture/topic description. During the course of these tasks， the errors in production of various consonant and vowel sounds are recorded with comment on overall intelligibility of speech. Resonatory system was assessed by asking the client to produce /mae/ and /pae/alternatively. The perceptible difference between both the sounds was scrutinized. Also， the nasality during phonation of /a/ was noted. Prosodic system assessment included the reading of contrastive stress words and informal assessment of rhythm and intonation during various conversation instances (questions， narratives， statements etc).**\n\n【23】**Objective evaluation conducted included Dr. Speech (Tiger DRS， Inc) for phonatory-respiratory system， Electroglottography(Tiger DRS， Inc) for phonatory system. Fundamental frequency， jitter， shimmer， amplitude tremor， ofthe sounds /a/， /e/ and /u/ were recorded using Dr Speech software. Frenchay Dysarthria Assessment was administered for rating the overall severity of dysarthria 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.**\n\n【24】**Dysphagia evaluation was carried out subjectively. The client was asked whether he cough or choke while eating. He was also asked whether he had difficulty in clearing throat following which the client was observed while drinking } cup of cold water and then while eating a cookie. The client was questioned whether he had any difficulties swallowing， eating quickly， or having limits on the sorts of things he could consume.**\n\n【25】**Objective evaluation impression**\n\n【26】**Oromotor examination was carried out subjectively to chart the weakness at the level of articulators. Structural abnormality of lips at rest was observed. The patient was asked to give an exaggerated smile to check lip spreading. Lip seal was assessed by blowing air into cheeks and by maintain for 15 sec. And then the patient was asked to say /P/./P/ crisply and clearly for 10 times. Lips articulatory movements were tested by repeating “oo ee” for 10 segments in 10sec. The movements of lips in conversation were observed. Palatal maintenance was assessed by asking the patient to say-“ah-ah-ah\"for. Tongue at rest was assessed by asking the patient to open his mouth. Tongue functions like protrusion， elevation，lateral movements were assessed. Alternate movements of tongue were assessed by asking the patient to say \"ka la” for 10 times as quickly as possible. Intelligibility of words was also assessed.**\n\n【27】**Results**\n\n【28】**Table 11 reveals the obiective evaluation done andtheir respective results. The client’s imaging reports reveal mild diffuse neuroparenchymal atrophy. Nerve conduction study report shows， Axonal motor neuropathy involving bilateral peroneal nerves. Electroglottography results show normal glottal wave morphology with all the quotients within normal limits， however， voice evaluation through Dr Speech reveals hoarse voice with predominantly breathy voice quality.

Fasciculation/fibrillations are also evident with mild limitation in range and rate of motion.**\n\n【42】**Detailed evaluation of all the speech subsystem is shown in Table4. As shown in the Table 4， results of subjective evaluation of all subsystems of speech with swallowing assessment convey the patient to be mildly dysarthric.**\n\n【43】**Discussion**\n\n【44】**Through an in depth evaluation， our client was provisionally diagnosed with mild Dysarthria. The client possessed weakness in**\n\n【45】**the speech musculature. Surprisingly， the weakness commenced after the recovery from COVID-19 infection. However， the client did not have any conventional positive etiology for his dysarthric component albeit having hypertension. The hypertension as well originated as a post COVID-19 condition. The diffuse parenchymal atrophy reported in the imaging can be attributed to age related neurophysiological alterations. It cannot account for the speech deficits portrayed by the client， as it developed acutely post COVID-19 as opposed to progressive slurring typically reported in age-related speech deteriorations. Furthermore， the peroneal neuropathy reported in the client， would not directly affect speech. Hence， considering all of these facts， we can establish that hypertension was the direct cause of dysarthria. Even though hypertension has been along-established risk factor for dysarthria by virtue of its role in cardiovascular incidences， it in itself is rarely considered as the causative agent. Our case report substantiate the finding that hypertension alone can lead to weakness in muscles thereby leading to dysarthria.**\n\n【46】**The pathophysiology behind this sequela can stem from the degrading effect of hypertension on the body. As most of the muscles involved in speech are highly vascular in nature， they are immensely vulnerable to the adverse effect of hypertension. The prolonged contraction in these muscles as a response to increased blood pressure can bring about generalized soreness in them， which would result in overall fatigue with mild dysarthric speech. Another major reason that dominates the previous could be that COVID-19 virus interacts with the angiotensin converting enzyme and angiotensin receptors located in the endothelium thereby altering the pathophysiological**\n\n【47】Table 4： Impressions of subjective evaluation.\n\n| **Subjective evaluation**  |  | **Results**  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Evaluation of subsystem**  | **Articulation**  | **Distorted lingual sounds with reduced intelligibility of speech**  |\n| **Evaluation of subsystem**  | **Phonation**  | **/a：/-6.05s**  |\n| **Evaluation of subsystem**  | **Phonation**  | **/i/-5.98s**  |\n| **Evaluation of subsystem**  | **Phonation**  | **/u：-5.77s**  |\n| **Evaluation of subsystem**  | **Phonation**  | **s/z-0.77s**  |\n| **Evaluation of subsystem**  | **Respiration**  | **Abdominal breathing present with inadequate respiratory support**  |\n| **Evaluation of subsystem**  | **Resonation**  | **Hyponasal sound with reduced nasal emission.**  |\n| **Evaluation of subsystem**  | **Prosody**  | **Inadequate stress**  |\n| **Swallowing Assessment**  |  | **Chewing difficulty for solids and occasionally chocking is observed after drinking liquids.

There is an increase pool of evidence that suggest a causal relationship between brain damage and heart dysfunction. It is at times difficult to ascertain whether the cardiac dysfunction seen in patients with acute ischemic stroke is triggered by the stroke or is the underlying cause ofthe stroke.**\n\n【4】**Case Studv**\n\n【5】**We present a 75-year-old African Arab male known hypertensive who was admitted with a history of sudden onset of right sided weakness and aphasia. He had normal vital signs except for tachycardia 119 beats per minute (bpm) and tachypnea (25b/m). Systemic examination was noted for prominent neck veins， a displaced apex at 6\"h intercostal space and apical grade III systolic murmur. The computed tomography scan of the head revealed an acute left basal ganglia infarct. An ECG done on the day of admission showed sinus tachycardia (139 bpm) with T-wave inversion in lateral leads. Other work ups included an Echocardiogram (ECHO) which showed： Dilated left atrium， dilated and hypertrophied left ventricle with an Ejection Fraction (EF) of 44%， elevated Troponins and BNP were also documented. On the 2nd day the patient became dyspnoeic and required oxygen support， a repeat ECG was remarkable for atrial fibrillations (162 bpm). Intravenous Furosemide40 mg b.i.d， Digoxin 0.25 mg o.d， Losartan 50 mg o.d， Aspirin 75 mg o.d and Atorvastatin 40 mg nocte were administered \\[1，2\\]. Warfarin at a dose of 5 mg OD was also given (CHA2 DS2 VASc score of 6). On the fourth day he was doing better off oxygen support， chest was clear but was still tachycardic at a rate of 140 bpm. Propranolol at a dose of 40 mg b.i.d was added for rate control. He was discharged on the 74 day with a resting heart rate of 90 bpm.**\n\n【6】**Discussion**\n\n【7】**Cardiac dysfunction in the setting of acute stroke is not uncommon phenomenon. A number of cardiac complications have been reported after an acute stroke including heart attack， congestive heart failure， cardiac arrest and abnormal heart rhythm such as atrial fibrillation. This was the case in our patient who seems to have developed tachyarrhythmia (atrial fibrillation) and decompensated heart failure after an acute ischemic stroke. Many of the cardiac complications are preventable and thus early recognition and treatment can improve patients'outcomes.**\n\n【8】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【9】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**1\\. Samuels MA.

The cause of ARVD/C is not yet clear， but recent studies suggest it is most often related to desmosomal abnormalities \\[2，3\\]. ARVD/C is not a simple RV disease. Left Ventricular(LV) or biventricular involvement is increasingly identified in ARVD/C patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) is a valuable diagnostic tool for ARVD/C due to the high negative**\n\n【19】**predictive value， which can identify LV impairment and thus has a significant impact on clinical decision-making \\[5，6\\]. Most of the ARVD/C patients had CMR evidence of LV involvement， of which Late Gadolinium Enhancement (LGE) and Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) were the most sensitive indicators. Biventricular and left-dominant disease variants have been identified and have led some to use the term Arrhythmogenic Cardiomyopathy(ACM) to define the broader spectrum of the disease phenotypic expressions. LV involvement can be considered a late manifestation of advanced disease；however，recent studies at the level ofgenetic characterization have hypothesized that potential LV involvement may develop ahead of significant RV dysfunction in patients with ARVD/C. CMR evidence of LV involvement is a strong independent predictor of hard cardiac events 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Additionally，the presence of LV dysfunction plays an incremental role in predicting adverse cardiac events compared to RV dysfunction alone.**\n\n【20】**Case Presentation**\n\n【21】**Patient presentation**\n\n【22】**A 73 years old patient was admitted in our clinic with symptoms and signs of decompensated right and left sided heart failure.

The treatment included Acenocoumarol and beta blocker -Bisoprolol5 mg/daily.**\n\n【23】**Physical examination**\n\n【24】**The following symptoms were observed： elevated jugular venous pressure with positive venous pulse and hepatojugular reflux； vesicular breathing with basal crackles； Heart Rate (HR) 80/min， systolic murmur in the 4\"h left intercostal space，louder in inspiration； hepatomegaly，peripheral oedema.**\n\n【25】**Electrocardiogram (ECG)： on admission-atrial fibrillation， HR**\n\n【26】**80/min.**\n\n【27】**Holter ECG - Atrial fibrillation， heart rate 60/min， premature ventricular beats， non-sustained wide complex tachycardia (Figure1A).**\n\n【28】**Echocardiography demonstrated dilated _d_ cardiac chambers， predominantly right sided， mildly reduced left ventricular ejection fraction- 42%；right ventricular dysfunction， Fractional Area Change(FAC) - 28%； Tricuspid Annular Plane Systolic Excursion (TAPSE)-12 m/sec， Moderate Mitral Regurgitation (MR)， severe Tricuspid Regurgitation (TR)， with Pulmonary Artery Pressure (PAP) - 37mmHg .**\n\n【29】**Invasive study： coronary arteriography reveals no stenosis but dilation and aneurisms of coronary arteries， Left Circumflex Artery(LCx) arises from right coronary sinus. Right heart catheterization：high Right Atrial Pressure (RAP)-25/30/21 mmHg with severe tricuspid regurgitation and Ventricularization of Right Atrium (RA)， mild pulmonary hypertension PAP-35/20mmHg； Right Ventricular Pressure (RVP)-37/9/17 mmHg. Regarding diagnostics of unknown cardiomyopathy CMR was performed- cardiomegaly with RV and RA dilation (RA -75/67 mm)， apical trabeculation of RV， dilated inferior v. cava -30 mm， desynchrony in RV Outflow Tract (RVOT)， hypokinesis of the apical and septoapical segments of the RV and LV， jet of significant tricuspid regurgitation with incomplete coaptation of the valve leaflets. Late Gadolinium Enhancement (LGE) in RV free wall to RVOT and LV apical and septoapical zone. The RVEF was36.5% and LVEF - 45%， with moderately increased End-Diastolic Volume (EDV) and End-Systolic Volume (ESV) of LV (Figures1C-1E). Due to the wide complex tachycardia， CRT-D (Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy-Defibrillator) was implanted followed by no dynamics in echo-parameters， clinically stable， no sustained wide complex tachycardia on Holter ECG.**\n\n【30】**and septaapical part of LV，jet phenamenon proximal of tricuspid valve during systale with incomplete coaptaion of valve leaflets.

Using Next Generation Sequencing(NGS) of genes’ panel for hereditary cardiomyopathy， the following genetic variant was detected： NM\\_000256.3 (MYBPC3)： c.1316G>A(p.Gly439Asp). This sequence change replaces glycine with aspartic acid at codon 439 of the MYBPC3 protein (p.Gly439Asp). The glycine residue is highly conserved and there is a moderate physicochemical difference between glycine and aspartic acid. This variant is present in population databases at an extremely low frequency (rs763045718， ExAC 0.01%). Clin Var contains an entry for this variant in a patient with cardiomyopathy (Variation ID： 628463). Algorithms developed to predict the effect of missense changes on protein structure and function are either unavailable or do not agree on the potential impact of this missense change (SIFT： Deleterious； PolyPhen-2：Benign； Align-GVGD： Class C1). In summary， the available evidence is currently insufficient to determine the role of this variant in disease. Therefore， it has been classified as a Variant ofUncertain Significance.**\n\n【34】**Discussion**\n\n【35】**Abnormalities in cardiac Myosin Binding Protein C (MyBP-C， encoded by MYBPC3) are the most common cause of Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM) - mutations are detected in about 30% of HCM cases. Most MYBPC3 mutations in HCM result in premature termination codons that cause RNA degradation and a reduction of MyBP-C in the heart 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants(mostly missense and splicing mutations) in MYBPC3 were reported in about 5% of cases with Dilated Cardiomyopathy (DCM) as well通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. It is an interesting observation how different mutations in a same gene could make different myosin dysfunctions. It was demonstrated that stepwise loss of MyBP-C resulted in reciprocal augmentation of myosin contractility. Direct attenuation of myosin function， via a damaging missense variant (F764L) that causes Dilated Cardiomyopathy (DCM)， normalized the increased contractility from MyBP-C depletion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Another therapeutic agent MYK-461， a pharmacologic inhibitor of myosin ATPase， rescued relaxation deficits and restored normal contractility in HCM cardiomyocytes with MYBPC3 mutations. These data define dosage-dependent effects of MyBP-C on myosin that occur across the cardiac cvcle. Therapeutic strategies to MyBP-C activity may rescue depressed cardiac contractility in patients with DCM， whereas inhibiting myosin by MYK-461 should benefit the substantial proportion of HCM patients with MYBPC3 mutations.**\n\n【36】**Conclusion**\n\n【37】**WVi quite complex arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy， with left ventricle involvement and anomalies in coronary arteries， whereby genetic testing revealed an extremely rare genetic missense variant in MYBPC3 gene. The genetic change in the exon 14 of the gene causes aminoacidic change Glycine/Aspartic acid with a moderate physicochemical difference in the protein. The association of this mutation with the development of that complex cardiomyopathy is worthy to be investigated， since it could have an important impact on the application of new treatment， using specific agents， connected to myosin activity.**\n\n【38】**1\\.

A careful history，physical examination， radiology and endoscopy may reveal the exact pathology which may be in larynx， trachea or bronchus and so with a proper diagnosis， the management is successful with a faster recovery and a cure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. This misdiagnosis as asthma mayproduce a psychological trauma to parents and repeated visits to clinics will result into loss of working days and a monetary loss to parents as well as to state treasuries too. Wheezing is very common in children (40%) and by six years ofage， almost one half of children will have had at least one episode of wheezing. In children younger than 5 years， asthma is the most likely cause of recurrent wheezing but other causes should be considered in the differential diagnosis. The diagnosis ofa vocal cord dysfunction can be made using direct laryngoscopy， only during symptomatic periods or after the exercise \\[2，3\\]. A stridor may be produced by other glottis pathologies like glottis cysts， vocal cord granulations， polyps and papilloma. Aspirated foreign bodies， stuck up in larynx， can lead to persistent cough with dyspnea and a stridor and by going further down it may produce a generalized wheezing， necessitating an endoscopic retrieval 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Commonly found aspirated foreign bodies are food particles and seeds (70% of all episodes)， metallic or plastic pieces of toys or house hold items. The sudden onset of wheezing and choking may indicate foreign body aspiration， which warrants immediate bronchoscopy. If the history or physical examination suggests asthma， clinical guidelines recommend pulmonary function testing 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Stridor with drooling suggests the diagnosis of epiglottitis and there may be congenital anomalies involving the air passages.**\n\n【15】**In this study， six different etiologies irrespective ofage or sex and duration or site of lesion were taken up， to understand common antilogies which may be misinterpreted as bronchial asthma but can be diagnosed correctly by simple X-rays or CT scans and an endoscopy.**\n\n【16】**Case Series**\n\n【17】**Case 1**\n\n【18】**(Glottis pathology-Foreign body) One year old girl was having SOB and cough for 3 months， after swallowing pieces of a cloth pin (plastic). The mother removed it from child’s mouth but the cough continued with a hoarse week crying sound and occasionally with a mild to moderate stridor. The patient was diagnosed and being treated repeatedly for asthma. The chest X-ray was found non informative. An FFL was indicated but due to its unavailability a rigid direct laryngoscopy was done which revealed a piece ofplastic cloth pin lying in between the true vocal cords， hooked at anterior commissure . Immediate after the FB extraction， the stridor disappeared and in next 3days the crying became normal.**\n\n【19】**Case 2**\n\n【20】**(Glottic pathology-papilloma) A four years old girl was being treated off and on for dyspnoea， stridor and cyanosis with a diagnosis of asthma， for about a month. The chest X-ray was found normal. Again a FFL was indicated but due to its non-availability， a rigid direct laryngoscopy was done which revealed an obstructive papillomatous growth on superior surface of both true vocal cords .**\n\n【21】**Figure 2： Through RFL-papilloma on vocal cords.**\n\n【22】**An emergency tracheostomy had to be performed and then through RDL， an excisional biopsy of the glottic growth was done. The histology confirmed it to be a papilloma. After a check direct laryngoscopy (before the decannulation) and with a gradual decannulation， the tracheostomy tube was removed after a week.**\n\n【23】**Case 3**\n\n【24】**(Supra glottic pathology-cyst) A four months old child， mature at birth， had persistent cough， wheeze and stridor， for two months. The chest X-ray was normal. A provisional diagnosis of Laryngomalacia/Bronchial asthma was made and due to non availability of FFL， a RFL was performed which revealed a， 0.5 cm size， round cyst on superior surface of epiglottis with its left edge extending to vallecula pushing the left side of epiglottis downwards. The cyst wall was excised and a mucoid fluid was drained. Few granulations were also seen over left false vocal cord near the arytenoid. True vocal cords， sub glottis and trachea were found normal. Post operativelythe wheezing disappeared though the hoarseness persisted for 2 weeks. Histology report from the cyst in vallecula revealed it to be a retention cyst contents with inflammatory cells and the granulations tissues from the false vocal cord showed “Fibromyxoid spindle cell proliferation”.**\n\n【25】**Case 4**\n\n【26】**(Glottic inflammatory. pathology-Sub acute inflammation) A nine months old child had a hoarse and low volume crying sound with a persistent dry cough and respiratory distress， for 2 weeks. There was no history of respiratory tract infection. The child was known to be asthmatic. Clinically and radiologically the chest was clear. The CBC was found normal. A RFL (as FFL was not available) revealed congestion and edema on true vocal cords. The child was treated for subacute Laryngitis with steroids and antibiotics and in seven days the patient recovered fully.**\n\n【27】**Case 5**\n\n【28】**(Subglottic Pathology- FB) A nine months old child had breathlessness， noisy breathings for about two weeks and fever for 1week. She was being treated for bronchial asthma without any relief. The patient had mild inspiratory stridor with bilateral conducted**\n\n【29】**Figure 3： Subglottic FB as seen in X-ray of Neck (Lateral view).**\n\n【30】**Figure 4： Extracted Subglottic FB.**\n\n【31】**Figure 5： Chest X-ray.**\n\n【32】**sounds in lungs. Incidentally a chest X-ray was advised which revealed a radio-opaque， 5 mmx3 mm， rectangular FB in subglottic region .**\n\n【33】**The child was taken to operation theatre for a RFL but an emergency tracheostomy had to be performed first， because of the falling oxygen saturation. Through RFL the metallic FB was extracted， from the subglottic region.**\n\n【34】**Case 6**\n\n【35】**(Oesophageal Pathology- FB) A two years old child had cough， wheezing and choking with drooling of saliva for 2 weeks， more so during getting feeds， which was liquid only. The child was being treated for suspected bronchial asthma but without any benefit so a chest X-ray was advised which revealed a coin in upper third of oesophagus . Coin found partially eroded. A RFL was used to extract the coin. The surfaces of the coin were found partially eroded and rusted due to its long stay inside the oesophagus.**\n\n【36】**Discussion**\n\n【37】**Regarding the age factor， the cases in our study group， were in between 4 months to 4 years， similar to studies in the United States(between 1988 and 1994) which showed that the prevalence for**\n\n| **S.No.**  | **Site/age/sex**  | **Pathology**  | **Diag.by**  | **Remarks**  | **Managed by**  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **1**  | **Glottic/1 year/F**  | **F.B.(Plastic piece)**  | **RFL-**  | **Duration-3 Months (Cough， Hoarseness and Mild** **Stridor)**  | **RFL-Extraction**  |\n| **2**  | **Glottic/4 years/F**  | **Papilloma**  | **RFL-**  | **Duration 1 Month， (off and on-SOB， Stridor andCyanosis)**  | **RFL-Excision**  |\n| **3**  | **Supra-Glottic/4 months-/F**  | **Cyst and Granulations**  | **RFL-**  | **Duration 2 Months (Persistent Cough， Wheezes and** **Stridor)**  | **RFL-Excision**  |\n| **4**  | **Glottic/9 months/-M**  | **Inflammation**  | **RFL**  | **Duration 2 Weeks， (Cough， Hoarseness and a WeakSound on Crying)**  | **RFL-Diagnostic**  |\n\n【39】**Figure 6a： Coin found partially eroded. Figure 6b： Coin found partially eroded.**\n\n【40】**wheezing amongst two to three year olds was 26% and amongst 9to 11 year olds， it was 13%(4.5). FB aspirations， congenital laryngeal cysts and wheezes due to asthma are also common in young children， below 5 yrs of age. Regarding the sex incidence， in our study， 4 cases were females and 2 were male children but as we picked up the cases with only different pathologies and not age wise hence no inference can be drawn for the sex incidence. In other studies also no specific sex ratio has been found. Similarly a study on incidence of site and type of pathology was not possible in this study as cases were not selected for a particular period， site of lesion or as per pathology. The different sites with different pathologies were selected for the sake of discussion. In our study the symptoms and duration for all the cases was in between 2 weeks to 3 months as for this study the cases were selected who had dyspnea of recent origin with different pathologies. All the six cases in our study were being treated for asthma. These misdiagnosed asthmatic patients were later found to have a different pathology， emphasizing the importance of radiology and endoscopic investigation for a proper diagnosis. A diagnosed by rigid endoscopy was used due to non availability of a flexible fiberoptic endoscope and in radiology， plain X-rays of neck and chest were helpful. For removal of FB， rigid endoscopes were used which is still a preferred way of removing a relatively big FB from upper airway. In our study the FB seen were a coin (in oesophagus)， a ring from subglottis and a FB (plastic piece of a cloth pin) in glottis. As per the results are concerned， there was an immediate relief in case of FB extracted from glottis after excision of the glottic papilloma and when the coin was removed from upper third of oesophagus but the progress was gradual after supraglottic cyst removal and in the case of laryngitis. In the case of subglottic FB extraction， after a planned decannulation， the tracheostomy tube was removed.**\n\n【41】**Limitations**\n\n【42】**The cases were selected as per different aetiologies so this study is only for discussion of different aetiologies and their clinical confusing presentation as bronchial asthma (not in relation to incidence/sex/age).**\n\n【43】**Acknowledgement**\n\n【44】**My sincere thanks to the management of the GPHC for their permission to use the hospital records and to parents of the patients whose records were taken up in this study.**\n\n【45】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【46】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**1\\.

Due to the limitations of physical experiments such as difficulty in observation， rapid occurrence of phenomena， and dangers， as well as the impact of subjective and objective factors such as school funding， teacher constraints， and students weak experimental awareness， many physical experiments are not convenient to conduct in the classroom or laboratory， such as wave optics， fluid mechanics， particle physics， and nuclear physics experiments. The development of computer and simulation technology has enabled virtual experiments to be realized 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1-3\\]</u>， but most of the existing physical experiment simulation software in China is two-dimensional simulation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>， such as Zhang Wenmiaoyun et al.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>， who implemented optical experiment simulation based on Python， and Cao Fujun et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>，who designed and developed two-dimensional simulated electromagnetic experiments using EWB 5.0.

Currently， relevant scholars have developed 3D simulation software， such as Guo Tiezheng et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>， who implemented cricket system simulation experiments based on Unity3D， Xiong Yanfan et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>， who discussed the application of VR technology in practical teaching， and Feng Jiao et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>， who implemented flight simulation systems using the WebGL framework Three.js. Most of these 3D simulation software uses Unity3D，VR， and Three.js， with good results， However， using Unity3D 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u> requires downloading and installation， while VR has a high cost of configuring hardware devices. In view of the application requirements of physical experiment simulation software， Three.js， which is lightweight， plug-in free， and can be directly run in a browser 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>， has become the best choice for developing physical virtual simulation software.**\n\n【18】**This article takes the classic experiment of fluid mechanics \"Saxon bowl sinking experiment\"as an example， and uses Three js to design and implement a virtual simulation system for physical experiments.

It provides a set of simple solutions and practical built-in objects for creating 3D graphics. At the same time， it can quickly instantiate elements such as Scene， Light， Camera， and Renderer， greatly improving the development efficiency of 3D graphics during COVID-19 pandemic.**\n\n【24】**Workflow**\n\n【25】**The workflow of Three.js mainly includes four parts： creating a scene， configuring a scene， creating model objects， and rendering 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. The five main elements of 3D graphics rendering are： Scene， camera， object，light， and renderer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. A scene is a three-dimensional space used to place models， lights， and cameras， which are then rendered using a renderer. Objects need to be presented through a camera to determine the observation position， direction， and angle， and to determine the final scene displayed on the display. Objects are three-dimensional models for display.

Lights provide illumination for the scene， and different light sources and colors can be selected based on the scene effect. The function of the renderer is to render the created scene and the projections of three-dimensional objects observed by the camera on a two-dimensional plane， and present them to the browser .**\n\n【26】**Introduction to Saxon Bowl and Its Timing Principle**\n\n【27】**The Saxon bowl is a bowl with a perforated bottom， which is timed by observing the natural sinking of the bowl in water. In this paper， theoretical analysis of the relationship between the Saxon bowl sinking time and related physical parameters is conducted，and experimental simulation is established.**\n\n【28】**Assume that a bowl with a mass of m。 a thickness ofd， a height of h。 and a cross-sectional area of S holes at the bottom is placed in a liquid with an infinite width and a density of 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. When t=0， the bottom of the bowl is in contact with the liquid surface； At the time of t=t\\_， the bowl mouth is flush with the outer liquid surface， and the physical process of the Saxon bowl sinking within the time period 0≤tsta is analyzed. By establishing a physical model and combining fluid mechanics processes， it is concluded that the settling time of the Saxon bowl in liquid is 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>：**\n\n【29】**Design of Saxon Bowl3DSimulation Experimental System**\n\n【30】**System architecture design**\n\n【31】**The simulation experiment platform adopts a hierarchical model： A presentation layer， an application layer， a business logic layer， a data access layer， and a database five-tier structure (Figure2). The presentation layer is used to display system interfaces and experimental data， display simulation models， and provide interface services for the application layer. The business logic layer processes the system's business logic (rules， workflow， data integrity， etc.). The data access layer provides data.**\n\n【32】**3D animation design**\n\n【33】**The Saxon Bowl simulation experiment designed a series ofthree dimensional animations to simulate the real experimental process， and added interactive details of user operations， achieving human-computer interaction beyond the viewing level to enhance the user experience. For example， when measuring mass with a tray balance， the system will determine whether the user has placed items on the tray， and whether they have moved weights or weights， so as to control the left and right swing and placement position of the objects， in order to prevent model overlap and threading The vernier caliper will be opened and closed according to the user's operation； When measuring the density of a liquid with a densitometer， place it in the liquid to be measured and float up and down until it becomes stable； Liquid surface texture in a water tank simulates fluid flow； The Saxon bowl sinks， equipped with a movable bowl rack to ensure that the bowl is in a static state when it first touches the liquid level， and then sinks according to the sinking path simulated by the fitting curve.**\n\n【34】**During the process， the small hole in the bottom of the bowl flows liquid， and the liquid level in the bowl will rise accordingly.**\n\n【35】**Implementation of Saxon Bowl 3D Simulation Svstem**\n\n【36】**Construction of three-dimensional experimental environment**\n\n【37】**The experimental environment is an important link that affects the visual effect of virtual simulation experiments. In order to enhance the user's experience in experiments and restore the experimental scene of the laboratory Saxon Bowl experiment， it is necessary to build a 3D high-definition rendered virtual scene during COVID-19pandemic.**\n\n【38】**First， use the three coordinate axes x， y， and z in the scene created by three.js to form a simple virtual simulation experiment three-dimensional space 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>， laying the foundation for subsequent3D experimental equipment creation and experimental simulation effects. In order for the 3D model in the scene to also present a 3D**\n\n【39】**effect in the human eye rather than a simple planar figure， it is also necessary to create a Perspective Camera that can adjust its own observation range， angle， and distance from the 3D model to make the model present different visual effects. The light sources in the scene can not only enhance the 3D feel of the model， but also highlight the material characteristics of the model. For example， applying a point light source to a tray balance can well highlight its metal texture. In order to meet the requirements similar to those of real experiments， the system strictly sets camera parameters to ensure the effectiveness of experimental equipment measurement data during simulation experiments. In addition， arranging scene lights can also give a three-dimensional sense of the environment. The core code is as follows：**\n\n【40】**Construction of three-dimensional experimental equipment**\n\n【41】**Modeling of three-dimensional experimental equipment is the foundation for implementing a three-dimensional simulation system for physical experiments， providing necessary materials for the construction of virtual scenes and the implementation of interactive behaviors20.**\n\n【42】**Firstly， select an appropriate method to construct 3D model components based on real physical equipment data. Components with regular shapes are constructed using a box (THREE. BoxGeometry)， a cylinder (THREE. CylinderGeometry)， a sphere(THREE. SphereGeometry)， and a cone (THREE. ConeGeometry). Components with irregular shapes need to first obtain data on each vertex of the component， use THREE. Vector3() to store the data， and place it in a vertex array， then， THREE.Face30 stores the triangular faces formed by connecting the vertices of the component， and places them in a triangular face array. Finally， the required components can be constructed using the above two arrays. After all components are built， use the intersection， union， and subtract components in the Three BSP plug-in library to assemble the 3D model. Taking a vernier caliper as an example， the modeling scheme is as follows：**\n\n【43】**Let scene，camera，ambientLight**\n\n【44】**scene = new THREE.SceneO；//create a scene**\n\n【45】**camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(x， width /height， 1，**\n\n【46】**1000)；//create a Perspective Camera**\n\n【47】**camera.position.set(-3，1，30)；//position the camera**\n\n【48】**camera.lookAt(new THREE.Vector3(-10， 0， 0))；//set camera observation point**\n\n【49】**ambientLightt=InewTHREE.AmbientLight(0x606060)；//add light source**\n\n【50】**scene.add(ambientLight)；//Adding Lights to a Scene**\n\n【51】**The vernier caliper mainly consists of a ruler body， a depth ruler， a master ruler， a vernier ruler， an internal measuring claw， an external measuring claw， and fastening screws. The master ruler， ruler body， and depth ruler are selected as cuboids (THREE. BoxGeometry)，and the coordinates are placed or embedded in appropriate positions. For irregular shaped internal and external measuring claws， it is difficult to restore true vernier calipers using traditional geometric graphics. Now， it is possible to obtain the data of each vertex of this part through an array and store it. Then， use the connection function of THREE.Face3() to connect each vertex in the space， and finally combine the two parts of the space. The shape of the fastening screw is similar to the cylinder (THREE. CylinderGeometry) in the three.js library. We use the cylinder to construct its shape and place the figure in the appropriate position on the vernier caliper. The above process completes the basic construction of the vernier caliper equipment model，and then uses the THREE. TextureLoader texture map to add a scale to the vernier caliper .**\n\n【52】**Other experimental equipment such as tray scales， densitometers， and Saxon bowls all use the above modeling ideas. The parts with regular shapes use simple geometric graphics from the three.jslibrary， while the irregular parts use arrays to obtain vertex coordinates and**\n\n【53】**construct them in space using aline method. Finally，the two parts are combined during COVID-19 pandemic.**\n\n【54】**Implementation of three-dimensional interactive behavior**\n\n【55】**Experimental simulation effect is an important factor affecting its practical value. In addition to presenting realistic visual effects and realistic experimental processes， rich and detailed interaction behavior is also a major factor affecting experimental simulation effect 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>.**\n\n【56】**In the Saxon Bowl simulation experimental platform， the key to achieving interactive behavior is the interaction between a series of behaviors generated during user use and the coordinates of the model in the scene， thereby achieving manipulation of the model behavior. Due to the characteristics of the three.js runtime environment， using a mouse and keyboard is sufficient to change the X， Y，and Z coordinate values of the 3D model， completing all operations such as movingand rotating. By monitoring mouse and keyboard events during use， the model is bound to corresponding events. When the event is monitored and the corresponding event is triggered， the position of the model in three-dimensional space can be changed， achieving corresponding effects. This change in position is not constrained by the movement characteristics on the plane like 2D， and can achieve better 3D effects and experimental simulation effects during COVID-19 pandemic.**\n\n【57】**In the process of changing the position of a model， other models in the scene monitor their own coordinates and the model coordinates ofthe changed position in real time. Once the relationship between the two coordinates meets the coordinate relationship of the interaction conditions between the pre designed models， the two models will make the specified interaction behavior in time to achieve the ideal interaction effect. For example， during the process**\n\n【58】**of manipulating experimental equipment to move and place it on a pallet balance tray， the system will calculate the distance between the coordinates of the experimental equipment and the monitoring area above the pallet balance tray in real time. When the monitoring area above the pallet is reached， the interaction condition between the experimental equipment and the balance is reached， and the balance and experimental equipment will tilt in the corresponding direction to achieve interaction during COVID-19 pandemic.**\n\n【59】**In order to present 3D interactive effects and enhance the immersive experience of user experimental operations， the renderer. render() in three.js is used to refresh the position of the models in the scene based on coordinates after a very short period of time， and change the virtual simulation scene in real time.

His best-corrected visual acuity was 1.2 and 0.7 in the right and left eye， respectively. A serous retinal detachment in the posterior fundus was observed in both eyes. He was diagnosed with VKH disease. Fundus fluorescein angiography revealed multiple pinpoint leaks suggestive of VKH disease. He received 1000 mg of daily methylprednisolone infusion， for 3 days， followed by oral prednisolone， at 40 mg daily. Serous retinal detachment and headache promptly recurred during the oral administration of 40 mg of prednisolone， 8 days after initial steroid pulse therapy. Sub-Tenon triamcinolone acetonide was injected in both eyes， and serous retinal detachment and headache immediately improved. No recurrence was observed for 8 months until the present， and his best-corrected visual acuity was 0.9 in both eyes.**\n\n【15】**Conclusion： Sub-Tenon triamcinolone acetonide injection may be effective for VKH disease recurrence when added to conventional steroid pulse therapy. This case suggests the possibility of ecurrence in the early stage of steroid pulse therapy.**\n\n【16】**Introduction**\n\n【17】**Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) disease is an autoimmune-driven inflammation of the ocular， auditory， and meningeal structures that all contain melanocytes， which is the elective target of the inflammatory reaction \\[1，2\\]. VKH disease frequently recurs. Maruyama et al. reported that 20%of patients with VKH disease experience recurrence even with the best diagnostic and treatment strategies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Several reports have been presented about the recurrence of VKH disease from 10to 21 years after initial therapy according to a search of PubMed (keywords， VKH； search years，2000-2022) and CiNii Research (keywords， VKH； search years， 2000-2022) databases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4-6\\]</u>.**\n\n【18】**On the contrary， Masaki et al. reported that VKH disease recurred 3 days after initial prednisolone high-dose therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. No reports were presented about the early recurrence of VKH disease following steroid pulse therapy through PubMed and CiNii Research. Hence， evidence is insufficient and details are unclear about the recurrence of VKH disease following steroid pulse therapy.**\n\n【19】**Herein， we present a case of serous retinal detachment type of VKH disease that recurred after8 days of initial steroid pulse therapy. We report details in the current report as this case seems to be precious.**\n\n【20】**Case Presentation**\n\n【21】**A 56-year-old male patient presented at Dokkyo Medical University Saitama Medical Centre， Koshigaya， Japan in August 2022， with a headache and blurred vision for 6 days. He was suspected ofVKH disease at a previous eye clinic. The Best-Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) was 1.2 and 0.7 in the right and left eye. Both eyes have normal intraocular pressure. Slit-lamp biomicroscopy revealed mild iritis， and cells in the vitreous cavity in both eyes. Fundus examination revealed serous retinal detachments in both eyes .

The glycosylated hemoglobin(HbA1c)level was 5.3%.**\n\n【29】**The clinical diagnosis was VKH and the patient was immediately treated with 1000 mg of methylprednisolone (Solu-Medrol； Pfizer， New York， NY， USA) infusion daily for 3 days， followed by oral administration of 40 mg of prednisolone (Predonine； Shionogi， Osaka， Japan)， daily， which was gradually tapered off over the subsequent 6 months.**\n\n【30】**Headache， retinal pigment epithelium undulations， and serous retinal detachment improved at first， and the patient was discharged from 7 days after initial steroid pulse therapy. Headache and decreased vision recurred 8 days after initial therapy. Serous retinal detachment worsened  and choroidal thickness increased 11 days after initial therapy.**\n\n【31】**The BCVA was 0.2 and 0.5 in the right and left eyes， respectively. Sub-Tenon triamcinolone acetonide at 40 mg was injected in both eyes and serous retinal detachment and headache improved immediately. The BCVA improved by 0.6 in both eyes 21 days after initial therapy. Serous retinal detachment was almost resolved (Figure4a) and choroidal thickness improved by 484 and 421 um in the right and left eyes， respectively .**\n\n【32】**The therapeutic reaction was favorable， with no recurrence for 8months until the present.**\n\n【33】**Discussion**\n\n【34】**One of the features of VKH is recurrence. Recurrence that repeats several times will become a chronic type. The visual prognosis of chronic type is generally unfavorable. The PubMed (keywords， VKH； search years， 2000-2022) and CiNii Research (keywords， VKH； search years， 2000-2022) databases， revealed that VKH disease recurred after 8 days of initial steroid pulse therapy， which is quite short. Ishibazawa et al. reported that headache， tinnitus， and sensorineural hearing loss developed， with increased choroidal**\n\n【35】**thickness without other evidence of increased ocular inflammation after 6 months of initial steroid pulse therapy. Headache and ocular inflammation were observed in our case as recurrent symptoms. A few reports presented about the recurrence period from initial therapy， thus accumulation of cases is important.**\n\n【36】**Rubsamen et al. reported that VKH disease recurred in 9 (43%) of 21 patients in the first 3 months， usually in association with a rapid tapering of steroid dosage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Iwahashi et al. reported that poor initial visual acuity and rapid tapering of the corticosteroid were associated with posterior recurrence 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Our patient recurred during an oral administration of 40 mg of prednisolone after 3 days of1000 mg of methylprednisolone infusion. This change of medication may correspond to rapid tapering.**\n\n【37】**Hosoda et al. reported that sub-Tenon triamcinolone acetonide injection alone may have VKH recurrence 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Our patient received40 mg of sub-Tenon triamcinolone acetonide injection added with oral administration of 40 mg prednisolone. Therefore， recurrence was not observed. Our treatment was effective not only in ocular findings but also in headache resolution.**\n\n【38】**T cell reactivation which recognizes melanocyte antigenicity， suppressor T cell hypofunction which restrains expression of antigenicity of melanocyte，and antigenicity decoration of melanocyte by virus infection seem to be the causes of the mechanism of VKH recurrence 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Immune reactions may occur for the target of residual melanocytes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. However， these assumptions are one of the speculations because the mechanism of VKH disease onset and recurrence remains unclear. Rapid elucidation is anticipated.**\n\n【39】**Conclusion**\n\n【40】**VKH disease may recur in an early stage of steroid pulse therapy from the current case. We have to pay attention to recurrence at any time. Sub-Tenon triamcinolone acetonide injection added to oral administration of prednisolone is quite useful for the recurrence of VKH disease.**\n\n【41】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【42】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**1\\.

Her past medical history included heart transplant8 years ago for cardiomyopathy， hypertension and a recent open umbilical hernia repair with mesh. Her medications included oral immunosuppressive medications (tacrolimus and mycophenalate) and anti-hypertensive's (amlodipone). She was not known to have any allergies.**\n\n【10】**Routine observations on admission were normal. Abdominal examination demonstrated a non-distended abdomen with localized guarding and rebound tenderness in the right iliac fossa.**\n\n【11】**ECG was in sinus rhythm with heartbeat of 96 Beats per Minute (BPM). A recent echocardiogram demonstrated normal ventricular and valvular function. Routine biochemistry was largely unremarkable with a mildly raised CRP at 38 but normal white cell count and no evidence of neutrophilia. Computerized tomography showed uncomplicated acute appendicitis and a post-operative seroma around her previous open umbilical hernia repair site.**\n\n【12】**Broad spectrum intravenous antimicrobial treatment was commenced prior to surgery and the case was discussed with the patient's transplant team. It was advised that immunosuppressant agents be continued as per her usual dose. Additional treatment with steroids or anti-fungals was not recommended.**\n\n【13】**An open appendicectomy was performed. The appendix was divided and delivered through a Lanz incision using an Alexi's wound protector. The patient remained hemodynamically stable throughout the procedure with systolic BP ranging from 98 mmHg to 118 mmHg. She was admitted to a general surgical ward post-operatively where she made an unremarkable recovery and was discharged three days later. The patient returned 2 weeks post-operatively for a planned wound review and was noted to have a clean well-healing scar. No major complications were recorded within the 30-day post-operative period and histological examination of the specimen confirmed acute appendicitis.**\n\n【14】**Discussion**\n\n【15】A clear understandingand appreciation ofthe altered physiology in particular cardiac physiology in transplant patients is vital. This knowledge is crucial to the general surgeon and will help guide with decisions such as the best approach to intra-abdominal surgery. In addition it is important to recognize that transplant patients are often on of a cocktail of immunosuppressive medications and the impact this may have on post-operative complications， in particular surgical site infections. Effective management of such a patient is best approached with the aid of a multidisciplinary team.\n\n【16】**Altered cardiac physiology in transplant patients and the impact on intra-abdominal surgery**\n\n【17】**The transplanted heart lacks both sympathetic as well as parasympathetic innervation. The loss of vagal tone results in a higher resting heart rate； between 90-110 Beats per Minute (BPM) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Another key change in physiology is that the transplanted heart depends entirely on venous return. It is said to be pre-load dependant'通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. In normal cardiac physiology，hypovolaemia results in an increase in cardiac output by increasing heart rate and increasing contractility. This is achieved by the stimulation of neurohormonal pathways as well as the activation of Frank-Starling mechanism通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.**\n\n【18】**A transplanted heart cannot respond to sympathetic and parasympathetic stimuli， and is therefore dependant entirely on venous return \\[1，2\\]. This is an important consideration in intra-abdominal surgery， as many gold standard approaches are laparoscopic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Laparoscopic surgery**\n\n【19】**involves establishing pneumoperitoneum. The increase in intra-abdominal pressures during surgery may decrease venous return and this in turn may reduce heart rate. Unfortunately a denervated heart will be unable to compensate by utilizing neurohormonal pathways due to the reasons discussed above \\[1，2\\]. In the case reported here， this altered cardiac physiology was the primary reason an open approach was adopted. Whilst laparoscopic appendicectomy， is now the gold standard approach， in this case an open approach was in the patient's best interest.**\n\n【20】**Immunosuppression： surgical considerations**\n\n【21】**To reduce the risk of rejection， transplanted patients are on a combination of immunosuppressant medications. The commonest combination is tacrolimus and mycophenalate with or without prednisolone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Whilst an important， anti-rejection strategy， one of the key considerations post-operatively is the increased risk of infections. In particular the increased risk of surgical site infections通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. In our case this was an important consideration for several reasons. Firstly not only was our patient immunosuppressed， an additional factor to consider was the surgical approach. An open approach is associated with increased risk of surgical site infections通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. To reduce this risk， intra-operatively an Alexi's wound retractor was used. This offered protection to the wound edge during the operation， in particular during dissection of the acutely inflamed appendix. An additional advantage of using an Alexi’s wound retractor was to confer better visibility intra-operatively facilitating the identification of the appendix prior to dissection.**\n\n【22】**Effective multidisciplinary approach**\n\n【23】**In order to effectively manage transplant patients it is important to involve a number of teams.**\n\n【24】**Pre-operatively， as per Enhanced Recovery after Surgery (ERAS)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u> protocol， the patient was counseled. Information regarding the approach was discussed with the patient and consent was obtained for an open appendicectomy， due to reasons discussed above. Additionally， advice was sought from the patient’s transplant team. In particular， guidance was sought over the need to continue immunosuppression pre and post operatively. Furthermore a clear direction was sought for the need to start steroid and initiate anti-fungal therapy. The need for anti-microbials was also discussed with the microbiologists.**\n\n【25】**Pre-operatively， the case was discussed with cardiologist and cardiac physiologists to ensure that the transplanted heart was optimized prior to general anesthesia. All essential imaging and**\n\n【26】**cardiac physiology tests (echocardiogram， ECG) were conducted to the highest standard. Anesthetic opinion was sought both pre-operatively and intra-operatively， paying particular regard to goal directed fluid management and effective use of pain management. In accordance with ERAS intra-operative protocols， the incision was deliberately made as small as possible and care was taken to ensure strict aseptic control was maintained throughout. Despite a small incision， surgical visibility was adequate due to the use of the Alexis wound retractor.**\n\n【27】**Post-operatively，thepatient Was discussed with the physiotherapists and early mobilization was encouraged with good oral pain control. Once again in keeping with the ERAS protocols， the patient was encouraged to start oral intake early and effective pain management was prescribed.**\n\n【28】**Effective management of such patients is dependent on input from a number of specialties. Strict adherence to the ERAS protocols pre， peri and post-operatively ensures that patients are offered the best possible care allowing them to return to their normal activities of daily life sooner and decreasing post-operative complications.**\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>1\\.

As echocardiographic examination is not routinely done in all cases of pulmonary embolism， it can be assumed that the exact incidence is underreported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Prompt diagnosis of these free floating thrombi is of utmost importance as they can embolize at any moment and thus require emergency treatment. Rarely these thrombi can extend into left atrium across a patent foramen ovale \\[5，6\\]. We report an unusual case of acute pulmonary embolism with presence of a floating thrombus in right atrium with extension into left atrium through a patent foramen ovale.**\n\n【17】**Case Presentation**\n\n【18】**A 54 years old male patient presented in emergency department of our institute with chief complaints of sudden onset shortness ofbreath (NYHA class IV) for lasteight hours. On examination patient had tachycardia (pulse rate of 120 beats per min) and tachypnea (respiratory rate of 28/min) with hypotension (blood pressure： 90/62 mmHg). Electrocardiography (ECG) showed sinus tachycardia with non-specific ST/T changes. Troponin-I and D-Dimer values were raised. Transthoracic echocardiographic examination showed dilated right atrium (RA)， right ventricle(RV) and main pulmonary artery. There was RV systolic dysfunction \\[Tricuspid Annular Plane Systolic Excursion (TAPSE) =16\\] and moderate tricuspid regurgitation (TR gradient =75 mmHg). A large right atrial thrombus was seen  which was oscillating into right ventricle in diastole via tricuspid valve . Another thrombus was seen in left atrium  with presence of a defect in interatrial septum likely suggestive of patent foramen ovale (Figure1C). However continuity of thrombus across patent foramen ovale could not be demonstrated on echocardiographic examination.**\n\n【19】**Followed by this， patient underwent non ECG gated CT pulmonary angiography， which demonstrated a large partially occlusive thrombus in main pulmonary artery extending into right and left pulmonary arteries . A linear hypodense filling defect was seen in right atrium and ventricle  suggestive of thrombus. In addition filling defect was also noted in left atrium . On coronal reformatted images， continuity of thrombus across right and left atrium was demonstrated through a defect in interatrial septum . Doppler ultrasound for bilateral lower limbs did not show any evidence of deep venous thrombosis.**\n\n【20】**Based upon echocardiography and CT findings， a diagnosis of floating right atrial thrombus with extension across a patent foramen ovale with acute PTE was made. Patient was started on intravenous anticoagulation (low molecular weight heparin) and referred to higher center for surgical embolectomy， in view of high risk of systemic embolization. However， repeat transthoracic**\n\n【21】**Figure 1(A-D)： Transthoracic echocardiagraphy images showing flaating echogenic thrombus (white arrow) in right atrium (RA). The thrombus was seen oscillating into right ventricle (RV) through tricuspid valve in diastole(1B). In addition a defect was seen in interatrial septum (black arrow) with presence of echogenic thrombus (curved arrow in D) in left atrium (LA).**\n\n【22】**echocardiography in higher center showed marked reduction in size of thrombus. Subsequently the patient was managed with systemic thrombolysis with injection tenecteplase with no evidence of systemic embolization. Patient improved clinically and was discharged after one week stay in hospital.**\n\n【23】**Discussion**\n\n【24】**Acute Pulmonary Thromboembolism (PTE) is a medical emergency with high mortality and morbidity. Combination of various diagnostic tests like plasma D-dimer levels， ventilation/perfusion lung scan， and spiral computed tomography and lower limb venous Doppler can be used to establish a diagnosis of acute PTE 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. In addition to the above mentioned diagnostic tests， it has been shown that transthoracic echocardiographic examination can help in early risk stratification in acute PTE， thereby influencing the management 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Echocardiography gives valuable information about pulmonary arterial hypertension， RA， RV dilation and RV hypokinesia.**\n\n【25】**Also， echocardiographic examination can demonstrate right heart thrombi in a patient of pulmonary embolism with a reported prevalence of 7% to18% \\[1，2\\]. Floating right heart thrombi are accompanied by severe pulmonary embolism and it has been shown that presence of right heart thrombi is predictive of worse outcome in cases of acute PTE \\[2，8\\]. These thrombi are thought to be in transit from peripheral venous system to pulmonary circulation. In extremely rare cases these thrombi can extend into left atrium through a patent foramen ovale. It has been proposed that increased pressure in right atrium due to RV overload can cause right heart thrombi to protrude across a patent foramen ovale 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. This condition is life threatening due to imminent risk of pulmonary and paradoxical embolism. Although the diagnosis of a free floating thrombus is straight forward on real time echocardiographic examination， occasionally it can be difficult to differentiate from other conditions like Chiari network， persistent eustachian or thebesian valves， atrial septal aneurysms or intracardiac tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.**\n\n【26】**Floating right heart thrombus is a therapeutic emergency and any delay to treatment could be lethal (with reported mortality upto40%)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Treatment options include anticoagulation， thrombolytic**\n\n【27】**Figure 2 (A-D)： CT pulmonary angiography axial maximum intensity projection (MIP) images demonstrating partially occlusive thrombus in main pulmonary artery (white arrow) extending into right and left pulmonary arteries (A， D). A linear hypodense thrombus was seen in RA and RV (black arrow in B) as well as in LA (black arrow in C). On coronal reformatted images continuity of thrombus in RA and LA was demonstrated (black arrow in D) through a defect in interatrial septum.**\n\n【28】**therapy and surgical embolectomy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>， but there is no consensus on ideal treatment. Thrombolytic and anticoagulant therapy is simple， rapid， non invasive and widely available. However， it may cause a fixed thrombus to dislodge， leading to pulmonary embolism and may also lead to paradoxical systemic embolism in a case of entrapped thrombus in patent foramen ovale (as in our case). Also， thrombolytic therapy is associated with risk of significant bleeding. Surgical embolectomy on the other hand is invasive and associated with inherent delay， complications of general anesthesia and inability to remove thrombus beyond central pulmonary arteries. However a patent foramen ovale can be repaired at the time of surgery thereby reducing the risk of paradoxical embolism.**\n\n【29】**To conclude， right heart thrombi can be seen in association with acute pulmonary embolism and in extremely rare cases can extend across patent foramen ovale.A diagnosis can be made on transthoracic echocardiography. Treatment options include anticoagulation， thrombolysis and surgery or a combination of above.**\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>l.

The thymidine kinase 2 gene encode for mitochondrial thymidine kinase， which phosphorylates the pyrimidine nucleosides thymidine and deoxycytidine. The most frequent mutation is p.Lys202del and compounds heterozygous forms have been reported. We report a50-year-old female with recurrent rhabdomyolysis，bilateralptosis， and girdle limb weakness.Muscle biopsy presented frequent， red-raged fibers and dystrophic changes. The most severely affected muscles in magnetic resonance imaging axial T1-weighted sequences were the gluteus maximus， sartorius and tensor fasciae latae muscles.

The mtDNA encodes less than 0.1% of the proteins regulating mitochondrial activity， most encoding genes remain unknown \\[3，4\\]. TK2-deficiency myopathy is specifically caused by defects in the replication， maintenance， and repair of mitochondrial DNA by TK2， which is the first and limiting step in the phosphorylation of deoxypyrimidine nucleosides 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Several mutations have been described in the TK2 gene that leads to the myopathic form 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3-5\\]</u>.**\n\n【22】**TK2-related myopathy clinical picture is heterogeneous， and three forms have been described：infantile (<1 year)，childhood (1 to 12 years)， and late-onset myopathy (>12 years)， the latter being the most unusual (17.4%) and with a relatively better prognosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. In the late-onset group， the mean age of symptoms onset is between 17 and 31 years \\[6，7\\]， with a similar prevalence among gender， and mean survival is 19.8 to 23.0 years \\[6，7\\].**\n\n【23】**Muscle clinical manifestations are characterized by proximal weakness， ptosis， facial diplegia， ophthalmoparesis and dysphagia \\[6，7\\]. The natural progression of the disease evolves to respiratory failure at 10 years of presentation， requiring non-invasive mechanical ventilation \\[6，7\\]. Creatine Kinase (CK) may be normal， although it usually is elevated between 190 U/L to 6500 U/L \\[6，7\\]. Serum lactate is a nonsensible test and is elevated in only 25% of cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.**\n\n【24】**The genetics profile of TK-2 patients shows that p.Lys202del is the most frequent mutation in the TK2 gene in late-onset patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.

During her childhood， the patient had exercise intolerance without muscle weakness. At 36 years old， after a long flight， the patient presented an acute episode of limb girdle weakness， myalgias and a 25，000 U/L in serum CK. This episode lasted three days， then she returned to being asymptomatic， and CK returned to normal values.**\n\n【28】**The patient started a progressive girdle limb muscle weakness one year after the first rhabdomyolysis episode and slightly elevated CK(600 U/L to 900 U/L). At 47 and 50 years， she had new episodes of rhabdomyolysis (CK 15.000 and 17.000 U/L) episodes with no precise trigger. She was admitted to our hospital due to the last episode of rhabdomyolysis.**\n\n【29】**On examination， there was bilateral ptosis， orbicular oculi， and limb-girdle weakness.

A variety of new laparoscopic and endoscopic techniques exist to aid in the weight loss process， with some of the newest advances in intra gastric balloons. In this case report， we aim to answer the question of whether the Air-filled Gastric Balloon System can act as a bridge to definitive bariatric surgery， as an off-label use， in patients with a BMI greater than 65 kg/m.**\n\n【10】**Introduction**\n\n【11】**The prevalence of obesity is increasing worldwide， and The Center of Disease Control (CDC) data indicates that 39.8% of adults and 18.5% of youth in the United States are obese 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Obesity is associated with several comorbidities， including heart disease，stroke， diabetes， and various types of cancer. Additionally， obesity and related co morbid conditions impart an increasing economic burden on health care systems. For example， in 2008， it was estimated that the United States spent$142 billion USD on obesity-related medical costs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.**\n\n【12】**Although lifestyle modifications are first-line treatments for obesity， these approaches are generally ineffective due to several factors， particularly lack of patient compliance. Thus， various surgical interventions have emerged over the last five decades to facilitate obesity management. Since the first jejunoileal bypass was performed in 1954 by Dr. Kremen， bariatric surgical procedures have continued to evolve 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. With relatively recent advancements in endoscopic and laparoscopic techniques， there are now several procedures with varying degrees of complexity used for obesity management. An emerging treatment option for obesity is the intra gastric balloon.**\n\n【13】**Intra gastric balloons are currently used as an adjunctive therapy for weight loss in obese individuals. The principle mechanism of action of these balloons is to target the mechanoreceptors of the gastric wall. Once delivered into the stomach， they occupy the gastric cavity， induce an early sensation of satiety， and thereby reduce caloric intake.**\n\n【14】**Currently there are two types of intra gastric balloons： fluid-filled and air-filled. The Obalon Balloon System was approved for use in 2016 and is the first FDA approved swallow able balloon system designed for weight loss. Currently， the Obalon Balloon System is indicated for temporary use to facilitate weight loss in adults with a BMI of 30 kg/m’ to 40 kg/m’ who have failed to lose weight through diet and exercise. The system is intended to be used as an adjunct to a moderate intensity diet and behavior modification program.**\n\n【15】**The Obalon Balloon System comes in a set of three balloons that the patient swallows. Occasionally， endoscopy is used to assist in intra gastric placement of the baloon. All balloons must be removed 6 months after the first balloon is placed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Of the air-filled intra gastric balloon options， the Obalon Balloon System has been shown to be the most likely to achieve weight loss通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Aside from a rare potential association between fluid-filled intra gastric balloons and acute pancreatitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>， the side effect profile of the Obalon Balloon System is relatively benign. The most common adverse effects reported are nausea and emesis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Small bowel obstruction has also been reported from a migrating Obalon balloon， which was managed endoscopically 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Additionally， there is one reported case in Korea of gastric perforation in a patient with noncompliance of PPI therapy after intra gastric balloon insertion， however， it should be noted that the Obalon Balloon System was not used in this case 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.**\n\n【16】**Here， we report the first use of air-filled gastric balloon system (Obalon) as a successful adjunctive modality for bariatric surgery in a patient with morbid obesity in extremely high BMI(>65 kg/m²). To our knowledge， there has not been any other documented off-label use of an intra**\n\n【17】**gastric balloon system.**\n\n【18】**Case Presentation**\n\n【19】**A 52-year-old male with a history of arthritis， hypertension， hypothyroidism and morbid obesity presented in July 2018， for evaluation for bariatric surgery. His weight was 243 kg (BMI 70.7kg/m)andprevious attempts toloseweight with nutritional modification were unsuccessful. In addition，due to a history of arthritis，the patient was bed-bound and unable to carry out activities of daily living. Immobility and morbid obesity resulted in the development of an acute lower extremity deep vein thrombosis and shortness of breath， likely due to a pulmonary embolism， which was never confirmed because of the weight limit of the CT scanner. Due to his high BMI， and associated co morbid conditions， the patient was considered to be an extremely high risk bariatric surgical candidate. The decision was made， after comprehensive discussion with the patient， to utilize the Air-filled Gastric Balloon System to attempt weight loss and optimize the patient for bariatric surgery. He underwent insertion of a total of three intra gastric balloons from July to September 2018. He presented to Flushing Hospital Medical Center on February 5h， 2019for removal of the balloons.**\n\n【20】**Our patient lost a total of 73 kg and weighed 170 kg (BMI 49.5kg/m’) at the time of the intra gastric balloon removal. He is currently scheduled to undergo sleeve gastrectomy sometime in the next 3 to4 months.**\n\n【21】**Risk Profile**\n\n【22】**Based on the ACS NSQIP Surgical Risk Calculator 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>， we calculated that with our patient's initial weight (243 kg， BMI 70.7kg/m) and severe co morbid conditions， his risk of serious postoperative complications would have been 5.5%， which is double that of the average population at 2.4%. His calculated overall postoperative complication risk would have been 6.9%， compared to 3% in the average risk patient. By lowering his weight， his calculated risk of serious postoperative complication would decrease to 2.7% (which is similar to those at average risk at 2.4%).**\n\n【23】**Discussion**\n\n【24】**Intra gastric balloons have emerged as a safe and practical adjunct for weight loss in obese individuals. Among the air-filled balloon options， the Obalon Balloon System has been demonstrated to be most likely to result in weight loss 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Moreover， while the other methods involve at least an endoscopic suite for placement， the Obalon Balloon System is available in pill form and can be administered in an ambulatory setting. Since there is no requirement for anesthesia，the risk of complications is lower.**\n\n【25】**The safety profile of the Obalon Balloon System is based off of a double blinded，randomized controlled， clinical trialthatincluded 387patients with a BMI between 30 kg/m and 40 kg/m. These patients were randomized to receive either the Obalon Balloon System or a sham device and were assessed for weight loss and safety outcomes after an initial 24-week period 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Since this study， the Food and Drug Administration has approved the Obalon Balloon System for a targeted patient BMI between 30 kg/m’ to 40kg/m.**\n\n【26】**An important consideration in applying the Obalon Balloon**\n\n【27】**System is the cost. The Obalon Balloon System is not currently covered by insurance， thereby imparting a patient-provided cost of $6，000 to $8，500 USD. Thus， there is a potential socioeconomic burden that may affect endpoints in the future.**\n\n【28】**Our patient chose to undergo a pioneeringprocedure for a patient of his BMI. Had this not been offered， alternative options to this off-label use include intensive inpatient dietary modification and exercise programs， or direct to surgery. For patients with a BMI greater than65 k/m²， these alternate options， if failed， pose a greater risk and cost.**\n\n【29】**Prospective studies should be conducted to investigate the feasibility ofusing intra gastric balloons as a bridge to bariatric surgery in extremely obese individuals，that otherwise have a prohibitive risk tor surgical intervention.**\n\n【30】**Conclusion**\n\n【31】**Effective and safe weight loss in patients with morbid obesity is essential. In our patient， the air-filled gastric balloon system(specifically Obalon) offered a minimally invasive and compelling method in achieving adequate weight loss prior to bariatric surgery. We demonstrated the successful off-label use of the air-filled gastric balloon system as an adjunctive therapy to facilitate weight loss and serve as a bridge to bariatric surgery in a patient with an initial BMI greater than 65 kg/m.**\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>1\\.

India’s first peak was in September2020 and then the number decreased. However， India started vaccine diplomacy but did not arrange sufficient vaccine doses for their people. Lack of social distancing， no use of mask， attending social program fuelled the COVID-19 infection. India got one year to improve the health sector but in reality， all are in a dream now. Lack of oxygen support， vaccines， and capacity in hospital beds are now the bottlenecks to tackle the second wave of COVID-19 India.**\n\n【9】**Keywords： COVID-19；India； Second wave； Vaccine； First Wave； Economy**\n\n【10】**Introduction**\n\n【11】**The biggest threat in humankind is now COVID-19， which is of Zoonotic origin and spreads through aerosol transmission of respiratory droplets. It started from the seafood market in Wuhan， Hubei， China back in December 2019，and within 2 months， it spread worldwide and WHO declared it as pandemic \\[1，2\\]. Most common symptoms include dry cough， fever， difficulty of breathing， and tiredness or fatigue \\[3，4\\]. It is estimated that transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is occurring mainly by airborne 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. To tackle the issues， several countries went into a lockdown scheme. During this national lockdown， restrictions were imposed on most of the movement， home confinement was mandatory， and exceptions were given only for essential food shopping 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Physical distance， use of mask， hand sanitization， respiratory hygiene， prompt self-isolating， and prompt testing are the so-far worldwide COVID-19 prevention techniques. A recent survey of WHO reveals that globally90% of countries are still struggling to come back to their pre-COVID-19 condition in terms of health services.**\n\n【12】**Now， the world is experiencing a second wave of COVID-19 infection \\[7，8\\]. Often the second wave from infectious diseases occurs after a relative decrease in the number of patients with the disease. The second wave may increase among specific age groups or populations， or in particular areas of each country and become as widespread as the first wave. The first wave of a pandemic is followed some months later by a second or third wave of infection. This can be severe as experienced previously in the influenza pandemics of 1918 (H1H1)， 1957 (H2H2)， 1968 (H3N2)， and 2009(H1N1) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. It may be a question that why there is always a second wave. Probably the answer is， most often， infected people in one region do not develop herd immunity and they are re-exposed again to the infection from people who got infected from the first wave 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. After the COVID-19last year， WHO including all research articles， scientists， and researchers， expected that there could be a second wave from COVID-19. The threat arriving from the COVID-19 second wave was already assumed and reported by researchers \\[11，12\\].**\n\n【13】**Some countries， like South Korea and Singapore， got success to flatten the virus spreading by employing comprehensive testing and tracing regimes. Furthermore， UK， France， Italy， Spain managed to flatten the wave by imposing lockdowns. On June 22nd， 2020，South Korea announced the second wave although the number was low 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. In this country so far death count was 301 (as of July31，2020).South Korea has conducted 1，295，962 tests since January 3m， 2020， to detect the illness通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. On January 23，COVID-19 officially hit Vietnam and by the 8th of September 2020，Vietnam had a second wave 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. The first wave commenced in Spain， from mid-March 2020 and continued for 3 months and again the second wave started in mid-September 2020 which stayed until 2020Christmas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. Sweden's COVID-19 cases peaked during the first wave with 102 reported deaths(7-day rolling average) on April 215，2020.On December 20h， 2020， COVID-19 deaths in Sweden had reached more than 8，000 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. The second wave from COVID-19 was theoretically studied for Iran， where model validation and the prediction were performed using data from January 22nd to June 25h， 2020. It was predicted that the second wave would be more severe than the first wave. The most effective way to the improvement of weakly immune people is to employ appropriate medical**\n\n【14】**Figure 1： Total confirmed COVID-19 cases between March 25m and June 1=， 2020.

Modeling studies in the UK suggested that the test-trace-isolate program could reduce the chances of the second wave in the UK， as there is a chance to reopen the school from September. The absence of sufficiently broad test-trace-isolate coverage and reopening of schools can result in reproductive number over 1 and would peak up cases in December 2020， which will be 2 times to 3times the size of the original COVID-19wave 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. This has happened in reality and the UK again started lockdown and strict restrictions.**\n\n【17】**Last year one study revealed that India could face a deadly second wave and in present-day India is facing this enormous life-taking wave. Currently， India is facing another wave， or better to say the second wave， and much more in world discussion. In this work， how Indian is dealing with the second wave of COVID-19 and vaccination and other associated issues are discussed.**\n\n【18】**First Wave in India**\n\n【19】**India is the 2nd most populated country in the world after China， and a center of attraction because of its diverse variation. India has 28 states and 8 Union Territories. Its population is more than 1.35 billion， of which 2.75 million are below the poverty line. A significant variation is present in India where the smallest state Sikkim has a population closer to Bhutan and the largest one Uttar Pradesh has a population similar to Brazil. Goa which has the highest**\n\n【20】**GDP per capita can be comparable to Jordan while the poorest state Bihar is similar to that of Haiti 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. Thus， state-wide variation is not surprising. The health care system in India is also a mixture of public and private health care systems， available in rural and urban locations. The government unfortunately spends only 1.17% of its GDP on health care 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. The overall capacity of private health care is4 times that of the public sector.**\n\n【21】**January 30h， 2020， was the day when the first case of COVID-19was detected in the southern state of India. Within few weeks， COVID-19 spread throughout the country and reached the count of100 by March and close of 1，600 by end of March. Consequently， the first death from this disease also happened in March. To tackle the spread Indian PM announced a nationwide lockdown without any heads up to the citizen. Initially， the lockdown was until April 14h，2020， which later was extended to May 03， 2020，and then June 012020 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>. To understand how the lockdown worked in India， the stringency index was performed which showed that at the starting of lockdown the stringency index was 100 whereas， in other countries which also faced serious lockdown， the in dex was not satisfactory and appeared low. On April 12h， 2020， Italy scored a stringency index of93.5， while Belgium and Peru counted 81.48 on March 22n， 2020，and96.30 on May 015，2020. However， India's score fell to near 82 in May2020， which evidently indicates that lockdown which was followed**\n\n【22】**according to the governmental rules at the beginning， did not at the end.**\n\n【23】**As shown in Figure 1， it is apparent that this lockdown did not help India to stop the spread and India experienced its peak in September 2020. Back in September 2020， India faced 90，000 cases every day including 1，200 deaths. Lockdown had limited success and it drastically impacted the Indian GDP， which fell 23.9% than that of the same quarter in 2019. Sharp unemployment was prominent because of the lack of jobs. Industrial Production (IIP) fell by 36%during the 3 months between April and June of 2020 compared to the previous year 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. Indian government behavior towards migrant workers was negligent which the world experienced last year. Unnecessary death， due to the impact of COVID-19 lockdown which was not directly related to the COVID-19 occurred， was nearly600 by late May 2020 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. The death of 23 individuals from March12h to April 11h， 2020， was recorded due to suicide. Fear of isolation or domestic violence was the reason behind these tragic incidents通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>. This noticeably indicates that not only economic issues， social health， and mental issues were also key aspects due to the prolonged lockdown period.**\n\n【24】**The air quality of India is always in bad shape which got an immensely positive impact due to last year’s COVID-19 lockdown. In India， mainly major urban places and cities have poor air quality. Because of the lockdown transport， industries were closed which limited the emission ofharmful gases. Compared with the immediate Pre-Lockdown period (PL3)， the average PM2.5 and PM10 reduced by up to 51% and 47% respectively during the lockdown periods 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24-26\\]</u>.**\n\n【25】**Second Wave in India**\n\n【26】**In mid-September， India had a peak of 93，000 cases per day， which started declining， and the Indian government， policymakers， media； politicians thought In dia is free from COVID-19. Restrictions were less and elections campaigns for five states were announced for186 million people to cast their vote. In January 2021 Indian started its vaccine diplomacy by shipping vaccines to foreign countries. Interestingly last year， a research study from MIT suggested that without proper treatment or vaccination， India can surge up to0.287 million cases by early 2021. India reported more than 100，000new cases on April 04h， 2021，and a new record for the country was observed， a level not seen in its first wave. On April 15h， 2021， new COVID-19 infected cases were 0.2 million in India. On May 4h， COVID-19 cases were more than 20.2 million. The western state of Maharashtra， which has been India’s COVID ground zero from the start of the pandemic， is back at the top after briefly reporting a drop in cases. This state， among India， the richest and home to its financial hub， Mumbai， confirmed more than 66，000 cases last night. It is widely agreed among experts that both cases and deaths are being under-reported in India right now. The Lancet COVID-19commission warned that India could experience recording more than2，300 deaths every day by the first week of June.**\n\n【27】**To understand the COVID-19 cases two factors can be considered： (a) Test Positivity Rate (TPR=total infection/total cases)；(b) Case Fatality Rate (CFR= total deaths/total infections). The Test positivity rate shows whether testing is enough to limit the virus spread by employing quarantine and isolation. According to WHO， TPR below 5% is good which indicates the health care program is working sufficiently. India had over 5% TPR during the first wave and started declining from August 2020. On April 14， 2021，TPR was**\n\n【28】**Table 1： State-wise TPR and CFR in India on April 15m， 2021\\[271.**\n\n| **State**  | **CFR**  | **TPR**  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Maharashtra**  | **1.6**  | **15.7**  |\n| **Nagaland**  | **0.7**  | **8.9**  |\n| **Kerala**  | **0.4**  | **8.5**  |\n| **Chhattisgarh**  | **1.1**  | **7.6**  |\n| **West Bengal**  | **1.7**  | **6.5**  |\n| **Andhra Pradesh**  | **0.8**  | **6**  |\n| **Madhya Pradesh**  | **1.2**  | **5.3**  |\n| **Tripura**  | **1.2**  | **5.1**  |\n| **Rajasthan**  | **0.8**  | **5.1**  |\n\n【30】**5.4%. State-wise TPR also varied. Maharashtra had a very high TPR of15.7% indicating very high transmission. State-wise transmission on April 15h， 2021 is listed in Table 1. As of 11th May India has tested more than 305 M samples. Tests include both， RT-PCR and Rapid Antigen. India’s current test positivity rate (7DMA) is 22%.

Emergency Use Listing (EULs) for COVID-19 vaccine was issued by WHO. On December 31， 2020 Pfizer， on February 15h， 2021， two versions of the AstraZeneca/Oxford， (manufactured by the Serum Institute of India and SKBio)， and on March 12h， 2021， Ad26.COV2.S， (Johnson& Johnson) were EUL listed by WHO. According to WHO， the vaccine should be taken if possible and even if you experienced COVID-19.However， it is too early to predict how these vaccines will work and protect and research is continued. It is still advised to take a vaccine because it will develop immunity inside the human body and will probably reduce the risk of illness development. In general vaccine development goes several stages which include pre-clinical(vaccine development in the lab)， Phase 1 Clinical trial (8 participants to 10 participants； for vaccine testing safety)； Phase 2 clinical trial (50participants to 100 participants； for testing vaccine immunogenicity i.e. production of antibodies against virus)； Phase 3 clinical trial (30k participants to 50k participants； for testing actual protection offered by the vaccine) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[28\\]</u>. However， this COVID-19's dreadful impact forced to development of a vaccine within a vear compared to other previous diseases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[29\\]</u>. For example， the development of the polio vaccine took 40 years， 5 years for Ebola， and an average of 15 years for most of the vaccine development 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[30\\]</u>. To understand how vaccines are working properly， efficacy is useful term. Efficacy is a degree of relative lessening in threat. To understand it in bete way； if someone has cloned of him/herself which having one version fully vaccinated and other version is not then the vaccinated one will have 95% less risk to get risk. In reality cloning of human being is not possible hence in the lab randomization is employed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[31\\]</u>. According to WHO， vaccine will only is allowed in the market if it has at least 50% efficacy and higher is better 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[32\\]</u>. Table 3 lists the vaccines and their efficacy.**\n\n【39】**India targeted to vaccinate 300 million people by August 2021， and by February 8h， 2021， India was able to vaccinate 6 million beneficiaries countrywide 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[40\\]</u>. In India， two different vaccines are available which include Covishield and Covaxin. Covishield vaccine is the same patent technology developed by the AstraZeneca vaccine and manufactured by the Serum Institute of India. According to the Indian Government website， the choice of vaccine is not an option of public， though it will be made available in various parts of India. The first group includes healthcare and frontline workers. The second group to receive the COVID-19 vaccine will be persons over 60 years**\n\n【40】**of age and persons between 45 and 59 years of age with comorbid conditions. Vaccines are mostly liquid products. As of May 5h， 2021total vaccination has been done for 16，04，94，188 people.**\n\n【41】**At the beginning of the vaccination program， vaccines were free from government medical healthcare while private hospitals charged250 rupees ($3) which were changed later. Serum institute decided to sell shots at 150 rupees to central， 300 rupees ($4) to state， and the private hospital for 600 rupees ($8). Bharat Biotech decided to charge 150 rupees to central， 400 rupees ($5.50) and private hospital for 1200 rupees ($16) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[42\\]</u>. European Union paid $2.15 per dose for the AstraZeneca vaccine. According to them， the price reduction is because of the EU's contribution to vaccine development. This high price for Covaxin is shocking as it is made by an Indian company.On the other hand， Covaxin didn't publish yet its phase 3 clinical trial data in a peer-reviewed scientific journal， and has only announced its interim efficacy data-claimed to be around 80% through a press release. Now Sputnik V vaccines got a green signal to be used and at the first phase， 125 million doses will be distributed. Details of the present two vaccines are listed in Table 4 and Table 5， which show the other vaccines that are under process.**\n\n【42】**However， there is still doubt that the vaccination plan will not work properly as the COVID-19 virus is mutating and new variants as listed in Table 6. WHO has been tracking mutations and variants since the start of the COVID-19 outbreak. Currently， there is no agreed international naming system for variants. In India， the active variants are B.1.617 and B.1.1.7.3.2.**\n\n【43】**Current issues in India**\n\n【44】**COVID-19patients with severe conditions suffer from respiratory distress 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[44\\]</u>.

However， the director of Inox Air Products， which supplies 50% of the oxygen demands in the country， claims that India has sufficient oxygen to deal with the present condition.

In India， the health care sector consumes 15% of total produced oxygen while the rest are consumed by industry.

Right now in India， three key bottlenecks for the vaccination process are the unavailability of the vaccine， efficacy of the vaccine， and penetration (registration).

When there was a plan to school student’s returning to school， this second wave created and made the plan delayed again. Indian government made announcements regarding promotion of student to the next classes without any examination，based on their assessments， class tests and projects. Additionally， various states cancelled their state board examinations during serious pandemic situation， directly and severely affecting the education system and standards 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[52\\]</u>. It's unclear when situation will be clear again. Because of the closure of education sector， approximately 320 million students have been affected. It can be argued why India didn’t move towards digital education. For 2017-18 years， National Sample Survey office reported that only 23.8% Indians have internet access with 42% in urban and14.9% in rural. According to economic times， during lockdown one in four students in India can’t use the online study because they don’t have laptop or desktop. Thus， in quality and inconsistency of education in digital medium is evident. Even developed country like USA faced challenges to offer equal online education because of the presence of black，Hispanic and low income family student. On other hand， it is also evident that the way students learn in school (offline education)， it is not possible to achieve through online because online education can't replace the interpersonal interactions， essential social skills for holistic growth and development.**\n\n【60】**Discussion**\n\n【61】**Totackle this COVID-19 situation， no medication is available now and no one knows fully how to deal with this. Isolation probably one of the best ways to limit at least the spreading of this virus. Lockdown probably the best way to limit transmission 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[53\\]</u>. According to WHO， to lift the lockdown， proper health system capacities for testing， trace every contact and isolate and treat every case； maintain social distancing at schools and other essential places， workplaces； minimizing importation of new cases from countries or areas that have not yet contained the outbreak； community willingness to continue social distancing wherever possible and community engagement in all measures are required. It is evident that the lockdown for the first wave in India did not stop the spread of COVID-19 and the economy suffered a lot. However， now the COVID-19 Task Force (set up by the government) and the Supreme Court asked the Indian government to impose again nationwide lockdown to break the transmission. Probably from last year’s experience， the Government is trying to use all efforts and keep the lockdown for the last option. However， according to the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy， this localized lockdown already created a job loss which is around 70 lakhs in various states across the country. Though it is not announced，but， from May 2021， 98% of Indians are under some kind of restriction to break the COVID-19 second wave transmission.**\n\n【62】**India is dealing with a huge vaccination program for COVID-19and many people even in rural areas were able to have those doses free of cost. However， it has to be remembered that temperature control is essential for the safety and efficacy of the vaccine. Even unwillingly or due to lack of infrastructure， if vaccines are kept at different temperatures， they will be deadly \\[54，55\\]. The first wave of COVID-19 affected hugely in urban areas and also for the second wave it is evident that hotspots (and the emerging hotspots) are everywhere in urban areas \\[56，57\\]. To have the better result from vaccination it could be the strategy to vaccinate urban areas first and then rural areas or areas where population density is less. However， now there is no scope as COVID-19 second wave also covered the smalltowns and rural areas in India.**\n\n【63】**It is heartbreaking to see that when India facing this tragic pandemic and suffering from the second wave； pharmaceutical companies are charging a price for vaccines. Indian government failed to stockpile vaccine at an early stage while other countries such as the USA， UK， and Israel started this measure in back September2020. India first purchased 15 million doses and later administered over 140 million doses. However， it is not officially revealed how it will be fulfilled. On February 15， India's finance minister announced Rs 35，000 crores ($4.69 billion) for COVID-19 vaccines. Without a free vaccine， India may move towards another economic downtown if lockdown possess again. Increase COVID-19 cases can create a situation again which requires the forced shutdown， closure of industry which will derail the economy again. Economist believes that Indian government could support the free vaccination scheme， which could only take 0.3% of GDP. By simple calculation， it can be shown that 966 million people should be vaccinated twice which indicates the requirement of 1.93 billion doses. If dose cost Rs 150total cost will be Rs 28，980 crores ( close to 0.14%GDP) and if the cost is Rs 400； total cost will be Rs 77，280 crores (close to 0.38%GDP)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[58\\]</u>.**\n\n【64】**It is evident that India's claim ofbeating the epidemic and younger population are free from this disease， immunity has been developed， and overall victory on the COVID-19 is fully hogwash. Currently， administrative arrogance， lack of doses， hyper-nationalism， and population created a grave burning issue 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[59\\]</u>. Probably it can be said that the people of Indian are also equally liable for the occurrence of the second wave. Early letting down the protection (use of mask； sanitization； maintaining social distancing)； started attending weddings and socializing，religious gathering， and no strict restriction norms from government； all added the fuel in this situation. It seems like Indians were in a parallel universe while the rest of the world was experiencing a second wave. As the infection rate waslow， people were not in the mood to take the vaccine. India could slow down the rate by imposing strict vaccination rules， maintaining social distancing， and follow strict COVID-19 restriction measures set by WHO. The government had one-year time to increase the health sector capacity and a complete failure is visible now. People are paying thousands and lakhs of money in the health sector if they are lucky enough to be admitted to hospital. According to the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation， by August 1， India can experience a staggering1 million deaths from COVID-19 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[60\\]</u>. To avail herd immunity， India should implement safe， effective， and robust vaccination 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[61\\]</u>. Currently population of India is 135 crore. 94.5 crore people must be vaccinated to obtain herd immunity which is only possible if 189crore vaccine doses are available. With India's current vaccination rate，herd immunity is feasible only in 3.5 years.**\n\n【65】**Conclusion**\n\n【66】**The second wave of COVID-19 infection was under the radar from last year still it could not be stopped. India is facing the second wave of COVID-19 infection. In this work， how India dealt with COVID-19 first wave and now suffering from the second wave is documented. National lockdown is still not imposed. Last year lockdown could not limit the COVID-19 transmission but due to the closure of industry India faced serious economic down. Pure medical Oxygen is essential for COVID-19 patients but lack of oxygen created the scenario more complex. Vaccination programs started but the price of vaccination is a serious issue. It will take several weeks to vaccinate a large population. Free vaccination could help the Indian economy as a new national lockdown can create another economic dip. Education sector is now another large sector which suffered significantly. It is still unsure how India will manage to tackle this second wave.**\n\n【67】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【68】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**1\\. Lu R， Zhao X， Li J， Niu P， Yang B， Wu H， et al.

The clinical manifestations include chronic headache， cranial nerves affected and epilepsy， a few patients present with bilateral or unilateral moderate visual loss. We describe the case of a patient who presented with bilateral visual loss without any other positive manifestations； the patient was initially diagnosed with Ischemic Optic Neuropathy (ION)， but further investigation revealed IHCP. This study was approved by the ethics committee of the 6h Medical Centre of Chinese People's Liberation Army General Hospital.

Twenty days after treatment， the BCVA of the patient was significantly restored： that of the right eye reached 20/20， and that of the left eye was 20/200. Unfortunately， visual field examination showed that the visual light sensitivity in the right eye had decreased， and examination of the left eye showed that one-quarter of the visual field was completely loss.**\n\n【27】**Discussion**\n\n【28】**Hypertrophic Pachymeningitis (HP) is a chronic inflammatory disorder characterized by fibrous thickening of the cerebral and/or spinal dural mater 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. HP is divided into two types， Idiopathic Hypertrophic Pachymeningitis (IHP)， for which no identifiable cause has been found， and secondary HP， for which is described inassociation with trauma，infections， tumors， autoimmune/inflaarmrmatory disease and cerebrospinal fluidhypotension syndrome. IHCP， the most common features of which is chronic intermittent headache， can also be expressed as cephalagra， local or whole brain blunt pain， or progressive palsy of cranial nerves 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. One important reason for the ease of cranial nerve damage is the narrowing of the skull gap， in which cranial nerves pass， due to endocranial hypertrophy. The thickened dura might invade the oculomotor nerve， abductor nerve， trochlear nerve， trigeminal nerve and optic nerve 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Severe injury of the optic nerve alone occurs infrequently but can lead to painless rapid bilateral visual loss. Mathew et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>， reported one case of IHCP presenting as acute**\n\n【29】**left-sided painless visual loss， and the patient complained of persistent left-sided headache and numbness on her forehead in the past few years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Our case presented as rapid bilateral visual loss as the initial clinical manifestation， and we have not found similar previous reports.**\n\n【30】**The diagnosis of IHCP can be made by combining clinical manifestations， imaging examination results， laboratory test results and pathological features. The pathological characteristics are diffuse fibrous hypertrophy of the dura matter and lymphocytes as well as plasma cell infiltration； IHCP can also present with glass-like changes or caseous necrosis. It can also be observed on MRI and defined pathologically on biopsy； the performance of MRI was correlated with the clinical state in 80% of cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Imaging demonstrated the diffuse thickening of the dura； the lesions appeared hypointense or isointense on T1-weighted sequences and hypointense 厂T2-weighted sequences. The scope of the dura was larger on gadopentetate-enhanced T1-weighted sequences than on plain scans通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. According to others， laboratory findings might show increased ESR or CRP levels in patients， and some patients show positive results for auto antibodies including ANA，P-ANCA，ACA and RF \\[7，8\\].**\n\n【31】**Conclusion**\n\n【32】**Intracranial neuropathy might occur rapidly and progressively， and the damage is difficult to recover. A clear and correct diagnosis as soon as possible and timely treatment are critical. In this report， the visual acuity of the left eye in the patient was lost three days earlier than that of the right eye； as a result of treatment， the BCVA in the left eye was lower than that in the right eye. The results of this study demonstrate that we should pay attention to intracranial changes as soon as possible in patients with a sharp decline in visual acuity but with no obviously positive signs in the eyeball.**\n\n【33】**Funding**\n\n【34】**This was supported by the Innovation Cultivating Foundation of 64h Medical Centre of People's Liberation Army General Hospital (no.

Vedolizumab， a gut-selective monoclonal antibody to the a437 of integrin， has been used in such patients， but data on its efficacy are limited. Our case suggests the efficacy and safety of vedolizumab as induction therapy in CARP patient without a previous experience with anti-TNF agents. Larger studies with a higher number of patients are required to confirm these findings.**\n\n【12】**Keywords： Vedolizumab； Chronic antibiotic-refractory puchitits； Ulcerative Colitis**\n\n【13】**Introduction**\n\n【14】**Ulcerative Colitis (UC) is a chronic disease ofthe colon and rectum. Primarytreatment is medical therapy. Restorative total proctocolectomy with Ileal Pouch-Anal Anastomosis (IPAA) is one of the surgical modalities used to manage patients with refractory UC or develop severe complications such as colonic perforation， hemorrhage， or toxic megacolon. The ileal pouch serves as an internal reservoir of feces in the absence of rectum. Many patients develop long-term complication so called pouchitis with an estimated incidence ranging from 46% to 82%， which includes a range of symptom severity such as abdominal cramping， pelvic pressure， and increased stool frequency with urgency， to more debilitating symptoms including abdominal pain， rectal bleeding， disorder defecation and incontinence 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Pouchitis is a nonspecific inflammation in the Ileoanal Pouch Anastomosis (IPAA). The pathophysiology of pouchitis remains poorlyunderstood. Gut microbiota have an important role in fact increased bacterial levels and ileal reservoir dysbiosis appear to be major contributors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Pouchitis may be difficult to treat as well as have a negative impact on the quality of life in these patients. Since dysbiosis is a key factor for pouchitis development， there is evidence for a therapeutic role of probiotics 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u> (i.e.， VSL#3 was able to prevent a relapse during a follow-up period of 9 months)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u> and antibiotics. Antibiotics therapy's， particularly ciprofloxacin and metronidazole， are the mainstay of treatment for acute pouchitis after having excluded other diagnoses (infections， Crohn’s disease of the pouch， ischemia and irritable pouch) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. However， about 10% to 15% of patients with acute pouchitis do not respond to these treatments and develop chronic pouchitis， which is defined by symptoms persisting for more than 4 weeks. These patients often require prolonged courses of antibiotics combinates with steroid therapy (budesonide) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>， immunomodulators (azathioprine) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>， and mesalamines with varying efficacy. CARP is diagnosis when patients do not respond to a 2-week course of ciprofloxacin， metronidazole， or rifaximin for pouchitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. CARP is one of the most common causes of pouch failure.**\n\n【15】**Patient information**\n\n【16】**In our patient， a 52-year-old Caucasian male， restorative proctocolectomy had become necessary 28 years ago in severe refractory ulcerative colitis. Ileoanal Pouch Anastomosis (IPAA) was performed in 1999. Pouchitis was first diagnosed in 2020.**\n\n【17】**Timeline**\n\n【18】**In August 2021， he developed a chronic diarrhea with up to 30 to 40 liquid (including 6 nightly) stools， accompanied with blood and mucus， associated with diffuse abdominal pain and bloating affecting his quality of life.**\n\n【19】**Diagnostic assessment**\n\n【20】**Laboratory work-up revealed Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR)， C-Reactive Protein(CRP) and stool calprotectin with no abnormalities. He denied sudden weight gain or weight loss. Endoscopy showed inflammation， ulcerations， edema and mucous exudates in the pouch and in the**\n\n【21】**afferent ileal limb. In particular，linear ulcerations were present in the pouch， circular ulcerations in the ileal mucosa. Histology confirmed the active phase of ileal ulcerative chronic inflammation combined with signs of regeneration (fibrosis).**\n\n【22】**Therapeutic intervention**\n\n【23】**He started probiotic therapy， with VSL#3， but without successful clinical effects. Then he was prescribed metronidazole，from 250 mgto500 mg orally two times daily. After many therapeutic interventions with metronidazole， the patient was unable to tolerate it. He was prescribed ciprofloxacin 500 mg orally two times daily， but without successful clinical effects. In the end he was prescribed ECN Nissle capsule and dipropionate Beclomethasone， from 5 mg to 10 mg orally one time daily， which developed corticosteroid resistant.**\n\n【24】**Therefore， this severe flare of pouchitis was refractory to metronidazole， Ciprofloxacin，VSL#3， ECN NissleeCapsule， dipropionate beclomethasone and mesalamine. Stool studies for clostridium difficile， viruses， and bacteria were negative. Endoscopy and Histology showed no improvement. For this reason， the patient was switched to anti-integrin therapy and showed sustained clinical and endoscopic response to Vedolizumab 300 mg i.v. at weeks 0， 2， 6， and every 8 weeks.**\n\n【25】**Follow up and outcomes**\n\n【26】**After four doses， pouch and ileal ulcerations had healed completely and edema and mucous exudates were no longer present. C-Reactive Protein and stool calprotectin were also negative. Clinically， the patient is now in good condition，reports about 15 daily stools without any abdominal discomfort.**\n\n【27】**Discussion**\n\n【28】**Biological therapy such as anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)(infliximab， adalimumab) agents \\[9，10\\]，vedolizumab or ustekinumab are some ofthe options used to treat chronic pouchitis. Vedolizumab is a monoclonal antibody that selectively blocks gut lymphocyte trafficking by interacting with a4B7 heterodimer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. The key to understanding the potential efficacy of vedolizumab is based on the fact that dysbiosis contributes to the attraction of leukocytes that will undergo adhesion by the integrin-MAdCAM interaction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. However， the effect of vedolizumab treatment on Chronic Antibiotic Refractory Pouchitis (CARP) is very limited. The largest study was a retrospective multicenter cohort study at five academic centers in the United States including 83 IPAA patients with endoscopically confirmed inflammation of the pouch. Some 87% of patients were previously treated with antibiotics for pouchitis， and 51% previously were treated with anti-TNFs for pouchitis. After at least 3 months follow-up， 71% of patients exhibited a clinical response， and 19.3%achieved clinical remission； 54% had endoscopic improvement while 17.6% achieved endoscopic healing. Patients who developed pouchitis symptoms within 1 year postoperatively were found to be less likely to respond to VDZ 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. In a recent review Ribaldone DG reported that vedolizumab has significant efficacy in chronic refractory or antibiotic-dependent pouchitis， also in patients who failed to respond to other treatments including those with anti-TNF agents 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. In literature， only twenty-one patients had a biological treatment with vedolizumab for CARP without a previous experience with anti-TNF agents 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14-17\\]</u>. Our case is important because it evaluates the efficacy of vedolizumab as a first-choice biological treatment in CARP and represents the first case report which evaluates a histological improvement thanks to the effectiveness of**\n\n【29】**vedolizumab in the treatment of chronic refractory pouchitis. In our single patient refractory to multiple therapies， we found good clinical and endoscopic response encouraging further investigations on clinical response， mucosal healing and histological improvement. In a recent meta-analysis Saurabh Chandan demonstrated that clinical improvement in symptoms was reported by 48.7% patients treated with VDZ， clinical remission was achieved by 45.4% patients treated with VDA and finally， endoscopic improvement and remission was seen in 61.2% patients treated with VDZ. Biologic therapy is safe and effective short-term as well as long-term in the treatment of CARP\\[19，20\\].**\n\n【30】**Conclusion**\n\n【31】**Vedolizumab showed consistent treatment benefits across clinical， endoscopic and histological endpoint， together with safety consistent. Vedolizumab intravenous is effective in chronic refractory or antibiotic-dependent pouchitis so that can be value its use like first line in the biological therapy can be evaluated as confirmed by a recent study where demonstrates that T cell movementing mechanisms are important and vedolizumab antagonism in pouchitis has functional effects. A phase- 4 study aiming to evaluate the efficacy and safety of vedolizumab in the treatment of chronic pouchitis (EARNEST) has just been completed confirms these findings.**\n\n【32】**Author Contributions**\n\n【33】**All authors contributed to the study conception and design.

Late second trimester and early third trimester is the most common period of hepatic decompensation when most of the complications are seen. We hereby describe an unusual case where the diagnosis of cirrhosis was unknown till the time of delivery due to its asymptomatic nature. However， the diagnosis was finally made with high index of suspicion and was further optimally managed to achieve a successful pregnancy outcome. The aspects of optimal management have been discussed.**\n\n【11】**Keywords： Cirrhosis； Portal Hypertension； Pregnancy**\n\n【12】**Introduction**\n\n【13】**Pregnancy associated with cirrhosis is a rare occurrence. Nevertheless， pregnancy in a patient with cirrhosis and portal hypertension is a unique problem which needs specialized care. Pregnant patient with cirrhosis and portal hypertension is at risk of significantly increased foetal loss， oesophageal variceal bleeding， splenic artery aneurysm rupture， hepato-renal syndrome and hepatic decompensation \\[1，2\\]. The complications and hepatic decompensation most commonly occur in the early third trimester (28 to 32 weeks of gestation). The present report describes a rare case with asymptomatic cirrhosis going undetected during pregnancy only to present with hepatic decompensation at the time of delivery and post-partum period.**\n\n【14】**Case Presentation**\n\n【15】**A 5h gravida multiparous 32 year old lady presented to emergency at 36 weeks and 5 days with complains of labour pains. She had been non-compliant with her antenatal visits with only two visits， one at 16h and another at 24th week of gestation. This was a precious pregnancy as she had two intrapartum still births associated with difficult delivery in the past. The patient had only 1 live issue who was 6 year old and was born of a caesarean section at term， done for meconium stained liquor in early labour. There was no history of any chronic medical or surgical illness.**\n\n【16】**On examination vitals were stable， with mild pallor and no icterus. Per abdomen uterus was term size with mild contractions and normal foetal heart rate. On per vaginal digital examination， cervix was 2 fingers loose and 30% to 40% effaced with intact membranes. The pelvis seemed to be inadequate for the baby. An emergency caesarean section was contemplated in view of anticipation of a difficult delivery. After shifting the patient to the operation theatre， spinal anaesthesia was given. Per operatively large dilated vessels (5 mm to 7 mm in diameter) were encountered subcutaneously and in the preperitoneal space. Some of them had to be secured with suture ties after being accidentally incised during surgery. A live male baby of 2.3 kg was delivered. Mild atonic post-partum haemorrhage occurred which could be controlled by uterine massage and uterotonics. Despite the best efforts， there was a blood loss of approximately 1.3 liters. An abdominal drain was inserted to prevent intra-abdominal collection. As the pre-operative haemoglobin was 7.7 gm %with a platelet count of 99，000/dL and an INR of 1.88， 1 unit of packed red blood cells and 4 units of fresh frozen plasma were transfused.**\n\n【17】**In the immediate post-operative period patient was comfortable， afebrile， maintained stable vitals and adequate urine output. However， the abdominal drain continued to produce an output**\n\n【18】**of serosanguineous fluid at approximately 50 to 100 cc/hr. The blood investigations were remarkable in terms of deranged complete blood count (haemoglobin 8.8 gm %， platelet count 81，000/dL， and total leukocyte count 15，100/dL) and deranged liver function tests(total bilirubin 1.8 mg/dL， direct bilirubin 0.9 mg/dL， aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase-327/125IU/L，total protein-4.4 gm % and serum albumin-2.3 gm %). On day 2，peritoneal drain could not be removed in view of persistent high output of 1500ml to 1700 ml per day. Adequate amount of fluids were given keeping in mind the drain output， urine output and in sensible losses and peritoneal fluid became clear gradually. Ascitic fluid investigations revealed a white cell count of 1000/dL with 90% polymorphs， sugar-106 mg % and aprotein level of 0.7 gm %， suggestive of infected transudative fluid. Ultrasound examination of the abdomen revealed lobulated 17.7 cm liver with coarsened echotexture， splenomegaly(17.9 cm)， dilated portal vein (1.2 cm) and splenorenal collaterals， suggestive of cirrhosis with portal hypertension. However， there was no history of hematemesis， melena， recent jaundice or blood transfusion. And there were no stigmata of chronic liver disease that were evident.**\n\n【19】**Further investigations revealed negative tests for hepatitis B antigen， anti-hepatitis C antibody and autoimmune hepatitis antibody panel. Serum ceruloplasmin was done and Wilson’s disease was ruled out. Iron profile was done and the patient was found to be iron deficient， for which iron replacement was initiated. The blood and the ascitic fluid cultures failed to show any microbiological growth， however the patient was already on antibiotics when the samples were collected. A liver biopsy was planned as per the gastroenterologist's opinion to ascertain aetiology of cirrhosis， but was not done as the patient declined consent. Final diagnosis of liver cirrhosis with portal hypertension and secondary bacterial peritonitis was made. Treatment was started with beta-blocker (propranolol)， spironolactone， furosemide， intravenous albumin， stool softener and higher antibiotics in consultation with the gastroenterologist. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was also done and revealed grade 2oesophageal varices for which endoscopic variceal ligation was done. The peritoneal drain output reduced gradually allowing its removal on day 12. Stitches were removed on post operative day 20 and was discharged next day.**\n\n【20】**Discussion**\n\n【21】**Pregnancy with portal hypertension secondary to cirrhosis is a scenario which is rarely encountered but commonly associated with serious complications leading to significant morbidity and poor prognosis. Cirrhosis is uncommon in reproductive age group with a reported incidence of less than 45 cases per 100，000 women通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Moreover， metabolic and hormonal derangements associated with cirrhosis lead to anovulation and hence infertility. In more recent times improvements in the treatment of chronic liver disease resulted in higher conception rates， making pregnancy with cirrhosis more common， however the exact incidence remains unknown. The diagnosis of cirrhosis usually surfaces in early pregnancy with routine evaluation or is known beforehand. Thus there is certain level of preparedness for screening and management of complications in the third trimester and peripartum period. Despite all measures， the pregnancy outcomes in cirrhosis remain dismal. The present case is unique in terms that a diagnosis of cirrhosis could be made only at the time of delivery. Even then， with appropriate timely recognition and management， a successful outcome was achieved.**\n\n【22】**Approximately up to 50% ofthe pregnancies in cirrhotic patients are expected to face complications， the most common being variceal haemorrhage and liver failure \\[4，5\\]. Refractory ascites， hepatic encephalopathy， hepatorenalsyndrome。spontaneousbacterial peritonitis， post-partum haemorrhage and adverse fetal outcome are other complications which maybeencountered通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. The riskofvariceal haemorrhage is 400 times during pregnancy and remains one of the deadliest complications. Up to 80% patients with detectable varices are expected to bleed during the gestational period. The most common occurrence is during the late second and early third trimester， which is the period of maximum vasodilation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Although uncommon， splenic artery aneurysms also rupture and bleed around the same time period. The importance of splenic artery aneurysms lie in the requirement of a high index of suspicion to reach a diagnosis and its association with high rates of materno-fetal mortality. Secondary to increased intra-abdominal pressure during pregnancy， extravasation of fluid from splanchnic vessels is hindered， making ascites relatively uncommon as a complication during pregnancy. The rates of fetal wastage are alarming in cirrhosis with estimates reported in the range of 10% to 66%. Even with live births， the risk of prematurity is significantly high. A case series reported a prematurity incidence of 25% amongst live births in pregnancies in cirrhotic patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. It is important to recognize that the occurrence of complications in cirrhosis is often interlinked with one complication triggering the other. Variceal haemorrhage may precipitate hypotension， acute liver failure and thus hepatic encephalopathy. It also increases the risk of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis which in turn increases the risk of hepatorenal syndrome significantly. Thus prevention of complications in the first place remains an important goal.**\n\n【23】**Management of _f_ pregnancy in cirrhosisentailscareful assessment of liver function， esophageal varices and screening of other complications followed by an individualistic approach for each case. The importance of maintaining hydration and avoiding hypotension cannot be overemphasized. Hypotension can precipitate hepatorenal syndrome and is a risk factor of hepatic decompensation and encephalopathy. The risk of hypoglycaemia is real and needs to be addressed on a regular basis with generous supplementation of simple sugars and fruit juices. Renal function should be monitored on a regular basis to pick up any dysfunction early. Regarding management of labour， choice of mode of delivery should be made as per obstetric indications. Underlying coagulopathy in cirrhosis often needs correction to prevent post-partum haemorrhage which is common and has been reported in 7% to 26% of the cases. Risk further increases with a caesarean section and blood products should be readily available during labour of such a patient. Regional anaesthesia should be preferred over general anaesthesia if required during operative delivery. And sedatives should be used minimally as they may precipitate hepatic encephalopathy.**\n\n【24】**In the present case， dilated pre-peritoneal veins and significant ascites amounting to continuous post-operative abdominal drain output were important markers towards portal hypertension. Since the patient had tolerated the course of gestation well without any symptoms，achronic significant systemic illness was hardly suspected. However， to our surprise， an unexpected diagnosis of cirrhosis uncovered on further evaluation. The patient was successfully managed with beta blockers (propranolol 20 mg thrice daily)， spironolactone (50 mg twice daily)， antibiotics for secondary bacterial peritonitis and ligation of esophageal varices which were picked up before they bled on screening upper gastrointestinal tract endoscopy.**\n\n【25】**It was difficult to maintain fluid balance because of large drain output， but formed an important part of the management. Fortunately in this case， the outcome was good for both the baby and the mother.**\n\n【26】**To conclude， the possibility of portal hypertension and liver cirrhosis should be borne in mind when significant ascites and dilated pre-peritoneal vessels are noted on caesarean section， irrespective of the course of pregnancy. Further evaluation and management by a multidisciplinary effort from the obstetrician， gastroenterologist and neonatologist holds the key to a successful pregnancy outcome.**\n\n【27】**1\\.

However， TMP/SMZ has been reported to cause hemolysis when administered to patients with deficiency. PJP might be fatal without receiving treatment. Therefore， there is a dilemma on the use of TMP/SMZ in G6PD deficient patients. Herein， we report a G6PD deficient patient with PJP treated successfully with 21 days of TMP/SMZ without any signs and symptoms of hemolysis.**\n\n【17】**Conclusion： It might be safe for the Southeast Asia population with a history of G6PD deficiency to administer TMP/SMZ under expert surveillance.**\n\n【18】**Keywords： Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency； HIV； Pneumocystis pneumonia； Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole**\n\n【19】**Abbreviations**\n\n【20】**ALT： Alanine Amino Transferase； AST： Aspartate Transaminase； BUN： Blood Urea Nitrogen； CXR： Chest X-Ray； Cr： Creatinine； G6PD： Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase； GGO： Ground-Glass Opacities； Hb： Hemoglobin； HRCT： High-Resolution Computed Tomography； IDSA：Infectious Diseases Society of America； OPD： Out-Patient Department； PJP： Pneumocystis Jirovecii Pneumonia； PCP： Pneumocystis Pneumonia TMP/SMZ： Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole； RBC：Red Blood Cell； WBC： White Blood Cell； WHO： World Health Organization**\n\n【21】**Introduction**\n\n【22】**Pneumocystis Pneumonia (PCP) is an opportunistic and fatal infection caused by the fungus Pneumocystis jirovecii. As per guideline， Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMZ) is the recommended regimen for managing Pneumocystis Jirovecii Pneumonia (PJP)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. However，TMP/SMZ is associated with the serious side effect of drug induced hemolytic anemia associated with Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. Although substitute regiment does exist， the success rate of using those alternative regimens is below 80% except for the combination use of TMP and dapsone， which is also a medication contraindicated in patients with G6PD deficiency. Jennifer et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u> therefore suggested avoiding using TMP/SMZ in patient with the deficiency of G6PD. On the other hand， a literature reviews done by Youngster et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u> Suggested that TMP/SMZ is probably safe when given in usual therapeutic dose. Together with the inconclusive recommendations， there was also no real-world experience on the use of TMP/SMZ in G6PD deficiency patients in Taiwan. In this article， we reported a G6PD deficient patient whom recovered from PJP by administration of TMP/SMZ.**\n\n【23】**Case Presentation**\n\n【24】**A 31-year-old Han Taiwanese man with a history of G6PD deficiency was admitted due to fever， cough， fatigue， muscle soreness and occasional dyspnoea for 20 days. After admission， Chest X-Ray (CXR) revealed bilateral infiltration. The White Blood Cell (WBC) count was 5200 cells/mL， N-Seg 72.3%， lymph 19.2%， Hemoglobin (Hb) 13.2 g/dL， platelet 231，000/mL， Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) 16 mg/dL， Creatinine (Cr) 0.8 mg/dL， Sodium (Na) 136 mmol/L， Potassium (K)3.6 mmol/L， Aspartate Transaminase (AST) 30 U/L， Alanine Amino Transferase (ALT) 21 U/L**\n\n【25】**and total bilirubin 0.7 mg/dL. Blood and sputum acid fast satin， TB culture， pneumococcal and legionella urinary antigen test， Mycoplasma IgM， Chlamydophila IgM， Toxoplasma IgG all showed negative. High-Resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT) was arranged and showed diffuse Ground-Glass Opacities (GGO) and thickening of interlobular septum. PJP was then considered. HIV EIA and HIV western blot both showed positive result. CD4 counts were 50 cells/mm’. HIV RNA (Ribonucleic Acid) load was 45588copies/ml. Oxygen supplement was delivered and TMP/SMZ 240mg/1200 mg intravenously was given every eight hours. At Day-13 of TMP/SMZ treatment， a review of medication was preformed and the issue of G6PD deficiency history was raised. The blood test was done immediately and Hb was 11.6 g/dL， total bilirubin was 0.7 mg/dL， direct bilirubin was 0.3 mg/dL. With no obvious sign and symptoms as well as episode of acute hemolytic， the TMP/ SMZ treatment was continued. At Day-16， under stable condition， the patient was discharged with oral TMP/SMZ240 mg/1200 mg three times a day for five more days and an Out-Patient Department (OPD) appointment was arranged. After 21 days ofPJP treatment completed， aprophylaxis dose of TMP/ SMZ 160 mg/800 mg once daily was given until CD4reach 200 cells/mm. The G6PD enzyme activities were measured by quantitative fluorescence assay and showed a level of 0.6 U/g Hb(reference range： 6.4 U/g Hb to 12.9 U/g Hb) which was classified as severe enzyme activity deficiency by the definition defined by World Health Organization (WHO) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.**\n\n【26】**Discussion**\n\n【27】**G6PD deficiency is the most commonly inherited Red Blood Cell (RBC) enzymatic defect， affecting around 400 million people worldwide 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. About 7.5% of the world population carries one or two genes for G6PD deficiency. It is an X-linked genetic disorder with 187 known allelic mutations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. In Taiwan， G6PD deficiency prevalence between male and female were approximately 2.81% and0.7% respectively7\\].**\n\n【28】**TMP/SMZ is used in a variety of infectious diseases and is the recommended treatment option in current practice for managing PJP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>； however， it is associated with hemolysis when administered to G6PD deficient patients. Chisholm-Burns et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u> demonstrated a case with of African ethnicity with G6PD deficiency that experienced hemolysis after administration of double strength of TMP/SMZ orally for eight days. Reinke et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u> also reported a black woman with HIV infection who received only one dose of TMP/SMZ intravenously for managing PJP which then resulted in acute hemolysis. On the contrary literature had reported challenging G6PD subjects with genetic variant alleles. A commonly observed in the African population， with TMP/SMZ at the dose of 320/1600mg every 12 h. The level ofhemoglobin did not decrease significantly nor did any hemolysis occur throughout the trial 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. The possible explanation was that the regeneration rate of hemoglobin was faster than destruction of hemoglobin in G6PD A-variant population. However， the severity of hemolytic anemia varies among individuals with G6PD deficiency. Specific G6PD alleles are associated with G6PD variants with different enzyme activity and， therefore， result in different levels of disease severity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. In Southeast Asia， the most common variant alleles appear to be G6PD Kaiping and Canton， which are different from the western or African ethnicity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. To date， there is still insufficient evidence for the population in Taiwan to suggest a robust relationship between our G6PD variant alleles and the degree of disease severity with regards to the safety in the use of TMP/SMZ in G6PD deficiency 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>.**\n\n【29】**Conclusion**\n\n【30】**The experience and evidence regarding safety in the use of TMP/SMZ in G6PD deficient HIV infected patients is not vet clear. Herein， we documented a case of a G6PD deficient HIV infected man successfully treated the PJP with high dose of TMP/SMZ without any signs and symptoms of hemolysis.**\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**Acknowledgment**</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**I would like to express my gratitude to Yeo Han Ting Jillian， who gave me writing and editing assistance.

In South Dagon Township， 1，065 potential mosquito breeding containers were inspected and Aedes immature stages were found in 246 containers. Meanwhile， 309 Aedes infested containers out of 1，216 inspected containers were found in Htantabin Township. Discarded container type was the highest Aedes infested proportion in both townships and meanwhile， flower vase was the most common type container.

South Dagon was one of the high dengue cases-reported townships in last 5 years (VBDC， Annual Report 2019). Meanwhile， Htantabin， a suburban area and located at outskirt of Yangon city， reported the highest dengue cases from January to June 2020. Thus， those two townships were selected purposively for the present study.**\n\n【19】**As precaution measures for COVID-19 transmission， the following measures were precisely performed during the activity：Applied minimum workforce (one entomologist， one epidemiologist， one Basic Health Staff (BHS) and one local ward authority)， applied personal protective measures (masks and face-shields)， routine temperature checking of survey team members and reduced the contact time with inhabitants.**\n\n【20】**Inspections of potential breeding habitats (presence or absence of Aedes mosquito immature stages) in and around household premises were inspected thoroughly by survey team following precaution measures as mentioned previously. Container type， size， place and type of water were noted down using checklist. Residents were requested to bring flower vases which were placed indoor to outside of the houses. In order to reduce communication time with residents， larvae and pupae were not counted and also water containers inside of the houses except flower vases were ignored in the present study.**\n\n【21】**Data analysis**\n\n【22】**Entomological data were analyzed by using R studio software and categorical data were shown in percentage.

Spermatic cord liposarcoma is a rare tumor， and only some 200 cases have been reported in the literature. About 20% of liposarcomas are retroperitoneal， involving only 0.1% of the inguinal mass， typically confused with inguinal hernia. We treated the patient with organ sparing surgery， preserving the testicle， without chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Follow-up for six months showed good response， without recurrence or metastasis.**\n\n【17】**Keywords： Liposarcoma； Inguinal mass； Spermatic cord**\n\n【18】**Introduction**\n\n【19】**Tumors of the spermatic cord are rare and generally hard to diagnose. Most are benign， and when malignant they are almost always sarcomas. Here we report a case of giant spermatic cord liposarcoma in an 80 year old patient， presenting scrotal mass initially diagnosed as an inguinal hernia.**\n\n【20】**Spermatic cord liposarcoma is a rare cause of inguinal mass. These tumors can closely mimic inguinoscrotalhernia upon physical examination. However， these tumors require a different surgical approach and treatment plan. Liposarcomas are tumors that occur mainly in retroperitoneum： Only3% to 7% are found in the paratesticular region. The spermatic cord is the main place of origin in these cases. This malignant disease can result in loss of fertility， in addition to life threatening sequelae.**\n\n【21】**Case Presentation**\n\n【22】**A.S.D.F， 80 years old， presented weight loss (10 kg in 6 months) associated with normocytic and normochromic anemia and a giant inguinoscrotal mass on the left with a 5 year evolution. Computed tomography of abdomen and pelvis indicated the presence of a massive left inguinal hernia with fatty contents .**\n\n【23】**The patient was referredto amedicalclinic wherehe was evaluatedby proctology and submitted to general surgery due to the suspicion of consumptive intestinal focus syndrome， and inguinal hernia， respectively. Finaly， he was evaluated by urology， in which the surgical procedure was indicated， due to suspicion of inguinal cord liposarcoma. Total inguinal mass resection with preservation of the testis and free margins was performed . He evolved well in the postoperative period and was discharged after five days for outpatient follow-up. The histopathological report evidenced the presence of well differentiated liposarcoma . The patient was referred to clinical oncology and opted not to undergo radiotherapy or chemotherapy， even in the case of lesions greater than five centimeters， but grade I， with favorable pathology， due to his advanced age. The risks of complications would outweigh the benefits. He remains in good general condition， so far without recurrence， six months after the surgery.**\n\n【24】**Discussion**\n\n【25】**Sarcoma of the spermatic cord was first reported by Lesauvage in 1845 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Based on case reports since then， it appears that most patients with spermatic cord liposarcomas develop the condition in the fifth or sixth decade of life， with an uneven， painless， irregularly growing inguinal or inguinoscrotal mass that is distinct from the testis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2-4\\]</u>. Diagnosis of spermatic cord liposarcomas in the preoperative period may be challenging， since this clinical presentation can indicate several more common conditions， such as inguinal hernia， lipoma， hydrocele， epididymal cyst， funicular**\n\n【26】**Figure 1： Computed tomography of abdomen and pelvis.**\n\n【27】**cyst or testicular tumors \\[2，5-8\\].**\n\n【28】**On ultrasound examination， a liposarcoma of the spermatic cord usually presents heterogeneous echogenicity. However， these ultrasonographic findings have no specificity. Computed tomography is suggestive of diagnosis in approximately half of the cases and helps to determine the involvement of the anterior abdominal wall and/or retroperitoneum \\[1，5，9，10\\]. They can be classified into four groups：well differentiated， myxoid， round cell or pleomorphic type. The first two are the most cited in the literature and have better prognosis. Some authors advocate the theory that a liposarcoma may arise due to degeneration of a previous lipoma， but other reports say the opposite\\[11J.**\n\n【29】**The size of the tumors can range from 3 cm to 30 cm in diameter and they tend to be gray white or yellow. Most of them are lobulated or nodular and in some cases a certain degree of necrosis may be present.**\n\n【30】**Current standard treatment strategies for these tumors include radical orchiectomy with extensive local excision of surrounding structures and with high ligation of the spermatic cord. Even in well-differentiated liposarcomas， local recurrence is high. In this case， a broad excision of the inguinal canal， with or without orchiectomy， should be performed if not previously done. Adjuvant radiation or chemotherapy is not well established， although there is some evidence supporting high grade chemotherapy， especially for PPC rhabdomyosarcomas \\[12，13\\].**\n\n【31】**Some studies report a 5 year overall survival rate of 75% for well differentiated tumors. Some risk factors for recurrence have been defined and include tumor grade， size， depth of invasion， and most importantly， surgical margin status \\[14，15\\].**\n\n【32】**Although this is an uncommon condition， so few cases have been reported in the literature， the current trend is focused on organ sparing surgery， involving fewer multi layers， especially in well differentiated liposarcomas or in patients with advanced age， and comorbidities， since even with high local recurrence， these are late. Some authors have already reported that complete excision of the tumor， if possible， can be performed with the intention of preserving the testis， as in the case presented here \\[16，17\\]. Radical surgery remains the gold standard and rigorous follow-up should be maintained over the long term. Every effort should be made to report new cases with organ-sparing surgeries，to enable improving patient outcomes in the future.**\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**1\\.

There are less than 10 reported cases of orbital myxofibrosarcoma. The authors report a case of a patient with a previous resected low-grade myxofibrosarcoma in the right orbit， who 16-years later presented with the same tumor. This first recurrence was resected， leaving a residual mass. Two years later， the patient presented with an extensive mass in the right orbit， sinuses， and nasal cavities. The histopathological examination showedhigh-grade myxofibrosarcoma. The patient underwent palliative radiotherapy and palliative care. The risk of metastasis ofthis type of tumor depends on the degree ofhistological differentiation. But local recurrence rate is similar for all with an increase of metastasis risk with every recurrence. Due to the few cases reported there are no standardized management guidelines. However， it is recommended wide surgical margins be associated with postoperative radiotherapy in the presence of residual lesions or high-grade tumors.**\n\n【13】**Keywords： Myxofibrosarcoma； Orbital； Proptosis**\n\n【14】**Introduction**\n\n【15】**Myxofibrosarcoma (MFS) is the most common type of fibroblastic sarcoma in elderly patients. It is a slow-growing mesenchymal tumor that usually occurs in the extremities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Its orbital location is extremely rare as there are few cases described in the literature at the moment of this review. Therefore， there are notreatments guidelines available for this disease， thus the authors present this case of a recurrent orbital myxofibrosarcoma in order to collaborate towards future studies and this orbital tumor management.**\n\n【16】**Case Presentation**\n\n【17】**A 73-year-old woman presented with a 5-month painful right proptosis and a same-side Ipro exodeviation. Her past medical history was significant for a right orbital mass resection reported by an external hospital as a low-grade myxofibrosarcoma 16 years earlier. Her other medical background included arterial hypertension， dyslipidemia， fibromyalgia， essential tremor， suspended tobacco use， and she had been treated for a depressive episode. The patient was taking atorvastatin and sertraline， at the moment of presentation.**\n\n【18】**On the first physical examination， she presented with an obvious right exophthalmos and exotropia . Uncorrected visual acuity was 20/150 in the Right Eye (RE) and 20/20 in the Left Eye (LE). Intraocular pressure was normal in both eyes. Slit-lamp examination was unremarkable. Fundus examination revealed a congested right optic disc.**\n\n【19】**Computerized Tomography scans (CTs) revealed a thrombosed right orbital vascular malformation and Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA) revealed an orbital mass with a vascularized component in the internal portion of the right orbit .**\n\n【20】**Considering the patient's background， a relapse of the original tumor was suspected. Thus， a transcaruncular orbitotomy with excisional biopsy of the lesion was performed. The mass was lobular and solid in appearance， of medial location， and deep extension， almost reaching the orbital apex. Due to the lesion size， it was necessary to widen the surgical field with a vertical division of the upper eyelid at 5 mm from the superior punctum. The resected mass was 50 mmx30mmx19mm .**\n\n【21】**_cited._**\n\n【22】**Histologic examination revealed fused cells， ofelongated， oval， round nuclei， some pleomorphic and hyperchromatic， eosinophilic cytoplasm， mitotic count of 1 to 3 in 10 fields of higher magnification.Stroma with mild to moderate inflammatoryelements of lymphocyte type， congestive**\n\n【23】**Figure 1： Patient at first consult presenting right exaphthalmos and exatropia.**\n\n【24】**Figure 2： Brain resonance showing a thrombased right orbital vascular maltormation.**\n\n【25】**Figure 3： Resected mass.**\n\n【26】**vascularization， hyalinized fibrosis， myxoid areas. No necrosis was found.Immunohistochemical analysis of the tumor cells was positive for vimentin， desmin， ki-67 positive in 10% of the nucleuses and CD34 in 80% of the cells negative for S100 and actine. These features were suggestive of low-grade myxofibrosarcoma.**\n\n【27】**Due to the presence of tumor in the surgical margin of the biopsy a post-surgical CT was done， which confirmed the presence of a residual mass. This case was presented to the oncology committee to evaluate the need for exenteration of coadjuvant therapy. Consensus was not reached. Therefore， no further procedures were done.**\n\n【28】**The patient stayed asymptomatic during medical follow-up for two years， after that period， the patient presented with two-week paresthesia of the right orbital region， progressive exophthalmos， and a recurrent nosebleed from the same side. On examination， the patient showed greater proptosis in the right eye. The evaluation by otolaryngology revealed a nasal cavity mass. Resonance revealed an extensive mass centered in the perinasal cavities of about 60 mmx50 mm x 62 mm. The tumor occupied the ethmoid cells， maxillary**\n\n【29】**Figure 4： Resonance showing recurrence of the tumor centered in the perinasal cavities.**\n\n【30】**sinus， and part of the right orbit， with intraconal involvement， and which posteriorly extended to the sphenoid sinus， compressing the cavernous sinus .**\n\n【31】**Through the nasal passage， a new biopsy was performed. It was diagnosed as high-grade myxofibrosarcoma. The case was presented again to the oncology committee， along the lesion was out of surgical reach. It was decided that palliative care management and palliative radiotherapy was the best option for this patient.**\n\n【32】**Discussion**\n\n【33】**Myxofibrosarcoma (MFS)， previously called malignant myxoid fibrous histiocytoma， is one of the most common fibroblastic sarcomas in elderlypatients (20%). It is a slow-growing mesenchymal tumor that usually occurs in the extremities， and its orbital location is extremely rare 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. In the literature there are less than 10 reported cases of orbital myxofibrosarcoma， however， it is likely that there is an underreporting due to the change in its nomenclature in recent years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2-10\\]</u>. In 2002， the World Health Organization modified the classification of MFS， so that part of the previously reported orbital Malignant Fibrous Histiocytomas (MFH) could correspond to the same entity， unlike other subtypes of FMH (pleomorphic， giant cell and inflammatory) that did not represent a defined entity\\[11，12\\]. Characteristics of the previous studies are summarized in Supplementary Table 1； however it was not possible to find the full article of the work by Imai et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.**\n\n【34】**The clinical behavior of myxofibrosarcomas is related to the degree of histological differentiation. Low-grade tumors have a low probability of metastasizing (20%)， however the local recurrence rate is similar for all tumor grades， with rates ranging between 17% and60%， and with each new recurrence the risk of metastasis recurrence increases \\[1，8，13，14\\]. The high rates of local recurrence could be explained by the frequent vascular extension of the tumor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. Recent studies have shown that the only significant predictor of local recurrence risk is the surgical margin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. Risk factors associated with disease-specific mortality are size greater than 5 cm， tumor necrosis， and <75% myxoid component on histology 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Compared to other soft tissue sarcomas， MFS have better survival， since a 5-year survival rate is estimated at 64% to 77% in high-grade MFS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>.**\n\n【35】**Managing these patients is a real challenge. The described infiltrative character makes it very difficult to define the tumor margins， increasing the probability of residual lesions and therefore of local recurrence.In addition，each recurrence increases the probability of having higher-grade lesions， and therefore of metastasizing. The few cases reported to date do not allow for standardized management**\n\n【36】**guidelines， but in general， resection with wide surgical margins is recommended， associated with postoperative radiotherapy in the presence of residuallesions or high-grade tumors.**\n\n【37】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【38】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**1\\.

In our practice， patients are treated according to the international guidelines， thus the higher mortality rates seen in our country are probably related to patients presenting with more advanced disease and consequently less chance of survival.

Arterial blood gas sampling confirmed metabolic acidosis (pH 7.22， PO， 93 mmHg and PCO， 35 mmHg) and a Computed Tomography (CT) of the abdomen/pelvis with intravenous contrast was undertaken， revealing a splenic rupture with a moderate hemoperitoneum . The patient re-affirmed there was no trauma prior to the onset of abdominal pain. A repeat full blood count was performed and confirmed a significant decrease in Hb(5.7 g/dL) and hematocrit (17.6%). Two units of Red Blood Cells (RBC) were transfused immediately， and the patient transferred to the operating room for emergency laparotomy and splenectomy.**\n\n【15】**An arterialline inserted prior to induction revealed severe hypotension (50/20mmHg) requiring administration of small boluses of intravenous Adrenaline (5 ug +5 ug). General anesthesia was initiated with a rapid sequence induction (Etomidate 18 mg， Fentanyl 150 ug， Rocuronium 80 mg). Intubation was uneventful， and anesthesia was maintained with Sevoflurane and Remifentanil. A percutaneous sheath introducer with a 8.5 French was inserted under US guidance into the right internal jugular vein to facilitate rapid administration of blood products. Four units of RBC and three units of Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP) in addition to 500 mL of colloids and 500 mL of crystalloids were required during surgery aiming to stabilize the patient and reverse the coagulopathy. A total splenectomy was performed， and after safe extubation in the operating room， was transferred to the intensive care unit. His postoperative course was uneventful and successfully discharged home seven days later.**\n\n【16】**Discussion**\n\n【17】**Rivaroxaban has a rapid onset of action with a relatively predictable pharmacokinetic profile and a relatively short plasma half-life making initiation， maintenance， and discontinuation of anticoagulant therapy considerably more comfortable than with traditional oral anticoagulants. It is highly protein-bound (92% to 95%) with renal excretion at 36%， and in contrast to other new anticoagulants as Dabigatran， dialysis is not effective for its removal.**\n\n【18】**Table 1： Management of bleeding secondary to Rivaroxaban.**\n\n【19】**Rivaroxaban Moderate bleeding： action Severe bleeding： action**\n\n|  | **Fluid replacement.** **Give blood cells if Hb<8 mg/dL** **Give platelets (if <70.000/pL or if patient is taking an** **antiplatelet drug)** **Tranexamic acid iv (15-30 mg/kg) +/- continuaus infusion (1** **mg/kg/h)** **面 Consider Prothrombin complex 50 lUikg， repeat if necessary**  | **Add recombinant factor Vlla (Novoseven@-100 pg/kgby lV bolus)； repeat if necessary\\*2** **Give Andexanet alfa if available\\*3** **·Bolus 800 mg at 30 mg/minute.** **·Within 2 minutes following the bolus dose， administer** **the continuous iv infusion 8 mg/min for up to 120minutes.**  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n\n【21】Half dose could be an option if there is no a life-threatening bleeding scenario\n\n【22】**Figure1A，1B：CTabdomen/pelvis with contrast showing active extravasation from the spleen with a large subcapsular hematoma and hemoperitoneum.**\n\n【23】**In 2019 the update of the AHA/ACC/HRS in the guidelines for the management of patients with atrial fibrillation， Rivaroxaban is now recommended over warfarin for stroke prevention 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. There is， at present， no consensus on the best methodology for assessing Rivaroxaban activity in vivo and hence no guiding dosage. Unlike traditional oral anticoagulants， traditional coagulation tests cannot be used to assess or adjust dosing. At therapeutic concentrations， Rivaroxaban has a relatively weak influence on the PT；however， it is more profound at higher concentrations， with a good correlation between prolongation of the PT and plasma concentration.**\n\n【24】**Although hemorrhage iiss the significant adverse effect of Rivaroxaban， unfortunately， there is no immediate reversal agent currently available. Although Andexanet alfa has been approved by the FDA， for reversal of anticoagulation in life-threatening or uncontrolled bleeding in patients treated with Rivaroxaban， it is not available in many countries. Therefore， other measures should be taken to treat significant hemorrhage .**\n\n【25】**Conclusion**\n\n【26】**Rivaroxaban's datasheet details no reference to spontaneous splenic rupture due to its use； however， this is the sixth case report of spontaneous splenic rupture in a patient， with no history of trauma， treated with Rivaroxaban.**\n\n【27】**A pharmacologic interaction could be the potential cause of an increase in activity ofRivaroxaban resulting in major hemorrhage.

It has a wide range of symptoms as well as complications from fatigue to loss of consciousness. Although a lot of factors can cause low sodium levels， combining specific medications can lead severe hyponatremia in a rapid onset which can cause high mortality and morbidity. The objective of this case report was to underline that prescribing specific medications disregarding their side effects can cause this common electrolyte imbalance but in a more severe manner. In this case report， we present a 46-year-old male patient with serum sodium level of 104 mEq/L who consumed hydrochlorothiazide for hypertension and was under treatment with Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) for major depression. Patient had tonic-clonic seizures at the second hour of the treatment and intubation was needed due to loss of consciousness and hypoxia. After proper replacement ofsodium with hypertonic solutions in intensive care unit for nine days， extubation was indicated. Even in healthy young males， hyponatremia due to two separately prescribed medications can lead life threatening hyponatremia. Physicians should be aware of the side effects of diuretics， especially hydrochlorothiazides and SSRIs and their combinations.**\n\n【12】**Keywords： Diuretics； Hydrochlorotiazide； Hyponatremia，SSRI**\n\n【13】**Introduction**\n\n【14】**Hyponatremia is defined when sodium levels are decreased less than 135 mEq/L 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. It is the most common electrolyte imbalance detected among all medical fields. It has an incidence of 0.97% and prevalence of 2.48% in general population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. The prevalence of hyponatremia among hospitalized patients is 15% to 30% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Most of the time the severity of hyponatremia is mostly mild or moderate and the patients are generally asymptomatic. Main symptoms include nausea， vomiting， headache， lethargy， fatigue， apathy， disorientation， drowsiness， agitation， muscle cramps and convulsions. Physical examination shows findings of dehydration， decreased level of consciousness， ataxia， decreased deep tendon reflexes， presence of pathological reflexes， pseudobulbar paralysis， increased intracranial pressure syndrome，hypothermia， Cheyne Stokes respiration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Severe hyponatremia primarily presents with central nervous system symptoms and findings 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Renal or cerebral water wasting， loss of sodium via gastrointestinal system or skin， specific medications and many more factors can cause hyponatremia. In our case， we present a patient with severe hyponatremia secondary to combination of two specific medications usage which necessitated intubation due to generalized seizures.**\n\n【15】**Case Presentation**\n\n【16】**A 46-year-old male patient， who was diagnosed with hypertension a month ago， applied to the emergency department of our hospital with complaints of headache lasting for 10 days and lately developed confusion. Further questioning implied that the patient had had many emergency room admissions due to severe hypertension attacks for a month. Medication for hypertension he used for a week included spironolactone 25 mg per oral (po)， once a day (qd)；hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg po， qd； perindopril indapamide 5 mg/1.25 mg po， qd. He had taken 100 mg captopril right before he applied to the emergency room.**\n\n【17】**Physical examination findings were confusion， limited cooperation and coordination. Blood pressure was 158/70 mmHg， pulse was 76 beats per minute with normal sinus rhythm，saturation was 99%， and temperature was 36.6°C at the time of admission. No specific findings were noted on the respiratory and gastrointestinal system examination. He had not had nausea， vomiting and diarrhea at the onset of symptoms. Laboratory results were as serum sodium of 104 mEq/L， glucose**\n\n【18】**level of 122 mg/dl， potassium level of 3.5 mEq/L， chloride was 67mEq/L， blood urine nitrogen was 19 mg/dl， creatinine was 0.96 mg/dl. Blood gas levels showed that pH： 7.5， HCO3： 25 mEq/L. Blood count was WBC： 15.000， Hb 13 g/dl and PLT 330000/ul. According to clinical examination， patient was assessed as euvolemic. Since his serum osmolality was 221 mosm/kg it was decided that patient had been having euvolemic hyponatremia and internalized to the internal medicine clinic. Sodium gap was calculated， and 3% hypertonic serum infusion had been started. When the hypertonic infusion was at the second hour， patient had a generalized tonic-clonic seizure. The patient had gotten unconscious and became hypoxic due to aspiration. Consequently， he was intubated and transferred to intensive care unit of internal medicine clinic. Phenytoin infusion had been started as the first line intervention. Cranial imagings of the patient showed no pathological findings while thoracic imaging indicated air bronchograms and diffuse consolidations. Patient diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia and treatment of 4，5 gr piperacillin -tazobactam four times a day had been started.**\n\n【19】**Intubated patient was followed up for nine days. Sodium depletion was replaced carefully during this period with 3% hypertonic sodium chloride solution. When sodium levels reached to 139 mEq/L，patient had become conscious again and ventilation requirement was no longer needed； patient was extubated. After 3 more days of follow up in intensive care unit with sodium replacement therapy with hypertonic sodium infusion and antibiotic regimen for aspiration pneumonia， satisfying results were obtained from laboratory tests indicating pneumonia regression and acceptable serum sodium levels. Patient's sodium levels by day were demonstrated on Figure 1. Patient had gotten clinically better， was no longer in need for intensive care unit admission and discharged to internal medicine clinic.**\n\n【20】**Investigations for etiology of the hyponatremic case had been started ultimately. Spot urine sodium was <20 mEq/L. Thyroid function was normal as the results were as follows： TSH was1.18uIU/ml， free T3 level was 3.05 pg/ml and free T4 was 0.97 ng/dl. No pathologic results of urine sampling were noted other than ketone bodies which were 2+. Patient’s morning cortisol level was 10.2 mcg/dl and ACTH level was 51 pg/ml. Therefore， intravenous ACTH stimulation test was performed. Adrenal insufficiency was ruled out due to the satisfactory results of cortisol response. Patient's lab results for functions of hypophysial hormones were within normal ranges. As a result of all laboratory testing， patient's evaluation for etiology of the normovolemic hypotonic hyponatremia was ended up with drug related hyponatremia as known as drug induced hyponatremia. Patient's all prescribed medications were stopped，and hypertension management was done with 30 mg nifedipine two times a day per oral. Following blood pressure levels were within normal ranges. Serum sodium levels were noted in normal ranges during the inpatient followed up. No additional seizures were observed. After completion of the antibiotic regimen for aspiration pneumonia which was confirmed with laboratory results and clinical recovery， patient was discharged with satisfying outcomes.**\n\n【21】**Discussion**\n\n【22】**Hyponatremia as one of the most common electrolyte imbalances is caused by numerous factors disturbing the balance between water and sodium. The diagnosis and the treatment are essentially based on the etiologic factors. First and the foremost， main etiological factors causing hyponatremia should be assessed properly. In some cases， various factors， especially multiple drug usage， can**\n\n【23】**cause hyponatremia at once. Careful history taking and physical examination can make a physician distinguish whether the patient ishypovolemic， normovolemic or hypervolemic. Additionally， history of the patient can reveal that if the condition is acute or chronic， and the patient is symptomatic or asymptomatic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. In patients diagnosed with hyponatremia， serum osmolality should be calculated， and etiology of the imbalance should be investigated. In our case， patient had become symptomatic in a short period of time which was obtained by a detailed patient history pointing out that the patient's condition was acute. Additionally， patient had severe symptoms which also occurred acutely and had high mortality rates.**\n\n【24】**The symptoms of hyponatremia mostly depend on the onset and the severity of the imbalance. Mortality is caused by cerebral edema， which is precipitated by acute decrease in serum sodium levels， or by osmotic demyelination syndrome due to the aggressive replacement of sodium in chronic hyponatremia patients. Hence it is crucial to get aproperhistoryofthe patient to determine whether the hyponatremia developed in a short or long period of time. Our patient’s serum sodium levels were very low as he applied for an emergency care with very low sodium levels (104 mEq/L).**\n\n【25】**The variety of the drugs causing hyponatremia is increasing constantly. Underlying mechanism ofthe drugsleadinghyponatremia mainly can be divided into three categories which are drugs physiologically acting as Antidiuretic Hormone (ADH)， stimulating the secretion of ADH and creating a synergistic effect of ADH on renal response 4.**\n\n【26】**In a study conducted by Fenoglio et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>， which focused on the most reported drugs causing iatrogenic hyponatremia， they revealed that 75.5% of the patients had syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion.Selectiveserotoninreuptake inhibitors(n=15)，antiepileptics(n=7)， proton pump inhibitors (n=7) or hormones， antipsychotics， antineoplastics were taken by those patients. Additionally， 12.2% of the participants who were diagnosed with hypoosmolar hypovolemic hyponatremia，thiazide diuretics were submitted as the main etiology. Our patient was newly diagnosed with hypertension and was taking his medications which were spironolactone， hydrocholorthiazide， perindopril， indapamide. Moreover， he was taking hydroxyzine and sertraline for his major depression which was prescribed by his physician.**\n\n【27】**In another study， Movig et al. compared the risk of hyponatremia caused by SSRIs and other antidepressants. Also， they compared combined use of diuretics with SSRI's or with other antidepressant：The results indicated that SSRI's were 4 times more potential to cause hyponatremia than other antidepressants. Additionally， the use of diuretics combined with SSRI's in elderly population had the highest risk ratio among others 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Although our patient was relatively**\n\n【28】**younger than the patients in the study； severe hyponatremia was caused by combined medications he was using for his hypertension and his depression which all were prescribed by physicians.**\n\n【29】**Time onset of hyponatremia has a wide range from the first day of the consumption up to few months. In one study conducted by Liu BA and his friends， the mean time interval was estimated at 13days 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. The time interval was also short in our study which was about seven days； as the patient developed prominent symptoms after starting his antihypertensive treatment with hydrochlorothiazide.**\n\n【30】**In hospitalized patients with hyponatremia secondary to SSRI usage，10% ofthose needed intensive care and mortality rates are up to7%通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Thus， exclusion ofother etiologic factors causinghyponatremia and early diagnosis and treatment are crucial. As mentioned above， our patient was in severe depletion of sodium which led him had tonic-clonic seizures， become hypoxic and unconsciousness which all are signaling high rate of mortality， separately.**\n\n【31】**Checking the serum sodium levels both before and after the treatment is recommended in patients who have multiple chronic diseases and under the treatment with multiple medications since they have higher risk for drug related hyponatremia. \\[9，10\\]. First treatment approach is discontinuation of the possible drug and providing supportive therapy. In patients under SSRI medication， diuretic prescription should be avoided to minimize the risk of hyponatremia \\[5，6\\].**\n\n【32】**Conclusion**\n\n【33】**Physicians should keep this in mind that commonly used drugs such as SSRIs or diuretics are causing severe hyponatremia with acute onset which leads mortality and morbidity. In a patient with acute hyponatremia symptoms careful questioning about medication history should be done. We strongly recommend that combination of SSRI with diuretics， especially with hydrochlorothiazide shouldnt be prescribed to any patient since they have severe complications by decreasing the serum sodium levels rapidly.**\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【35】通用结尾删除-1:<u>1\\.

This infection can be acquired intrauterine when the first infection of pregnant woman occurs and the Toxoplasma gondii reaches the fetus by transplacental via. The damage to the fetus can compromise the pregnancy and life quality of the infected individual. Early diagnosis of infection allows emergency therapeutic intervention with reduction of the transmission rate and also the severity of the sequelae. Different methodologies are available for the diagnosis of acute gestational toxoplasmosis with detection of IgG and IgM anti-T. gondii antibodies. The methodologies differ mainly by specificity and sensitivity values reached， as well as execution facility and time required. These parameters can decisively influence the choice of the most appropriate technique by the municipal health polices， in public health strategies. The main ofthe present review is to synthesize the major characteristics of serological tests for congenital toxoplasmosis.**\n\n【15】**Keywords： Congenital toxoplasmosis； Gestational toxoplasmosis； Public health； Serology**\n\n【16】**Introduction**\n\n【17】**Toxoplasmosis is a protozoonosis worldwide distributed； its etiologic agent is Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondit)， a protozoan belonging to the phylum Apicomplexa， class Sporozoasida， order Eucoccidiorida， family Sarcocystidae， genus Toxoplasma and single species， T. gondii 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.

The tachyzoites can invade any nucleated cell and form a parasitoid vacuole， where they undergo rapid and successive divisions by endodiogenia， originating new tachyzoites， which break the parasitized cell and invade healthy cells， which characterizes this phase as proliferative 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.**\n\n【19】**The dissemination ofthis parasite in the organism occurs through freeor intracellular tachyzoites through the lymph， or blood， and can give rise to a polysymptomatic picture， with varying severity according to the parasite load， the parasite strain and the susceptibility of the host 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.**\n\n【20】**The frequency of infection may vary according to age， eating habits， cultural patterns and the urban or rural origin of the individual. The prevalence can vary between parts worldwide， with higher taxes in Latin America， parts of Eastern/Central Europe， the Middle East， South-East Asia and Africa 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. The infection can occur by the ingestion of food or water contaminated with oocysts， or ingestion of undercooked or raw meat with cysts bradyzoites， or the tachyzoites bytransplacental**\n\n【21】**via， nevertheless， the human toxoplasmosis has been associated with low socioeconomic conditions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.**\n\n【22】**This increased risk may be due to changes in the placenta. In early pregnancy， the placental barrier reaches a thickness of 50 to 100um and progressively decreases to 2.5-5 um at the end of pregnancy， allowing parasites to more easily invade trophoblasts.**\n\n【23】**According to the gestational age on the first infection with T. gondii， the damage to the fetus can vary due to the morphogenesis phase when affected by the parasite， therefore， in 80.0% to 90.0%of infections in immunocompetent individuals there is no clinical manifestation； however， when there is the infection in the first trimester of gestation， fetal death is common， and when in the second and third trimesters of gestation it may lead to prematurity and Sabin's tetrad， which associates microcephaly，retinocoriditis，cerebral calcifications and mental deficiency 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. In 50.0% of congenital infections， fetal alterations such as hydrocephalus and periventricular necrosis with macro or microcephaly are reported. In 90.0% of patients there is marked retinal destruction and retinocoriditis， in69.0% cerebral calcifications are developed and in 60.0% of the cases are generated mental retardation or neurological disorders with signs of encephalitis and with seizures 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.**\n\n【24】**The chance of congenital in fection is estimated between 4.5% and15.0% when there is toxoplasmosis in the first trimester， followed by 17.3% to 30.0% in the second third， and 60.0% to 75.0% in the last period \\[10，11\\]. This increase in the rate of infection according to gestational age is due to the morphological changes of the placenta， because in the first trimester of pregnancy， the placenta has reduced dimensions and the chance of the parasite reaching the fetus is small， in contrast， as in this phase happens the organogenesis， when there is differentiation of the germinative leaflets， ectoderm， mesoderm and endoderm giving rise to the internal organs of the organism， aggravating the infection， that can lead to fetal death 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.**\n\n【25】**In the second trimester， increased placenta reflects a greater chance of infection， however， in this period， the infection becomes less severe， since almost all organogenesis has already occurred， meantime， it can result in important damages such as Sabin's Tetrad， in which the fetus presents retinocoriditis， cerebral calcifications， mental retardation or neurological disorders and hydrocephalus， with macro or microcephaly 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. In the third trimester， the placenta presents the largest dimensions of the period， consequently， the chance ofinfection is higher and， in contrast， the chance of developing serious damage at birth is remote， with manifestations of the disease such as fever， body spots， blindness， in a few days， weeks or months after birth 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.**\n\n【26】**The reduction in incidence， as well as morbidity and mortality rates associated with congenital toxoplasmosis can be achieved in the presence ofcollaborative efforts among pregnant women， researchers， doctors and health policy managers， on the adoption of primary and secondary health preventive measures in the gestation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>.**\n\n【27】**The diagnosis of acute T. gondii infection in the gestationalperiod is crucial to define the risk of fetal involvement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. For this，prenatal care should be carried out continuously from the gestational diagnosis， in order to avoid congenital toxoplasmosis and also the other risks associated with the life of the pregnant woman and the fetus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. In Brazil，health professionals who work in the care ofpregnant women who perform prenatal care through the Unified Health System (SUS)， comply with the protocols established by the Ministry of Health，**\n\n【28】**which guide the serological monitoring for primary infection by T. gondii 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. Confirmation of toxoplasmosis is based on indirect or immunological methods， since the direct demonstration of the protozoan by culture， inoculation， immunohistochemistry and pathology is in frequent 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>.**\n\n【29】**The molecular techniques with direct detection of T. gondii tachyzoite is possible during the acute phase of infection and can confirm fetal infection from different body fluids such as blood， amniotic fluid， cerebrospinal fluid， aqueous humor，bronchial lavage fluid alveolar and even urine by PCR technique with a sensitivity of up to 92.0%， which makes this the method of choice in cases of low parasitemic， on the other hand， in the chronic phase of infection， as in cases of cysts in brain or pulmonary tissue， the technique will not be useful 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>.**\n\n【30】**Indirect or serological techniques， through the detection of antibodies of the IgM， IgG， IgE and IgA classes， do not require invasive procedures that pose a risk to the fetus such as amniocentesis and can be performed at any time during pregnancy. Several methods are available for the serological diagnosis of gestational toxoplasmosis such as the Sabin-Feldman technique， Immunofluorescence antibody test (IFAT)， Hemagglutination (HA)， complement fixation (FC)， enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)， immunoblotting and Imunosorbent Agglutination Assay (ISAGA)， with differences between the values of sensitivity and specificity reached 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>.**\n\n【31】**It is important that the serological tests for specific anti-T.gondii antibodies are performed at the first prenatal visit with serial analysis in the second and third trimester of gestation and the pregnant woman should receive guidance on the preventive measures of infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.**\n\n【32】**In the serological diagnosis， specific IgM class antibodies are usually the first to be detected， whereas IgG antibodies appear later， with high titers during the acute phase and gradual reduction with persistence of low titers in the majority of cases， throughout the individual's life， both in the latency phase and in the chronic phase. IgM antibodies may be detectable for long periods， months to years after the acute phase of infection only by highly sensitive diagnostic methods. However， when this antibody is not detected by traditional techniques， or inability to observe IgG seroconversion during pregnancy， the expression of increased IgG titers in serial samples obtained at least three weeks apart， and in tests may suggest the diagnosis of the acute phase of T. gondii infection. Among the techniques for identification of recent T. gondii infection in pregnant women is the IgG and IgM capture ELISA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>.**\n\n【33】**In immunocompetent individuals， serological tests with IgG and IgM screening are sufficient for diagnosis because they are sensitive， specific and easy to perform 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>.**\n\n【34】**Serological screening has several advantages， such as the identification of seronegative pregnant women， which provides the opportunity for health professionals to act in the preventive education of gestational and congenital toxoplasmosis， since eating habits and personal hygiene practices are identified as factors associated with the risk of infection.

This method is considered excellent for the diagnosis of individual toxoplasmosis in the acute or chronic phase and also for epidemiological surveys， on account of its high sensitivity， indicating IgG antibodies in serum dilutions up to 1：16000 and specificity with little cross-reaction with other diseases， however， due to the need to manipulate the parasite in its infecting form， is not used as first option for routine diagnosis. Currently， for biological safety， the technique has been replaced by Indirect Immunofluorescence which also has lower cost and also detects IgG and IgM antibodies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u>. Besides the conventional Sabin-Feldman dye test are the gold stand for human toxoplasmosis， the conventional test using in vivo tachyzoites is the highest percent of toxoplasmosis detection in human serum when compared the results when using cell culture-derived T. gondii tachyzoites and when test indirect immunofluorescent antibody tests (IFAT) using in vivo and _in vitro tachyzoites._**\n\n【40】**The Microparticle Enzymelmmunoassay(MEIA)technique**\n\n【41】**The MEIA1Imakes quantitative determination of IgG and IgM anti-T. gondii antibodies in human serum or plasma. The immunoassay works on a random and continuous way in an Abbott company machine (AXSYM)， and for the IgM antibodies detection a rheumatoid factor neutralization solution is required to remove no specific antibodies avoiding false positive results. At the end of the reaction， the immune complex bound to the alkaline phosphatase-labeled conjugate reacts with the substrate to generate fluorescence of intensity proportional to the antibody concentration of the analyzed sample 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u>.**\n\n【42】**The Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELFA)**\n\n【43】**The ELFA is an automated test in the VIDAS system of the company Bio-Mérieux， used for IgG and IgM antibodies anti-T. gondii detection， through the immunoenzymatic method with a final fluorescence detection as the main reaction， named immunocapture， where the IgM antibodies present in the immunocomplexare labeled with alkaline phosphatase. This method， when compared to the ISAGA (Immunosorbent Agglutination Assay)， demonstrated agreement of 98.9%， sensitivity of 93.5% and specificity of 99.3%通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>.**\n\n【44】**The Indirect Fluorescent Antibody Test (IFAT)**\n\n【45】**IFAT is indicated for serological surveys and diagnosis ofacquired infection， because it can reach sensitivity up to 95.0%， however， false positive reactions with antinuclear factor (FAN) and false negative in the presence of low IgG titers can occurs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u>.**\n\n【46】**Enzimed Link Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA**\n\n【47】**The ELISA is an immunoenzymatic assay can reach up to 80.0%**\n\n【48】**of positivity and identifies early infection， with special importance for the diagnosis of congenital toxoplasmosis. The technique eliminates the interference of IgG and rheumatoid factor that are present in IFAT and can be standardized for detection of different classes of antibodies. When ELISA is used for IgG detection， a high positivity index has been observed in the Brazilian population， however， it is not possible to predict whether the infection is acute or chronic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[28\\]</u>.**\n\n【49】**In regions were the cost of the kits is expansive for screening proposes， some in-house ELISA for the detection of toxoplasma antibody demonstrated sensitivity and specificity as the commercial kit used in the study with a better cost-effective diagnostic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[29\\]</u>.To detect recent infection， the research is directed to the identification of IgA， which remain with high titers for at least 24 months and， because they do not cross the placenta and are not eliminated through breast milk， increase the importance to the use of this technique for the diagnosis of toxoplasmosis in the newborn 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[30\\]</u>.**\n\n【50】**The ELISA is available as commercialkits andrequires an Analyzer for the detection of specific IgG against T. gondii. Briefly， the serum-specific IgG against the parasite is linked to T. gondii coated antigen on the surface of reagent wells， forming an antigen-antibody complex The goat anti-human IgG labeled with horse radish peroxidase can be used as the secondary antibody to the antigen-antibody complex and after incubation and wash， as a chromogenic substrate is added to each well. The process should be stopped using a stop solution of 1N of H，SO . The Optical Density (OD) is recorded at 450 nm in the analyzer equipment. Calibrator and positive/negative control sera are used in each test set and the immune status ratio value of each sample is calculated by dividing OD of the sample by the cutoff value (cutoff is the mean OD of the calibrators x correction factor). Results were interpreted based on the manufacturer's recommendations as non-reactive， equivocal， or reactive 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[31\\]</u>.**\n\n【51】**The ELISA (for the qualitative determination of specific IgM antibodies anti T. gondii in dry blood samples collected on filter paper for in vitro diagnostic use only)， MEIA and ELFA have been used to improve the diagnosis of toxoplasmosis， which has demonstrated to be useful for the diagnosis of toxoplasmosis， as they show greater sensitivity and specificity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[32\\]</u>.**\n\n【52】**The lgG avidity test**\n\n【53】**IgG Avidity concerns on the observation that， in most patients， during acute T. gondii infection， IgG antibodies bind poorly to the antigen that is low avidity， whereas in the chronification of the infection， the bond strength increases and high avidity can develop. These antibodies with high avidity reflect the fact that the primary infection occurred in the distant past， estimated about more than three months， although this method cannot determine if the infection was recent， since eventually low titers can persist for long periods， such as after antiparasitic treatment， which can maintain low avidity for more than four months. Thus， the test is especially indicated for the first trimester of gestation in IgG and IgM reagent women for screening serology， when it was shown to be the best marker ofacute infection in patients with positive IgM 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u>.**\n\n【54】**The Immunobloting Test**\n\n【55】**Immunoblotting is performed by segregation of the protein antigens components through the polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis The proteins are transferred to a nitrocellulose paper and processed against the serum to be tested， which， in the presence of reaction， can be visualized. The test is used to determine antigens involved in the**\n\n【56】**different stages of infection，however， it is not a routine test 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>.**\n\n【57】**Conclusion**\n\n【58】**The serological screening for gestational toxoplasmosis is essential for the identification of susceptible pregnant women and fast detection of IgM seroconversion， with monitoring since the first trimester of pregnancy for the efficient prevention of congenital toxoplasmosis. Among the techniques for detection of anti-T. gondii antibodies in pregnant women， the sensitivity and specificity of antibodies， verified by MEIA， ELFA and ELISA techniques were higher when compared to IFAT detection. The recent infection in the first trimester of gestation should be confirmed by the avidity test.**\n\n【59】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【60】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**1\\. Bresciani KDS， Costa A.

Thus， it is foremost to detail situations and treatment procedures that reached a fortunate ending in terms of fertility preservation， gestation and delivery， more specifically after IVF.**\n\n【18】**_Copyright C 2022 Bos-Mikich A.

Her medical history**\n\n【21】**included two previous IVF attempts with autologous oocytes at another clinic. At that time her AMH was 0.7 ng\\\\ml and both treatment cycles were unsuccessful. In her first IVF attempt using donor oocytes， three high quality blastocysts were created. They were transferred in two consecutive cycles and did not result in gestation. Another donor-oocyte cycle followed， in which she received two grade 1 fresh blastocysts. Ten days after transfer， B-HCG test of 355mUI revealed an early gestation. The first ultrasound 26 days post-transfer showed one intrauterine gestational sac and another in the cervix， with both embryos measuring Crown Rump Length (CRL) of 0.5 cm and with active heartbeat . The patient received extensive information and counseling on her condition. After different treatment possibilities were discussed， we decided for a US-guided aspiration of the cervical gestational sac to best preserve the intrauterine gestation. The procedure was performed in a local hospital， under general anesthesia， on day 28 after embryo transfer. The cervical gestational sac was punctured using a 17 G single lumen oocyte aspiration needle under US-guidance. The treatment approach was successful in aspirating the contents of gestational sac. The patient was discharged home after 24 h observation. The histopathological examination confirmed embryonic remains and products ofconception from the aspirate. There was minimal bleeding during and after the procedure. On the second post-operative day， the patient presented with painless vaginal bleeding and was readmitted to the hospital. Trophoblastic tissues of the cervical ectopic conceptus were gently removed using a curette， under ultrasound guidance. Histopathology analysis confirmed the presence of chorionic villi in the gestational tissues. An ultrasound performed four days after the curettage revealed a viable intrauterine gestation. Some residual trophoblast tissue could still be detected into the cervical canal. Serial obstetric US six days later revealed the persistence of a heterogeneous， hypervascular mass measuring 2.7 mm x2.0 mm in the cervical canal near the internal os， corresponding to remains of the cervical gestation chorionic villi. Two weeks after the curettage， the cervical heterogeneous mass persisted and the intrauterine gestation followed normal development. Fortnightly US surveillance revealed a shortened uterine cervix， at 20weeks gestation. A cervical pessary was inserted at 22 weeks gestation to avoid preterm delivery. The patient was prescribed absolute bed rest until 37 weeks gestation， when labor contractions started. The pessary was removed and the cesarean section was schedule for the next day. The patient delivered a healthy baby girl weighting 2960 g and 46 cm.**\n\n【22】**Discussion**\n\n【23】**The present case report describes the successful treatment of a CHG after IVF， using US-guided aspiration of the ectopic gestational sac， followed by curettage， pessary placement due to cervical shortening and absolute rest. The frequency of different forms of heterotopic gestations is much higher after IVF， than after natural conception \\[2，3\\]. The clinical management of a CHG after IVF imposes specific challenges， considering that IVF pregnancies are highly desired and treatment for the termination of an ectopic gestation may also put in danger the viable intrauterine one.**\n\n【24】**To our best knowledge， this is the first description of a CHG detected at an early gestational age and treated with US-guided aspiration of gestational sac， cervical curettage and pessaryplacement. Although the curettage of the cervical canal was carefully performed， cervical shortening occurred and the placement of a pessary was Iiecessary to avoid preterm delivery.**\n\n【25】**The patient was 41 years of age and that was her first pregnancy， after four unsuccessful embryo transfers. The early detection of the extra uterine gestational sac at 6 weeks was paramount for the success in the CHG management， without pregnancy loss of the viable intrauterine gestation and fertility preservation. Majority ofthe CHGs are detected after vaginal bleeding， at more advanced gestational age. Thus， particularly after IVF cycles in which more than one embryo is transferred， the first US scan should include a careful evaluation ofthe cervical canal to exclude a heterotopic gestation at the cervix.**\n\n【26】**Different treatment options are described for the resolution of cervical heterotopic gestations. However， some of the treatments may result in undesired outcomes， such as infertility 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u> and intrauterine gestation loss 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Sonographically guided injection of various agents， into the ectopic gestational sac is effective， but it is also associated with persistent trophoblastic tissue 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. US-guided aspiration of cervical conceptus results in immediate termination of the ectopic gestation and there is a minor risk to cause harm to the intrauterine pregnancy.**\n\n【27】**In conclusion， considering that there is no consensus on the best treatment for CHG， it is important to report the factors that contributed to the successful resolution of the present case. Early detection and US-guided aspiration performed by an experienced operator， careful follow up of the remaining embryonic tissues， monitoring of cervical canal along the gestation to avoid preterm delivery due to a possible shortening of the cervix after curettage and placement of cervical pessary to ensure a full-term gestation represent a safe and effective management of CHG， with fertility preservation and favorable live birth outcomes for IVF patients.**\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**1\\.

According to the CDC， MDD affects more than 16.1 million American adults， or about 6.7% of the U.S. population age 18 and older in a given year. People suffering from MDD experience sadness， anhedonia， feelings of guilt， loss of energy， lack of concentration， loss in appetite， and psychomotor symptoms with possible suicidal ideation. It is a mental disease that unfortunately is still marginalized and ostracized in society today. We wrote this case report in hopes of raising awareness for depression and how it can affect individuals through secondary pathways.**\n\n【10】**Background**\n\n【11】**The role of the gut microbiome and its correlation with the production and dissemination of serotonin is still a relatively novel concept and one that has not been give its due amongst the scientific community. By showing how intrinsic the enteric nervous system and its maintenance is to promoting the production of various neurotransmitters involved in mental health diseases， we hope to make its role intricate to the understanding of mental illness and its potential treatment going forward. Gastric acid is involved in the primary function ofpreparing food for digestion and absorption by the intestine. Acid production is a central component of the stomach's contribution to digestion. Low gastric acid means higher susceptibility to food poisoning. Proton pump inhibitors use can cause diarrhea， enteric infections， and alter the gastrointestinal bacterial population by suppressing the gastric acid barrier leading to Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth (SIBO) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Normally when food leaves the stomach， it is acidic， and it leads to changes in pH and the pancreas and gallbladder release pancreatic juice and bile but if the stomach is not producing gastric acid， the gallbladder stops releasing bile. Prolonged PPI treatment produces bowel symptoms and symptoms such as cramps，hypotension and hypomagnesemia. The gallbladder has a very important role to play as the same nutrients that work in the gallbladder produce bile. Therefore， when a patient undergoes cholecystectomy， they develop an imbalance of neurotransmitters. Bile makes glycine and taurine and when it is depleted we cannot absorb calcium and this leads to hypocalcemia. Gallbladder bile rinses bacteria off the intestinal lining and the bacteria sticks to the wall increasing its bowel population leading to gastrointestinal symptoms such as malabsorption. This now increasing enteric bacterial populace leads to the formation of the \"leaky gut”bacteria causing inflammation and depression by increased intestinal permeability associated with an upload of Lipopolysaccharide(LPS) translocation which induces depression symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Hence gut microbiota and probiotics alter behavior and brain neurochemistry.**\n\n【12】**Case Presentation**\n\n【13】**In the case of our patient we had a 62-year-old female who had suffered from years of Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) as well as obesity class 1 with a BMI of 33. Our patient also complained of alternating bowel movements， abdominal cramps， dyspepsia， and years of H2receptor blockers and PPI use， as well as recurring cholecystitis and its affiliated symptoms. In March of 2017 our patient underwent a cholecystectomy after feeling months of gastric discomfort and dyspepsia and had finally had enough and could no longer further prolong her discomfort. Her ultrasound imaging and lab results pointed to a diagnosis of cholelithiasis with concurrent cholecystitis and she presented to the ER with intractable abdominal pain in the right upper quadrant. After initial stabilization with fluids， antibiotic treatment， and pain management， the patient in agreement with the consulting Gastrointestinal (GI) physician， decided to have a cholecystectomy**\n\n【14】**performed as she had been struggling with cholecystitis for years now. The procedure was done laparoscopically with no post operational complications. Three months later the patient presented with severe fatigue and weight gain and the recurrence of her pre-cholecystectomy symptoms. Additionally she did not feel like leaving her house， stopped socializing with her friends， felt a loss of energy and just seemed to stop caring about things. She was taken to her primary care physician， who referred her back to her GI doctor， and recommended a psychiatry consult. After standard imaging and pertinent lab results conducted by the GI physician failed to show any causal gastro intestinal factors that could be contributing to our patients state she visited a psychiatrist who，based on her presenting symptoms， diagnosed her with moderate depression secondary to the life stresses compounded by her recent surgery. The purpose of this report is to theorize how her enteric system undergoing chronic inflammation along with her cholecystectomy further exacerbated the inflammation and ultimately lead to her depression， highlighting the “Leaky Gut\"phenomenon.**\n\n【15】**Past medical history**\n\n【16】**Hyperlipidemia， Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease， Hypertension， Gastritis and Obesity**\n\n【17】**Past family history**\n\n【18】**Thepatient's father and motherboth had ahistory ofhypertension， gastroesophageal reflux disease and hyperlipidemia.

She was prescribed cholestyramine andesomeprazole to deal with any residual symptoms post-surgery. The patient was also scheduled to follow up with a dietician who prescribed a course of medical nutrition therapy individualized to our patient， and to follow up with her PCP to better manage her other chronic medical concerns and for medication reconciliation. The patient was advised to limit fat intake， increase dietary fiber gradually， and to avoid caffeinated and carbonated**\n\n【36】**drinks， chocolate， citrus products， spicy foods and to eat small meals. Due to a combination of factors including non-compliance with proposed dietary restrictions and inability to comply with her PCP's instructions pertaining to maintaining a healthier lifestyle， our patient experienced a return of pre-surgical symptoms as well as a sudden loss of interest in activities of daily living and was diagnosed with moderate depression by a psychiatrist. The psychiatrist after a careful review of the patient’s file suggested a thorough course of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)， a modified and realistic diet in consultation with a dietician， a workout routine and therapy sessions relating to the patient’s depression and eating habits. After two months of little improvement， the patient was started on Wellbutrin XL by her psychiatrist keeping the associated weight gain with other antidepressants in mind. The patient was instructed to take Wellbutrin XL 150 mg once daily in the morning for the first 4 days after which she would start on Wellbutrin XL 300 mg once daily.**\n\n【37】**Outcome and Follow-Up**\n\n【38】**Although our patient was given the appropriate post-op care， she initially did feet better but then began to deteriorate to her pre-surgery levels in terms of symptoms and in addition developed this new feeling of being depressed all the time which could have been related to her non-compliance with the physician ordered lifestyle recommendations in terms of her diet and other appropriate lifestyle changes. After a psychiatric consult and initial assessment， the patient tried to be more adherent to the recommendations and hoped her CBT sessions， therapy， and new dietary guidelines coupled with exercise would alleviate her concerns yet she continued to feel depressed and continued to have abdominal symptoms similar to what she felt before she had her cholecystectomy. The patient was then prescribed Wellbutrin XL and advised to continue her CBTand follow her dietary， exercise， and healthy lifestyle recommendations. After an intense and strict adherence to her diet/exercise/CBT routine together with the medication the patient experienced mild relief within five months post-surgery， her abdominal symptoms had disappeared， and she had started to lose weight and felt happier. The patient started to socialize more and took up a proactive approach to bettering her eating habits and other lifestyle choices. The Wellbutrin XL initially started at 150 mg once a day was increased to 300 mg once today after the initial four day period and then maintained as the patient did not feel like there was any need for an adjustment.**\n\n【39】**Discussion**\n\n【40】**A dysbiotic state leads to increased intestinal permeability and allows contents such as bacterial metabolites and molecules as well as bacteria themselves to leak through the submucosa and into the systemic circulation， a phenomenon aptly named leaky gut syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. In our digestive gut， sugar precursors E. coli &proteobacteria Bifidobacterial species act on the chorismite from where E. Coli， proteobacteria， B. subtilis， firm elves， mycobacterium and actinobacteria leads to formation of tryptophan which in the intestinal epithelial cells causes serotonin production in the gut. When the concentration of these bacteria is reduced due to antibiotics or PPI use， it decreases their quantity in the gut and the lack of bile post-cholecystectomy prevents the cleansing ofthe gut liningto get rid ofthe bad bacteria. This in part leads to less tryptophan and serotonin being produced in the enteric system，leading to depression. Tryptophan is synthesized from chorismite by members of several bacterial phyla including protein bacterium， actinobacterium & fircules. E. Coli can synthesize chorismite， a tryptophan precursor， which acts as a**\n\n【41】**branch point for microbial metabolic pathways consistent with this key role for bacteria. Antibiotics and PPI treatment alters tryptophan and undoes metabolism leading to less serotonin and melatonin in the brain. Tryptophan， tyrosine， and phenylalanine are made in the gut. When tryptophan is shuttled through the kynurenine pathway there is less tryptophan available to make serotonin and hence less serotonin in the gut available to be transported to the brain via the vagal nerve. Low bile，post-cholecystectomy， causes leaky gut as bile acid stimulates biliary lipid secretion due to their physical chemical properties. They can form mixed micelles together with biliary phospholipids which allows the solubilizing in bile of cholesterol and other lipophilic compounds. Mixed micelles also account for the emulsion of dietary fat and lip soluble vitamins in the gut， helping their absorption. Bile acids also facilitate intestinal calcium absorption. At the intestinal level， bile acids are known to modulate pancreatic enzyme secretion and cholecystokinin release. Moreover， they are potent anti-microbial agents that prevent bacterial over growth in the small bowel.**\n\n【42】**There is also a systemic IgM-mediated immune response in depression directed against LPS (which is part of the bacterial wall of gram negative bacteria) suggesting that bacterial translocation may play a role in the inflammatory and pathophysiology of clinical depression. Bacterial translocation indicates the presence of “leaky gut”or an increased permeability of the gut wall or loosening of the tight junction barrier 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Hyperactivity of the HPA axis is also one of the most reliable biological findings in patients suffering from major depression. Exposure to stress and cytokine responses may impair neuronal plasticity and stimulation of neurotransmission. Administration of exogenous IL-1b significantly enhances IL-1b levels in the Pre-frontal Cortex (PFC) and hippocampus and further increases Hypothalamic， Pituitary， and Adrenal (HPA) axis activity. Likewise， acute stress markedly increases IL-1b levels in the PFC， hippocampus and hypothalamus. Repeated stress sensitizes the HPA axis response to administration of exogenous IL-1b and possibly leads to depression 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.**\n\n【43】**The gut is composed of nerve tissues and uses neurotransmitters to communicate with the brain. The gut microbiota affects brain development and plasticity by secreting various neurotrophins and proteins， such as Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF)， synaptophysin and postsynaptic density 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Our brain has an**\n\n【44】**intimate connection with our gut via vagal nerve， which has hundreds of millions of nerves cells that regulate our digestive processes. This“second brain\" in the gut is spread out throughout the entire length of the gut. This second brain has many sensors in the enteric nervous system. The connection between depression and the gut is integrative from serotonin in the gut and how it relates to serotonin in the brain. Many patients with depression complain of constipation. This might be due to 95% of our serotonin being produced and stored in the gut via enterochromaffin cells which leads to modulation of mood， appetite， and well-being. The serotonin in the gut is synthesized from the food that we inject and the microbes that live in our gut that stimulate the production of serotonin. 60% of the production is due to the signals that come from the microbes in our gut. The serotonin cells are sandwiched between the cells that make the lining ofthe gut. The cells have vagal nerve association and the signal when the cell is activated goes to the brain via the vagal nerve from where it is delivered into the limbic system. This case study involves a patient with a long history of GERD treated with H2 antagonists， PPIs， and a host of other medications over the vears who underwent a cholecystectomy. This was followed by symptoms of depression that required treatment with an ant-depressant coupled with healthier lifestyle changes and dietary restrictions. This case study is being written to establish a possible connection between the gut microbiome and depression.**\n\n【45】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【46】通用结尾删除-1:<u>1\\.

During this exercise one of the legs is bend in the hip and knee joint in a sitting position so that the foot is placed on the medial aspects of the contralateral thigh. Next step is to bend the upper body above the thigh which leads to stretching of the hamstring muscles.**\n\n【18】**While performing this exercise the patient felt a sudden pain in her posterior thigh which resulted in the inability to extend her knee. The knee was locked in 70° flexion.**\n\n【19】**In the past she has been treated due to algophobia (fear of pain) and she was diagnosed with a somatic disorder.

The neurologist assumed an interference of her symptoms.**\n\n【24】**However an MRI-scan of the lumbar spine was obtained to rule out nerve root injury or compression， it also showed no significant pathologies. To prevent ongoing lack of motion of her knee joint it was extended under mild analgosedation. The knee showed free Range of Motion (ROM) under sedation. A knee brace was applied to keep the knee in an extended position. The following day she presented with a foot drop.**\n\n【25】**Once more we asked the neurologist for a detailed examination including a Nerve Conduction Study (NCS). The NCS showed pathologic signals indicating an acute sciatic nerve injury.**\n\n【26】**Mean while the patient mentioned that she had been diagnosed with a bony tumor in her proximal right femur.

She was sometimes comfortable with her situation and did not express any signs of severe pain， while few minutes later she was crying in bed due to unbearable pain not responding to any medication. As complicating factor she was diagnosed with a， bony tumor “possibly resulting from a fall a few years earlier. Unfortunately we did not get this information on admission. Retrospectively the patient reported periodic cramps and pain in her posterior thigh ongoing for several months. An MRI-scan of that area was performed externally shortly before was reported to show no signs of sciatic nerve compression at that time.**\n\n【42】**This might have been one of the reasons why we first did not focus on a possible nerve injury but rather on thelocked knee and the lower spine. Therefore the MRI of the pelvis and thigh was the last of three MRIs performed.**\n\n【43】**The symptoms were inconclusive and only the nerve conduction study objectified the injury of the sciatic nerve. Once it was diagnosed operation was performed immediately to decompress the nerve and to prevent long term symptoms11.**\n\n【44】**Conclusion**\n\n【45】**In cases with nerve palsy especially in young and healthy patients a thorough neurological examination and a nerve conduction study should be performed as soon as possible to differentiate between**\n\n【46】**central or peripheral causes. If a peripheral cause is assumed an MRI-scan ofthe nerve from its origin to its end is advisable not to over look a mechanical compression of the nerve in an uncommon location.**\n\n【47】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【48】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**1\\.

In the clinical picture one could find pronounced muscle contractures of upper arm and especially of leg muscles with sharp limitation of movement's range in large joints， together with “woody”firmness of the limb muscles with painless tumor-like swellings within the muscles of upper arms and thighs. EMG showed abnormal spontaneous electrical activity， very short motor unit potentials and increased incidence of polyphasic potentials. Muscle biopsy showed pronounced increase of the fibrous tissue around muscle fascicles in perimysium exclusively， this was combined with massive inflammatory cell infiltrates， and diffuse inflammatory cell infiltration with small foci inside endomysium. Increased variability in the fiber's size， as well as atrophy， focal degenerative changes and necrosis of some muscle fibres was also evident. Treatment with prednisolone in combination with cyclophosphane caused decrease of both nodule's size and firmness of muscles， accompanied by some increase of joint movement's range.**\n\n【15】**Keywords： Fibrosing myositis； Localized nodular myositis； Muscle and joints contractures； Inflammation； Polymyositis**\n\n【16】**Introduction**\n\n【17】**Localized nodular myositis is a very rare disorder， and its nosological place remains unclear. Some authors consider it to be a nosological entity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1-6\\]</u>； others think that it is a clinical and pathological variant of polymyositis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7-9\\]</u>. However some authors suppose that separating of localized nodular myositis from polymyositis and dermatomyositis syndromes will be possible only after careful clinical and pathological analysis of many more cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. We examined a patient in whom localized nodular myositis was one of the clinical signs of subacute fibrosing polymyositis.**\n\n【18】**Case Presentation**\n\n【19】**Patient F. (n2380) aged 64 was admitted to the clinic in January 1990. He complained of sharp difficulties in walking and the limitation of movements range in large joints of extremities because of severe muscle stiffness， and presence of the extremely firm painless masses within upper arm and thigh muscles with slight weakness of the arm muscles.**\n\n【20】**The disease has been developing since November， 1966 when the right ankle joint and the lower leg oedema developed. Severe pain in the region of talocrural joints and in gastrocnemius muscle during walking as well as hyperemia of the right lower leg soon followed. In December， 1988 the oedema widely spread to his right leg totally， and the lower leg and thigh muscles became large， firm and painful. In 3 months the same changes appeared in his left leg. In March， 1989 the patient walked with difficulties because of sharp stiffness of the leg muscles and pain in gastrocnemius muscles. There was no pain in leg joints.**\n\n【21】**_cited._**\n\n【22】**At that time the diagnosis of thrombophlebitis of lower limb’s veins was established. However the special treatment was ineffective and the diagnosis of thrombophlebitis was not confirmed. In May， 1989 despite of the decrease ofleg's oedema the muscles of the legs and pelvic girdle remained extremelyhard and stiff. The patient could walk on his toes only and with the help of a stick because**\n\n【23】**Figure 1： Large swelling within the right biceps brachii muscle and less swelling (after treatment) within left one with bilateral contractures of these muscles， seen more vividly at left.**\n\n【24】**Figure 2： Patient can \"sit\" only with straightened legs because of severe contractures of thigh and pelvic girdle muscles. Bilateral swellings within biceps brachii and vastus lateral is muscles， together with the right biceps brachii muscle contracture is seen as well.**\n\n【25】**Figure 3： Hyperextension of lowerlegs because of contractures of quadriceps and gluteus maximus muscles is present. Swellings within vastus lateral are muscles are seen more vividly at left.**\n\n【26】**of sharp limitation of range of movement in knee and ankle joints. In September， 1989 the volume of muscles of the upper arms enlarged， they became very firm and slightly painful， and limitation of range of movement in left elbow joint developed. Large， firm and slightly tender nodules appeared simultaneously in the upper arm and thigh muscles， and later such developed at the outer surface of right lower leg (this nodes disappeared themselves after some months). There was no muscle weakness and pain in the leg muscles and in joints. However the patient could walk using crutches only，because “his legs were hard and straight like sticks\". In December， 1989 the patient**\n\n【27】**was hospitalized in the surgical department with the diagnosis of the femur sarcoma. We could not perform MRI of nodules. However the signs of neoplasia were excluded by punctured biopsy of the nodules with thorough muscle histology， gastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy， X-ray pictures of chest， femur and joints. Blood and ESR were normal. Diagnosis of sarcoma was not confirmed. The granulomatous myositis (may be sarcoid nodular myositis) was suspected by neurologist (V. Kazakov).**\n\n【28】**Status**\n\n【29】**General condition was well. Body temperature was normal；pulse rate was 76， and the respiration rate 16. Blood pressure was 130/80mmHg. Hepar， spleen and peripheral lymphonodules were not enlarged. Slight oedema and hyper pigmentation of the distal parts of lower legs and ankles were present.**\n\n【30】**Slight periorbital oedema was present also. Slight weakness of the orbital part of orbicular is oculimuscles was revealed. Swallowing and phonation were not disturbed. No atrophy of the tongue. Moderate atrophy of left trapezius， supra-and infraspinatus， deltoid us and triceps brachii muscles， as well as the muscles of the forearms and dorsal interosseous hand muscles bilaterally were evident. The interscapular space is deepened， the inner edge ofleft scapula slightly recede from the thorax. The muscles， especially biceps brachii， muscles ofpelvic girdle， thighs and lower legspalpatory had “woody”consistency. Painless swellings， without clear borders or connection to skin with “woody”firmness were palpated within biceps brachii(10 cm x6 cm on the right and 15 cm x10 cm on the left) and vastus lateralis (6 cm × 4 cm bilaterally) muscles .**\n\n【31】**One could see severe contractures of biceps brachii muscles， more prominent at left， as well as gluteus maximus， quadriceps， posterior groups of the thighs and lower leg muscles. Both active and passive movements were limited in shoulder and elbow joints and were almost impossible in hip joint， knee and ankle joints. The patient couldn't abduct his arms to vertical position and to extent his forearms fully . He walked with difficulties on the straight legs using crutches only  and he could “sit only with his legs straightened and his trunk being thrown back\" . He couldn't stand up.**\n\n【32】**Muscle strength according to Daniels et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u> was as follows：Neck flexors， 3+； neck extensors， 5； sternocleidomastoide us， 3+； deltoid us， 4 at right and 3+ at left； biceps brachii， 4 at right and 3-at left； triceps brachii， 5 at right and 4 at left； extensors and flexors of the wrists and fingers， 4； dorsal and volar interossei， 3； gluteus maximus**\n\n【33】**Figure 4： The patient is walking with difficulty on his straight legs， and using crutches.

Biceps brachii and vastus lateralis muscle's needle EMG showed fibrillation potentials， positive sharp waves， increased insertion activity and pseudomyotonic discharges at rest. The mean duration of 20 motor unit action potentials (MUAPs) in m. biceps brachii was 3 msec-3.5 msec (normal 7.3 msec-8 msec) and mean amplitude was 250 uv -350 uv (normal 500 uv). The mean duration of the 20 MUAPs in the vastus lateral is was 3.5 msec(normal 7.4 msec-10 msec) and mean amplitude was 350 uv-400 uv(normal 900 uv). At maximum voluntary muscle contraction a low-amplitude interference pattern was evident in both muscles. 80% of action potentials were polyphasic and pseudopolyphasic.**\n\n【44】**Maximum conduction velocities of motor fibers of both ulnar and tibialis posterior nerves from elbow to wrist and from knee to the ankle were normal bilaterally.**\n\n【45】**Biopsy of m. peroneus longus from the region of a prior swelling， which disappeared itself some months ago， showed increase of connective tissue， inflammation and apparently spared muscle fascicles. Extreme increase of the fibrous tissue particularly in**\n\n【46】**perimysial space which seemed to wrap and compress the muscle fascicle was the most prominent histologic feature . Increase of the interstitial connective tissue was evident inside endomysial space as well， but to alesser extent. Massive inflammatory cell infiltrates were concentrated predominantly in the perimysium fibrous tissue between muscle fascicles as well as near and around perimysial blood vessels . Diffuse inflammatory cell infiltration was present in both perimysial and endomysial spaces with rare foci enclosing some muscle fibers， as well as in the region of damaged muscle fibers. Inflammatory cell infiltrates consisted of lymphocytes， histiocytes， and rarely plasma cells. Cross section of the diameter of the adjacent muscle fibres showed its increased variation with atrophy， segmental necrosis， degeneration， vesicular and internal nuclei， and decrease in longitudinal and transverse striation， increase in the number of sarcolemmal nuclei of some muscle fibers， and a small number of regenerating muscle fibers with prominent dark nucleoli . Productive inflammation with endothelial hyperplasia in perimysial blood vessels was not found.**\n\n【47】**Right lower leg skin biopsy performed at the site of muscle biopsy， showed the areas of some atrophy and oedema of epidermis together with collagenous fibresoedema with slight lymphocytic cell infiltration near and around blood vessels .**\n\n【48】**The patient was treated by oral prednisolone in the dose 1 mg/kg/day (80 mg/day) together with intramuscular cyclophosphane in the dose 2.5 mg/kg/day (200 mg/day). The size and firmness of nodules as well as firmness of muscles decreased after 1.5 months of treatment； muscle strength increased and the range of movements in joints increased a little too.**\n\n【49】**Discussion and Conclusion**\n\n【50】**Manyinvestigations distinguish a special rare variant of\"localized nodular myositis\"as a well-known form of inflammatory myopathies\\[1-6，12-15\\]. Some authors described this form under the name“focal myositis”as a new clinical and pathological entity representing benign pseudotumour of skeletal muscle 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. The disease manifested with rapidly growing painful swellings resembling muscle tumor or venous thrombophlebitis of lower legs in some cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. Authors considered that “focal myositis\"differed from polymyositis. Although this disease is characterized by myalgia and inflammation in a muscle， the pathological process always remains limited to one zone of a single muscle only， and the signs of systemic disease are not observed \\[12-14，18-24\\].Similar cases were describedbyotherauthors later \\[1，16，25-29\\]. In some works \\[1，30\\] it was shown that focal myositis differs from polymyositis greatly by immunological and clinical changes despite of similar morphological changes in muscles. The same opinion had some other authors \\[12-14，16，18，20，21，27，29\\]. However some authors opposed then osological entity of \"localized nodular myositis”among inflammatory myopathies \\[7，8，31\\]. These authors suggest that the clinical and pathological evidence indicates a close relationship between localized nodular myositis and polymyositis， as the former clinical picture often precedes and evolves into the latter. It is necessary to remark that such forms of polymyositis starting as focal processes were rarely described \\[7，8，32，31\\].**\n\n【51】**The clinical picture in our patient differs from that was reported earlier \\[7，8，31\\]. In these cases the polymyositis began with the development of painful nodules within limb muscles. Progressive muscle contractures were not found. In the early stage of the disease the restriction of movements was connected with pain full nodules，**\n\n【52】**but in the later stage with severe weakness and atrophy of muscles. Thus in these cases localized nodular myositis was a prelude of polymyositis.**\n\n【53】**In our patient the disease started with oedema， painfulness，“woody\"firmness and stiffness of lower leg and pelvic girdle muscles with rather fast， almost simultaneous， development of contractures of these muscles. Just pronounced contractures of muscles themselves， but not muscle weakness became the cause of sharp limitation of range of movements in our patient.**\n\n【54】**The clinical picture in our patient differs from the clinical picture in patients with “Stiff Person Syndrome”(SPS). In SPS patient the muscles of the arms and legs don't have “woody\"consistency during palpation， as well as painless nodules of “woody”firmness within some muscles of arms and legs， and pronounced contractures of muscles， which sharply limit patient's movements. Our patient as well had no fluctuating muscular rigidity with repeated episodes of painful muscle spasms which are characteristic for SPS. In SPS patients at initial stage of the disease as a rule there are no signs resembling thrombophlebitis with lower leg oedema and skin hyperemia that we observed in our patient. Unfortunately， in that period we could not determine anti-GAD antibodies that are characteristic of the SPS.**\n\n【55】**Bradley et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[33\\]</u> described three patients aged 23， 4 and 6 with extreme perimysial and less endomysial fibrosis that was a result of contractures of muscles which caused the limitation of movements more than muscle weakness. However in these patients the disease began in early childhood and they had no“woodynodules within the muscles， although muscles in Case 1 and Case 3 were extremely firm with “woody\"consistency during palpation.**\n\n【56】**Earlier Walton and Adams named such cases as \"chronic myositis fibrosa\" and suggested them to represent simply a chronic phase of polymyositis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[34\\]</u>. However in our patient the contractures of muscles of “woody\"firmness developed at the beginning of the disease， and proceeded during 4-6 months， so according to Hudgson our case can be attributed to subacute polymyositis， and not chronic one 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>.**\n\n【57】**In our patient the picture of morphological changes in the muscle somehow resembled the changes which were observed by some authors \\[1，7，9\\]. However coarse degenerative changes of muscle fibers with their replacement by fibrous connective tissue and fat， as it was reported in the cases of the authors cited were not found in our case. The most prominent feature in our case was the extreme increase of connective tissue with massive lympho-histiocytic infiltrates predominantly in perimysial space， and scattered atrophy and degenerative changes of some muscle fibers. All slides of this muscle biopsy specimen were discussed in 1990 at the Round table consultation service of selected cases (Head Prof. Dr. Schroder J.M.) at the VII International Congress on Neuromuscular Diseases in Munchen， Germany.**\n\n【58】**Histological diagnosis was polymyositis. Activity of the serum enzymes was normal in our patient. It was possibly connected with the absence of rough damage of muscle fibers as well as by extreme increase of connective tissue and a long standing disease \\[2，35\\]. At EMG one could see changes resembling polymyositis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.**\n\n【59】**However， the clinical picture of the disease in our patient differs greatly from “pure”polymyositis. He had painless muscles of“woody”firmness and intramuscular “woody”swellings resembling sarcoma， which developed after the pronounced muscle contractures**\n\n【60】**The latter caused sharp limitation of movements in large joints of extremities practically through the whole duration of the disease. Extreme perimysial fibrosis without coarse damage of muscle fibres， which usually cause severe muscle contractures， and without visible muscle weakness and atrophy characterized our case.**\n\n【61】**Thus in our case at the basis of peculiarities of clinical picture， histological muscle changes， EMG results， and some improvement from prednisolone and cyclophosphane treatment we suppose that the localized nodular myositis was one of clinical signs of subacute fibrosing polymyositis.**\n\n【62】**Sarcoid nodular myositis was excluded because at muscle biopsy no typical sarcoid histological changes including necrotic zones and interstitial granulomas with multinucleated giant cells and epithelioid cells were found 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[36-38\\]</u>. Also chest X-ray picture showed no enlarged lymph nodules. Absence of the calcifications， osteoid and cartilage formations on radiographs of the arm and leg muscles allowed to exclude myositis ossificans progressive \\[39，40\\]. It is quite possible that localized nodular myositis in some cases is a clinical and pathological and even immunological entity \\[1，13，14，19-24，27，29，41，\\]，but in other rare cases it may be the first manifestation of polymyositis or one of the clinical signs of subacute fibrosing polymyositis as we observed in our case 7，17，18，31，32.**\n\n【63】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【64】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**1\\.

These editorial highlights the ongoing efforts to preserve and breed endangered species， focusing on captive breeding programs， artificial insemination， embryo transfer， and their role in conservation. Captive breeding programs have proven crucial in recovering declining populations and providing genetic reserves for future reintroduction into the wild. Additionally，advanced reproductive techniques such as artificial insemination and embryo transfer have enhanced reproduction rates and genetic diversity. However， it is important to acknowledge that these approaches should be complemented by in-situ conservation efforts aimed at protecting natural habitats and addressing underlying causes of population decline. Successful reintroduction of captive-bred animals requires ongoing research， careful monitoring， and collaboration among scientists， conservationists， and local communities. Public awareness and education play a pivotal role in promoting conservation and garnering support. Byadopting an integrated and collaborative approach， we can strive for a future where endangered species thrive in harmony with their natural environments，ensuring the preservation of biodiversity for generations to come.**\n\n【13】**Preserving biodiversity has become an increasingly urgent concern as the world faces a rising rate of species extinction. To protect and save endangered animals from disappearing forever， scientists and conservationists have been making significant efforts in the field of reproduction and conservation of endangered species. One of the most prominent approaches is the establishment of captive breeding programs， also known as ex-situ breeding programs. These programs have played a crucial role in attempting to recover declining populations and preserve endangered species from extinction. By maintaining animals in controlled environments such as zoos and specialized breeding centers， these programs can ensure the survival of species and provide a genetic reservoir for future reintroduction efforts into the wild. Furthermore， technological advancements have enabled the use of assisted reproductive techniques such as artificial insemination and embryo transfer to enhance reproduction rates and the reproductive success of endangered species. Artificial insemination allows for the collection of sperm from endangered males， which can be used to fertilize females that would otherwise be unable to reproduce naturally. Embryo transfer， on the other hand， enables the transportation of healthy embryos from endangered species to recipient females， thereby increasing the chances of successful reproduction. These advanced reproductive techniques not only help overcome reproductive challenges faced by endangered species but also contribute to genetic diversity and the long-term survival of these populations. By preserving genetic variability， these approaches assist in the adaptation and resilience of species in the face of environmental threats and climate change. However， it is important to emphasize that assisted reproduction and captive breeding programs should not be considered definitive solutions for biodiversity preservation. These strategies should complement in-situ conservation efforts， which aim to protect natural habitats and address the underlying causes of declining wild populations. The reintroduction of captive-bred animals to their natural habitats is a crucial step towards the long-term success of conservation. After all， the ultimate goal is to ensure that species can thrive and reproduce in their natural environments， contributing to the health of ecosystems as a whole. However，the challenges faced in reintroducing captive-bred animals should not be underestimated. Adaptation to new environments， competition with other species，and overcoming obstacles such as**\n\n【14】**illegal hunting and habitat destruction are just some of the challenges reintroduced species may encounter. It is crucial， therefore， that reproductive and conservation programs be supported by ongoing scientific research， careful monitoring， and collaboration among scientists， conservationists， and local communities. Understanding the ecological requirements of species and implementing adequate protection measures in their natural habitats are essential elements for successful reintroduction. Additionally， public awareness and education play a vital role in promoting conservation and adopting behaviors that support wildlife preservation. By sharing the efforts of reproduction and conservation， along with the ecological and cultural significance of endangered species， we can generate interest and support from society at large. The reproduction and conservation of endangered species require a collective and comprehensive effort that**\n\n【15】**includes not only actions directed at captive populations but also the protection of natural habitats， combating illegal hunting， controlling environmental degradation， and raising public awareness. Only through an integrated and collaborative approach can we effectively preserve endangered species and ensure the health and resilience of the ecosystems they inhabit. In summary， current efforts in the reproduction and conservation of endangered species， including captive breeding programs， assisted reproductive techniques， and careful reintroduction， play a vital role in biodiversity preservation. By combining scientific knowledge， active conservationism， and public engagement， we can work towards a future where threatened species can thrive and coexist harmoniously with their natural environments. It is our duty to protect and ensure the survival of species for future generations，ensuring a richer and more diverse world for all.**", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

Mixed-Dust Pneumoconiosis (MDP) is rarely reported， although exposure to a multitude of different inorganic components is common in environmental and occupational settings and it ought to be considered as a differential diagnosis.**\n\n【19】**Case Presentation**\n\n【20】**We describe a 52-year-old man， former smoker (5 pack year)， who presented to a pulmonology appointment to evaluate possible COVID-19pneumonia sequela. He had a past medical history of hypertension， dyslipidemia and acute myocardial infarction in 2008. His daily medication included bisoprolol， rosuvastatine， enalapril and hydrochlorothiazide. He lived in an urban area， with no exposure to biomass burning and had no pets. He worked as stonemason， carving marble for 38years and had also worked with wood and upholstery. He reported a 12-month history of dyspnea on exertion， worsened after SARS-CoV-2 infection (3 months earlier). Chest High Resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT) at the time of infection revealed diffuse Ground Grass Opacities(GGOs)， subpleural reticulation and traction bronchiectasis with upper lobe predominance， and also mediastinal lymph nodes with “eggshell” calcification. Four months after the infection chest HRCT was repeated， which showed abnormalities' stability ?**\n\n【21】**On first examination， he had good peripheral saturations and normal breath sounds at chest**\n\n【22】**A**\n\n【23】**Figure 1： A) HRCT with GGOs， subpleural reticulation and traction bronchiectasis with upper lobe predominance； B) mediastinal lymph nodes with \"eggshell\"calcification.**\n\n【24】**Figure 2： Pathological findings of lung cryabiopsy.

There was no stigma of autoimmune diseases， but digital clubbing was present.**\n\n【26】**Blood workup showed no immunological changes. Pulmonary function test revealed moderate restrictive pattern (TLC 3.33 L； 56%， FVC 2.29 L； 58% e FEV1 2.01L；64%) and reduced diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide (3.78； 44%)； transthoracic echocardiogram was normal. Bronchoalveolar Lavage (BAL) showed no lymphocytosis， but lightly birefringent particles were seen under polarized light**\n\n【27】**Given his exposure history， egg-shell calcification of mediastinal lymph nodes and lightly birefringent particles on BAL， differential diagnosis of COVID-19pneumonia sequela was set aside and silicosis was the main differential diagnosis. However， the HRCT pattern was not consistent with silicosis. In face of a reasonable doubt pending on the definitive diagnosis， it was decided in multidisciplinary discussion LOperform transbronchiaalllung cryobiopsy， which histology showed interstitial focal fibrosis with accumulations of dust-laden macrophages and a significant number of lightly birefringent particles seen under polarized light； no silicotic nodules were observed (Figure2). These morphologic aspects were consistent with silica and other less fibrogenic dust exposure， such as iron and silicates (mixed dust fibrosis). In light with these findings and exposure history， MDP diagnosis was made.**\n\n【28】**Literature Revie w**\n\n【29】**MDP is associated with typical occupations such as metal miners， quarry， foundry， pottery and ceramics workers， as well as stonemasons. However，MDP has also been reported in hand grinding maize using large stones 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u> and secondary biomass fuel burning 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Some studies have also reported overexposure to respirable quartz in farming 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>， which can be responsible for MDP and other types of pneumoconiosis in farmers with no other exposure， reinforcing the importance of a thorough anamnesis and exposure history.**\n\n【30】**Symptoms are nonspecific， such as productive cough and dyspnea， which could be related to pneumoconiosis， smoking or associated emphysema. Pulmonary function tests can be normal or show an obstructive， restrictive or mixed pattern 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.**\n\n【31】**Chest radiographs may appear normal， have pure nodular opacities (which tend to have ill-defined contours)， show early reticulation and irregular opacities only or show a pattern with progressive massive fibrosis. Chest HRCT findings include reticular， reticulonodular or nodular opacities in cases with MDP or may be normal in some cases with macular pneumoconiosis (considered an early stage of MDP). It may also show hilar lymphadenopathy and calcification in the late stages 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.**\n\n【32】**Histologically， MDP is defined as interstitial accumulations of dust-laden macrophages and Mixed Dust Fibrosis lesions (MDF)， with or without silicotic nodules or massive fibrosis. If silicotic nodules are present，then MDFlesions should outnumber the former. In the absence of exposure history， mineralogic analyses showing a mixture of crystalline silica and silicates would support the diagnosis通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.**\n\n【33】**Although uncomplicated MDP is typically a benign disease， cases with fatal extensive diffuse interstitial fibrosis causing honeycombing may be encountered. It should be noted that some patients with typical MDF lesions have superimposed diffuse interstitial fibrosis indistinguishable from UIP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. It is of utmost importance that causative respirable dust exposure be identified，as the most important step is to remove the patient from further exposure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.**\n\n【34】**Conclusion**\n\n【35】**Clinical diagnosis of MDP requires the exclusion of other well defined pneumoconiosis as well as non-exposure-related interstitial pulmonary disorders such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis or sarcoidosis. However， the diagnosis of MDP may well present as a**\n\n【36】**challenge， and misdiagnosis is frequent because details of causative previous exposures may not be available and the clinical findings may vary considerably. Presently， as we are faced with several COVID-19pneumonia patients’ revaluations， it should be kept in mind that environmental and occupational diseases cannot be overlooked. One cannot forget a detailed clinical and exposure-related history， so it could be combined with specific imagological， analytical and histopathologic investigations in order to reach the correct diagnosis， which is crucial for prognosis definition， appropriate preventive measures in the workplace and also for compensation issues.**\n\n【37】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【38】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**1\\.

We present a woman with CH and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus(SLE)， whose Fertility Preservation (FP) in pregnancy-prohibitedphase may have contributed to BP control and a livebirth. A 33-vear-old woman with CH and SLE conceived twins in SLE remission， without BP control. Both SLE flare and superimposed preeclampsia occurred， and the pregnancy was terminated because of renal dysfunction at 20 weeks. She presented with depression and decreased medical adherence， resulting in prolonged hypertension and pregnancy prohibition. FP was started 40 weeks after stillbirth， and a blastocyst was preserved at the fifth oocyte retrieval. Her medical adherence improved， and her BP became 120-130/90-100 mmHg. After thawed embryo transfer， she conceived a singleton pregnancy. Her BP was 120-130/70-90 mmHg during this pregnancy. At 32 weeks， she delivered a baby due to abnormal findings in Cardiotocogram. In this case， FP may have contributed to BP control and a livebirth. To our knowledge， this is the first report of FP in a pregnancy-prohibited woman with CH or SLE.**\n\n【17】**Keywords： Autoimmune disease； Fertility preservation； Hypertension； Pregnancy； Systemic lupus erythematosus**\n\n【18】**Introduction**\n\n【19】**Pregnancy with Chronic Hypertension (CH) is a high-risk pregnancy because the incidence of Superimposed Preeclampsia (SPE)， preterm birth， Fetal Growth Restriction (FGR)， fetal/neonatal death， maternal death， and maternal cardiovascular morbidities such as heart failure， renal failure， stroke， and pulmonary edema are 3 to 10 times more frequent in patients with CH than in normotensive women 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. It is well accepted that Blood Pressure (BP) control， before conception or since early pregnancy， is important. However， the target BP is controversial. The International Society for the Study of Hypertension in Pregnancy (ISSHP) states that the target BP should be in the range of 110-140/80-85 mmHg 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>， and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence(NICE) recommends a target BP of 135/85 mmHg 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. In contrast， in 2019， the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommended that anti-hypertensive therapy for CH should be started when pregnant women have a BP≥160/110 mmHg， and that the target BP should be 120-159/80-109 mmHg 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. This recommendation is based on the finding that strict control of diastolic BP did not improve maternal/fetal outcomes. In April 2022，however，ACOG revised the target BP to 140/90 mmHg 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>， based on the results of the Chronic Hypertension and Pregnancy study.**\n\n【20】**Pregnancy with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is also a high-risk pregnancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6-8\\]</u>. A study including patients with active and inactive disease at conception， showed a significantly higher incidence of hypertension， renal disease， preeclampsia， preterm delivery， cesarean delivery， FGR， and neonatal death in women with SLE than in women without SLE 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. For women with SLE， conception is recommended after at least 6 months disease remission， which is based on reports showing that pregnancy loss is significantly higher in women who had active SLE during 6 months**\n\n【21】**before conception than in those who were in remission for >6 months before conception \\[6，7，9\\]. In Japan， the criteria for pregnancy in women with autoimmune disease are based on renal function. The estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) should be ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m. No such criteria for BP exist 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.**\n\n【22】**Here we present the case of a woman with CH and SLE who had a healthy baby after BP was controlled before pregnancy. It was suggested that embryo preservation during pregnancy-prohibited period may have contributed to improvement in depression and medical adherence， resulting in BP control and a livebirth. To our knowledge， this is the first report on the embryo preservation in pregnancy-prohibited woman with CH or SLE.**\n\n【23】**Case Presentation**\n\n【24】**A 21-year-old woman presented to our hospital with cheek erythema， oral ulcers， finger arthralgia， and thrombocytopenia； she was subsequently diagnosed with SLE at the department of rheumatology in our hospital. Her BP was normal， and her medical history was uneventful. An evaluation of the patient’s family history showed that her mother had hepatic cancer， but there was no family history of autoimmune diseases， hypertension， thrombosis， or sudden death. The patient showed positive results in autoantibody tests for anti-DNA， anti-RNP， anti-Smith， anti-SSA， anti-SSB， and Lupus Anticoagulant (LA)， and negative results for anti-cardiolipin and anti-B2 Glycoprotein I (B2-GPI). SLE flares were observed twice during the following 2 years. During the second flare， her BP was130/80 mmHg. Subsequently， she was in remission and was taking 7mg/day Prednisolone (PSL) and 4 mg/day Tacrolimus (TAC). She got married at the age of 30 years， and her disease remained in remission. She conceived spontaneously at 31 years of age， but the pregnancy resulted in a miscarriage at 7 weeks. LA and anti-B2-GPI tests were**\n\n【25】**repeated 8 weeks after the miscarriage， but both showed negative results.**\n\n【26】**The patient subsequently visited a private fertility clinic， and her BP that time was 137/89 mmHg. She conceived dichorionic diamniotictwins after intrauterine insemination in a natural ovulatory cycle at 33 years of age. At 5 weeks of gestation， her BP was 138/102mmHg. At 9 weeks， she presented with thrombocytopenia and skin erythema， and an SLE flare was diagnosed. Her PSL and TAC doses were augmented， and treatment with Hydroxychloroquine sulfate(HCQ) was initiated . At 13 weeks， she was referred to our Obstetrics and Gynecology (OBGY) department， a tertiary perinatal care center， and was subsequently managed in cooperation with the rheumatology department at our institute. At 13 weeks， LA test again showed negative result. Hypertension (150/110 mmHg) was observed at 13 weeks， and methyldopa， labetalol， and amlodipine were administered； however， her BP remained around 150/90mmHg. She was admitted at 17 weeks because thrombocytopenia had not improved. Although intensive immunosuppression therapy， including intravenous immunoglobulin， augmentation of PSL， and initiation of Cyclosporin A (CyA) and azathioprine， was administered for the SLE flare，the thrombocytopenia did not improve. At 20 weeks， rapid progression of renal dysfunction was observed， which was indicated by changes in the serum creatinine levels (from 0.86 mg/dL to 1.19 mg/dL) and the eGFR (from 62.0 mL/min/1.73 m² to 43.4mL/min/1.73 m). Her serum uric acid levels were also elevated (6.8 mg/dL). Because the patient's thrombocytopenia and renal dysfunction did not improve despite intensive immunosuppressive therapy， we concluded that SPE was complicated with the SLE flare， although the gestational age was only 20 weeks. Considering the gestational age， we recommended termination of pregnancy for maternal safety. After obtaining informed consent， therapeutic termination was performed**\n\n【27】**Table 1： Summary of embryo preservation trials.**\n\n| **Trial**  | **Weeks afterthe still birth**  | **Stimulation**  | **Number of** **QQcytesretrieved**  | **Number ofpreservedtrophoblasts**  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **1s1**  | **40**  | **Short**  | **4**  | **0**  |\n| **2d**  | **56**  | **CC**  | **1**  | **0**  |\n| **3d**  | **64**  | **CC**  | **2**  | **0**  |\n| **41h**  | **68**  | **CC**  | **2**  | **0**  |\n| **51h**  | **72**  | **CC**  | **2**  | **1**  |\n\n【29】CC： Clomiphene Citrate\n\n【30】**at 20+2 weeks using a cesarean section， and two babies (292 gand 272g) were delivered.**\n\n【31】**Afterthestillbirth，immunosuppression therapy was administered more intensively， including steroid pulse therapy (intravenous methylprednisolone， 1，000 mg/day for 3 days)， initiation of mycophenolate mofetil (which is contraindicated during pregnancy)， and augmentation of CyA. As a result， her serum creatinine levels decreased， and platelet counts increased. Although her hypertension was prolonged， she was discharged 28 days after stillbirth.**\n\n【32】**Following the discharge， SLE was treated with PSL， CyA， HCQ， and belimumab， and renal function test results and platelet counts were controlled within normal ranges . However， her BP remained around 150-160/100-110 mmHg； therefore， pregnancy was not permitted. She became depressed soon after the stillbirth； at approximately 20 weeks after stillbirth，her depression became severe， and she stopped taking prescribed medicines. She contemplated suicide， but it was avoided with the help of a psychiatrist.**\n\n【33】**As we could not predict when pregnancy would be permitted， a prenatal team of doctors suggested embryo preservation to the fertility treatment team. We proposed that the couple undergo**\n\n【34】**embryo preservation 36 weeks after the stillbirth to preserve fertility. The couple chose to proceed with the embryo preservation. Embryo preservation started 40 weeks after the stillbirth . The stimulation methods and outcomes are shown in Table 1. The first trial used the “short”protocol， and the following trials used administration of Clomiphene Citrate (CC). A blastocyst with good morphology was preserved for the first time at the fifth trial 72weeks after the stillbirth. Following the embryo preservation trials， the patient’s depression had ameliorated， and her adherence of medicines improved. Her BP was 120-130/90-100 mmHg， with the systolic BP falling into the normal range. SLE was in remission， and LA was negative once again. Rheumatology and OBGY doctors had a conference and permitted her pregnancy 76 weeks after the stillbirth.**\n\n【35】**After obtaining informed consent from the couple regarding the risks of pregnancy that included a possibility of twin pregnancy(2% in single blastocyst transfer)， an SLE flare， preterm birth which could result in a neonatal mortality/morbidity， and the risk of mortality/morbidity to the patient， a thawed Embryo Transfer (ET) was performed in a spontaneous ovulatory cycle 80 weeks after the stillbirth. The patient developed a singleton pregnancy. In this pregnancy， her BP was maintained around 120-130/70-90 mmHg. However， serum creatinine was elevated to 0.97 mg/mL at 32+4weeks， and she was subsequently admitted. At 32+5 weeks， elevated serum creatinine (1.06 mg/dL)， decreased eGFR (53 mL/min/1.73m’)， and abnormal findings on Cardiotocogram (loss of variability) were observed； therefore， an emergency cesarean was performed. A 1，580 g baby was delivered with a 5-min Apgar score of 9. After delivery，the serum creatinine levels became normal. Both the mother and baby were in good health 1 year after the delivery.**\n\n【36】**Discussion**\n\n【37】**We presented the case of a woman with CH and SLE whose first**\n\n【38】**pregnancy resulted in a miscarriage， the second pregnancy (without pre-conceptional BP control) resulted in therapeutic termination at20 weeks， and the third pregnancy (with pre-conceptional BP control) resulted in a livebirth.**\n\n【39】**First， we estimated that the patient's hypertension was drug-induced due to administration of PSL and TAC for approximately10 vears.**\n\n【40】**Second， we diagnosed an SLE flare and SPE during the second pregnancy. In the management of pregnancy in patients with SLE， differential diagnosis of SLE flares and Hypertensive Disorders of Pregnancy (HDP) is important because the treatment for an SLE flare is immunosuppression， while the final treatment for HDP is termination of pregnancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. However， a differential diagnosis may be challenging for clinicians because both conditions present with proteinuria， hypertension， and lower-extremity edema， and may also have systemic effects 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. In this case， we concluded that both SLE flare and SPE were present because immunosuppressive therapy did not control the disease； therefore，therapeutic termination at 20 weeks was done. A twin pregnancy is a strong possible cause of SPE at an early gestational age. Postpartum improvement of renal dysfunction and thrombocytopenia supports this diagnosis.**\n\n【41】**Third，wediscussedthesafetyofAssistedReproductiveTechnology(ART) in women with SLE. The most serious complication associated with ovarian stimulation and ovarian hyper stimulation syndrome is thrombosis \\[11，12\\]. To avoid thrombosis， selection of appropriate ovarian stimulation， a \"freeze all” strategy， and appropriate heparin administration should be performed， especially for those with Anti-Phospholipid Antibodies (APAs) \\[11，12\\]. To avoid thrombosis in thawed ET， a natural ovulatory cycle is the first choice. If hormone replacement is necessary， non-oral natural estradiol andprogesterone should be administrated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Furthermore， single ET should be performed to avoid the risks associated with multifetal pregnancy通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. ART is not indicated in the women with acute flare， poorly controlled arterial hypertension， pulmonary hypertension， advanced renal disease， severe valvular or heart diseases， or major previous thrombotic events 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. In this case， we considered that the patient had alow risk ofthrombosis，because her anti-mullerian hormone was low (0.84 ng/mL)， her APAs were negative， and she had no previous episode of thrombosis. In addition， because her platelet count was>10×104 /uL， the risk ofovarian bleeding with Oocyte Retrieval (OR) was low. Therefore， we concluded that ovarian stimulation and OR were acceptable in this case.**\n\n【42】**Fourth， we discussed the validity of ET in this case as the patient’s BP was 120-130/90-100 mmHg with a relatively high diastolic BP. As mentioned in the introduction， the target BP is controversial in pregnancy in women with CH， with ISSHP，NICE，andACOG having different guidelines. In a retrospective analysis of 215 women with CH， Ueda et al. showed that systolic BP<130 mmHg within 14 weeks of gestation reduced the risk of developing early-onset SPE 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. We(Kurashiki Central Hospital) participated in this study and recognized the importance of systolic BP control. In this case ET was performed in 2020 when the international guidelines for target diastolic BP ranged from 85 mmHg to 110 mmHg. Therefore， we believed ET to be acceptable in this case.**\n\n【43】**Lastly， we discussed Fertility Preservation (FP) in women with SLE， who are prohibited from getting pregnant. It is well accepted that SLE itself is not a cause of infertility \\[6，7，11，12\\]. However，**\n\n【44】**administration of Cyclophosphamide (CPA) decreases ovarian reserve， resulting in decreased fertility \\[6，7，11，12\\]. Additionally， when a woman with SLE is advised not to conceive for a long period， her fertility decreases because of a decreased ovarian reserve and oocyte ageing 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. It is demonstrated that clinicians should give information on FP，including cryopreservation of embryos/oocytes/ovarian tissue， to the female patients with SLE who are going to be administrated with CPA， in European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology(ESHRE) guidelines 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u> and American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) guidelines 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. Accordingly， FP counseling before CPA administration is a common practice at present. In Japan， there have been reports on this issue since 2015. However， FP counseling for women with SLE who are advised not to conceive for a long period is not yet a common practice； FP counseling for these women is not present in the ESHRE or ASRM guidelines. A review by Italian doctors showed that FP should be considered for women who are advised not to conceive for a long period 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>， suggesting that FP had been practical in Italy or European nations in these cases. However， we could not find such reports in English. We believe that FP for women prohibited from pregnancy is not yet a common practice because it is undetermined whether ART in women with SLE during a pregnancy-prohibited period is safe and effective. Additionally， we could not find the reports on FP in women with CH.**\n\n【45】**In conclusion， we present a woman with CH and SLE， in whom post-stillbirth depression and medical adherence improved during embryo preservation， resulting in systolic BP control and a livebirth. We reported this case because it provides in formation on FP in women with CH or SLE during pregnancy-prohibited period. However， the safety and effectiveness on this approach is undetermined，and careful consideration is necessary on a case-by-case basis.**\n\n【46】**Ethical Consideration**\n\n【47】**We have obtained the written informed consent from the patient for the publication of this report. The ethical committee of Kurashiki Central Hospital approved this report.**\n\n【48】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【49】通用结尾删除-1:<u>1\\. Harper LM， Tita A， Karumanchi SA.

The most prevalent tumors occurring in pregnant females are malignant melanoma(2.8/1000)， followed by carcinoma of the cervix (1/2200) and breast (1/3000). A review of the literature didn't find any convincing evidence that pregnancy has a deleterious impact on the incidence of clinical profile of malignancy as compared to non-pregnant women of reproductive age， except in the case of malignant melanoma.**\n\n【12】**Urological malignancy in pregnancy is rare and poses a diagnostic and treatment challenge. Here， we report a case of non-muscle invasive bladder carcinoma in the pregnant female， successfully managed by TURBT (Transurethral Resection of Bladder Tumor)，resulting in good maternal and fetal outcomes.**\n\n【13】**Keywords： TURBT； Non-muscle invasive bladder cancer； Pregnancy**\n\n【14】**Introduction**\n\n【15】**Urological malignancies are very uncommon in pregnancy， with an overall incidence ofaround1/1000 pregnancies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1-3\\]</u>. Though rare， they can impose particular problems in diagnosis and management during pregnancy as fetal wellbeing has to be kept in mind too.**\n\n【16】**Case Presentation**\n\n【17】**A 25-year-old pregnant woman in the 36th week of gestation was presented to the hospital owing to painless gross intermittent hematuria with clots for the last four months. She denied any history suggestive ofurinary tract infections， renal calculus， or other genitourinary complaints. Herprenatal course had been otherwise uneventful， and she had no history of such urological complaints. She was a nonsmoker， nonalcoholic， and had no history of occupational or chemical exposure. On examination， the patient was pallor， normotensive， afebrile， and had stable vitals and voiding of wine-colored urine with blood clots. The fetus was active and the fetal heart sounds were strong. There was no evidence of vaginal bleeding. Her complete blood count was within normal limits except for normocytic normochromic anemia (Hemoglobin 9.2 gm/dl). Blood urea nitrogen，serum creatinine， viral markers， and coagulation survey were non-contributory. Her urine analysis showed numerous red blood cells with no casts or crystals and her urine culture was negative. Ultrasound examination revealed mild pregnancy-related hydronephrosis without any calculus and single space-occupying， papillarylesion of size approximately 2 cm x2 cm with high vascularity was noted at the right anterior wall of the bladder， suggestive of bladder tumor. The kidneys were normal in appearance. A single live fetus without any uterine abnormalities was noted.**\n\n【18】**She was being followed conservatively but in meantime， she started to have severe gross hematuria with clots retention leading to a fall in hemoglobin (6.2 gm/dl). She was managed by cystoscopy and clots evacuation followed by two units of blood transfusion. On cystoscopy， a growth of 2 cm x2 cm in size was noted at the anterior bladder wall that was bleeding profusely.**\n\n【19】**A decision was taken to fulgurate and bipolar Transurethral Resection of Bladder Tumor(TURBT) in the same sitting under spinal anesthesia. The procedure was uneventful. On 2nd postoperative day， severe fetal distress was noted， the cause of which was unknown. A decision of Lower Section Cesarean Section (LSCS) was taken by a treating obstetrician and was performed.**\n\n【20】**The postoperative periods were uneventful， with mother and baby both being healthy and recovering. The patient and the baby were discharged on postoperative day 8.**\n\n【21】**The TURBT tissue specimen sent for histopathological evaluation revealed transitional cell carcinoma of the urinary bladder of TaG 1 grade. Follow-up cystoscopy on 3r-month follow-up was unremarkable.己**\n\n【22】**Discussion**\n\n【23】**In men， bladder carcinoma is one of the most common malignancies，but its occurrence in women is quiet less， with a male to female ratio of 3-4：1通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. It usually presents in the 6h and 74 decades of life. In young pregnant women， chances of the bladder carcinoma are very low. Pregnancy and malignancy are among the biological conditions in which antigen tissue is tolerated by a competent immune system 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.**\n\n【24】**The majority of these cases usually present in the second or third trimester with painless hematuria. Hematuria presenting during pregnancy always warrants prompt evaluation， keeping bladder cancer as a differential diagnosis in mind. Diagnosis of bladder carcinoma during pregnancy can pose a dilemma， as symptoms are often misleading， i.e. frequency and nocturia are usually mistaken as they can arise throughout pregnancy in healthy females too， thus delaying the diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. It is further complicated as for the patient， identification of the source of bleeding is often difficult and is frequently mistaken for obstetric hemorrhage or more common benign lesions such as cystitis. Although cystitis is the commonest cause of hematuria during pregnancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>， complete work-up is needed if a response to treatment is not satisfactory but firstly， painless vaginal bleeding due to placenta previa must be excluded since this needs prompt obstetrical intervention. Although bladder carcinoma is quite rare in pregnant women， gross hematuria should be managed with a high index of suspicion to rule out the possibility and timely management of bladder malignancy. Flexible cystoscopy is considered safe and the most useful test in the evaluation ofhematuria pregnancy. Transurethral IResection of the Bladder Tumor(TURBT) under regional or general anesthesia is considered safe to perform irrespective of the gestational period 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. If the malignant potential of the tumor is high， then termination of pregnancy is considered during the early gestational period for maternal survival， followed by management of malignancy. There are only 27 cases reported of bladder mass with pregnancy out of which eight cases were managed with TURBT during the intrapartum period followed by an uneventful continuation of pregnancy till term or near term， thus ensuing fetal well-being simultaneously通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6-9\\]</u>.**\n\n【25】In this case， as the patient was having profuse bleeding from bladder growth， so we decided to go for fulguration and TURBT.\n\n【26】**Unfortunately， the fetal distress of unknown cause resulted in emergencyLSCS. The current casehighlights the successfulprocedural outcome of TURBT for the mother but the risk remains for the fetus although TURBT is considered safe generally. In our case， though we couldn't ascertain the exact cause of fetal distress， still the procedure can be considered as one of the culprits. The authors want to shed light on the TURBT in pregnancy as a not-so-safe procedure but it remains a choice to perform in a patient with persistent hematuria where conservative treatment fails to continue pregnancy till term. Close and proper monitoring of both the maternaland fetal conditions remains crucial during the postoperative follow-up period.**\n\n【27】**Author's Contribution**\n\n【28】**Corresponding and first author： Substantial contributions to the conception or design of the work and the acquisition； Drafting the work or revising it critically for important intellectual content.**\n\n【29】**Co-authors： Analysis， or interpretation of data for the work； Agreement related to the accuracy or integrity of any part of the work are appropriately investigated and resolved； Agreement to be accountable for all aspects of the work.**\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>1\\.

However， migration and early spontaneous expulsion of the screw after treatment of the symphysis pubis disjunction is considered rare. We present a report of a 64-year-old man who， after a fall from a height， presented with a disjunction of the pubic symphysis treated with two-plate fixation and presence of screw migration into the bladder and spontaneous expulsion one month after surgery.**\n\n【18】**Keywords： Screw； Pelvic fracture； Internal fixation； Bladder foreign body**\n\n【19】**Introduction**\n\n【20】**Disjunction ofthepelvic ring is associated with a 7%to 25%incidenceofurinarytract injuries 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Treatment with an anterior plate in the pelvis is recommended as a fixation method for disjunctions of the pubic symphysis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1-3\\]</u>. Because the fixation is performed in the joint area， micro movements occur and may cause plate breakage or loosening of screws 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. The literature demonstrates that late screw loosening with migration to the bladder is relatively common 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1-4\\]</u>. In this study， we report a case of migration to the bladder and early (one month) spontaneous expulsion of the screw after anterior pelvic ring surgery with plates in the pubic symphysis.**\n\n【21】**Case Presentation**\n\n【22】**Male patient， 64 years old， victim of a fall from a roof， approximately three and a half meters high on November 254， 2021. Upon admission to the orthopedic emergency room， after physical examination and imaging tests， the opening of the pubic symphysis chapter II was diagnosed.**\n\n【23】**Both the patient and the fracture remained stable throughout the treatment， and it was decided not to temporarily fix the pelvis with an external fixator. After carrying out all the preoperative preparation， the definitive orthopedic surgical procedure was performed seven days after the trauma. A pelvic approach was used through the Pfannenstiel access， with associated detachment to protect the urinary bladder. The orthopedic surgical technique used was the placement of two orthogonal plates， one superior and one anterior. Top plate was large fragment DCP with 4 mm x4.5 mm screws. The anterior reconstruction plate was made of small fragments with 4 mmx3.5mm screws. Satisfactory radiographic control was performed at all stages .**\n\n【24】**On January 015， 2022， the patient reported spontaneously eliminating， via urine， 1 screw 3.5mm from the anterior plate after loosening the plate. After examination of excretory urography associated with cystoscopy， it was confirmed the formation of a fistula in the anterior wall， close to the transition with the lateral/medial bladder fundus， around 0.6 cm .**\n\n【25】**The formation of the fistula was due to a foreign body reaction (friction against the bladder) after loosening the 3.5 mm screw， and after its formation it was encompassed by the organ. From the urological point of view， we proceeded in an expectant manner， keeping the patient using an indwelling urinary catheter for 30 days associated with the use of the antibiotic Bactrim**\n\n【26】**Figure 1： Antero-posterior X-ray of the pelvis with the pubic symphysis esion.**\n\n【27】**Figure 2： Images of symphysis fixatian with twa plates in antera-pasteriar， inlet and outlet view.**\n\n【28】**(sulfamethoxazole + trimethoprim) for 10 days and ultrasound control to confirm the closure of the orifice. From the orthopedic point of view， watchful waiting was maintained； with no weight bearing for two months associated with radiographic control and computed tomography.**\n\n【29】**Discussion**\n\n【30】**Screw migration to the bladder after disjunction of the pubic symphysis with exit through the urethra has been reported as an extremely rare event 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Bladder injury can be caused by the trauma itself， considering theproximity ofthe organ to thebone，byherniation of the bladder into the symphysis or by iatrogenic injuries 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Perry and Husmann 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u> observed that 50% ofurethral injuries after fracture of the pelvis in women were not diagnosed by inadequate urological evaluation.**\n\n【31】**Fridman et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u> and Sho et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u> reported a patient with spontaneous expulsion of the implant after fixation of the pubic symphysis similar to our case. Peled et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u> reported that there was an injury to the bladder during the trauma， therefore， the possibility that the screw migrated through the injured area cannot be excluded.**\n\n【32】**ThepubicCsymphysisis afibrous joint thateexhibits micromovements during walking. Therefore， when the surgeon performs fixation ofthe pubic symphysis， in the pelvic ring， loosening of the screw and/or breakage of the screw and plate is common 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. What is observed in the literature is the presence of this complication**\n\n【33】**Figure 3： A) X-ray of the pelvis without the screw (arrow)； B) Image of the fistula in the bladder.**\n\n【34】**in patients with disjunction symphysis pubis treated with a plate， in which migration of the screw to the bladder generally occurs late 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1-4\\]</u>. Hosseini et al.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u> reported a case of bladder perforation due to screw loosening seven weeks after pelvic surgery， which was treated with cystoscopic screw removal. Unlike the previous case described by Hosseini et al.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>， our case involved the exceptional case with migration of the screw to the bladder with spontaneous elimination1 month after surgery， still in a state of convalescence and without any complaints. This reinforces the lack of diagnosis due to previous bladder injury， which may have favored its migration， despite the patient still being at rest.**\n\n【35】**Matta 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u> advocated a single， curved pelvic plate with four or six holes with 3.5 mm screws. Some researchers have advocated the use of double plates， longer 4.5 mm screws or even two-hole plates with similar results \\[1，3\\]. To avoid the instability generated by fixation of the pubic symphysis， fixation with two plates was chosen a 4.5DCP in the upper region and a 3.5 anterior reconstruction plate. The doubt raised by the authors was the need for posterior fixation of the sacroiliac joint and the use of long V-shaped anterior screws， which could stabilize the pelvis， preventing screw migration.**\n\n【36】**Conclusion**\n\n【37】**This report is intended to alert orthopedic surgeons to be careful with the fixation ofthe pubic symphysis and to look for the diagnosis of bladder injuries due to trauma， avoiding complications such as migration of the screw to the bladder.**\n\n【38】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【39】通用结尾删除-1:<u>1\\.

The sputum constituted of saliva and phlegm in various proportions. No hemorrhage was noted. He suffers from COPD and is on inhalers， nebulization by bronchodilators and steroids since 1996. Since last one year， he is also on nistami powder - a combination of indacaterol and glycopyrronium inhalation. Despite cough there was no sense of constriction in chest， neither any spasmodic component he was familiar with. On that particular day， he had not taken any dose of inhaler as he had not felt any necessity for it. During the bout of cough， however， he decided to inhale nistami powder. There was some relief but still the impulse to cough continued. He sucked in some lozenges thereafter. It really had no effect but before lying down， he decided to take in Foracort (formoterol and budesonide) inhaler in apprehension of disturbed sleep. As he inhaled， he coughed out a single piece of gram seed of about5 mm x5 mm.  indicating the real cause of his cough**\n\n【14】The patient recalled a bout of cough during the dinner on 1.7.2021， when he had eaten a vegetable preparation containing gram seeds.\n\n【15】Patient does not suffer from any neurological disease but has a habit ofeating fast.\n\n【16】**In the past history， a similar episode had occurred following ingestion of small garlic of similar size.

Careful and meticulous examination is crucial before embarking on any surgical interventions. Numerous differential diagnoses is possible for any neck mass and it differs between adult and pediatric patient. The final diagnosis will depend on the patient’s age， the location of the mass， the detail characteristic of the mass as well as the associated symptoms exhibited by the patients. We describe a case of suspicious of branchial cyst which turn out to be a recurrent thyroid tumor.**\n\n【16】**Keywords： Neck mass； Thyroid tumor； Branchial cyst**\n\n【17】**Introduction**\n\n【18】**Neck masses are frequently encountered by surgeons. They are subdivided into midline and lateral neck masses. Cystic neck lesion in adults has to be carefully evaluated to obtain accurate diagnosis and to offer the correct treatment. The commonest midline neck mass in adults is of thyroid gland origin. Thyroid masses are under the subdivision of lower midline neck masses. Examples of thyroid masses are solitary thyroid nodules， multinodular goitre and diffuse thyroid masses. Ultrasound is an excellent technique for imaging the thyroid gland. Solid and cystic lumps can be distinguished and nodules can be characterized with a high degree of accuracy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.**\n\n【19】**Branchial Cyst (BC) is one of the commonest examples oflateral cystic neck lesion. It appears as a developmental failure of the branchial apparatus. They often manifest in young adults with an incidence peak in the third decade. Few theories have been suggested to explain the origin of BC， such as the inclusion theory and the branchial apparatus theory. Inclusion theory postulates that BC is epithelial inclusions within a lymph node. This theory is supported by the fact that most BC has lymphoid tissue in their wall. Branchial apparatus theory suggests that branchial cysts represent the remains of pharyngeal pouches or branchial cysts or both and that cysts should be present at birth with peak incidence at the second to third decades 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. BC mostly， about 60% located in the upper third of the neck at the anterior margin of the Sternocleidomastoid (SCM) muscle. It is usually persistent and 70% are clinically cystic. Ultrasonography is the modality of choice in cysts 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.**\n\n【20】**We would like to share our experience of managing a patient presented with left sided neck mass， clinically appeared as branchial cyst but further investigations and final histopathological result was ofthyroid nodular hyperplasia.**\n\n【21】**Case Presentation**\n\n【22】**A 33-year old， Malay lady with history thyroid surgery 20 years ago for multinodular goitre， presented to Otorhinolaryngology clinic in September 2017 with complaints of a left anterolateral neck swelling. The swelling is painless and gradually creasing in size for more than 14 years of duration. The patient was asymptomatic. She had no obstructive symptoms， voice changes， hypo or hyperthyroid symptoms or any constitutional symptoms.**\n\n【23】**Examination of neck revealed a huge left anterolateral cystic lesion， measuring about 15.0cm x 10.0 cm， extending superiorly to the lower border of the left mandible， inferiorly to just above the clavicle . Laterally， the mass extends up to the posterior border of the left sternocleidomastoid muscle and medially， it encroaching the midline. There was also surgical scar which most probably could be due to previous thyroidectomy scar. Nasal， ear， laryngeal， cranial nerves and other systemic examinations were unremarkable.**\n\n【24】**The patient was treated as having branchial cysts until the Fine Needle Aspiration and Cytology(FNAC) findings were reported as colloid nodule with cystic degeneration.Ultrasonography of neck**\n\n【25】**Figure 1： Huge left neck mass overlying the sternomastoid muscle which was cystic and fluctuant on clinical examination.**\n\n【26】Figure 2： Enlarged thyraid gland with multiple well defined cystic and solid lesions， which displaced and compressed the trachea to the right (red arrow).\n\n【27】**interpreted that features are of multinodular goitre. Blood tests such as the thyroid function test and the serum calcium levels were within normal range. Patient was then planned for computer tomography in order to ascertain the origin of the mass and to rule out features of malignancy in view of it is long standing nature. The CT scan reported as the thyroid gland was grossly enlarged with multiple well defined cystic and solid lesions， predominantly cystic lesions. The largest lesion was in the left thyroid gland， measuring 9.1 cmx9.1 cm x8.8 cm without retrosternal extension. The lesion caused mass effect to the airway where it compressed and displaced the trachea postero-laterally， and the surrounding structures involving supraglottic， glottic and subglottic region， seen at the level of C2/C3 cervical body till T1/T2 level .**\n\n【28】**Subsequently， she underwent completion thyroidectomy in January 2018 which revealed a cystic mass overlying the carotid sheath . The mass was excised leaving the carotid sheath content intact . Her histopathological report was nodular hyperplasia of thyroid. Eight months postoperative，the patient is well with no complication and she was pleased with the surgery as her aesthetic has significantly improved.**\n\n【29】**Discussion**\n\n【30】**The aim of presenting this case is to show the diversity of the differential diagnosis of the neck mass in our patient. Initially with the location and examination of neck mass， a provisional diagnosis of branchial cyst was speculated but after further investigation like FNAC， ultrasonography and CT scan of the neck， the provisional diagnosis was directed towards multinodular goitre. The location of neck mass and imaging appearances gives surgeon the gross**\n\n【31】**Figure 3： Intraoperatively， the mass was cystic and intimately lies on the carotid sheath (carotid artery， vagal nerve and internal jugular vein).**\n\n【32】**Figure 4： The mass was removed in total，leaving the vagal nerve intact. The mass measured 15.0 cm x11.0cm.**\n\n【33】**idea on the provisional and differential diagnosis. The initial examination of this patient which revealed a very cystic and fluctuant mass giving the impression it could be a branchial cyst. This were supported by its typical location at lateral neck region overlying the sternocleidomastoid， the patient's age as well as presence of extensive surgical scar which could be due to total thyroidectomy.**\n\n【34】**A differential diagnosis of midline neck masses are numerous and includes subcutaneous lesions (epidermoid cysts， dermoid cysts， teratoid cysts and lipoma)， thyroglossal ducts cysts， lymph nodes and thyroid masses. Differential diagnosis for lateral neck masses on the other hand， is divided into skin and subcutaneous lesions (epidermoid cysts， dermoid cysts， teratoid cysts and lipoma)， developmental masses (lymphangiomas and branchial cysts)， lymph nodes (infectious， inflammatory and neoplastic)， neurogenic tumors(neurofibromas and schwannomas)， vascular tumors (carotid body tumors) and salivary glands.**\n\n【35】**In view of wide differential diagnoses， meticulous examination and complete work up is necessary in managing any patients who presented with neck mass. This is crucial in order to come to a correct final diagnosis and proper treatment can be instituted. Sixty percent of BC is located in the upper third of the neck， anterior to the sternocleidomastoid muscle， but they may appear anywhere in neck or even in the parotid gland. Detection of a cystic mass in the lateral neck region should always raise a possibility of thyroid nodule通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Seventy percent are cystic， although up to 30% may be solid. Regional lymph node metastasis from the Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC) of the upper aerodigestive tract might mimic BC in imaging if it undergoes cystic degeneration. Cystic degeneration in cervical metastasis from Waldeyer’s ring is estimated to be 33% to 62%通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.**\n\n【36】**Imaging commonly used for neck masses are Ultrasound (US)， Computer Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging(MRI). US is the initial method of imaging， as it is relatively cheap，**\n\n【37】**well tolerated， absence of ionizing radiation and provides excellent resolution and contrast of the extra cranial head and neck 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. US is very useful in cases where Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology (FNAC) is needed and it displays the intracystic architecture and vascularity. In older patients with cystic lateral neck lesions， ultrasound with CT or MRI is the best investigation modality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.**\n\n【38】**In BC， US display various echogenicities without intrinsic vascularity on color Doppler. The typical snowstorm' appearance is seen on pressing the transducer against the tissue. This is due to the movement of the cholesterol crystals 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. The role of US-guided FNAC is questionable when assessing cystic lesions because FNAC has a high false-negative rate (38% to 63%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. However， BC is differentiated from HNSCC metastasis by evaluating the cell ploidy using flow cytometry DNA analysis of the FNAC samples 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. The simple cyst depicts thin， smooth rim and mucoid content of low density in CT， whereas in MRI， uncomplicated BC has low T1-Weighted (T1W) and high T2W signal intensity. An infected cyst will possess thick， irregular， enhancing and maybe septated rim in CT. In MRI an infected cyst will show high signal intensity in both T1W and T2W images. Contrasted images will display an enhanced cystic wall\\[71.**\n\n【39】**The commonest midline neck lump in adult is of thyroid gland origin. Thyroid cysts commonly appear as a solitary thyroid nodule of variable size， are painless unless have a hemorrhagic component within. Thyroid cysts usually are fluctuant or tense and on the contrary， adenomas are usually solid. True epithelial thyroid cysts are rare. Cystic thyroid lesions are mostly due to haemorrhage or degeneration within a hyperplastic nodule (part of a multinodular goitre). Toxic and non-toxic multinodular goitres are painless too and have multiple nodules of variable size and shape. In cases of thyroid masses， ultrasound is an excellent choice ofimaging and they appear as well-defined，heterogeneous nodules with cystic component and internal septa. The comet tail sign is occasionally seen and it suggests the presence of colloid within 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Multinodular thyroid is diagnosed when multiple cystic nodules are present. Ultrasound with fine-needle aspiration cytology is the first-line investigation in cases with solitary thyroid nodule. The presence of punctuate calcifications and chaotic intranodular vascularity on Doppler will raise suspicion of malignancy， hence ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration is advocated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. CT scan is usually performed in thyroid mass to look for the retrosternal extension， to assess any compression on adjacent structures like the trachea and the major neck vessels (internal and external carotid artery and internal jugular vein) as well as suspicious features of malignancy such as presence of metastatic lymph nodes and area of central necrosis.**\n\n【40】**Conclusion**\n\n【41】**It is imperative to investigate for a correct diagnosis of any neck mass as the subsequent surgical plan will depends on the final pathology diagnosis. This will avoid unnecessary surgical morbidities and improve patient's post-operative outcomes.**\n\n【42】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【43】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**1\\. Prakash PK， Hanna FW.

Probiotics are host-friendly live microorganisms those can restrengthen the intestinal microbial flora and are widely used mostly in the management of acute diarrhea. Probiotics-induced adverse drug reactions like， urticaria is an unusual incidence and here we found an event of probiotics-induced acute urticaria.**\n\n【15】**Case Description： An 18-month-oldpediatric patient was suffering from diarrhea for last 2 days and took the consultation of a doctor. He was prescribed with probiotics (a combination of Lactobacillus _acidophilus-2 billion， Lactobacillus bulgaricus-1 billion and Bifidobacterium bifidum-1 billion) at_ a dose： one capsule per day orally. On the day one， the patient was experienced with probiotics-induced acute urticaria just after 3 and half hour of ingestion，and most of the symptoms of urticaria were resolved within 4 hr to 5 hrs without any anti-allergy medication. Same incidence happened in the second day. As per the doctor's advice， probiotics were discontinued and he was not experienced with any allergic reaction， after that.**\n\n【16】**Conclusion： Any drug may be treated as an allergen by a living human body and consequently， may develop allergic reactions such as， urticaria. Although，probiotics are considered as safe drugs， but in our case， we found a usual probiotics-induced acute urticaria case in a pediatric patient.**\n\n【17】**Keywords： Acute Urticaria； Probiotics； Adverse Drug Reactiona**\n\n【18】**Introduction**\n\n【19】**Acute urticaria， also known as hives， characterized by episodic， pale red， pruritic edematous lesions (wheals) on the skin， as a result of body's unpleasant symptomatic response to an allergen with or without a known etiology 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Urticaria is the second most common cutaneous manifestation of adverse reaction after maculopapular drug eruption and occurs in 15% to 25% peoples at any stage of life \\[1，2\\]. Probiotics are host friendly live microorganisms that are helpful for reestablishing host's beneficial microbial flora in the digestive system and this concept was established in the20h century through a hypothesis proposed by a Russian scientist and won a Nobel Prize. Both the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations (UN) have uniquely defined probiotics as live microorganisms， which， when administered in adequate amounts， confer a health benefit on the host’通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Probiotics， such as L. acidophilus，L. bulgaricus and B. bifidum are widely used as probiotics 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u> and adverse reaction with any of these probiotics is not recorded to date. We found a case of acute urticaria (an adverse drug reaction) followed by the oral administration of above mentioned probiotics in a pediatric patient.**\n\n【20】**A 18-month-old healthy male pediatric (toddler) patient went to a doctor (out-door) of a tertiary level hospital in Dhaka， Bangladesh with the complain of lose stool， persistently occurred for last 2 days with a frequency of 3-4 times a day and only oral rehydration saline (ORS) was administered in home. During consultation， doctor prescribed a probiotic combination in hard capsule form containing L. acidophilus (2billion)， L. bulgaricus (1 billion) and B. bifidum (1 billion)， at a dose： one capsule once a day， orally for the next 10 days for the treatment of diarrhea. Adequate ORS intake was advised for rehydration in the prescription. On that day， patients body weight was**\n\n【21】**Figure 1： Probiotics-induced urticaria on back.**\n\n【22】**10.8 Kg， blood pressure was 100 over 55 mmHg and pulse rate was120 beats per minute. The patient took the first dose (1 capsule) of the probiotics in the afternoon of the same day. After about 3 andhalf hour of administration， he developed acute urticaria characterized by pale red wheals with itchy and swelled feature， mostly in the chest and back . Patient looked fatigue. About 4 hr to 5 hours later， most of the pale read wheals were disappeared and itchiness reduced， significantly without taking any medication for that allergic reaction. The patient's parents were confused with that incidence of the first day and again experienced with the same incidence on the second day with probiotics ， which was again resolved after 4 hr to 5 hrs of ingestion without any sequelae except， mild itchiness in the chest and back. On the third day， parents avoided the ingestion of probiotics to their child and took him to doctor， immediately. His probiotic was stopped and by this time， his diarrhea was resolved. The pediatric patient was prescribed with syrup Chlorpheniramine Maleate (1 mg twice a day， orally) for his mild itchiness and he had not been experienced with any allergic symptom in the following days.**\n\n【23】**Discussion**\n\n【24】**Urticaria is an unpleasant adverse cutaneous reaction that may occur without any perception with a prevalence of 0.5% to 1% in population. The primary symptom of urticaria is pruritus.According to the symptoms’duration of stay and presence of stimulus/antigen， urticaria is generally classified as acute， chronic and physical 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Any urticaria， size ranges from few millimeters to several centimeters in diameter，lasts for less than 6 weeks called， acute urticaria 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. In some cases， skin lesions may last forless than 48 hrs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. It appears suddenly in response to a trigger， which may be a viral infection or an allergen， such as drug， food and insect 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Drug-induced urticaria is seen in 9%of out-door patients in dermatology department and mostly reported against the most common drugs， such as penicillins， non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs， sulfonamides and Fluoroquinolones 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Urticaria mostly occurs in the range of 20-40 years of age. Urticaria with a deeper swelling is called， angioedema. Generally， urticaria is occurred due to the activation of mast cell by both immunologic and non-immunologic mechanisms， which causes the release of inflammatory mediators， such as cytokines， histamine， leukotrienes and prostaglandins. These mediators increase vascular permeability which as a result， develops edema and pruritus. Mast cells are widely distributed throughout the body and possess Immunoglobulin E(IgE) receptors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. A study on 411 pediatric patients found that 76.4% patients are experienced with acute urticaria 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Approximately30% urticarias are chronic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. An acute urticaria was observed in that pediatric patient with mild angiedema and severe pruritus， and**\n\n【25】**resolved within a period of less than 48 hrs.**\n\n【26】**A data analysis report showed that drug-induced urticaria and fixed drug rashes are most frequently occurred with carbamazepine(16.23%)， phenytoin (15.15%) and cotrimoxazole (13.53%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. The age of the patients is an important factor for occurring any type of cutaneous drug eruptions. Geriatric patients， boys younger than 3years and girls older than 9 years have been found more susceptible to drug-induced skin eruptions. Several factors of the culprit drugs are responsible for the skin eruption likes， urticaria and factors are： route of administration， dose of the drug， frequency of dosing， duration and drug-metabolism pathways 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. In the current case， urticaria was developed in that boy with the ingestion of oral probiotics， significantly.**\n\n【27】**Probiotics are orally ingestible and nondigestible drug products that help to reestablish the naturally developed beneficiary host-microbiota in the digestive tract and synbiotics are formed when probioticsincluded inthecurrent intestinalmicrobiota 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.Hundreds of different bacterial species are living in the intestine and among the intestinal microbes， those are beneficial for host's health， are termed as probiotics.

Considering all the studies on probiotics， it is believed that probiotics are safe， non-pathogenic beneficial organisms and that is why， globally， different combination of probiotics is used in the management of diarrheal diseases. Recently， probiotics are considered as the cost-effective， potential first line treatment option for managing acute viral diarrhea(specially， in the pediatric patients)， recurrent Clostridium difficile diarrhea and antibiotic-induced diarrhea \\[6，12\\]. Epidemiological studies showed that bacteremia and sepsis is very rare with lactobacilli.

Although usually diagnosed in the first decades of life， it is possible that manifestations are not recognized at older ages. This article aims to report the case of a 70-year-old female patient， admitted to the emergency department with delirium， and who， after ruling out organic causes， was diagnosed with a rare mitochondrial syndrome. The detailed evaluation of the case allowed the diagnosis of MELAS syndrome， with symptoms manifesting late. In this report， the importance of possible differential diagnoses regarding encephalopathies of atypical course is highlighted， even in patients with advanced ages.**\n\n【13】**Keywords： MELAS； Delirium； Mitochondrial Diseases； Older adults**\n\n【14】**Introduction**\n\n【15】**MELAS (Mitochondrial myopathy， Encephalopathy， Lactic Acidosis and Stroke) syndrome is one of the most common mitochondrial diseases， although its prevalence is rare (0.18 cases per100，000 population/year) \\[1，2\\]. There are reports of more than 30 pathogenic variants related to this syndrome， as the m.3243A>G mutation is known as the most commonly found. It is a mitochondrial DNA pathogenic variant， and maternal relatives of patients with the syndrome may carry this mutation without showing symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. The prognosis of patients with MELAS is quite unfavorable， with rapid and aggressive progression； thus， patients hardly ever reach advanced ages and only 1% to 6% of cases occur after the age of 40 years \\[4，5\\].**\n\n【16】**Especially for patients at older ages， MELAS syndrome manifests as cumulative multi-organ disease with broad manifestations that are relatively common to agingpopulation including stroke-like episodes， dementia， hearing impairment， muscle weakness and diabetes. Such impairments， evaluated separately， would hardly be attributed to a rare genetic syndrome， especially in an older patient and could possibly be undiagnosed. Similarly， the syndrome may course with cognitive deterioration in different degrees， and its manifestations may mimic an acute confusion condition， that could be attributed to other cause or even and undefined etiology \\[1，2\\].**\n\n【17】**This case report aims to describe a patient with an initial clinical manifestation of delirium， which， after extensive investigation， led to a late diagnosis of MELAS syndrome. Previous cognitive alterations， history of familial migraine，neuroimaging exams， and a positive family history with the pathogenic variant m.3243A>G helped in the diagnostic conclusion.**\n\n【18】**Case Presentation**\n\n【19】**_cited._**\n\n【20】**A 70-year-old white female patient was admitted to the emergency room with a history of psychomotor agitation and worsening of disorientation that began the day before admission. Her comorbidity history was referred by a son and consisted of systemic arterial hypertension， type II diabetes mellitus not properly controlled， visual and auditory impairment since the age of 50， and no history of smoking. During her medical history， it was also reported that， approximately a year before， the patient had a stroke， manifested with aphasia and transient motor deficit (right hemiparesis). Since then， she had been apathetic， with periods of disorientation and psychomotor agitation， associated with tonic-clonic seizures. She presented a neuroimaging exam that showed previous ischemic insults. In the first 24 h of hospitalization， the patient presented with decreased level of consciousness associated with generalized tonic-clonic seizures， with gasping respiratory pattern， being submitted to orotracheal intubation in the emergency room and referred to the intensive care unit for neurological monitoring and hemodynamic control.**\n\n【21】**Figure 1： Skull MRI showing altered cortical-subcortical intensity of the temporal lobes， hyperintense on T2 and FLAIR， notably on the left.**\n\n【22】**Figure 2： Contrast enhancement in thalamic capsular vascular lesion， left. Lentiform nucleus has hypersignal on FLAIR， hypoxic-ischemic lesion， dilation of the ventricular system.**\n\n【23】**During the investigation， Computed Tomography (CT) of the skull demonstrated cortical-subcortical hypodensities in the left temporal and occipital region with liquor density， suggesting encephalomalacia due to a previous ischemic event， and another temporal cortical-subcortical hypodensity on the right， suggesting another area of ischemia. Laboratory testing showed elevated blood glucose， with no evidence of bacterial infection and negative viral serological markers. Electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm and repolarization alteration； transthoracic echocardiogram with preserved cardiac function and mild mitral insufficiency； doppler of carotids showed no obstructions. Sedation was discontinued a couple of days after but the patient did not recover consciences.**\n\n【24】**Furthermore， an electroencephalogram was performed， which showed no epileptiform seizure pattern， as well as a control CT scan of the skull， with no evidence of acute ischemic or hemorrhagic events. Thus， it was decided to collect Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF)， which showed elevated lactate (58 mg/dl-RV： 9-19 mg/dl)， with no other alterations. During hospitalization， the patient underwent skull Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (MRI) due to clinical worsening， demonstrating an alteration in the cortical-subcortical intensity of the temporal lobes，hyperintense on T2 and FLAIR， notably to the left. Contrast enhancement in the thalamic capsular vascular lesion， on the left. Lentiform nucleus has hypersignal on FLAIR， hypoxic-ischemic lesion， dilatation of the ventricular system (Figure2). Cranial arterial and venous angioresonance was also performed， which showed no evidence of aneurysmal dilatation or stenosis.**\n\n【25】**Regarding clinical evolution， the patient underwent treatment for subsequent infectious conditions， required dialysis therapy with recovery of renal function and， due to the indispensability of**\n\n【26】**Figure 3： Cranial arterial and venous angioresonance with no evidence of aneurysmal dilatation or stenosis.**\n\n【27】**mechanical ventilation without neurological recovery， needed a tracheostomy. Approximately 90 days after admission， the patient evolved with refractivity to the instituted treatments， with progressive clinical worsening and death in the intensive care unit.**\n\n【28】**Discussion**\n\n【29】**Genetic diseases involving pathogenic variants are more prevalent in youngpatients， rarely developing symptoms after the age of 65. Among the diseases caused by pathogenic variants， one of the most frequent is MELAS syndrome. The manifestations of MELAS are typical in childhood， with a prevalence of 65% to 76% of affected individuals presenting symptoms until the age of 20 \\[4，5\\]. Although the onset of MELAS manifestations is more typical in young patients， this case report shows a later onset of symptoms.**\n\n【30】**MELAS syndrome is a neurodegenerative disease caused by the decreased ability of cells to produce sufficient energy in the form of Adenosine 5'-Triphosphate (ATP) \\[5，6\\]. Dysfunctional mitochondria are unable to generate enough ATP to meet the energy needs of various organs，particularly those with high energy demands， including the nervous system， skeletal and cardiac muscles，kidneys， liver， and endocrine system 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.**\n\n【31】**MELAS involves multiple organ involvement with diverse clinical manifestations， including neurological symptoms， lactic acidosis， myopathy， recurrent headaches， hearing impairment， psychiatric， renal， gastrointestinal， and endocrine disorders 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Symptoms develop when the metabolic demands of the body exceed the available energy supply of the defective mitochondria 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. The most com manifestations of MELAS include altered level of consciousness， stroke-like _e_ episodes， focall or generalized1 seizures， migraine headaches， and dementia. Stroke-like episodes are so described because they do not present an ischemic etiology， and the affected areas do not correspond to the classical vascular distributions \\[6，9\\].**\n\n【32】**The reported patient initially presented with two important clinical manifestations： Acute onset disorientation and psychomotor agitation， attributed at first to a delirium possibly superimposed on a previous neurodegenerative condition. Acute changes in the emergency department have a high prevalence in patients over 65years of age. Commonly， these patients are rashly diagnosed with delirium， and the organic cause is often not identified. Delirium is defined as an acute neuropsychiatric syndrome marked by cognitive and behavioral changes. It comprises a brain dysfunction， with**\n\n【33】**multifactorial etiology， of abrupt onset and fluctuating course. Delirium is a common disease， but 55% to 80% of cases are not recognized and are not documented by the clinical team treating the disease \\[7，10\\]. Initially， the management involves identifying several etiologies， such as： Psychoactive drugs， hydroelectrolytic alterations， severe pain， hypoxemia， severe anemia， infections， and significant immobility 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11-14\\]</u>.**\n\n【34】**In the present case， after excluding the most common etiologies that trigger delirium， the presence of clinical manifestations， such as seizures， decreased level of consciousness and behavioral changes， associated with a history of recurrent headaches， psychiatric alterations and maternal family history， and neuroimaging exams， stimulates clinical reasoning focused on differential and uncommon diagnoses of other encephalopathies. After a joint investigation of the clinical， family， laboratory， and imaging history， it is concluded to be a rare mitochondrial syndrome.**\n\n【35】**As a genetic disease with hereditary characteristics， MELAS is a progressive neurodegenerative disease associated with polygenic mutations， inherited from the mother， of the mitochondrial DNA通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. Thus， a rigorous review of family history is of great importance， especially in relation to maternal antecedents， including a history of migraine， exercise intolerance， and psychiatric alterations. In the clinical case reported here， the family history proved to be of enormous magnitude to hypothesize MELAS as a possible diagnosis.**\n\n【36】**As well as the clinical history， the radiological examination is extremely important to aid in the diagnosis， since the lesions are similar to stroke in the temporal， occipital and parietal regions. The affected areas do not correspond to the classical vascular distributions， presenting an irregular distribution， well associated with metabolic or small vessel etiology 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. In the reported case， neuroimaging exams showed cortico-subcortical alterations in temporal and occipital regions， on the left， and thalamus， justifying the symptoms presented， such as migraine and neuropsychiatric alterations.**\n\n【37】**The managementofMELAS syndromeinvolves a multidisciplinary approach， with lifestyle modification by means of diet and physical exercises， in addition to symptomatic treatment and treatment of complications. There is no drug therapy approved by the Food and Drug Administration or therapeutic protocol established to date for the treatment of MELAS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16-18\\]</u>. Affected individuals need to be evaluated globally， with assessment of the organs most affected by the disease and should be followed up at regular intervals to monitor progression， with screening for possible complications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. One of the most important behavioral measures is smoking cessation since it can worsen mitochondrial dysfunction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. Among the treatments， supplements， such as antioxidants and cofactors， are being used in MELAS syndrome based on limited clinical trials， for example， L-arginine and citrulline， which aim to increase the availability of nitric oxide， leading to an improvement in vasodilation and， consequently， blood flow \\[20，21\\]. More studies are still needed to effectively establish a drug therapy that can interfere with the prognosis and improve the quality of life of patients with MELAS， especially those with a later diagnosis.**\n\n【38】**The case reported here demonstrates the importance of screening and initial evaluation of older patients with delirium or acute encephalopathy， reinforcing the concept of the need to perform a detailed review of the clinical history of these patients， including family history. It is emphasized the importance of expanding the range of differential diagnoses when the most prevalent and common**\n\n【39】**etiologies are discarded or when the evolution of the case presents clinical manifestations that do not confirm the context of delirium. The present report also emphasizes that MELAS disease， although rare， may be diagnosed in older patients and it is possible that the incidence is underestimated due to underdiagnosis.**\n\n【40】**Conclusion**\n\n【41】**Acute neurological conditions are highly prevalent in patients over 65 years of age in the emergency department； therefore， detecting their etiology might be challenging. In cases that present with unusual clinical manifestations and atypical evolution， less prevalent diagnostic hypotheses should be considered. Mitochondrial pathologies， although more common in young people， can mimic an acute neurological condition in older adults. Although there is an unfavorable and progressive evolution， without therapeutic possibility， the diagnosis of MELAS is fundamental for the planning of patient comfort care and support in the face ofunfavorable evolution. The diagnosis also allows genetic counseling of family members and its better recognition and investigation in future studies，contributing to the understanding of the causative mechanisms of this disease and therapeutic possibilities.**\n\n【42】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**Acknowledgment**</u>\n\n【43】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**We thank the family members for consenting to conduct this report and Doctor friends Luciana Miranda， Luiz Abelardo and Romilson and for their support in carrying out this report.**</u>\n\n【44】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【45】通用结尾删除-1:<u>1\\.

The patient's case was studied 13 months after DC through high-resolution CT， assessing brain， skull and scalp data， that were used for virtual Three-Dimensional (3D) analysis and planning， in order to produce hypoprojected PEEK implants that prevented both an excessive tension on the severelyscarred scalp and an excessive intracranial dead space. The patient was treated with a one-stage cranioplasty that reconstructed 208 cm’ of the cranial vault while obtaining tensionless scalp closure； a total of 46cm² of skull surface in the lower temporal areas were left unreconstructed as they could work as a warning sign for the rise of ICP in case of swelling. The 12-months follow-up showed satisfactory aesthetic and structural results.**\n\n【15】**Discussion： Whether it’s for treatment of the syndrome of the trephined or for aesthetic purposes， the need to reconstruct calvarial defects remains a challenge， especially for very large defects (>150cm’) which are rarely described in literature. To overcome the potential intra- and extracranial complications to the procedure， available surface-guided CAD-CAM programming represents an optimal solution.**\n\n【16】**Conclusion： In this report， use ofundercorrection in planning and finalizing subtotal custom-made cranioplasty， appears able to restore skull integrity and aesthetics while avoiding excessive skin tension and reducing intracranial dead space.**\n\n【17】**Keywords： Cranioplasty； Subtotal cranioplasty； Custom-made cranioplasty； Decompressive craniectomy； Traumatic brain injury**\n\n【18】**Introduction**\n\n【19】**In cases of large skull defects， reconstruction currently represents a necessity， with the aim to provide structural protection for the underlying brain， a barrier against infection， and the solution to correct aesthetic deformities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. These skull defects are frequently the result of Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) -related Decompressive Craniectomy (DC)； in other cases， craniectomy is performed due to intracranial aneurysm， Arteriovenous Malformations (AVM)， cerebral abscess， ischemic stroke-related cerebral edema， and tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.**\n\n【20】**Since ancient history， great efforts have been made to solve the problem of skull defects， but it was only after World War I that cranioplasties were performed in greater number 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Between the reasons that support reconstruction， the main one is undoubtedly the treatment of the Syndrome of the Trephined 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u> which consists in the rapid neurological deterioration while changing the posture of the patient is specific positions (from orthostatic to horizontal or Trendelenburg position)， together with modifications of Cerebral Blood Flow (CBF) and Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF). In these patients， cranioplasty has a therapeutic effect in preventing these sudden neurological symptoms by avoiding the flaccid scalp portion covering the cranial defect from being sensitive to atmospheric pressure， causing direct force over the cortex 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Thanks to the vast knowledge of materials and design refinements while programming a Computer-Aided Design and Computer-**\n\n【21】**Aided Manufacturing (CAD-CAM) cranioplasty， it is now possible to perform subtotal cranioplasties， although uneventful results still represent a challenge. This work has been reported in line with the Scare Criteria 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.**\n\n【22】**Case Presentation**\n\n【23】**Informed written consent was obtained from the patient’s legal guardian for the writing and publication of this case report. A22-year-old patient was sent to the Emergency Room of our IIIlevel University Hospital 1 h after a 7-meter fall from a roof while working. Neurological examination assessed a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 6， and the patient underwent a brain CT scan  that showed bilateral cerebral swelling with multiple cerebral contusions and a suspected intracranial right carotid artery rupture.**\n\n【24】**He was transferred to the emergency operating room and under general anesthesia， he underwent right temporoparietal DC. After 24 h， the patient’s Intracranial Pressure (ICP) was still high(23 mmHg) and a left temporoparietal DC was performed (Figure2). The patient’s Glasgow Coma Scale score was 6 on postoperative day 11 and continued until discharge. Due to the trauma， the patient suffered irreversible traumatic brain damage， and despite the DC， a long-term outcome of Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS-E)=2 was assessed.**\n\n【25】**The patient suffered 3 episodes of skin flap dehiscence along different parts of the surgical incisions， that healed by secondary intention with the aid of medicated dressings.**\n\n【26】**A High-Resolution CT of the craniomaxillofacial complex was acquired (Siemens SOMATOM Definition AS+， Siemens， Erlangen， Germany)， assessing both the brain and the skull data ， which were processed using Materialise's Interactive Medical Image**\n\n【27】**Figure 1： Emergency CT scan assessing post-traumatic bilateral cerebral swelling and multiple cerebral contusions.**\n\n【28】**Figure 3： 3D reconstruction of the patient's skull before cranioplasty， missing of 40% of the cranial vault.**\n\n【29】**Figure 4： CT scan showing cerebral volume 13 months after trauma.**\n\n【30】**Figure 5： a) Intraoperative photograph showing left custom-made implant positioning (left)； b) the photographic detail shows the unreconstructed temporal area， that will work as a warning sign for the rise of ICP in case of swelling (right).**\n\n【31】**Control System 10.0 (Materialise， Leuven， Belgium).**\n\n【32】**All data regarding the surface of preoperative and postoperative cranial defect were acquired， together with the scalp surface and the intracranial dead space between the brain and the scalp. Using this data， 16 months after decompressive craniotomy， the patient underwent bilateral Polyether Ether Ketone (PEEK) custom-made cranioplasty (implants were fabricated by 3dific， Perugia， Italy) for the skull defect along the original incision approach .

The data acquired from the CT scan prior to the cranioplasty and processed with virtual Three-Dimensional(3D) analysis showed a total cranium surface of 397 cm， compared to 605 cm\"after surgery， with the implants representing a total of 208cm’ of skull surface. Bilaterally， in the temporal region， a total of 46cm’were non-reconstructed for reasons that will be discussed below. The patient did not show any complications related to cranioplasty and was discharged 7 days after surgery. Atthe 12-months clinical and radiological control ，noimplantloosening or dislocation were noted， and the aesthetic aspect and the structural strength of the cranium were restored.**\n\n【38】**Discussion**\n\n【39】**Under the circumstances of brain insults， such as trauma or intracranial hemorrhage， inflammatory cascade， impaired osmolyte transport and oxidative stress， combined to the eventual direct injury， lead to serious brain swelling and subsequent damage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. It is not a coincidence， in fact， that the first neurosurgical operation performed was indeed a trephination， performed by the Incas over 3000 years ago，probably with the purpose to treat the consequences of a trauma. However， we will have to wait the sixteenth century to see the first description of a cranioplasty， done by a Flemish physician named Fallopius 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.**\n\n【40】**In modern times， treatment of such harmful events as TBI**\n\n【41】**Figure 8： Virtual 3D model of the implants showing the bilateral temporal unreconstructed \"window\".**\n\n【42】**includes， in the first instance， DC together with a specific medical treatment and， in the case of really extended TBI， bifrontal or bilateral craniectomy is advised. Even though current guidelines do not specify nor the extension of the craniectomy neither the optimal time to perform subsequent cranioplasty 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>， some authors suggest that at least 60 cm² of cranial vault should be removed for DC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>and Hawryluk et al. conclude that a large fronto-parieto-temporal (15 cm in diameter) DC should be preferred over a smaller DC in order to reduce mortality and improve neurological outcomes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.**\n\n【43】**However， whether it’s for treatment of the syndrome of the trephined or for aesthetic purposes， the need to reconstruct calvarial defects remains a challenge， especially for very large defects (>150cm) which are rarely described in literature.**\n\n【44】**Historically， replacement of the patient's stored autologous bone flap has represented the first-line treatment for reparation of post-decompressive skull defects， usually taking place between 6 and 12months after surgery. However， complications like bone resorption， infection or chronic scalp wounds can result in a composite skull defect that should be approached by alternate means 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.**\n\n【45】**Nowadays， multiple options for restoring skull integrity following DC or previous autologous bone repositioning failure have been described， and in these cases， reconstruction planning should consider previous scalp incisions， to avoid scalp vessel damage that could bring to necrosis. Moreover， a thorough study of the scalp surface available should be performed， to obtain a tensionless closure. In an article of Nout et al. a CAD-CAM implant for parietal reconstruction was slightly decreased in projection， in order to facilitate wound closure通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. In these cases， CAD-CAM surface measurement can help predict the total skull surface before and after surgery， allowing to prevent potential complications such as skin dehiscence， or in cases when it is most suitable， to suggest the need for free soft tissue transfer or scalp expansion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>， as advised by Baumeister et al.**\n\n【46】**Another important factor to consider for a successful cranioplasty is the choice of the material， which should be carefully made： A recent systematic review reported a 20.64% risk of complications with alloplastic materials， but each of them has advantages and disadvantages that must be considered. Titanium offers low rates of infection (10.7%) and can be easily screwed directly to the adjacent bone； however， it has a higher extrusion rate compared to the**\n\n【47】**other materials， and being radiopaque， it gives problems for tumor surveillance follow-up 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Polyether Ether Ketone (PEEK) offers the advantage that it is radiolucent and hypodense and does not cause radiographic artifacts on CT scans or MRIs \\[11，12\\]. It has a 7.3%infection rate and a lower overall complication rate (17.3% vs. 31.8%for titanium). Polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) implants benefit from this material's strength， radiolucency and relatively low cost compared to the others. Prostheses made of PMMA can be modified intraoperatively using a bur， but， during handling and fixation， cases of prosthesis fracture are described， and account for an overall complication rate of 19% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.**\n\n【48】**In our patient， a large bilateral DC was performed， bringing the total calvarial defect to 254 cm. Due to this impressive bilateral defect， which represented approximately 40% of the total neurocranium， the patient had to rest only in supine position， causing a high risk of pressure sores and making it difficult to move the patient during bed changes or daily hygiene. For these reasons， the patient could not be left to the care of his family and had to stay at along-term care facility.**\n\n【49】**In the months following DC， several episodes of skin flap dehiscence along different parts of the surgical incisions occurred， treated by the neurosurgery and plastic surgery units. After complete healing of the scalp dehiscence， the maxillofacial surgery team was asked to reconstruct the calvarial defect， and with the aid of an engineering team， started programming the reconstruction， and two possible complications were highlighted. The first one is related to the skin quality and its surface； after several episodes of flap dehiscence， the skin resulted heavily scarred， thickened and contracted. The second potential complication is given by the dead space that would follow a cranioplasty which brings the calvaria to its original shape， while the brain would maintain its post-traumatic volume. Free tissue transfer was at first considered as a possible solution； it offers several benefits， including providing durable coverage for skull reconstruction， obliteration of dead space， and is of great benefit in revision cranioplasty patients with chronic overlying wounds lacking adequate soft tissue coverage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. However， free tissue transfer often limits the retention of native hair-bearing scalp skin at the defect site and would have necessitated a two-step surgery for both bringing soft tissue and calvarial custom reconstruction. Moreover，the relatives of the patient denied their consent to the free flap option to preserve a potential donor site from further surgery on such a delicate patient， and they preferred for us to find a solution for the problem without harvesting a free flap.**\n\n【50】**In order to overcomethe potential complications to the procedure， the program of developing adequate implants for cranioplasty firstly focused on the scalp surface， that was measured in the 3D rendering of the TC， giving an estimate of the scalp available (663 cm²). With this data， the biparietal implants for cranioplasty were designed to utilize all the skin surface available for cranioplasty without stretching the already scarred parietal skin， obtaining an undercorrected skull surface . Another concept that was taken into consideration was the volume of the dead space between the implant and the brain； by undercorrecting the custom-made implants， the amount of dead space was dramatically lowered. Despite the large area reconstructed with cranioplasty， thelower portion of the temporal area on both sides**\n\n【51】**was not covered by the implant ， since due to the presence of the zygomatic arch， it was the safest area to leave unreconstructed and could work as a warning sign for the rise of ICP in case of swelling.**\n\n【52】**Conclusion**\n\n【53】**Cranioplasty oflarge calvarial defects with poor soft tissue quality represents a challenge in which the surgeon could need to think\"outside the box\" to solve the problem he is put in front of. We have achieved durable aesthetic and functional results in this setting using undercorrected CAD-CAM PEEK implants for reconstruction，both reducing the risk of skin dehiscence and drastically reducing the intracranial dead space. For these patients， an accurate planning， that takes into consideration both soft and hard tissues is paramount. Further investigations are needed to better examine the long-term results of undercorrected CAD-CAM in cranioplasty patients.**\n\n【54】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【55】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**1\\.

She had diabetes and a history of left-side ureteral cancer， which was surgically removed five years ago. Physical examination revealed a Glasgow Coma Scale of 11 (eyes 4； verbal 2； motor 5) and no focal weakness. Laboratory studies showed a serum calcium level of 15.9 mg per deciliter(normal range， 8.4 to 10.2) and an intact Parathyroid Hormone (PTH) level of 1152.5 pg per milliliter (normal range：15-68.3). A chest radiograph showed a rim calcified tumor in the right neck with mild compression to the trachea . Computed tomography of the neck revealed the calcified tumor， which was located in the right lower lobe of the thyroid gland . There was no abnormal uptake in the Technetium-99m-labeled sestamibi scintigraphy. The patient received parenteral fluid therapy and then surgical removal ofthe tumor. The resected right lower parathyroid gland revealed an encapsulated tumor (measuring 3.2 cm x3.2 cmx 2.5 cm) with neoplastic cells invading the capsule and growing into the adjacent thyroid tissue ， indicating parathyroid carcinoma.

This case suggests the possibility of use of ASV to negate the need for fasciotomies for compartment syndromes complicating snake bites.**\n\n【20】**An 11-year old previously healthy child presented with a history of snake bite on his left hand**\n\n【21】**index finger complicated with progressive painful swelling of his left upper limb. His parents immediately tried to stop the bleeding by sucking out the venom and applying traditional remedies over the wound， though no cuts were made. The parents noticed bruising， bleeding and gradual swelling then， a tourniquet was tied and the patient was brought to the nearest district hospital which was 2 h away. The swelling had progressed over the left wrist and extended half way up the forearm. The tourniquet was immediately removed at the hospital. Intravenous antibiotics and tetanus prophylaxis were administered. He did not have any bleeding or neurological symptoms. However overnight the swelling had progressed beyond the elbow joint and there was bruising and bullae formation over the bite site Painful finger movements on the left hand with absence of radial pulse were noted. The patient was then referred to the orthopedic surgeon at our hospital for management of compartment syndrome.**\n\n【22】**On examination there was swelling of the entire left upper limb extending onto the left shoulder joint. There was significant tenderness on palpation of forearm and arm muscles and pain on passive extension. Radial pulse was palpable. Capillary refill time on the finger beds was less than 3 sec. Local examination revealed evidence of severe envenomation including redness， swelling， blistering and underlying ecchymosis.**\n\n【23】**A diagnosis of compartment syndrome was made. Patient was initially planned for urgent fasciotomy. However， his 20 min Whole Blood Clotting Time (WBCT) was found to be prolonged and he also had prolonged pro thrombin time and International Normalized Ration (INR). In view of the rapidly progressive severe local envenomation signs and deranged coagulation profile， the decision to first administer polyvalent Anti- Snake Venom (ASV) was made， though at that time >24 h had elapsed since the bite. After discussion with the orthopedic surgeon， it was decided to continue ASV and to withhold fasciotomy unless there is no evidence of improvement.**\n\n【24】**During the course of administration of anti-venom， the patient developed early allergic reaction evidenced by cough， scratchy throat， and urticarial rashes and vomiting with presence of hematemesis. The reaction was immediately managed1 with fluids， oxygen， adrenaline， antihistamines and steroids. ASV was stopped and patient was monitored. With resolution of symptoms， the infusion was further diluted and slowly restarted at a slower infusion rate. Is coagulation profile was normalizing at 6 h. Overnight his swelling over the forearm reduced significantly and pain had reduced. With normalization of coagulation profile and improvement of compartment symptoms fasciotomy was withheld. He responded well despite late administration of ASV. His limb swelling drastically improved and was discharged on day 7 of admission.**\n\n【25】**Discussion and Conclusion**\n\n【26】**Epidemiological data on snakebites in Bhutan remain limited.Of what is known and recorded， there are 69 species， of which 15 are venomous snakes belonging to two families， Elapidae and Viperidae6.**\n\n【27】**The timely administration of ASV remains the mainstay to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with snakebites. A retrospective study in Bhutan reported that around 35% of snake bites developed envenomation signs and symptoms. Polyvalent ASV was found to have excellent outcomes with only 7% mortality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.**\n\n【28】**Compartment syndrome involves the sustained elevation of interstitial tissue pressures within an osteofascial envelope to non-physiologic levels. It causes tissue injury leading to irreversible damage and， therefore， early recognition and treatment is critical for optimal outcomes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Alternatively， fasciotomy performed prophylactically may lead to worsened local myonecrosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. In most cases of snakebite， fasciotomy is not necessary. Once administered， anti-venom helps neutralize the venom， reducing compartment pressure and inhibiting the development of compartment syndrome.**\n\n【29】**In our case， in view of deranged coagulation profile， a decision was made to defer fasciotomy and observe response to ASV. Gregory et al.， reiterates that fasciotomy should only be performed in patients with clinical signs and symptoms of compartment syndrome that are present despite elevation of the affectedlimb and administration of 20vials of anti-venom 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. A study by Hall noted that， out of 1，257 cases of extremity bites only two required fasciotomies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.**\n\n【30】**In contrast， a recent study， where intra-compartmental pressures were measured for diagnosis of compartment syndrome， recorded a higher rate fasciotomies at 10.8%. As in the discussed case， the local and systemic envenomation effects of venom closely resemble the signs and symptoms of compartment syndrome. Fasciotomy， in the past， could have been withheld in patients with actual compartment syndrome， attributing the symptoms to the venom 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.**\n\n【31】**Initiation of anti-venom should not be held for delayed presentation of snakebites. Prophylactic fasciotomies should be considered after correction of hematological parameters. Though controversial， it is still prudent to start ASV first with closely monitoring and consider surgery only if compartment symptoms persist with failed response to ASV. ASV can， not only reverse coagulopathy， but may also be helpful in reducing symptoms of compartment syndrome， thereby negating the need for fasciotomies.**\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>1\\.

We present a case of a 49 year old female with left lung mass and left pleural nodule showing typical clinical and radiologic features of pulmonary synovial sarcoma with focal unusual histomorphology. While dense cellularity， interlacing fascicles， and hyalinized stroma were seen， this tumour showed unusual histologic features not usually seen with pulmonary synovial sarcoma but typical of other neoplasms， in particular， Verocay bodies， rhabdoid morphology， and vague rosette formation. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated Pan-Cytokeratin and CK7 immunoreactivity with focal S-100 expression， but were negative for muscle markers， other melanoma markers， and CD34. The tumour was negative for t(x；18).

Molecular testing for the pathognomonic t(x； 18) chromosomal translocation has enabled diagnostic confirmation in approximately 90% of cases通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. In t(x； 18) negative cases， diagnosis must rely on histologic and immunophenotypic features. The differential diagnosis of primary pulmonary synovial sarcoma is particularly challenging when histologic features unusual to synovial sarcoma， but common to other neoplasms are focally present. This challenge is compounded with negative t(x； 18) findings. We present a case ofprimary pulmonary synovial sarcoma where unusual histology was present and t(x； 18) was negative. We offer diagnostic pearls to prevent misdiagnosis in such challenging cases.**\n\n【15】**Case Presentation**\n\n【16】**A 49 year old female presented with chest pain and shortness of breath with no significant medical or family history. Laboratory and cardiac work-up was normal and chest x-ray showed a left pulmonary mass. Computed tomography redemonstrated the pulmonary mass with likely metastatic left pleural nodule . Biopsy and surgical excision of tumour showed classic monophasic pulmonary synovial sarcoma histology with dense spindled cellularity， interlacing fascicles， and hyalinized stroma as diagnosed by a pulmonary pathologist， however with focal Verocay body formation， rhabdoid morphology and vague rosette formation . Immunohistochemistry showed pancytokeratin and CK7 immunoreactivity with focal S-100expression， but were negative for muscle markers， other melanoma markers， and CD34. The SYT/SSX RNA fusion transcripts resulting from t{x； 18) 通用删除11(英):<u>(p11； q11)</u> translocation were not detected using real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. The patient showed no sign of widespread metastatic disease and was treated with complete resection of tumour and received adjuvant radiation treatment. The patient presented with recurrence and pericardial seeding eight months later and died of disease 10 months following diagnosis.**\n\n【17】**Discussion**\n\n【18】**Synovial sarcoma， although rare， is a primary pulmonary neoplasm with distinctive histology. The presence of focal unusual histologic findings characteristic of more common epithelial and mesenchymal tumors may lead to misdiagnosis. This is particularly problematic in small biopsies or in primary pulmonary synovial sarcomas that are negative for the pathognomonic t(x； 18) translocation. We present a case of primary pulmonary synovial sarcoma with unusual histologic**\n\n【19】**Figure 1： Synovial sarcomain a 49 year-old female with dyspnea and pleuritic chest pain. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan demonstrates a predominantly cystic mass with an eccentrically thickened wall (asterisk) and peripheral rim enhancement. A metastatic nodule is seen (arrowhead) along the lateral pleural surface.**\n\n【20】**Figure 2： Typical histologic features of pulmonary synovial sarcoma characteristically composed of densely cellular interlacing fascicles.**\n\n【21】Figure 3： Unusual histologic features that may lead to misdiagnosis include Verocay body-like areas.\n\n【22】**features， negative for t(x；18). The focal unusual histology in primary pulmonary synovial sarcoma can erroneously suggest more common primary and metastatic pulmonary neoplasms. Verocay body-like areas in this case were similar to those seen in malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. The stromal background of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor， however， typically lacks hyalinization and appears more basophilic. While focal immunoreactivity for S-100 can be present in both tumors， 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u> primary pulmonary synovial sarcoma is often immunoreactive for cytokeratin 7， a finding not generally seen in malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Clinically， malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors arise from nerve or neurofibroma and are associated with neurofibromatosis type I in approximately two-thirds of cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Primary pulmonary synovial sarcoma with focal vague rosette formation can leadto misdiagnosis as primitive neuroectodermal tumor \\[6，7\\]. Primary pulmonary synovial sarcoma may also be reminiscent of primitive neuroectodermal**\n\n【23】**Figure 4： Rhabdoid morphology and vague rosette formation.**\n\n【24】**tumor when the former is poorly differentiated and displays round cell morphology. Unlike primary pulmonary synovial sarcoma， primitive neuroectodermal tumor typically has distinct cell borders， clear cytoplasm， scant stroma， and lacks hemangiopericytoma-like vasculature typically seen with primary pulmonary synovial sarcoma. Both tumors can express CD99，CD56， and cytokeratins， 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u> although expression of cytokeratin 7 makes a diagnosis of primitive neuroectodermal tumor less likely 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Chromosomal translocation t (11； 22) is present in 85% of primitive neuroectodermal tumors通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. We present a case of primary pulmonary synovial sarcoma with focal unusual histologic features that may erroneously suggest more common primary and metastatic pulmonary neoplasms. This unusual histology may be particularly chalenging in small biopsies or when t(x； 18) is negative. Awareness of typical histology of pulmonary synovial sarcoma， their potential misleading unusual morphologic features， and prudent use of Immunohistochemistry will prevent misdiagnosis， even in t(x； 18)-negative cases.**\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>1\\.

There is reported significant negative association of semen volume， total sperm count， sperm motility， and morphology with advanced male partner’s age. Therefore， combination of the sperm preparation and assisted reproductive treatment were used for a better chance of pregnancy. This study was aimed to evaluate the in fluence of age on the sperm quality and pregnancy outcome in couple with subfertility undergoing Intrauterine Insemination (IUI).**\n\n【12】**Material and Methods： This retrospective cross-sectional study in vestigating 181 cases of IUI cycles from reproductive clinic of two public universities from January 2019 to December 2020. They were categorized into study group (male partner’s age 40 years and above) and control group (male partner’s age less than 40 years old). Sperm parameter reports were extracted from the patients records. Clinical pregnancy was the criteria for the IUI success.**\n\n【13】**Results： The mean age of male and female partners were similar in both groups. Sperm parameters showed an improvement after density gradient centrifugation sperm preparation with significant results in grade 1 and grade 3 sperm motility. There was no significant different in the clinical pregnancy between the groups.**\n\n【14】**Conclusion： There is an improvement in sperm parameters after density gradient centrifugation and the male age is not significantly affect the pregnancy outcome following IUI. Further study with larger sample is needed to confirm these findings.**\n\n【15】**Keywords： Density gradient centrifugation； Insemination； Paternal age； Pregnancy outcome； Semen analysis**\n\n【16】**Introduction**\n\n【17】**Lately， the topic of male infertility has been popularly discussed. A man who failed to produce high quality sperm in terms of density， motility and morphology is considered as infertile male. There are increase rates of infertility and adverse pregnancy outcomes seen after the age of 40 years old (independent of female partner’s age)， thus the male age factor might have some contribution to this matter， even though the spermatogenesis known to continue in elderly men， in contrast to oogenesis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. From the literature， contribution to conception by male partner is still occur ev after 40 years of sexual maturity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. But， degenerative changes in germinal epithelium occur with aging， causing Leydig cells to reduce in quantity and its function， thus affecting the spermatogenesis process due to decrease testosterone level， in which it starts at 30 years ofage \\[1，3，4\\]. Studies suggest that male partner's age is associated with diminished semen volume， sperm motility and/or sperm morphology. Increasing seminal ROS levels and changes in epididymal and accessory sex gland function may be possible causative factors for the decline in motility with aging. Emergence idea of intrauterine insemination with sperm preparation has shown some improvement in semen parameters but with conflicting data. In this respect， our objective is to established evidence on influence of age on the sperm quality and effect of density gradient centrifugation on pregnancy outcome in infertile couple undergoing Intrauterine Insemination (IUI).**\n\n【18】**This was a retrospective cross-sectional study involving two university hospitals in Malaysia**\n\n【19】**with fertility services. Completed one hundred and eighty-one IUI cycles from January 1， 2019 to December 31， 2020 were included in this study.**\n\n【20】**Couples who underwent IUI during the study period were enrolled in this study. Only the first IUI cycle of the couples were included in the study.**\n\n【21】**The inclusion criteria were as follow： Men age between 18 to 70years old， with semen analysis results either normal or one， or two of the sperm parameters were below the normal value established by the WHO 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. The semen parameters are the sperm count， sperm motility with characterized into Grade 1 (rapid and slow linear progressive motility)， Grade 2 (non-progressive motility) and Grade 3 (immotile spermatozoa). The female partner had regular menstrual cycle， normal pelvic ultrasound findings and at least one fallopian tube patent in hysteroscopy or laparoscopy dye insufflation test.**\n\n【22】**The exclusion criteria were including men with azoospermia， femalepartnerwith endometriosis，polycystic ovarian syndrome，poor ovarian responder， or premature ovarian insufficiency. Incomplete data on pre- and post-processing semen analysis or missing data regarding the pregnancy outcome were also being excluded.**\n\n【23】**All the data such as age of the couple， duration of infertility， semen analysis parameters before and after sperm processing， and the IUI results were obtained from the patient’s records. Pregnancy was defined as positive serum beta Human Chorionic Gonadotropin(b-HCG) taken at 14 days after IUI followed by presence of the fetal heart activity after 6 weeks period of a menorrhea.**\n\n【24】**The eligible couple were stratified into two groups according to the male partner’s age - study group (male partner’s age 40 years and above) and control group (male partner's age less than 40 years old). The semen parameters and pregnancy outcome were compared between the groups.**\n\n【25】**Semen sample collection and preparation for IUI**\n\n【26】**Semen samples were collected from the male partners following2 to 5 days of sexual abstinence by masturbation in sterile plastic containers at the clinic. Liquefaction was performed at roor temperature for 30 min. The initial analysis of the semen parameters(semen volume， sperm count， and sperm motility) was performed manually according to WHO guidelines 通用删除7(英):<u>(2010)</u> 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.**\n\n【27】**Subsequently the semen samples were processed using the density gradient centrifugation to remove seminal fluid and enhance sperm quality for IUI. The total volume of semen was divided so that a 15-ml conical tube marked with patient's identification would contain2 ml of a 90% density lower layer， 2 ml of a 45% density upper layer， and 2 ml of semen upper most layer. A gentle and careful move was required to ensure the layers were not mixed-up at each centrifugal stage. The sample was then centrifuged at 1，500 rpm for 20 min at Room Temperature (RT). After centrifugation， the supernatant was removed and the spermatozoa (pellet) was placed into another 15-ml conical tube， which contained 2.0 ml of sperm rinsing medium and mixed thoroughly； it was then centrifuged at 1，500 rpm for 10 min at room temperature. The supernatant was again removed， and the final pellet was suspended in the same medium solution， obtaining a final volume of 0.5 ml. A 10-ul aliquot was used to perform the analysis of post-processing seminal parameters. The motility of spermatozoa in the sample determined and incubated sample at 37°C until ready for insemination. The Makler counting chamber was used to assess**\n\n【28】**the count and motility and the processed sample in the best possible way. The sample was ensured to maintain its temperature at 37°Cby placing it in a test tube warmer before IUI procedure.**\n\n【29】**Ovulation induction and insemination**\n\n【30】**Standard protocol was used involving administration of 100 mg clomiphene citrate from the second day of menstruation for five days and injection of human menopausal gonadotropins (75 IU to 150IU) on day five onwards up to day ten of menstruation， either daily or every other day. When at least one follicle achieved more than 17mm， intramuscular HCG 10，000 IU was given for final maturation. Single insemination was done at thirty-six hours later with 0.5 mL to 1.0 mL of processed sperm from the fresh semen sample， injected intrauterine using a Gynetics catheter. After the insemination the patient was lying in the supine position for 15 min to 30 min. Oral dydrogesterone 10 mg three times daily was prescribed for the luteal phase support.**\n\n【31】**Statistical analysis**\n\n【32】**The Statistical Package for Social Sciences for Windows 通用删除1(英):<u>(SPSS version 22.0)</u> was used to record and analyzed the data. Quantitative variables were compared using Mann-Whitney test and the results were expressed as mean ± Standard Deviation (SD) and percentage. Categorical variables were evaluated using the Chi-squareand Fisher's exact test. A p-value of less than 0.05 is considered as statistically significant.**\n\n【33】**Results**\n\n【34】**A total of 181 of IUI cycles， from January 15， 2019 and December31，2020， were analyzed. The mean (± Standard Deviation， SD) age of male and female partner included in this analysis were similar for each group. Majority of the indication for the IUI was unexplained infertility .**\n\n【35】**Table 2 showed the results of sperm parameters of the two studied groups. As can be noted， there was no difference of sperm parameters among the male partner with different age groups. There was an improvement in the sperm concentration and Grade 1 sperm motility after the DGC， however not statistically significant. In the study group (male age 40 years and above)， there is significant increment in the grade 1 sperm motility and significant reduction of immotile sperm after GDC as illustrated in Table 3. Regarding the successful pregnancy， there was also no significant difference of the semen parameters between the studied group . The number of pregnancies was higher in group of male partner less than 40years old， compared with older age male partner，however， it was not statistically significant .**\n\n【36】**Discussion**\n\n【37】**Semen fluid analysis is the first step in the evaluation of male infertility. Semen characteristics that being evaluated includes the volume， sperm concentration， sperm motility， and sperm morphology.

In conjunction， study in Central India by classified age 36 to 42 as under the 3d group in a five-age class (21 to 60 years) that is relates with the decline in semen parameters and it is significant when the individual is after the age of 35通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Meanwhile， Gao et al. revealed a significant association between the increasing age and a drop in sperm quantity and quality based on 7-age groups among men aged25 to 51 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. The large dispersion also believed to derive this smaller**\n\n【54】**number of groupings to elucidate age as factors in differentiating the sperm counts. This study showed better sperm motility of the younger male compared to the older male who aged more than 40years old. Therefore， testing the subjects with different age level may validate the influence of age on semen parameters at certain degree of comparison.**\n\n【55】**Most of the finding showed an increase of the mean value in the count and motility. The significant difference was obtained in the study mostly in the post DGC for Grade 3 motility (immotile**\n\n【56】**sperm) suggesting positive effect of DGC on semen motility. Density gradient is the preferred technique for sperm processing for ART as it improved sperm motility and quality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. This study also highlighted the higher chance of pregnancy in female with the male partner who aged less than 40 years old， control group (3.3%) compared to female with male partner aged more than 40 years old. It showed that as the age of the couple grows older， the likelihood of pregnancy decreases， and most studies link aging to a drop in sperm parameters 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.**\n\n【57】**On a separate note， Dong et al. concluded that chances of pregnancy from IUI decreases as semen sample contained lower than 2 million motile sperm 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Thus， other studies specified that pregnancy from IUI is more probable with the existing of linear progressive motile among pairings with subfertility male with the higher likelihood of pregnancy from larger counts of post-prepared sperm with greater motility in IUI \\[13，14\\]. In addition， Ajayi et al. suggested than men with lower sperm counts had a 4 times higher likelihood to develop progressive sperm motility than men with normal sperm counts 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. Somehow， Ombelet et al. reviewed that studies should consider association of sperm parameters with other factors that may determine the success of IUI such as female age and period of subfertility. In addition， they iterate that prediction on pregnancy rate is acceptable yet considered as poor in sensitivity as comparison made with standardized limit sperm counts classing. Perhaps this study may output to different significance if sperm counts categorized in to non-parametric groupings for comparison with the nominal measure of pregnancy status. For the time being， this study suggests that IUI has done effectively in ensuring pregnancy from samples with lower sperm counts from pre-processed total or from post-processed non-progressive spermatozoa that originates from men below 40 years old. On the other side， female may conceive offspring in relation with lower counts of motile sperm or higher counts of immotile sperm after the post wash procedures conducted for semen samples of men aged 40 and above 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>.**\n\n【58】**Readings of bHCG level recorded pregnancy outcome either pregnant or not were insignificantly correlated with male age group as a result from IUI denoted from Fisher's Exact Test p-value of 0.185. This hypothesis in several manner is consistent with findings from other study with differing fertilization procedures that remarks male age as not a defining factors of pregnancy rates or outcome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17-20\\]</u>. On the other hand， Tatsumi et al. described age among men does not correlate with pregnancy outcome， yet simulation from IUI revealed women at the age of 38 to 40 years old as the sole factor influencing chances of pregnancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>.**\n\n【59】**Conclusion**\n\n【60】**In conclusion， similar semenparameters andcomparable pregnancy outcome was seen among couples with male partner's age below and above 40 years old. There was an improvement in sperm parameters after density gradient centrifugation which may involve in the achievement of pregnancy following IUI. This study is limited to sperm count and motility without analysis of morphology and sperm DNA， therefore further study with these added sperm parameters and larger sample could be considered in the future study.**\n\n【61】**Acknowledgement**\n\n【62】**The authors thank the patients of the Advanced Reproductive Centre (ARC)， Hospital Canselor Tuanku Muhriz， Kuala Lumpur who were involved in the study.**\n\n【63】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【64】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**1\\.

However， renal biopsy is rarely available in cancer patients who underwent systemic treatment； therefore， the renal consequences caused by inhibition of VEGF are usually underestimated. In here， we report a case of pancreatic cancer patient who developed proteinuria under the treatment of bevacizumab. The efficacy and side effects of bevacizumab were reported， and the mechanism of proteinuria and the principle of treatment were explored.**\n\n【15】**Introduction**\n\n【16】**More than 15 years ago， anti-angiogenic therapy firstly entered clinical practice， marking the new edge of anti-cancer treatment. The representative drug is bevacizumab， a VEGF-A targeting monoclonal antibody. Combining with chemotherapies， it has been widely used in oncology therapeutic areas with eight approved indications across different types of solid tumors， including Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)， Metastatic Colorectal Cancer (mCRC)， Glioblastoma(GBM)， Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC)， Ovarian Cancer (OC) and cervical cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.**\n\n【17】**However， bevacizumab has also shown efficacy in other types of solid tumors， for example， pancreatic cancer， which has very poor prognosis and causes huge disease burden for patients due to the limited options of treatment. Cutting edge researches consistently show that angiogenesis is the prerequisite for invasive tumor growth and distant metastasis. Therefore， anti-angiogenic drugs are valuable options for treatment of pancreatic cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.**\n\n【18】**Several clinical trials have shown the efficacy of bevacizumab in patients with pancreatic cancer. In a phase II clinical study， bevacizumab combined with gemcitabine in the treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer achieved an obiective effective rate of 21% and a disease control rate of 46%， with median PFS 5.7 months and a median OS 8.8 months 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Similarly， a phase III trial also demonstrates that combining bevacizumab with gemcitabine significantly improved PFS in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer (HR， 0.73；95% CI， 0.61 to 0.86；P=0.0002)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.**\n\n【19】**Due to the unique mechanism of inhibiting VEGF， bevacizumab has many adverse effects， including hypertension， proteinuria， bleeding， thrombosis， gastrointestinal perforation， and congestive heart failure， etc. Among them， proteinuria and hypertension are the second most common adverse effects after bleeding， and are often considered as dose limiting toxicity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.**\n\n【20】**Considering the high incidence of proteinuria and its damage for kidney， it is urgent for clinician to notice this bevacizumab-related proteinuria.**\n\n【21】**Case Presentation**\n\n【22】**A 56-year-old female patient had a medical history of hypertension for more than 18 years， with a maximum blood pressure reading of 185/105 mmHg. Blood pressure was controlled with compound-reserpine-triamterene tablets. In March 2019， the patient underwent duodenum-preserving pancreatic head resection due to the discovery of a pancreatic head mass， and postoperative pathology revealed poorly-differentiated adenocarcinoma of the pancreas， invasion of the common bile duct， and no lymph node metastases. After surgery， 6 cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy with capecitabine were performed (March 2019 to September 2019). In March2020， examination showed elevated serum carbohydrate antigen 19-9(CA19-9)>1000 U/mL；PET-CT demonstrated the following： Abnormal increased metabolic signals in the region of the first**\n\n【23】**Figure 1： Renal biopsy pathology revealed proliferative glomerulonephritis(moderate) with segmental sclerosis， which wasconsistent with IgAnephropathy grade considering tagetherthe findings of immunohistochemistry.

Considering the disease progression， erlotinib combined with gemcitabine was initiated then discontinued after7 days (due to systemic pruritic rash). Subsequently， the patient was given 6 cycles of first-line chemotherapy with gemcitabine1.4 mg d1， d8 + carboplatin 300 mg d1 + bevacizumab 600 mg d2(21-day cycles) from March 2020 to August 2020. After 6 cycles of treatment， disease assessment revealed stable disease. Bevacizumab600 mg d1 (21-day cycle) maintenance therapy was performed for 2cycles from August 2020 to November 2020. During treatment， the patient had intermittent epitasis and grade I-II myelosuppression. In April 2020， routine urinalysis showed trace urinary protein and erythrocytes 90/uL. The patient reported intermittent foamy urine that became more noticeable over time since July. In October， the patient developed hypertension with a maximum of 205/105 mmHg following bevacizumab administration， and the blood pressure was poorly controlled with compound-reserpine-triamterene tablets and metoprolol. Repeat urinalyses all revealed proteinuria， specific gravity 1.040， pH 6.5， white blood cells 108.3/uL， red blood cells51.7/uL， poikilocytes 100%， and protein >3.5 g/L. 24-h urine protein quantification was 0.96 g to 2.07 g.**\n\n【25】**Due to persistent proteinuria， renal biopsy was performed under local anesthesia on December 2020. Pathology under light microscopy showed proliferative glomerulonephritis (moderate) with segmentalglomerulosclerosilsSwhich， wWhen considered together with immunohistochemistry findings， was consistent with IgA nephropathy grade III. Immunofluorescence： IgA+. Electron microscopy： consistent with proliferative glomerulonephritis (Figure1). Therefore， following the initiation of nifedipine and losartan potassium tablets， the patient's proteinuria gradually turned negative aS St2and the hypertension was stable and well controlled. A repeat bone scan in December 2020 revealed bone metastases， and patients underwent subsequent treatment of second-line chemotherapy with**\n\n【26】**pemetrexed + oxaliplatin. Urinalysis showed no definite proteinuria. The patient died from disease progression in March 2022.**\n\n【27】**Discussion**\n\n【28】**Advanced pancreatic cancer has the shortest life expectancy among solid tumors. Whether in developing or developed countries， the overall five-year survival rate is about 6% ranging from 2%to 9% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Gemcitabine acts as the backbone of chemotherapy， with a response rate of only 5% and Overall Survival (OS) of 5.7months when used alone. In addition， Gemcitabine combined with capecitabine， irinotecan or oxaliplatin， have also not showed survival advantages compared with single agent gemcitabine. Therefore， great expectations were placed on the combination of gemcitabine with novel drugs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. With the combination therapy of bevacizumab and gemcitabine， our patient experienced a prolonged PFS of the first-line regimen of 8.3 months， and OS was >24 months， which proved to be a remarkable survival benefit that is rarely seen in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer.**\n\n【29】**Unlike conventional cytotoxic chemotherapies， bevacizumab-related proteinuria and/or hypertension occurred in up to 20% to30% of patients. The VEGF signaling pathway plays an important role in angiogenesis and maintenance of hemodynamic function. VEGF is expressed on glomerular podocytes， while its receptors are present on glomerular endothelial cells； VEGF expression is also important for maintaining glomerular structure and function， and either overexpression or down-regulation of VEGF may cause glomerular disease.**\n\n【30】**According to previous studies， proteinuria and/or hypertension associated with bevacizumab have the following characteristics：firstly， bevacizumab-induced proteinuria is dose dependent， with higher doses being associated with a higher incidence of proteinuria通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Secondly， the severity of proteinuria does not necessarily reflect the severity of renal pathological damage； many patients with Thrombotic Microangiopathy (TMA) as the only sign of nephropathy may also have grade I-II proteinuria 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. In addition， animal models have suggested that renal damage caused by bevacizumab is related to high dosages， but there is no definite correlation between the severity of renal pathological changes and the severity of proteinuria associated with bevacizumab 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.**\n\n【31】**Renal biopsy pathology is the most critical tool for diagnosing bevacizumab-inducedrenal injuryandprognosis. A review of previous studies of VEGF-related renal injury showed that， of 15 cases with renal biopsy pathology findings， 9 revealed TMA， 24-h proteinuria ranged from 0.16 g/24 h to 5.3 g/24 h， and other pathological changes including collapsing-like focal segmental glomerulosclerosis(cFSGS； _2_ cases)，proliferativeglomerulonephritis，immune complex glomerulonephritis， IgA nephropathy， and crescenti glomerulonephritis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. In the largest-scale pathological analysis from an 8-year observational study of VEGF antibody-induced renal injury， 100 patients with proteinuria and/or hypertension/renal insufficiency underwent renal biopsy at 6.87 ± 7.18 months after treatment initiation. Anti-VEGF medications included VEGF mAb and VEGF tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Seventy-three of these patients presented with renal TMA， and the remaining 27 patients had various glomerulopathies， mainly minimal-change disease (MCN) and/or FSGS. Renal injury caused by bevacizumab was primarily TMA， with only 1 FSGS reported. Both proteinuria and hypertension recovered after bevacizumab discontinuation and initiation of antihypertensive drugs， and there were no patients with severe renal failure requiring**\n\n【32】**dialysis， suggesting that glomerular lesions caused by VEGF-targeted drugs are common with the main pathological changes being TMA and MCN/cFSGS， but with an overall favorable prognosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Therefore， careful risk assessment at an individual level is helpful to identify renal injury and determine appropriate management. In addition， the severity of proteinuria does not always mirror the severity of renal pathological changes， so it is essential to consider renal biopsy in patients with persistent proteinuria.**\n\n【33】**In this case report， proteinuria (graded 1 to 2 according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events \\[CTCAE\\] version5.0 classification) occurred after more than 6 months of bevacizumab treatment and lasted for more than 1 month. The proteinuria did not resolve immediately after bevacizumab discontinuation. Hypertension， which was emergent during bevacizumab treatment， was refractory. Therefore， renal biopsy was performed. Pathology suggested proliferative glomerulonephritis， IgA nephropathy and benign sclerosis， without severe pathological changes such as TMA. After medical intervention with Angiotensin-Converting-Enzyme Inhibitors (ACEIs) and Angiotensin Receptor Blockers (ARBs)， the patient's hypertension was well controlled and stable， and the proteinuria gradually became negative and did not recur after further chemotherapy. The outcome was consistent with pathological changes of the kidney， avoiding the implementation of overtreatment or delayed anticancer therapy and without affecting the prognosis.**\n\n【34】**In summary， bevacizumab-related proteinuria is not necessarily a dose-limiting toxicity. It is important to periodically monitor renal function， routine urinalysis， and blood pressure during treatment，and to proactively control blood pressure within the normal range. For patients with persistent proteinuria， renal biopsy upon discontinuing the drug is safe and reliable， which is helpful in determining the prognosis and choosing further therapeutic drugs. For patients who have benign glomerular lesions as the main feature， ACEIs and ARBs can be selected to control hypertension and reduce proteinuria.**\n\n【35】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【36】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**1\\.

There was evidence of widespread infiltration of benign appearing histiocytes with hemophagocytosis in the lymphoreticular system on autopsy. They defined this syndrome as familial hemophagocytic reticulosis， which is currently known as HLH. The estimated incidence is approximately 1.2 cases per 1，000，000 individuals per year \\[21.**\n\n【12】**HLH is due to various pathophysiological pathways： 1) Hyperactivation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and macrophages；2) proliferation and infiltration of macrophages into various organs； and 3) elevated levels of various cytokines， resulting in progressive organ dysfunction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. More researches have shown down regulation of proapoptotic signals and genes related to innate and adaptive immune responses as well as up regulation of genes coding for proinflammatory cytokines and antiapoptotic factors to be important pathological mechanism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.**\n\n【13】**HLH can beprimary (congenital) or secondary (acquired). Mostly， secondary HLH is arbitrarily divided into three groups depending on the diseases. A-HLH denotes autoimmune disease-associated HLH， whereas HLH triggered by malignancy and infection is denoted by M-HLH and I-HLH，respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. HLH associated with miliary tuberculosis is rare with higher mortality rates通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.**\n\n【14】**Pathogenetic mechanism of primary HLH is associated with genetic mutations of perforin and vesicle trafficking genes. It is commonly found in children and adults with primary immunodeficiencies like Chediak-Higashi. The clinical outcome of primary HLH is fatal if immunosuppressive chemotherapy not initiated at an early stage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Acquired HLH in otherwise healthy persons is also associated with infections like Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV)， Herpes Simplex virus and tuberculosis bacterium \\[5，6\\].**\n\n【15】**Amongst infections， EBV is reported to be most common cause of HLH however； TB-HLH is less commonly reported. Incidence rate of TB is very high in Southeast Asian and developing countries like India 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Since， diagnosis of HLH is commonly missed； high degree of suspicion is required for its diagnosis， particularly with conditions like TB which can have varied clinical manifestations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.**\n\n【16】**Thus， understanding the prognosis and characteristics of secondary TB-HLH in order to achieve early recognition and treatment is extremely necessary to prevent irreversible tissue damage. Thereby， in this manuscript we describe a patient of tuberculosis complicated with HLH.**\n\n【17】**Case Presentation**\n\n【18】**A 44 years old male was admitted with complaints ofhigh-grade fever， cough with expectoration， worsening breathlessness for one week and tachypnea for last 2 months.

Furthermore， there was increased number of histiocytes with some showing evidence of hemophagocytosis. However， Ziehl Neelson staining for acid fast bacilli was negative. Thereafter， further investigations and workup for tuberculosis associated HLH was done.**\n\n【33】**Plasma fibrinogen was within normal levels (233 mg/dl) whereas lipid profile showed raised serum triglyceride levels (193 mg/dl). Hyponatremia and hyperkalemia were present along with raised urea and creatinine. Hyperferritinemia (>1800 ng/mL)， raised lactate dehydrogenase (920IU/L)and elevated ESR (50 mm in 1h) was also present. The Mantoux test was negative. However，real time PCR test with sputum sample was reported to be positive for tuberculosis.**\n\n【34】**Thus， as per HLH-2004 Protocol  and after correlating with clinical details， radiological and real time PCR positivity on sputum sample， diagnosis of tuberculosiIsSwith secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis was made.**\n\n【35】**The patient was managed with supportive measures. Later on， he was started on Anti-Tubercular Therapy (ATT) along with steroids. He was discharged in a stable condition but patient did not come for follow up.**\n\n【36】**Discussion**\n\n【37】**TB-HLHilsSatype of severe tuberculosis， diagnostically challenging for clinicians as its most common clinical presentation is Pyrexia of Unknown Origin (PUO). This condition was first reported in the 1980s but since last few years there are many cases reported in literature on TB-HLH通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.**\n\n【38】**Here， we report a rare case of TB associated HLH in an adult male diagnosed using PCR performed on sputum sample and bone marrow examination. The patient was successfully treated with ATT and corticosteroids. In this case， clinical suspicion of miliary TB was made with the help of history and physical examination. TB is widespread in Asian countries， including India， and is one of the important causes of but due to lack of precise diagnosis and non-specificity of clinical manifestations， early detection is quite difficult7，9\\].**\n\n【39】**Mycobacterium TB is an obligate intracellular pathogen which exacerbate macrophage over activity as well as Thl cell mediated**\n\n【40】**cytotoxicity thereby resulting in HLH. It is evidenced by increased serum levels of IFN-y，M CSF， and TNF-a in patients with tuberculosis通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Therefore， high TNF-a and IFN-y results in hematopoiesis suppression along with apoptosis thus， resulting in cytopenia. Inhibition of lipoprotein lipase results in hypertriglyceridemia and macrophage over activity leading to excess release of ferritin (an acute phase reactant) in response to inflammatory cytokines； tissue infiltration causes organomegaly， and fever is secondary to release of cytokines like IL 1， IL 6 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.**\n\n【41】**Literature shows that in patients diagnosed with TB complicated with HLH， there is 100% mortality if they did not receive ATT， whereas there is 40% to 60% reduction in mortality rate by combination of ATT and immunotherapy. Suppression of cytokine storm is of utmost importance in patients with HLH for long-term efficacy of ATT and needs to be done by induction of immunotherapy at an early stage of treatment. Thus， it was observed that patients who received immunotherapy alone also experienced significantly higher overall survival rates than patients who did not receive \\[7，10，11\\].**\n\n【42】**Highly elevated level of ferritin is an important prognostic marker and is strongly associated with HLH. Lin et al. concluded in a study that a rapid rate of fall in ferritin levels following therapy initiation was directly proportionate to overall survival and thereby associated with decreased mortality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. However， Park et al. in their23 patients of secondary HLH found that the rate of decline in ferritin was not associated with survival whereas high fibrinogen at the time of diagnosis was significantly associated with decreased mortality通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Similarly， Padhi et al. found that high serum ferritin (>1000 ng/mL) was an important indicator of disease severity and was associated with decreased survival， but the results were statistically insignificant on univariate analysis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.**\n\n【43】**Inour case， patient wwaass clinically suspectedaass miliary tuberculosis， having fever with organomegaly. Evidence of cytopenia and hemophagocytosis on bone marrow examination led to suspicion**\n\n【44】of TB-HLH which was confirmed by further biochemical results including hyperferritinemia， hypertriglyceridemia and elevated liver enzymes.\n\n【45】**In conclusion， this case illustrates early diagnostic challenges of both HLH and miliary tuberculosis. It provides the need for deep understanding of possible triggers of HLH， with more attention on TB-associated HLH since TB is most common infection in developing countries. In patients with tuberculosis who present with cytopenia(s)， coagulopathy， high triglyceride levels， HLH should be considered as a differential diagnosis. Till date literature highlights the fact that TB HLH have an unpredictable and/or poor outcome with or without ATT. Thus， early diagnosis and initiation of ATT， even in the presence of disseminated disease might alter the final outcome towards favorable in such cases.**\n\n【46】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【47】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**1\\.

However， unlike other solid organs such as kidneys and liver， only 15% to 25% oflungs from donors are transplanted 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Therefore， Ex Vivo Lung Perfusion (EVLP) has become an essential tool to expand the number of lung donors in recent years.**\n\n【23】**Case Presentation**\n\n【24】**A 52-year-old male with a past medical history of depression and atrial fibrillation was offered as a potential Maastricht III donor. The patient had a P/F of 320 mmHg， normal bronchoscopy， and condensation on the Right Lower Lobe (RLL) on the X-ray and CT scan . Grafts were accepted for in situ evaluation. During the assessment， asystole was confirmed 45 min after withdrawal with a warm ischemic time of 30 min. After flushing and macroscopic inspection of the grafts， modest bilateral edema was discovered along with RLL atelectasis. Therefore， an Ex Vivo Evaluation (EVLP) was considered for a reconditioning and further evaluation of the organs. Miscommunication between the harvesting and implanting teams resulted in separate storage and transport of the. Nevertheless， EVLP evaluation was approved， and the organs were brought to**\n\n【25】**Figure 1： Organ in the LS-1 organ chamber during perfusion prior to ventilation， and after table surgery adjustment.**\n\n【26】Figure 2A： Donor's X-ray.

A 1/2，3/8-inch “y’connector with a piece of priming hues on the 1/2 end and a silk ligature around each dissected pulmonary artery was used to adapt the circulatory circuit . The same was done for the airway， a pace of hues with ventilator adapter in a 1/2 end of the y connector. While a silk ligature around the 3/8 end of the connector and the left main bronchus was enough to fitting and secure it (Figure4)， an extra maneuver was required due to a size discrepancy of the main right bronchus. The short remaining trachea was split， and a supplementary pace of hues was placed over the 3/8 end to adapt the gauge . Thus， securing it with a tie was possible and final reassembly of the airway was accomplished. Extra silk sutures on the edge of the bronchus were placed and tied on the 1/2 end to prevent displacement during ventilation . After table surgery the organs were placed in the perfusion chamber  and modified ex-vivo Lund protocol was followed. During 90 min of perfusion， the lungs showed steady PA pressure， PVR， proper**\n\n【29】**Figure 4： Y connector one end on the left main bronchus with silk tight.

In Pakistan alone the prevalence ofGDM is approximately12% of all pregnancies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. GDM has been related with a multitude of factors that include genetic， epigenetic and environmental factors. Furthermore， GDM is associated with both short term and long-term complications and thereby causes a lot of stress to both the mother and the developing fetus. Stress in not only limited to physical stress but also extends to mental and psychological stress to the expecting mother and pregnant females with GDM are four times likely to develop psychological stress 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. In recent years the role of genetic factors in GDM 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u> and psychological and behavioral reactions have started to gain global attention 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Genetic studies such as Genome Wide Studies (GWAS) have successfully lead to discoveries of Single-Nucleotide Polymorphisms(SNPs)， common genetic variants and new loci that are related to common complex diseases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Such studies along with meta-analysis， case-control analysis and linkage analysis have identified candidate genes in the etiology of both GDM 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u> and psychological stress disorders. However genetic studies that link GDM with psychological stress are less well studied. The aim of this review is to understand the association of genetic changes particularly single nucleotide polymorphisms common in females with GDM and pregnancy induced psychological stress.**\n\n【11】**Single Nucleotide Polymorphism**\n\n【12】**Polymorphisms are a form of genetic variation， which refers to the presence of two or more alternative forms of a distinct phenotype. This variation can occur in any morphological， physiological， and behavioral traits and can occur in both coding and non-coding regions of the DNA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Among these genetic variations the Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNP) are of the most common type occurring in about 90% of the observed differences in the genome. Another feature of a polymorphism is that the most abundant allele should be present in the population at a test frequency of 99% or less. Therefore the rare allele will present at a total frequency of at-least 1%通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Most SNPs occur in the non-coding regions of the human genome but about 50，000 SNPs have been estimated to occur in the coding region of the DNA called cSNP where they can alter protein structure. These SNPs are an important genetic variation as they can influence morphological， physiological and pathological traits thereby have relevance to disease mechanism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u> as shown in Figure 1. Associations of these SNPs have been linked as risk factors to many diseases including both type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Establishing an association with the genetics can offer prediction of drug response and possibly develop a genome based diet that is safer to risked individual 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Graph： Created using Reactome \\[11，12\\] and modified from Wikipedia.**\n\n【13】**Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms iin Gestational Diabetes Mellitus**\n\n【14】**Gestational diabetes mellitus is defined as carbohydrate intolerance ofvariable severity diagnosed with onset or duringpregnancy通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. It is the most common metabolic disturbance duringpregnancy. It is a multifactorial disease with a rising prevalence globally where both environmental and genetic factors play an important role in the pathogenesis of the disease and associated post pregnancy complications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. In a systemic review done by Zhang et al. have assessed multiple genes that are associated with GDM. Among these they identified seven genes that are very significantly associated with GDM. These are The minor alleles of Transcription Factor 7 Like 2 (TCF7L2)， Glucokinase**\n\n【15】**region. The SNPs in the coding region are further sub divided into synonymous or non-synonymous SNPs. The synonymous SNPs and Non-coding SNPs results in un-altered protein structure whereas as non-synonymous SNPs result in altered protein structure which contributes to the pathogenesis of the disease.**\n\n【16】**(GCK)， Potassium Inwardly Rectifying Channel Subfamily J Member11(KCNJ11)， CDK5 Regulatory Subunit Associated Protein 1 Like 1(CDKAL1)， Insulin Like Growth Factor 2 MRNA Binding Protein 2(IGF2BP2)， Melatonin receptor 1B (MTNR1B)， and Insulin Receptor Substrate 1 (IRS1). Among these TCF7L2 showed the strongest association with GDM risk 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>.**\n\n【17】**Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms in Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM)and Psychological Disorders**\n\n【18】**Gestational Diabetes Mellitus is a pregnancy related metabolic disorder characterized by glucose intolerance that was nonexistent prior to pregnancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. A diagnosis of GDM furthermore increases emotional distress， such as depression， anxiety or stressamong women. A study done by Lee et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u> showed that prevalence depression， anxiety and stress were 39.9%，12.5% and 10.6 % respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. Pregnancy itself being a stressful condition the superimposed GDM along with stress results in further complications that could potentially lead to postpartum depression or diabetes mellitus post pregnancy. Multiple factors come into plays that contribute towards the development of stress and GDM however genetic factors play substantial role in the etiology of both psychological symptoms and GDM. In a recent review done by Yahya et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u> they identified about 83 candidate genes that were associated with GDM of which _TCF7L2， MTNRIB， CDKALI， IRSI， and KCNQ1 are the most_ prevalent 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. For the purpose of the review， we would only focus on these 5 major genes any overlap of these genes with psychological symptoms.**\n\n【19】**Transcription Factor7 Like 2**\n\n【20】**Genetic studies have showed TCF7L2 is found to be the strongest determinant of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) in the human population. In a review done by Chang et al. encompassing 22 studies6 out of 8 common SNPs were found to be strongly associated with GDM where rs7903146，rs12255372 and rs790169 had the strongest association 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. Furthermore In vivo studies showed that not only**\n\n【21】**TCF7L2 is associated with T2DM but is also related to altered behavior of the mice which was seen prior to the development of glucose intolerance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. This shows that TCF7L2 could potentially be associated with stress and GDM however further studies would be needed to make this association.**\n\n【22】**The Melatonin Receptor 1B (MTNRIB)**\n\n【23】**The Melatonin Receptor 1B (MTNR1B) is a newly identified candidate gene belonging to the class of G protein coupled receptors. Till date human genetic studies have identified many common variants of this gene associated with T2DM and GDM. Among these the polymorphism rs1387153 and rs10830963 was to be highly significant \\[6，21\\] later being also found in placental tissues associated with increased risk of GDM 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>. However when rs10830963polymorphism was assessed for depressive symptoms in T2DM no correlation was found 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u> but independently this polymorphism was associated with increased risk of Schizophrenia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>.**\n\n【24】**The Cyclin-Dependent Kinase5(CDK5) Regulatory Subunit-Associated Protein1-Like 1(CDKALI)**\n\n【25】**The CDKAL1 is a member of the methylthiotransferase family encoded by CDKALI gene has been implicated in the development of T2DM 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u> and GDM particularly the rs7754840 variant 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u>. Although this variant was not yet studied with respect to stress development multiple genetic variants of this gene were found to be associated with depressive symptoms with T2DM通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>.**\n\n【26】**Insulin Receptor Substrate IRS-1**\n\n【27】**Insulin receptor substrate-1iIsS：an important endogenous substrate of the insulin signaling pathway. Variants of this gene mainlyrs1801278 have been shown to be associated with both T2DM and GDM \\[27，28\\]. Other variants of this gene particularly rs13411764and rs3820926 in the upstream region have found to be a risk factor for major depressive disorder 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[29\\]</u>. Though not linked via studies as a risk factor for stress in GDM the potential of IRS being involved**\n\n【28】**in GDM and variants having association with psychological illnesses could possibly serve as a question for future research studies.**\n\n【29】**Potassium Voltage-Gated Channel Subfamily QMember1(KCNQI)**\n\n【30】**The Potassium Voltage-Gated Channel Subfamily Q Member 1(KCNQ1) gene variants rs2237892， rs2237895， rs2283228， rs151290， and rs2074196， have been recently identified as a risk factor for the development of T2DM \\[30，31\\]. Among these the variant rs2237892and rs2237895 were found to be associated with GDM in Chinese and Pakistani population respectively \\[32，33\\]. Polymorphisms of this gene in relation to psychiatric disorders are not much studied KCNQ1 variant rs8234 was found to be associated with increased of Schizophrenia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[34\\]</u>.**\n\n【31】**Studies Showing SNPS in Stress Related to GDM**\n\n【32】**Currently there are not many studies that have related SNPs associated with stress and GDM. A study done by Lee et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[35\\]</u>， have shown 14 genes associated with GDM and stress. These are _NPY5R； ANO2； EPHX2； TPH2； NRGI； LHPP； FKBP5； SDK2；_ _RORA； OXTR； BDNF； HTR2C； TEX51； and PLEKHG1 which are_ important candidates for various psychological disorders such as depression， anxiety and stress 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[35\\]</u>. In another study by Lin et al the authors investigated that association between gene polymorphisms， environment and psychological stress in GDM. The study included _COMT， NPSR1， HSP90B1，HSP90AA2， FKBP5. Among these genes_ only NPSR1 (rs324981) T/T genotype was associated with reduced risk of psychological stress where as the other genes had no significant association 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.**\n\n【33】**At present only two studies have shown associations of genetic variants with respect to stress and GDM. However， the candidate genes studied were mostly associated predominantly with stress and psychological disorders. This review further tried to link common candidate gene variants predominantly associated with GDM with potential relation to stress and therefore could serve as a basis for further studies.**\n\n【34】**Implications of Future Research**\n\n【35】**There is no any research work conducted in a local setting， highlighting the relationship of stress with GDM in background of genetic mutations. Thus； exploring the genetic profile of pregnant women is of paramount importance. Identifying the epigenetic mechanism of stress and GDM can benefit for sustainable long-term behavioral change measures to address the mental health of pregnant women. Further， the study will help the health providers treat the pregnant woman in a best suited way as well as to determine whether the new born to a woman will be predispose to psychological disorders in the future.**\n\n【36】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【37】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**1\\.

We present a combination of bilateral lumbar sympathetic nerve block and ultrasound guided PRF in the management of spinal cord injury related CCNP that was refractory to medical and physical therapy.**\n\n【12】**Case Report： A female (60 to 70 years old) presented to our pain clinic with severe bilateral electrical and burning leg pain diffusely from her hip to toes， covering both volar and dorsal aspects of the limbs along with sensitivity to touch. She described her pain as 10/10 disrupted her functional ability despite taking high dose painkillers. We performed， first， bilateral lumbar sympathetic nerve block at L3 that led to complete pain relief of 0/10 of the proximal limbs from her back to the distal thigh after three months； then，ultrasound guided PRF of bilateral sciatic nerves at the popliteal fossa that yielded a significant reduction in pain of her lower legs， with a severity of 4/10 and sensitivity to touch. In addition， improvement in function and sleep along with a significant reduction in painkiller dosage earned patient high satisfaction.**\n\n【13】**Conclusion： Lumbar sympathetic nerve blockade can be a therapeutic option for spinal cord injury related chronic central neuropathic pain. And subsequently PRF can be effectively applied primarily to the peripheral nervous system as the second stage of the management of SCI associated central neuropathic pain.**\n\n【14】**Keywords： Sympathetic nerve block； Pulsed radiofrequency； Chronic pain； Central neuropathic pain**\n\n【15】**_5451：_ Introduction**\n\n【16】**Chronic Central Neuropathic Pain (CCNP) attributed to Spinal Cord Injury (SCI)， brain injury， post stroke pain， and Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a devastating type of secondary chronic pain which， along with Chronic Peripheral Neuropathic Pain (CPNP) including peripheral nerve injury， painful polyneuropathy， post-herpetic neuralgia， and painful radiculopathy， falls under Chronic Neuropathic Pain (CNP)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Pharmacologic therapeutic options include tricyclic antidepressants， serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors， and gabapentin as first line treatments followed by weak (e.g.， tramadol) and strong opioids (e.g.， morphine and oxycodone) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. The medication refractory CNP are treated with non-pharmacological treatment including interventional therapies(e.g.， sympathetic nerve/ganglion block， epidural steroid injection， peripheral nerve blockade)， physical therapies (e.g.， Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS))， and psychological therapies (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Minimally invasive interventional procedures such as sympathetic nerve blockade/neurolysis/neuro-ablation， Transforaminal Epidural Steroid Injection (TFESI)， and Pulsed Radiofrequency (PRF) have been introduced recently for the management of chronic neurological pain including CCNP.**\n\n【17】**We present a rarely performed minimally invasive intervention ofbilateral lumbar sympathetic nerve block at L3 and subsequently ultrasound guided PRF of bilateral sciatic nerves at the popliteal fossa in SCI related CCNP that was refractory to medical and physical therapy.**\n\n【18】**Case Presentation**\n\n【19】**In February 2021， a female (60 to 70 years old) was referred to the Pain Clinic (Toronto， Ontario) for severe， persistent bilateralleg pain after a remote anterior spinal cord infarct 8 years ago.

She described her pain as 10/10 constant electrical and burning pain throughout that was worse at night. In addition， her skin was extremely sensitive to touch. The pain disrupted her functional ability to ambulate，perform physical exercise， and sleep. She denied any major weakness， sensory loss， muscle movements， cramps or tremors which were concordant with the findings on physical examination. Her current sensory and motor examination did not show any neurological deficits. She did not have any allodynia on examination， but she did have diffuse hyperalgesia to pin prick in bilateral lower extremities. In the past she had trialed a few analgesics， including gabapentin (30000 mg/d to 32000 mg/d) and duloxetine (60 mg/d) without significant pain relief. The diagnosis of CCNP secondary to SCI likely involving small fiber mediated pain was made. At this time bilateral L3 lumbar sympathetic block under fluoroscopic guidance was performed with each side receiving a total of solution injected .**\n\n【20】**In 3 month follow up the patient reported complete pain relief of0/10 of the proximal limbs from her back to the distal thigh. She still had residual burning pain of the lowerlegs at an intensity of 7/10. She had functional improvements of increased ambulation duration and improved sleep. She was able to reduce her gabapentin dose to 1500mg/d. Physical examination revealed bilateral hyperalgesia to pin prick diffusely over her lower leg and feet. Subsequently， ultrasound guided bilateral sciatic nerve pulsed radiofrequency simulation at the popliteal fossa was performed. Procedure details： 20 g 3.5-inch needle45V 42·C2Hz 10 ms for 2 min bilaterally**\n\n【21】**In 3 month follow up after this procedure she had significant pain relief of her lower legs， with a severity of 4/10 and reduced sensitivity**\n\n【22】**to touch. At this time， approximately 6 months after her bilateral lumbar sympathetic block， her proximal leg pain continued to be tolerable， with a severity of 3/10.**\n\n【23】**Discussion**\n\n【24】**The current findingshighlights that the multimodal and multistage approach， including targeting both the autonomic and somatic pain systems with sympathetic blocks and pulsed radiofrequency in the SCI related CCNP， which has been barely studied， can lead to lasting significant pain reduction.**\n\n【25】**Generally， there is no robust or sufficient evidence to support the efficacy of non-pharmacological treatment in SCI-related CCNP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Sympathetic nerve or ganglion management (including blockade， neurolysis， or ablation) with medication， neurolytic modalities， and radiofrequency ablation have been used in CNP mainly in PCNP， including pain associated with herpes zoster， post-herpetic neuralgia， diabetic peripheral neuropathy， and complex regional pain syndrome\\[3，4\\]. With SCI-related CCNP， other modalities including spinal cord stimulation， intrathecal medication delivery， deep brain stimulation， and dorsal root entry zone lesion have been commonly investigated in literature. The level of evidence for this has been low and the recommendation for its use is inconclusive 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. However， this case report supports the individualized approach can make the seldom-or non-studied interventional options in the SCI-associated CCNP，i.e.， sympathetic nerve block， available and useful.**\n\n【26】**Systematic reviews and meta-analyses have yielded that PRF can lead to decreased pain， improved function， and quality of life， and reduced oral medication use in Post-Herpetic Neuralgia (PHN) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>， trigeminal neuralgia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>， knee osteoarthritis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>， perineal pain after delivery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>， while non-effective in radicular pain 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Merely， one case report was found presenting the efficacy of PRF on a refractory complex regional pain syndrome due to sciatic neuropathy with a disabling pain in the unilateral lower leg and foot 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.**\n\n【27】**The current finding shows that bilateral lumbar sympathetic blockade can reduce SCI-related CCNP within the proximal bilateral lower limbs. Then with the residual bilateral lower leg neuropathic pain， PRF of the sciatic nerve bilaterally was able to reduce the unresolved pain and hyperalgesia.**\n\n【28】**This case spotlight that individualized， multimodal， minimally invasive interventions for CCNP can be safe and effective in achieving high quality ofpain control， and， ultimately， improve patient function and quality of life and earn patient satisfaction. Lumbar sympathetic nerve blockade can be a therapeutic option for spinal cord injury related chronic central neuropathic pain and， subsequently， PRF can be effectively applied primarily to the peripheral nerve system as the second stage of the management of SCI associated central neuropathic pain.**\n\n【29】**StatementofAuthorship**\n\n【30】**SK： Generated idea， collected data， drafted， edited， and critically appraised the manuscript.**\n\n【31】**MP： Collecteddata， edited， and1criticalIlyaappraisedthe manuscript.**\n\n【32】**AS： Generated idea， collected data， drafted， edited， and critically appraised the manuscript.**\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**1\\.

Some cases are also associated with erosions， crusting， hair， and nail changes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Most commonly， it is due to generalization of pre-existing dermatoses (such as psoriasis or atopic dermatitis)， drug reactions， or cutaneous T-cell lymphoma， but identification of the underlying disease process represents one of the most complex challenges in dermatology 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. We present the case of a patient affected by multiple myeloma who developed erythroderma.**\n\n【17】**Case Presentation**\n\n【18】**A 66-year-old male with a medical history of multiple myeloma developed an erythematous rash spread over the entire skin surface， with scaling and itching. Dermatologic examination revealed extensive pink patches with feathering edges and large scaling on head， neck， trunk， and limbs . He did not report previous dermatoses or known allergies， but a history of xerosis. Regarding multiple myeloma， he achieved Very Good Partial Response (VGPR) after four cycles of Bortezomib-Thalidomide-Dexamethasone (VTD) induction therapy followed by Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation (ASCT). Laboratory tests showed eosinophilia (5500/mm)， which has progressively increased for two months， until reaching a peak concomitantly with erythroderma. The previous month， acyclovir was replaced by valganciclovir for a cytomegalovirus reactivation (28000 copies/mL). Current blood tests found the presence of cytomegalovirus (481copies/mL)andhuman herpesvirus-7(90 copies/mL). Thepatient was started on oralprednisone and hydroxyzine， associated with topical steroids and emollients， but one month later erythroderma with lamellar scaling， intense itching and eosinophilia persisted， and thus a skin biopsy was performed. A week later， the patient developed fever， and blood cultures resulted positive for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus casseliflavus， therefore he received intravenous daptomycin in combination with piperacillin-tazobactam. Following the resolution of symptoms， all unnecessary drugs were suspended and intravenous 1 mg/kg/day dose of methylprednisolone was started， resulting in gradual improvement of erythroderma and eosinophilia. On the third day，**\n\n【19】**Figure 1： Dermatologic examination. Exfoliation of scale with underlying erythema and secondary excoriations on head (A) and knees (B).**\n\n【20】Figure 2： Dermatologic examination. Wide spread erythema with large thin scaling and excoriations (A， C， E). After the resolution of erythroderma， persistence of xerasis， lichenification and residual crusts (B， D， F).\n\n【21】**as the patient developed a febrile relapse with positive blood cultures for Klebsiella pneumoniae Carbapenemase (KPC) enzyme producers， steroid therapy was suspended， and ceftazidime-avibactam treatment was set. Clinical improvement was again interrupted by a new febrile episode associated with reactivation of cytomegalovirus (16000copies/mL) and worsening of erythroderma. Foscarnet therapy induced resolution of fever and reduction of erythema and itching. A further biopsy was performed， and intravenous methylprednisolone was started again. The pathologist concluded that histological and molecular findings were referable to a non-specific inflammatory reaction. After the resolution of erythroderma  and negative viral tests， the patient was discharged with a follow-up prograr.**\n\n【22】**Discussion**\n\n【23】**Erythroderma is a condition caused by several etiologies that result**\n\n【24】Figure 3： 2-Plus-1 AD diagnostic criteria proposed by Reynolds et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【25】**in red inflamed skin on 80% to 90% or more ofthe body surface \\[1，2\\]. The diagnoses of the underlying systemic or cutaneous disease can be remembered with the mnemonic SCALPID： Seborrheic dermatitis/sarcoidosis； contact dermatitis； atopic dermatitis/autoimmune diseases； lymphoma/leukemia； psoriasis/pityriasis rubra pilaris； ichthyoses， infestations (Norwegian scabies)； drug reactions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. The most common disorders are contact dermatitis， atopic dermatitis， and psoriasis， along with drug reactions， while the most common malignancy is cutaneous T-cell lymphoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>**\n\n【26】**The color of the skin can vary from pink-red to red-brown to deep red-purple， and pruritus is observed in up to 90% of patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The onset of scaling is typically seen 2 to 6 days after the onset of the erythema \\[1，2\\]. It varies in size and color， depending upon the stage of the erythroderma and nature of the underlying disease： In more acute phases scales are usually large and crusted， whereas in chronic states they tend to be smaller and drier 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. In cases of pre-existing dermatoses， nail changes may precede the erythroderma (e.g. pits in psoriasis or horizontal ridging in atopic dermatitis)， whereas others develop subsequently， for example they can become thick， dry， and brittle \\[1，2\\]. Colonization of the skin with Staphylococcus aureus is common and can lead to secondary cutaneous infections as well as**\n\n【27】**bacteremia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.**\n\n【28】**A detailed history is crucial for diagnosing the underlying etiology： Patients must be asked about pre-existing medical conditions， allergies， medications， and skin diseases (atopic or other dermatitis， psoriasis， etc) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. The presentation of erythroderma in individuals without a pre-existing skin disease is more common with drug-induced erythroderma or malignancy； compared with other causes， the onset of erythroderma secondary to medication is typically more sudden and rapidly progressing， the resolution is often quicker， and additional manifestations may be observed， like fever and peripheral eosinophilia， along with facial swelling， hepatitis， myocarditis， and allergic interstitial nephritis： This constellation of findings is referred to as DRESS (Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Our patient reported no pre-existing dermatoses or allergies； he was recently started on valganciclovir， but there was no improvement despite its suspension， and eosinophilia already existed before. Furthermore， mites could not be identified from skin scraping examined microscopically， and a screening test panel for associated auto antibodies was negative， thus we performed a 4-mm punch biopsy. Histological examination showed parakeratosis， spongiosis， vacuolization in the basal layer， exocytosis1of lymphocytes and granulocytes， inflammatory infiltrate in the dermis (with predominantly CD4+ T lymphocytes， histiocytes and granulocytes， but a moderate amounts of ezsinophils) and edema of the dermis.**\n\n【29】**Histological findings were compatible with1paraneoplastic erythroderma， idiopathic erythroderma and atopic dermatitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Tests for multiple myeloma showed no evidence of disease activity， so we excluded this possibility. Erythroderma is labeled as idiopathic in9% to 47% of cases (this group is composed mainly of older adult men with a chronic and relapsing course of pruritic erythroderma) and longitudinal monitoring of patients with idiopathic erythroderma may reveal undiagnosed cutaneous T-celllymphoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>，therefore we performed a second biopsy to enhance the accuracy ofhistopathologic diagnoses， but it excluded again a lymphoproliferative disease and showed a non-specific inflammatory pattern. Acute lesions of atopic dermatitis show spongiosis， intracellular edema in the lower epidermis， exocytosis of lymphocytes， a perivascular infiltrate of lymphocytes and macrophages around vessels of the superficial plexus， mast cells in different stages of degranulation， and occasional eosinophils 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. The presence of dermal eosinophilic infiltrates is a characteristic histological feature observed in skin biopsies from patients with erythrodermic atopic dermatitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. The diagnosis of atopic dermatitis remains clinical， as there is currently no reliable biomarker that can distinguish the disease from other entities： An elevated total and/or allergen-specific serum IgE level is not present in about 20% of affected individuals \\[5，6\\] as well as in our patient. Of all the existing diagnostic criteria， none are considered wholly or mutually exclusive in the diagnosis of atopic dermatitis， which remains prerogative of the clinician 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. According to the 2-Plus-1model  proposed by Reynolds et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>， our patient had two essential features (acute eczema and pruritus) and one important feature (xerosis)， without any exclusionary features of atopic dermatitis.**\n\n【30】**Furthermore， the onset of erythroderma was associated with a Cytomegalovirus reactivation twice， and the second time antiviral therapy resulted in improvement of erythema and itching. We**\n\n【31】**believe that cytomegalovirus might have been a trigger of the cell-mediated immune response that unleashed an erythrodermic onset of atopic dermatitis. Triggers (e.g. viral infections， food allergens， cosmetics， fragrance， weather， and other causes) are the leading cause of an atopic dermatitis exacerbation， and avoidance of triggers is an important mechanism patients can use to control disease activity通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Hafez et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u> found that active subclinical cytomegalovirus infection is more frequent in patients with atopic dermatitis and may have possible immunomodulatory role in the etiopathogenesis， even if it is not related to disease severity. Docke et al.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u> suggest that active， subclinical cytomegalovirus infection is more frequent in patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis and may have immunopathological relevance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. In-spite of the high prevalence of cytomegalovirus infection and its potent immunomodulatory activities， the relation of cytomegalovirus to atopic dermatitis is still poorly understood \\[8，10\\].**\n\n【32】**Conclusion**\n\n【33】**Erythroderma is a dermatologic emergency that could necessitate hospital admission， therefore determining the underlying etiology is crucial， and any external aggravating factors must be eliminated. Specifically， any potential drugs inducing erythroderma must be stopped. Early diagnosis is paramount as it allows early treatment and prevention oferythroderma-associated morbidity and mortality. It is very important to recognize atopic dermatitis as a cause of erythroderma， especially in a patient with late onset of the disease and no personal or familial history of allergic diseases. Further studies are necessary to clarify the relationship between atopic dermatitis and cytomegalovirus infection.**\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【35】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**1\\.

Often， these tumors will present as hematuria- which is regarded as benign. Because of this presentation， pediatric patients often are not diagnosed until years after their initial presentation. We present a 4-year-old female patient who presented initially at 6 months with progressive hematuria that ultimately ended up being diagnosed with a bladder teratoma. In conclusion， bladder teratomas should be included in the initial work-up when presenting with hematuria.**\n\n【12】**Introduction**\n\n【13】**Bladder tumors are uncommon in children with an incidence of 0.1% to 0.4% during the first two decades of life 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Malignant teratomas， yolk sac tumors， and all germ cell tumors in pediatric patients are exceedingly rare and most often affect females 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2-4\\]</u>. There has been no specific genetics identified for bladder teratomas specifically， but there have been familial cases of ovarian teratomas identified in several subsequent generations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.**\n\n【14】**Teratomas are the most common germ celltumor and are defined histologically as a combination of ectoderm， mesoderm， and endoderm as well as being grossly heterogeneous with both solid and cystic features 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Most mature cystic teratomas are composed of ectoderm-derived epidermis， sebaceous glands and hair follicles and mesoderm-derived dermal stromal elements. However，there have been rare cases of teratomas Containing Gastrointestinal (GI) epithelium and an organized GI tract which is true in this case 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. The most common teratomas are sacrococcygeal and ovarian in origin， with bladder teratomas being exceptionallyrare \\[2，4\\]. Teratomas are primarily asymptomatic and often found incidentally on imaging. When allowed to grow undiscovered， they have been shown to have mass effects in the affecting organ. When localized to the urinary system，teratomas have been shown to emulate bladder and ureteral calculi such as lower urinary tract symptoms， hematuria， and urinary retention 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. The most pathognomonic symptom of bladder teratoma in pilimiction， the passage of hair in urine 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.**\n\n【15】**There is little known about bladder tumors in the pediatric population，so it can lead to a delay in diagnosis and deleterious therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Although the surgical management ofthese tumors is well reported， there is no consensus on the surveillance or follow-up of these patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. We report the case of a 4-year-old child presenting with a bladder teratoma and discuss the diagnostic and therapeutic aspects of bladder tumors in children.**\n\n【16】**Case Presentation**\n\n【17】**_cited._**\n\n【18】**This is a 4-year-old female child， with no notable pathological history， referred from a regional hospital to our department for gross hematuria with clots. This clinical picture evolved from the age of 6 months with initial intermittent terminal hematuria then progressing to total hematuria associated withhypogastric pain. She had been hospitalized several times in different hospital systems without any definitive etiology being attributed to this hematuria before being referred. On physical examination， the patient presented with pale mucous membranes， hypogastric tenderness， and a soiled diaper with observed blood clots. A biological assessment had demonstrated a microcvtic hypochromic anemia at 4.8 g/dl with a hematocrit of 12%. An Emmel test performed came back positive. The kidney workup was unremarkable. An ultrasound of the urinary tree indicated an irregular peripheral tissue thickening of the bladder wall， vascularized by Doppler， suggesting a bladder tumor. A uroscan was performed and revealed a tumor of the bladder dome associated with right inguinal and external iliac lymph nodes . A cystoscopy under general anesthesia**\n\n【19】**b) Frontal Reconstruction**\n\n【20】**Figure 2： Intraoperative Images of the Bladder Tumor. a) External surface of the bladder b) Internal surface of the bladder**\n\n【21】**b) Internal Face**\n\n【22】**was performed preoperatively and revealed an ulcerative budding tumor of the dome and of the right anterolateral wall of the bladder. The surgical intervention was performed by a median infra-umbilical laparotomy and revealed a vascular tumor of the dome and of the anterolateral wall of the right bladder . We performed a partial cystectomy up to 1.5 cm of the ureteral meatus. The operative part measured 7cm×5 cm×2 cm (Figure3). Postoperatively，therewas a disappearance of hematuria and anemia with a hemoglobin level of13.1 g/dl. The post-operative follow-up ultrasound revealed a normal bladder. Anatomopathological examination of the surgical specimens revealed ulceration on the bladder surface. It also revealed edematous dissociation of the bladder chorion including hyperplasia of blood lymphatic vessels and capillaries giving a cavernous appearance； this is typically associated with intestinal metaplasia supporting the**\n\n【23】**diagnosis of a bladder teratoma. At 7 months postoperative， there was a recurrence of hematuria which prompted the performance of a cystoscopy under general anesthesia. The cystoscopy demonstrated localized neovascularization in the bladder without tun0T recurrence. One month later at 8 months postoperative， the patient reports normal urination with disappearance of hematuria as well as satisfactory continence.**\n\n【24】**Discussion**\n\n【25】**The benign nature of hematuria misleads clinicians when approaching a diagnosis of bladder teratoma. However， the most frequent reason for consultation for a bladder tumor is hematuria as seen in our patient \\[9，10\\]. Teratomas typically have a median age presentation of 30 years old which why this differential not expected通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Contributing to the complexity of this case， teratomas have an insidious nature growing at a slow-rate with an average of 1.8 mm per year subsequently further delaying their diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.**\n\n【26】**The first-line examination in children is the ultrasound of the urinary tract， given its accessibility \\[10，12\\]. Cystoscopy allows a definite diagnosis， but is rarely used in children given the need for general anesthesia and the risk of urethral injury 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Cystoscopy was used in our patient preoperatively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.**\n\n【27】**Treatment for bladder tumors includes partial cystectomy versu radical cystectomy. Partial cystectomy has obvious advantages over radical cystectomy. Namely， its bladder-saving approach avoids the need for urinary diversion， maintains erectile function in males， can be done under regional anesthesia， and is associated with lower morbidity and mortality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. In our patient， we used the partial cystectomy approach. Several other cases of bladder teratomas also used partial cystectomy approaches with success \\[11，14\\]. The prognosis for bladder tumors is often favorable as shown by a meta-analysis with a recurrence rate of 3.4% and death rate of 1%\\[141.**\n\n【28】**Conclusion**\n\n【29】**Despite the often-benign nature of hematuria in children， it is essential that any practitioner eliminate a bladder tumor. An ultrasound and a cystoscopy will confirm the diagnosis. The evolution is favorable after resection of the tumor. The follow-up must include investigation with serial ultrasounds and cystoscopies in front of any recurrence of the signs.**\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>1\\.

Unusually， in our patient the metastatic calcification with Metastatic Pulmonary Calcification (MCP)， vascular calcification， soft tissue calcification surrounding large joint and calcific uremic arteriolopathy. He underwent parathyroidectomy for secondary hyperparathyroidism. Five months after surgery a rapid regression of MCP and soft tissue calcification was observed， but calcific uremic arteriolopathy keep progressive development.**\n\n【12】**Case Presentation**\n\n【13】**A 43-year-old man with uremia due to glomerulonephritis， receiving hemodialysis since 2010， three times per week， four hours per time， was presented with ulcer of left heel for 1 month. He found a swelling over the right shoulder joint in early 2011. The swelling was mobile and soft， and grew rapidly from 2 cm to 10 cm in five months， but he had neither pain nor skin changes. There was no special treatment or regular examination of serum calcium， phosphorus and intact Parathyroid Hormone (iPTH). Over the next two years， another swelling developed over the left elbow joint similar to the ones described for the right shoulder joint. He hospitalized for lumbosacral area and bower limbs pain in July 2016. Blood tests revealed： (iPTH) 2156.5 pg/ml (<72 pg/ml). Computed Tomography (CT) scans showed bilateral， diffuse， centrilobular， ground-glass opacities areas distributed in the upper lobes . He was diagnosed with uremic renal osteopathy and uremic pulmonary metastatic calcification. There was no significant decrease in iPTH level after treatment with calcimimetics for 2 months. The lumbosacral area and bower limbs pain still progresses. He was difficulty in walking by the end of 2017. One yearlater， the patient returned to our hospital with the complaint of severe pain in left heel. In the past eight years， his height has been shortened by 6cm and his weight has dropped by 20kg.**\n\n【14】**Physical examination on admission showed： Emaciated form， a blood pressure of BP 144/96mmHg， a pulse rate of 90/min， a body temperature of 36.5℃ and a respiratory rate of 28/min. Two irregular， hard masses were found around right shoulder joint and left elbow joint. Joint range of**\n\n【15】**Figure 1： Computed tomography of the lungs in 2016.

Tender and necrotic indurated plaques with surrounding erythema were noted on his left heel.**\n\n【20】**Blood tests revealed： Calcium 2.27 (2.02-2.57) mg/dl，phosphorus of 2.53 (0.6-1.6) mg/dl， and iPTH levels up to 2580.5 pg/ml. Parathyroid scintigraphywas performed 15 min and 2 h after injection of Tc99m MIBI. The Tc-99 MIBI scintigraphy demonstrated a focus of intense uptake in the upper pole of the right lobe， lower and upper pole of left lobe on the early and late images. CT scans show multiple， centrilobular， calcified nodules through-out both lungs . The nodules were predominant in the upper and mid lung zones which was worse than 2016. Severe vascular calcification of thoracic and lower limb ， multilobulated calcified masses around the right shoulder joint were found at the same time . X-ray of the knee joint showed stripe shaped calcification of lower extremity vessels .**\n\n【21】**Total parathyroidectomy was performed in October 2018. Five parathyroid glands were excised .

The pain of lumbosacral and lower limbs was significantly relieved the second day after operation， but the pain on heel ulcer was not relieved. The patient was re-checked5 months after operation to evaluate the amelioration of metastatic calcification. CT scans revealed reduced metastatic pulmonary calcification . Peri-articular soft-tissue calcifications ofthe right shoulder were barely visible . X-ray of knee joint showed have no change . calciphylaxis on his left heel got worsen .**\n\n【26】**Discussion**\n\n【27】**With the advent of hemodialysis technology， the incidence of secondary hyperparathyroidism is rapidly increasing and metastatic calcification has become prominent. Metastatic calcification refers to the deposition of calcium in normal tissue， that is commonly**\n\n【28】**Figure 8： Follow-up computed tomography examinations.

Regions most commonly involved by this pathology are subcutaneous tissue， soft tissues of periarticular， vascular wall， internal organs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. In the presented case， a middle-aged patient suffered from multiple metastatic calcification due to secondary hyperparathyroidism. The biggest differences of our patient are the widespread metastatic calcification with pulmonary metastases， vascular calcification， soft tissue calcification surrounding large joint and calcific uremic arteriolopathy. To our knowledge， no similar researches have been reported in the past.**\n\n【32】**The diagnosis of secondary hyperparathyroidism is mainly depending on the history of chronic renal failure and elevated PTH levels， hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia were also observed.**\n\n【33】**Figure 11： The lesion progressed significantly after five months of parathyroidectomy.**\n\n【34】**Visceral calcinosis can affect lung， stomach， heart， pancreas， and kidneys， but lung is the most vulnerable organ 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. The pathological characteristics of Metastatic Pulmonary Calcification (MPC) is calcium salt deposition in basement membranes ofthe epithelium and endothelium of pulmonaryalveoli 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. The main pathogenesis of MPC has not yet been illustrated， but some factors， such as hypercalcemia and hyperphosphatemia， dialysis-associated intermittent acid-base imbalance， and local secretion of free hydrogen ions in the lungs， kidneys， and stomach have been suggested as the risk factors for MPC formation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. The diagnostic rate of MPC is very low， but histological changes of MPC are seen at autopsy in 60% to 75% of maintenance hemodialysis patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. This may probably due to insufficient sensitivity of chest X-ray examination， poorly understood about the imaging manifestations of MPC among clinicians， and the benign clinical course of the disease.**\n\n【35】**Chest radiographs are not very sensitive in the detection of MPC， especially in early stage of disease (small calcifications)， and are usually show patchy or confluent airspace opacities or normal. CT has high sensitivity in an early detection of MPC. A chest CT scan of metastatic pulmonary calcification reveals of bilateral， diffuse， centrilobular， ground-glass nodular opacities and partially calcified nodules or consolidations， predominantly in the upper lung fields， is the most common finding on \\[5，6\\]. Calcium preferentially deposits in relatively alkaline tissues. The upperlung fields have high Ventilation/Perfusion (V/Q) ratio， creating high oxygen and low carbon dioxide levels.**\n\n【36】**The high V/Q ratio results in decreased PaCO， and increased pH 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Therefore， it had nothing strange that the lung apex is more commonly involved than the lung base. In our case showed symmetrical， multiple， centrilobular areas of ground-glass opacity throughout both upper lung area in 2016. Preoperative CT scan showed more calcareous were deposited in upper lung zones， but not in lung base，which was in accordance with the characteristics of MPC imaging changes. In addition， radionuclide imaging is another useful technique in finding out the early MPC， demonstrating generally symmetrical and increased radioactive isotope uptake in affected lung fields 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. The pathological examination is the diagnostical golden standard for metastatic pulmonary calcification. However， it is largely limited in clinical applications since it is an invasive procedure.**\n\n【37】**MPC is a benign lesion， it generally slows progression in a long time， but it can also deteriorate rapidly within several weeks or months通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Most patients with MPC are asymptomatic， but several cases of hemoptysis， cough， dyspnea have been reported \\[2，9\\]. In our case， diffuse， patchy high-density shadows were found in both upper lungs**\n\n【38】**in 2016. The imaging changes of MPC were obviously aggravated in 2018 before operation， but throughout， the patient have no any respiratory symptoms. Preoperative pulmonary function test mainly shows mild restrictive ventilatory dysfunction. The pathological changes were absorbed gradually after five months of operation.**\n\n【39】**So far， the best treatment of MPC has not been established. The mainstayoftreatmentisnormalizationofphosphate and calciumlevels， primarily with phosphate binders. Another means is too applicate of active vitamin D to control secondary hyperparathyroidism on the basis of maintaining normal calcium-phosphorus product 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Most of these patients with asymptomatic， non-progressive MPC do not need to intervention since these patients eventually died of other causes instead of MPC. Cases have been reported that MPC can be fully absorbed after parathyroidectomy \\[11，12\\]. More research’s need to be done to see whether renal transplant is good for MPC通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. In this case， the patient has no any respiratory symptoms， however， besides MPC， the patient had multiple periarticular metastatic calcifications， severe systemic vascular calcification， bone deformation，bone pain and calciphylaxis of the heel at the same time. Therefore， he underwent total parathyroidectomy. Five months after surgery a rapid regression of MCP was observed.**\n\n【40】**Soft tissue calcifications are another common manifestation of secondary hyperparathyroidism， characterized by large calcium phosphate deposition into cutaneous and subcutaneous tissues. Depositing of calcium salt in periarticular soft tissue region on patients of maintenance hemodialysis for chronic renal failure call Uremic Tumoral Calcinosis (UTC). Its estimated incidence is between 0.5% and 7% of hemodialysis patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. It usually presents with benign nodules at periarticular sites， mainly manifests as firm， painless， lobular， tumor-like masses around the joints that can lead to limitation of movement of joint when large in size. The key feature is absence of erosion and destruction of nearby bone， and such lesions is reversible after medication or parathyroidectomy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. The sites commonly affected are soft tissues of periarticular shoulder， elbow， hip regions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>， other areas such as wrist 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>， spine 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>， and knee have been observed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. Our patient had extensive involvement of the shoulder and elbow； findings were consistent with metastatic calcinosis cut is secondary to TC. Why does it preferentially occur around joints? The exact mechanism behind this clinical entity is unknown. It may be related to the pH value of joint fluid， like the pathogenesis of gout. However， there have been no related experimental investigations published on this subject. In the natural course of such lesions is usually slow and progressive over several years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Sometimes， too much tumoral masses leads to ulceration with superadded secondary infection. In this case， five months after surgery， a rapid complete absorption of the tumoral masses around the right shoulder and left were observed.**\n\n【41】**Additionally， this case also showed calcification in vessels along chest and limbs. There was no improvement in systemic vascular calcification， instead an aggravation of calcific uremic arteriolopathy on his left heel was observed. These results consistent with the previous reports \\[19，20\\]， indicating that once calcification develops it probably cannot be reversed and tends to become more severe as time passes.**\n\n【42】**Overall， we report this case for the purpose of expanding the clinical and treatment of multiple metastatic calcifications in patient with SHPTH. MPC associated with uremia is potentially reversible， and can resolve after parathyroidectomy， but vascular calcification**\n\n【43】**cannot be reversed and tends to deteriorate as time passes.**\n\n【44】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【45】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**1\\.

With almost half of North American population having allergies to one or more common environmental antigens， it is imperative for us to look at the most upstream level involved in this reaction pathway. Though allergic reactions are rarely life-threatening it is a common issue in today's society that had led to much distress and loss of time.**\n\n【11】**To truly understand the mechanisms of an allergic reaction， we will try to analyze the earliest beginning of a reaction by looking at the impact of genetics and the cytokines involved in allergic reaction. While the most classical and common pathway involving IL-4 has been studied， we will be looking at a newer， less explored pathway involving IL-33 which has been very significant in allergic reactions and can be used as a future target for therapy.**\n\n【12】**IL-33 and ST-2**\n\n【13】**There are a group of damage-associated molecules released by tissue epithelial cells in response to external stimuli. These molecules are known as “alarmins.” One of the main alarmins being studied has been Interleukin-33 (IL-33). Originating from the IL-1 family of cytokines， IL-33 has been recently observed to be expressed in many allergy responsive cells such as epidermal， smooth muscle and epithelial cells. As we analyze allergies and the human response， it is important to appreciate this on an upstream level to comprehend all the signaling pathways and use this to evolve our knowledge base to create better treatments in the future 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.**\n\n【14】**IL-33 plays a vital part in allergic response through various pathways and one of the initial stages involve binding to a membrane-bound receptor called Suppression of Tumorigenecity 2 (ST-2 receptor) and an (IL 1-R co-receptor) IL-1Receptor accessory protein via a heterodimeric receptor complex. This leads to activation of the primary signal MyD88 cascade pathway via homotypic protein-protein reactions. Other pathways involved include an increase in IL-5 cytokines that are IL-4 independent producing T-cells. Th2 cells， in general， respond via two pathways： the classic pathway involves IL-4， STAT (signal transducers and activators of transcription proteins) and GATA3 (DNA sequence“GATA\"binding transcription factors) cascades while the non-classical pathway induces IL-5 production. This is polarized by IL-33 via the ST2 receptor and leads to a stronger allergic response.**\n\n【15】**The IL-5 cytokine also increases production of NF-kB (nuclear factor KB)， MAPKs (Mitogen Activated Protein Kinases) and OVA (Egg protein ovalbumin) that increase inflammation and activation of tissue-resident cells with ST-2. The IL-33/ST2 complex also increases TH2-inducing cytokines like Th17 that leads to cell-mediated airway inflammation via Mast Cells (MC).**\n\n【16】**The MyD88 pathway**\n\n【17】**The MyD88 signal cascade involves the MyD88 adaptor protein to increase production of several other proteins and cytokines including IRA K4 (Interleukin-1 receptor associated kinase 4)， TRAF6 (transcription factor 6)， IL-13 and IL-6. Increased IL-5 and induce goblet cell hyperplasia in respiratory epithelial cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. This in turn leads to heavier mucus production in respiratory epithelial cells and a stronger allergic response. These responses were highlighted by when they found administration of IL-33 failed to induce IL-5 and IL-13 secretion by MyD88 -/-T cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. They also found that IL-33 induces NF-kB p65 and the MAPK p38， JNK %(c-Jun N-terminal**\n\n【18】**kinases) and ERK Y (extracellular signal-regulated kinases). Though IL-33 was reported to be integral to mast cells and allergic responses， the role of ST2 has been controversial for Ag-specific asthma. They concluded in that the IL-33/ST2 signaling is more involved in acute allergic response than chronic allergies.**\n\n【19】**The processing and release of IL-33**\n\n【20】**As part of the IL-1 family， IL-33 does not possess signal peptide to release the proteins via endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi pathway. Hence， via external stimuli like allergens or injury， IL-33 is released by epithelial， endothelial， smooth cells and fibroblasts. The involvement of IL-33 in the development of allergic rhinitis induced by ragweed pollen challenge as IL-33 knock-out mice failed to induce ragweed pollen induced allergic reaction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. They found that Type2 Innate Lymphoid Cells (ILC2) localized in mucosal tissues like lung and intestine， adipose tissue and lymphoid organs like spleen and lymphoid tissue were major targets of IL-33 due to their high expression of ST-2 receptors. Thesecells also produced high quantities of type 2 cytokines IL-5 and IL-13 which was previously discussed as part of the signal cascade involving IL-33/ST2/MyD88. The various functions played by IL-33 have resulted in theorizing IL-33 to be both a cytokine and an intracellular nuclear factor with transcriptional regulatory functions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.**\n\n【21】**The Novel Alarmin**\n\n【22】**IL-33 is considered a “novel alarmin\"due to its secretion upon necrosis or damage and released upon responseto antigen. It is notably increased in expression in asthmatic patients vs. normal patients. It has been reported to induce airway bronchoconstriction through mast cell activation in murine models and found IL-33 protein in the lungs of mice with OVA/alum-induced airway inflammation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. This is due to the increased expression of tryptophan hydroxylase I by IL-33 that leads to serotonin synthesis and storage causing airway obstruction in asthma. It is also noted to be higher in patients with atopic dermatitis founded in epidermal keratinocytes. The high number of ILC2s in epidermal skin cells and lymph nodes release IL-5 leading to eosinophilic dermatitis. These are some of the many ways IL-33 is involved in various allergic reactions.**\n\n【23】**Future uses and novel therapy targeting IL-33**\n\n【24】**To create an effective future treatment， we have to appreciate the basic genetic component of IL-33 and understand the target region. IL-33 consists of an N-terminal helix-turned helix motif responsible for nuclear translocation and chromatin binding. It also has an IL-1like C-terminal domain， which is cleaved by a caspase to form a**\n\n【25】**mature 18kDa peptide from the original 30 kDa peptide. The deletion of the N-terminal domain containing the chromatin-binding motif has led to early lethality in mice by constitutive secretion of IL-33 in serum leading to multi-organ failure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.**\n\n【26】**One of the endogenous mechanisms that was studied was the recently reported IL-22 cytokine that originated from the IL-10， expressing REG3y from lung epithelial cells in mice that suppress IL-33 expression and accumulation of ILC2s in the lung. Another idea is to sequester ILL-33 in the nucleus of IL-33 producing cells. The parasite Heligmosomoides polygyrus releases a product named H. Polygyrus Alarmin Release Inhibitor (HpARI) that binds to IL-33via the N-terminus and tethers active IL-33 within necrotic cells \\[61. Other approaches involve controlling the bioactivity of IL-33 as it can be rapidly inactivated by oxidation of four critical cysteine residues that result in extensive reconfiguration of the ST2 receptors.**\n\n【27】**All these novel therapy approaches require further testing and clinical trials but the fact remains that IL-33 is a key factor in allergic responses. Targeting the IL-33/ST2 pathway will be a critical component in the future treatment of allergic reactions and the more extensive our knowledge grows on the vital IL-33 genetic and secondary pathways， the better future therapy will be to treat and prevent patients with allergic reactions.**\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**1\\.

India is a country of diverse culture and dynamic life-style which shows variations from one geographical location to another. Evidence suggests that 70% to 90% of cancers in India are related to lifestyle and can be easily prevented by adapting healthier life styles. Thus， this review aimed to examine risk factors of lifestyle cancers in different geographical locations in India. Three electronic databases， namely Psych INFO，JSTOR and Medline were systematically screened from December， 2017 to February，2018 for literatures on cancer and lifestyle risk factors. The search was limited to India， adults and papers written in English. 2，301 articles were identified and 10 were reviewed. Smoking and tobacco consumption were strongly related with lung， gastric and oral cancers in South and West India. Additionally， in West India， tea consumption was identified as a contributory factor for esophageal cancer while consumption of cabbage and sprout were found to lower the risk of colorectal cancer. In North India， attributions to esophageal cancer were snuff， smoking， salty tea， hookah， sundried foods and red chilli. A number of risk factors were unique to the different geographical locations in India. Awareness of these risk factors would help in strengthening preventive interventions which would facilitate a decline in cancer incidence in India and other countries where similar risk factors are prevalent. This review proposes to organize tailor-made awareness programs reflecting resonance to socio-cultural practice of people to reduce cancer incidence. Also， facilitation of tobacco and smoking cessation programs and strengthening of policies are strongly recommended to strengthen preventive interventions and reduce cancer incidence.**\n\n【12】**Keywords： Lifestyle； Cancer； Risk factor； Dietary patterns； India； Tobacco； Smoking**\n\n【13】**Introduction**\n\n【14】**Cancer is a lifestyle disease which is grouped according to the location of the cancerous stem cells. The World Health Organization defined cancer as “a generic term used for a large group of diseases that are characterized by the growth of abnormal cells beyond their usual boundaries and can invade to adjoining parts of the body) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Cancer is reported to be the second leading cause of death globally which accounted for 8.8 million deaths in 2015 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. The burden of diseases is doubled in the developing countries in that both non-communicable diseases and communicable diseases contribute largely to morbidity and mortality， and India seems to fall in this category where the burden of non-communicable diseases and communicable diseases are 63% and 37%， respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. The WHO Cancer Country profile revealed that 19.1% of premature deaths from NCDs (3，022，150) in 2016 resulted from cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. In addition， WHO cancer country profile， also revealed an increase in cancer mortalities from 683，800 deaths in 2014 to 784，821 deaths in 2018which implies the increasing trend in cancer mortalities in India \\[4，5\\]. Anand et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u> opined that only 5% to 10% of all cancer cases can be attributed to genetic defects， while the remaining 90%to 95% have their roots in the environment and lifestyle which includes cigarette smoking， diet， tobacco consumption， alcohol consumption， sun exposure， environmental pollutants， infections， stress， obesity， and physical inactivity.**\n\n【15】**In India alone， about 800，000 new cases of cancer are estimated to occur every year with stark variation across region where the age-adjusted incidence rates in men vary from 44 per 100，000 in rural Maharashtra to 121 per 100，000 in Delhi 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. The major cancers in men are mostly tobacco-related namely lung， oral cavity， larynx， esophagus， and pharynx. In women， the leading cancers sites include are cervix， breast， and ovary cancer and those related to tobacco namely oral cavity，**\n\n【16】**esophagus， and lung 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. India has the largest number of oral cancers in the world， due to the widespread habit of chewing tobacco 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Also， India is a nation with wide diversity in food habits and cultural practices， some of which are also found in other countries of the world. The prevalence of lifestyle cancers in India therefore gives a reason to critically examine the risk factors associated with these cancers for the management of lifestyle cancer incidence in India and the world at large.**\n\n【17】**Methodology**\n\n【18】**Literature selection criteria**\n\n【19】**A computerized search for literature was conducted using electronic databases namely Medline through Pubmed， Psych Info and JSTOR. The broad search term used for this review was cancer’which was combined with keywords prevalence’， fepidemiology， burden， qualityoflife， health care services，using AND'as Boolean operator. Each combination was carried out individually to get maximum results. In addition， MeSH term for cancer i.e. ‘neoplasm’was also used for each combination to cover maximum results. All search results were limited to studies with humans and published in English language. To retrieve more recent literature， a timeline of 10years was traced for database search but in case of JSTOR， timeline of only last five years was retrieved owing to huge nature of JSTOR.**\n\n【20】**Since lifestyle behavior is mainly formed in adult life， thus present review focuses on cancers among adults leaving children out of the scope of selection procedure. Thus， inclusion criteria for identifying the studies for this review included：**\n\n【21】**_1\\._ Research papers only， review papers or conceptual articles were excluded**\n\n【22】**_2\\._ Cancer as main disease， cancer as co-morbidity was excluded**\n\n【23】**_3\\._ Cancer among adults， studies with children were excluded**\n\n【24】**_4\\._ India as nationality and residency，studies with non-Indians and migrant Indians were excluded.**\n\n【25】**Data extraction process**\n\n【26】**Identification of studies for this review involved four stages. At the first stage， a total of 2，301 studies were retrieved from three databases using above keywords， out of which 1，402 were irrelevant to present review since these were pharmacological studies， molecular studies， genetic studies or studies conducted outside India. In addition， 167duplicates were manually removed by the titles resulting in 732studies to be screened by abstract.**\n\n【27】**At the second stage， 732 papers were screened with abstract reading， out of these 617 studied either children or elderly subjects， focused cancer as comorbidity， conducted with non-Indians or migrated Indians. This resulted in 115 studies after abstract screening to be reviewed for full text availability.**\n\n【28】**At the third stage， all the selected 115 studies were searched for full text availability but only 82 studies were available in full text to download excluding 33 studies from the scope of this review. Further， another 67 studies were removed because they combined children and adult population， focused on lesions， or were review papers which were not clear from abstract reading. Another 5 duplicate studies that were previously omitted were manually removed at full text reading resulting in 10 studies eligible for this review. The selection procedure of eligible studies is presented in Figure 1. Step 1**\n\n【29】**& 2 was first conducted by DK which was then reviewed by TB&AK Step 3& 4 were conducted by DK and TB together.**\n\n【30】**Data from selected 10 studies were extracted using a self developed data extraction form  which presented information like year of study， location， age group， duration of study， study setting， objectives， study design， sample size， sampling strategy， analysis procedure and results to facilitate transparency in data analysis. DK extracted data from selected studies. TB and AK then assessed a 30% sample of randomly selected studies to check accuracy and ensure rigor in data extraction process. We differed at few instances in methodology and findings sections of the reviewed studies but consensus was arrived after discussion.**\n\n【31】**Results**\n\n【32】**On the basis of geographical location ofthe research， the selected studies were grouped into three categories：**\n\n【33】**_1\\._ South India (three studies)**\n\n【34】**_2\\._ West India (four studies)**\n\n【35】**_3\\._ North India (three studies)**\n\n【36】**We could not find any study from eastern part of India using our search strategy.**\n\n【37】**Studies from South India**\n\n【38】**One study from South India reported the clinical profile and epidemiological trends of lung cancer with an emphasis on smoking practices 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. The data was collected from a sample of 258 lung cancer patients (200 males， 58 females) from January 2003 to December2007. The age range of the participants in this study was 26 to 77years. The study reported 60.5% participants were ever-smokers while only 39.5% were never smokers. Among the smokers， 71.8%smoked cigarette while 28.2% smoked bidi. A significant correlation(P=0.0028) was found between advanced age at presentation (>60years) and those with a history of smoking.**\n\n【39】**Jayalekshmi et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u> reported a cohort study conducted in Kerala on the risk of gastric cancer in relation to tobacco and alcohol consumption. A baseline survey was conducted on every resident of Karunagappally taluk covering 65，553 participants (30 to 84 years) for socio-demographic and other lifestyle-related factors from January 1990 to December， 1997. The face-to-face interview survey was conducted with the help of trained field investigators for each resident using a 6-page， standardized questionnaire which was constructed with specific questions to elicit factors such as household socioeconomic status， religion， education， income， and occupation along with lifestyle factors such as smoking and drinking habits， and dietary practices 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. The study reported that Bidi smoking was associated with Gastric Cancer (GC) risk (P=0.042). The Relative Risks (RR) comparing current versus never smokers was 1.6 (95% CI：1.0-2.5). Gastric cancer risk was associated with the number of bidis smoked daily (P=0.012) and duration of bidi smoking (P=0.036). Those who started smoking bidi at younger ages were at an elevated GC risk. The RRs for those that started bidi smoking under the age of 18 and ages 18 to 22 were 2.0 (95% CI： 1.0-3.9) and 1.8(95% CI：1.1-2.9)， respectively， when their risks were compared with lifetime non-smokers of bidis.**\n\n【40】**Mahapatra et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u> also examined the association between oral cancer risks and consumption of tobacco， cigarette and other oral dip products from March 2013 to July 2013 with 402 participants**\n\n| **Table 1： Summary of reviewed studies.**  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **First AuthorandYear**  | **Objective(S)**  | **Design**  | **Sample and Samplingstrategy**  | **Analysis procedures**  | **Main finding s**  | **ReviewerRemarks**  |\n| **Krishnamurthy et al.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>，2012， South India(Chennai**  | **To analyze the clinical profileand the epidemiologicaltrends in lung cancer** **patients with an emphasis onthe smoking practices from asingle tertiary care center**  | **5-Year Retrospective-prospective study on 258lung cancer patients (200males， 58 females) aged26-77 years in a tertiaryhealth setting in Chennai.**  | **Retrospective analysis ofprospectively collected dataof consecutive hospitalin-patients with a provendiagnosis of lung cancer at atertiary care oncology centre.**  | **SPSS software (Version18\\]was used.**  | **60.5% were smokers while** **39.5% were non-smokers.Smokers were cigarette(71.8%) and bidi (28.2%)smokers.**  | **Single facilitystudy which maynot represent thegeneral populationSample sizedetermination wasnot reported.**  |\n| **Krishnamurthy et al.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>，2012， South India(Chennai**  |  |  |  |  | **Acenocarcinoma was most** **prevalent among non-smokers(52.7%)and squamous cellcarcinoma among smokers(80.4%).**  | **Study includedsurvival rate of thesample.**  |\n| **Krishnamurthy et al.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>，2012， South India(Chennai**  |  |  |  |  | **Signiticant correlation ofsmokers presented atadvanced age (>60 years\\] withsquamous histology comparedto adenocarcinoma histology** **(P=0.00281.**  | **Structured abstract**  |\n| **Ganesh，et al. \\[101，2009， West India(Mumbai)**  | **Evaluating the associationof some life-style factors，dietary items on risk ofesophageal cancer.**  | **3-year hospital-based Casecontrol study on 2，070participants (442cancercases， 1628 controls\\]aged30-75 years in Mumbai.Cancer site is esophagus.Questionnaire andinterview was used for datacollection**  | **Interview of patients at Out-patient department of thehospital prior to diagnosis，recorc of information intopre-designed questionnaire，segregation of subjects into'cancer cases and 'controls.**  | **Univariate analysis andUnconditional logisticregression was appliedusing SPSS Version15.0 software**  | **lobacco+ pan chewers have1(C.3 times excess risk (OR=1.3.**  | **Unstructuredabstract.**  |\n| **Ganesh，et al. \\[101，2009， West India(Mumbai)**  |  |  |  |  | **Smoking bidi increased therisk 1.8 times (OR=1.8\\]andsmokingfr cigarettes increasedthe risk (OR=2)2-fold.

They studied the risk of demographic， dietary habits and lifestyle factors through interview in an out-patient department. These examined tobacco， alcohol， unhealthy diet and tea drinking as risk factors of esophageal cancer and colorectal cancer in Mumbai. They reported a moderate 1.3 times excess risk for chewers of pan(betel-leaf) with tobacco， 1.8-fold excess risk each for bidi smokers and alcohol drinkers， 2-fold for cigarette smokers， and tea drinking showed a 4-fold excess risk for esophageal cancer. Both studies also reported a dose-response relationship among pan with tobacco chewers and an increased risk with time duration. Similarly， bidi and cigarette smoking showed a positive dose-response relationship where the risks increased to 2.4 and 2.5 folds respectively. Some significant findings emerged regarding the dietary habits and colorectal cancer. Cabbage-eaters had a 50% reduction in risk among both the genders， compared to those who did not eat cabbage.

A matched case-control sample (N=700； 350 controls， 350 cases) was studied using a self-reported questionnaire tracking information on consumption of tobacco， poly-ingredient oral dip products， alcohol， dietary habits and demographic status. A great risk of oral cancer in tobacco chewers and oral dipping consumers was reported. Three Smoking categories (filtered， non- filtered cigarette and bidi) were prevalent in cases and all the oral dip products {chewing tobacco， mishiri， gutkha， and supari} except betel quid， (P=0.112)， and panparag(P=0.621)， showed significant difference in cases.

The study examined the significance of alcohol， tobacco， dietary items and occupational exposure to non-Hodgkin lymphoma risk. The findings suggested that， among the dietary items， only consumption of mutton showed 7.0-fold significant excess risk for non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Consumption of milk showed a 6-fold excess risk (OR=1.5)； while coffee showed a 50% reduction risk for non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

Samples were selected from patients who attended the Endoscopy Unit of Government Medical College from October 2007 to July2011. Patients below the age of 80 years and being diagnosed with squamous cell carcinomas of the esophagus were the cases while patients diagnosed with other diseases were the controls. Data on age， gender， educational level， and socio-economic status， family history of OC (first-degree relatives)， clinic pathological symptoms and dietary habits were collected using a short-structured questionnaire. The study examined risk factors and survival rate of OC and revealed that among dietary characteristics， snuff was highest (OR=3.86，95%) followed by salt tea (OR=2.53， 95%)， smoking (OR=1.97，95%)， sundried food (OR=1.77， 95%) and red chilly (OR=1.76，95%).

A preponderance of male cases over females was reported and majority of the cases were farmers (37%) and house-wives (29%) belonging to the low-socioeconomic status. It was further reported that， 91.7% of the cases were hookah smokers(major mode of smoking in Kashmir)， 78.8% smoked more than 20 g of tobacco per day， and 24% consumed five cups of salty tea per day. Sun-dried vegetable called Haakh was consumed by both cases and controls. With respect to fruit consumption， 45% cases consumed monthly， 40% consumed weekly while none consumed fruits daily.

Data were collected using a semi-structured interview schedule. The study revealed that illiteracy， low socioeconomic status， high parity (more than three)； early pregnancy and use of non-liquefied petroleum gas are associated with the risk of gall bladder cancer. They further reported that there was no significant relationship between alcohol consumption， tobacco consumption， education and age at menarche.

The studies were location-specific with none covering India as a whole. In addition to the commonly known risk factors like smoking， alcohol and tobacco consumption， dietary patterns and life style factors were also identified to pose risk to certain cancers. However， a variation was seen depending upon geographicallocation and different cancer sites.**\n\n【60】**Smoking**\n\n【61】**Smoking has been identified as the predominant cause of lung cancer， esophageal， oral and gastric cancer across the world having increased risk with longer duration andhigh quantity of consumption通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Earlier studies have reported a higher risk with bidi smoking in**\n\n【62】**comparison with cigarette 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19-21\\]</u>. High prevalence of lung cancer in Chennai was attributed to smoking (bidi and cigarette) especially among males， and the significant correlation found between advanced age at presentation (>60 years) and those with a history of smoking suggests high risk of cancer among advanced age smokers in comparison to young age 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Hookah smoking was quite popular in Kashmir region particularly among farmers. Smoking was also an established risk factor for esophageal cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22-25\\]</u>. In Pune， bidi smoking was identified as a significant risk to oral cancer while betel quid and filtered cigarette were not. Bidi smoking was observed to be more prevalent than cigarette； this could be attributed to the cheap cost thereby implicating its affordability by the low socioeconomic status 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>.**\n\n【63】**In Kerala， higher frequency and increased duration of bidi smoking heightened the risk of cancer and significant differences were observed for gastric cancer incidence among the low socioeconomic class. These differences could be associated to their dietary patterns， although it was not reported in the reviewed study 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>**\n\n【64】**Cigarette smoking and bidi smoking were reported to be associated with Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL) in Mumbai while alcohol consumption was not， although riskwas enhanced in drinkers by 50% compared to non-drinkers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>.**\n\n【65】**Passive smokers**\n\n【66】**Previous studies have established the association between smoking and lung cancer； nevertheless， there has been a rising trend in the occurrence of lung cancer in non-smokers as well especially among females. This could be attributed to second-hand smoking，**\n\n【67】**whereby they were exposed to passive smoking from their spouses while they worked closely on the farm and other indoor air pollutants\\[3，26，27\\]. This has also been reported as a contributory factor predisposing women to the risk of esophageal cancer in addition to the use of cow dung， wood and coal for cooking in Kashmir \\[17，28\\].**\n\n【68】**Tobacco consumption**\n\n【69】**Consumption of tobacco has been reported in various forms， such as， cigarette， hukka， bidi and snuff in the Jammu region 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. In addition to previously established association of cigarette， hukka and bidi with esophageal cancer， snuff intake has also been correlated with esophageal cancer because of the presence of tobacco carcinogens in moist snuff \\[291.**\n\n【70】**Over half of all tobacco consumed in India is smoked as bidi(Indian specific non-filtered cigarette) and about one-fourth of tobacco consumption is in smokeless form， such as chewing tobacco and mishiri 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[30\\]</u>. A great risk for oral cancer was found in the habit of tobacco chewing， with or without lime， which is kept in the mouth for different durations depending on personal habits. In an investigation that compared smokers with smokeless tobacco and oral dipping products users， both were at increased risk of oral cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. This could be due to the direct contact of these products with the oral epithelium of the users.**\n\n【71】**India has the largest number oforal cancer diagnosis in the world， due to the widespread habit of chewing tobacco 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Oral cancer is strongly attributed to consumption of gutkha， tobacco chewing， consumption of supari and consumption of mishiri. Areca nut， the seed of the fruit of the oriental palm Areca catechu， is commonly used in India to prepare paan or betel quid， pan masala and gutkha. Chewing of pure areca nut has been associated with the risk of oral cancer because of its ability to promote carcinogenesis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[31\\]</u>. Gutkha contains areca nut， slaked lime， catechu， condiments， and powered tobacco. Gutkha can be highly addictive when compared to chewing ordinary tobacco as it has been previously shown to be a gateway to smoking 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[32\\]</u>.**\n\n【72】**When compared with non- consumers， Gutkha consumers were5.1 times more at risk of oral cancer， supari consumers were 11.4times more at risk，tobacco chewers were 6.0 times more at risk， betel quid consumers were 6.4times more at risk and bidi smokers were 2.3times more at risk of oral cancer while Betel quid had no significant effect in causing oral cancer \\[11，14\\].**\n\n【73】**This could infer a protective effect of betel leaf (the main ingredient of betel quid) to the oral mucosa against the harmful alkaloids in areca nut. Betel leaf is known to be rich in beta-carotene which has the capacity to quench free radical 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.**\n\n【74】**In contrast， another study opined that chewing tobacco with paan (betel leaf) is more harmful in causing esophageal cancer than chewing tobacco only. It was speculated that while chewing tobacco with betel leaf， the juice comes in contact with the esophagus mucosa as opposed to tobacco juice alone which may be spat out without a direct contact with the esophagus mucosa 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>.**\n\n【75】**Alcohol consumption**\n\n【76】**Although oral cancer risk was not reported to be associated with cigarette smoking and mishiri consumption but alcohol was reported to be associated with a high risk of oral cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. In Kerala， Alcohol consumed was limited to arrack because it was the commonly consumed among the study population. Majority of the cases were**\n\n【77】**educated only until primary level and this could have an influence on their heightened alcohol consumption. Future researches are therefore recommended to establish the association of gastric cancer with other alcoholic drinks alcohol drinking was not reported in Kashmir； this could be due to the prevalence of Muslims in the region通用删除6(英):<u>\\[33\\]</u>.**\n\n【78】**Dietary pattern**\n\n**Tea is a common beverage in India. Salted tea has been reported as a dietary factor which is strongly associated with esophageal cancer通用删除6(英):<u>\\[31\\]</u>. The tea is prepared by brewing green tea leaves with sodium chloride to obtain a reddish brown extract after which water， salt and milk are added to it. Consumption of bicarbonate-containing hot salted tea， commonly consumed by Kashmiri people， has been identified as dietary high-risk factor associated with the development of esophageal carcinogenesis. This type of tea is commonly consumed at a high temperature due to the harsh weather that is prevalent in the region. The hyperthermic effect of this tea could be injurious to the esophageal mucosa 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[34\\]</u>. This correlates with an earlier study that reported a relationship between tea drinking and stomach cancer in Kashmir 33|.**\n\n【80】**Also， the risk of esophageal cancer due to tea drinking was reported in Mumbai as a result of the high temperature of the tea consumed， which could be injurious to the esophageal lining， although the actual temperature that causes injury is not known通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. In contrast， another investigation reported tea drinking to show less risk and coffee drinking showed a 50% reduction in risk when compared to non-drinkers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. Coffee has been reported to protect from cancer through the activity of its anti-carcinogenic constituents通用删除6(英):<u>\\[35\\]</u>.**\n\n【81】**In Kashmir region， the diet commonly consumed are cooked rice， green-leafy vegetable called haakh and salted tea. These have limited source of protective factor from esophageal cancer， as compared to the consumption of different varieties of fruits and vegetables， which are rich in the presence of vitamins and carotene that induces anti-oxidant effects 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[36\\]</u>. Increased intake of vitamin C was reported to be a protective factor against Gall Bladder Cancer， this is supported by an earlier hypothesis posing vitamin C to be an antioxidant which prevents the formation of carcinogen from precursor compounds， although there is no strong evidence for this 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[37\\]</u>. Also， dietary factors revealed red meat consumption to be a high risk factor for the incidence of NHL； this has also been confirmed by earlier studies通用删除6(英):<u>\\[38\\]</u>. However， high consumption of vegetables reduced the risk of NHL but they did not emerge as a protective factor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. Fresh fish on the other hand was reported to be a protective factor， this finding is similar to a study reported on risks of esophageal cancers in Mumbai\\[13，39\\]. Animal studies have shown that fat from fish contains 20% to25% saturated fatty acids， and fish and fish oil are a rich source of n-3fatty acids and the fat-soluble vitamins A and D， and these n-3 fatty acids have anti-inflammatory effects 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[40\\]</u>.**\n\n【82】**Meat consumption was found to be a risk factor among the women in the population which could be as a result of their small sample size when compared to the males (females =59， males =144). Further research should be conducted on a larger population in order to establish the association between meat consumption and colorectal cancer in females. Among the vegetarian diets， only cabbage and sprout consumption were reported to be protective factors while dark green leafy vegetables， root vegetables and other vegetables were not shown to reduce the risk of colorectal cancer. The anti-carcinogenic**\n\n【83】**actions of cruciferous vegetables are commonly attributed to them because theycontain glucosinolates 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[41\\]</u>. Sprouts contain antioxidants which may be the reason for its protective factor.**\n\n【84】**Food preservation**\n\n【85】**Owing to unavailability of vegetables， nomadic lifestyle and harsh weather， sun-drying is a common strategy used to preserve food in Jammu and Kashmir. This method facilitates the growth of mould， fungi and the presence of trace levels of several volatile and non-volatile N-nitroso compounds which have been strongly implicated with esophageal cancer \\[31，42，43\\].**\n\n【86】**Furthermore， the risk of colorectal cancer in Mumbai was associated with consumption of dry fish. This is speculated to be due to the fact that the dry fish is salted， dried and preserved for later use thereby exposing it to harmful microorganisms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.**\n\n【87】**Occupational exposure and socioeconomic factors**\n\n【88】**Occupational exposure was reported as a contributory factor to the risk of esophageal cancer in Kashmir where farmers are likely exposed to hazardous chemicals and biological farming that are suspected carcinogens 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. Although， the relationship between farming and risk of esophageal cancer was reported， other occupations were not included， therefore studies that include other occupations are strongly recommended. Also， poor socio-economic status posed to be a major risk factor predisposing the population to esophageal cancer in Kashmir. The absence of dietary nutrients， specifically vitamins A， E，Candtrace elements like zinc and selenium in meals， as observed in poor people increases the chances of cancer44，45.**\n\n【89】**In North India， the risk factors associated with Gall Bladder Cancer (GBC) were low education， three or more parity (childbirth)， early pregnancy and exposure to non-liquefied petroleum gas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. Early pregnancy and multiple pregnancies will elevate the levels of progesterone and estrogen which may change the lithogenicity of bile and increase the risk of GBC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[46\\]</u>. Non-liquefied petroleum gas does not burn completely therefore producing carbon monoxide， poly-organic and poly-aromatic hydrocarbons and other gases that could be carcinogenic thereby causing harm to women who use them to cook 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>. The role of traditional non-liquefied petroleum gas fuel in the incidence of GBC has not been well established， therefore future research is recommended in this area.**\n\n【90】**India being a country with a wide variation in food habits and cultural practices infers the possibility of similar lifestyle risk factors in other nations of the world. Consumption of hot tea and smoking are common habits in cold regions where people want to stay warm in the cold seasons. Also， there is a high rate of alcohol and tobacco consumption in many developed and developing countries inferring a high risk ofcancer incidence. In addition， meat is a highly consumed non-vegetarian diet in various countries in the world while vegetables are still less consumed in many countries causing poor nutrient intake in the population. These lifestyle risk factors， though are revealed from studies in India have the potential to draw inferences to other countries which have similar life-style.**\n\n【91】**Major gaps and recommendations**\n\n【92】**Hospital based surveys might not present the actual prevalence of cancer in the regions， therefore large population-based research is required to reveal the lifestyle risk factors of various cancers in the country for policy based interventions**\n\n【93】**Also， occupational exposure history especially exposure to chemicals， poisonous gases， and other occupational hazards needs to be studied with large samples in order to examine the suggesting relationship with cancer. In addition， physical activity which is also a risk factor for lifestyle cancers was not included in any of the reviewed studies.**\n\n【94】**We therefore recommend future research focusing on physical activity and its association with risk of cancers. In addition， we recommend that future research should examine the evidence of these contributory factors in the risk of cancers in India. Also， we recommend the need for quality research in other parts of India， in order to provide a wider perspective to the lifestyle factors that is contributing to the rising burden of lifestyle cancers in India.**\n\n【95】**Conclusion**\n\n【96】**In conclusion， this systematic review reveals that lifestyle cancers have a high incidence in India and this could be associated with the prevalence of risk factors like tobacco consumption， alcohol consumption， and dietary patterns of which tobacco consumption， a common habit in India is foremost. Lung cancer， gastric cancer， oral cancer， colorectal cancer， esophageal cancer， Gall bladder cancer and non-Hodgkin'slymphoma were identified as main cancers attributing to life style factors. Though life style factors like smoking， tobacco consumption， and other oral dip products were common factors in north， south and west India， few risk factors like consumption of salty tea， hookah，sundried foods and red chilly were unique to North India. Cabbage sprouts and Vitamin C rich foods were identified to have protective properties. Consumption of high temperature tea poses a risk of esophageal cancer while coffee has protective tendencies. Also， the consumption of various fruits and vegetables that are rich in vitamins and carotene have anti-oxidant effects which reduce the risk of lifestyle cancers. Among non-vegetarian diets， fresh fish is a protective factor while the risk associated with meat consumption is not yet established. However， the exposure of dry fish to harmful micro-organisms during preservation makes it a threat to the body. Amongst females， cooking methods such as the use of non-liquefied petroleum gas， cow dung， coal and wood and also exposure to passive smoking， high parity， and early pregnancy also emerged as risk factors for life style cancers. Contributory factors like occupational exposure， low education， and low socio-economic status have also been identified with these cancers. There is variation in the incidence of risk factors in different regions due to the diversity of lifestyle patterns in India， a reflection of what exists in the globe. This review therefore implies the need for better and more effective awareness programs which focuses not only on widely known risk factors but also those that are yet to be established. Also，establishment of tobacco and smoking cessation programs at various levels and enactment of policies to strengthen preventive measures are strongly recommended to achieve a decline in the burden of lifestyle cancers.**\n\n【97】**Limitations of the Study**\n\n【98】**Due to time constraint， the reviewer could not explore other databases like CINAHL which could have added to the available studies in the reviewed area.

In current study， the hepatoprotective aptitude of T. cordata was evaluated against Aceclofenac (ACF) instigated oxidative stress in rats. Leaves of T. cordata were extracted in methanol and various fractions were prepared by polarity-based method. Qualitative and quantitative spectrophotometric analysis along with HPLC-DAD analysis was performed on samples. Antioxidant potential of extracts was identified by DPPH method while BSA method was used to assess the anti-inflammatory activity. Rats were divided into various groups and oxidative stress was induced by ACF in liver of rats. T. cordata Methanol extract (TCM) was used to mitigate the oxidative stress. Serum analysis for liver enzymes and tissue analysis for enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants was performed. Qualitative and quantitative spectrophotometric analysis of various extracts depicted the presence of phenolics， flavonoids， andtannins. In vitro antioxidant and anti-inflammatory studies further elaborated the protective potential of plant extracts. Furthermore， treatment of rats with ACF showed decline (p<0.05) in the level of liver antioxidant enzymes， in contrast，elevation was found in the concentration ofhydrogen peroxide and nitrite in hepatic tissues. Increased serum markers of the liver were revealed after ACF treatment. Hepatocyte inflammation and injuries were prominent in histopathological studies of the liver in ACF-treated rats. However， the administration of TCM to ACF-intoxicated rats reduced liver injuries and restored the levels of antioxidant enzymes and free radical towards normal rats. T. cordata possess strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory potential due to presence of polyphenols and can help in development of drug against liver injuries with strong antioxidant potential.**\n\n【5】**Keywords： Telosma cordata； Antioxidants； Anti-inflammatory； Oxidative stress； Aceclofenac**\n\n【6】**Abbreviations**\n\n【7】**OPEN ACCESS**\n\n【8】**_\\*Correspondence：Mehreen Fatima， Department of_ _Biochemistry， Quaid-j-Azam University，_ _Islamabad， Pakistan，_ _E-mail： mfatima@bs.qau.edu.pk_ Received Date： 30 May 2023**\n\n【9】**TCM： Telosma cordata Methanol extract； ER： Endoplasmic Reticulum； TPC： Total Phenolic Content； TFC： Total Flavonoid Content； TTC： Total Tannin Content； HPLC： High Performance Liquid Chromatography； DPPH： 2，2-Diphenylpicrylhydrazyl； BSA： Bovine Serum albumin； ACF：Aceclofenac； TLC： Total Leukocyte Count； MCH： Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin； PTC： Platelets Count； MCV： Mean Corpuscular Volume； ALT： Alanine Transferase；AST： Aspartate Transaminase； ALP： Alkaline Phosphate； SOD： Superoxide Dismutase； POD： peroxidase； CAT： Catalase**\n\n【10】**Accepted Date： 12 Jun 2023**\n\n【11】**Introduction**\n\n【12】**Published Date： 17 Jun 2023 _Citation：Fatima M， Rashid Khan M.

ROS have the ability to initiate lipid peroxidation， known as a chain reaction， and cause oxidation of other cellular components， such as DNA and proteins. The main cause of liver ailment is lipid peroxidation which arises due to prolonged exposure to hepatotoxins. These free radicals enhance the production of Thiobarbituric Reactive Substances (TBARS)，when they interact with the polyunsaturated fatty acids，henceleading to necrosis. Therefore， Oxidative stress causes several ailments i.e.， cancer， atherosclerosis， nervous disorder， diabetes， idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis， asthma， and liver fibrosis.

In contrast， silymarin treatment showed ameliorating effects against ACF-induced toxicity as body and organ weights of this group were similar to normal rats. Co-administration ofTCM (150 mg/kg bw and 300 mg/kg bw) with ACF suppressed the toxic effects of ACF and showed an increase in body weight whereas restoration of absolute and relative liver weight was also observed. Administration of rats with only plant dose (150 mg/kg bw and 300 mg/kg bw) depicted a significant (p<0.05) elevation in body weight .**\n\n【110】**T. cordata restored serum markers in liver**\n\n【111】**After administration of ACF， an increase in levels of specific liver serum enzymes such as ALP， AST， ALT， and total bilirubin was observed . Though， albumin showed a significant decrease in its level. Increased levels of various serum enzymes are associated with hepatic damage with loss of integrity of cells. By contrast， co-administration of ACF with silymarin significantly (p<0.05) restored the level of these serum enzymes towards the control rats. Likewise， simultaneous treatment of Aceclofenac and TCM doses (150 mg/kg bw and 300 mg/kg bw) showed a remarkable effect (p<0.05) in repressing the levels of serum markers， yet an increase in albumin level was also notable.**\n\n【112】**T. cordata restored antioxidant enzymes in liver**\n\n【113】**Figure 4 shows levels of antioxidant enzymes in liver tissue after TCM treatments. Upon ACF administration， tissue damage was observed with a significant (p<0.05) reduction in the level of catalase， superoxide dismutase，peroxidase， and reduced glutathione.Although treatment with silymarin along with ACF showed a protective effect againstliver injury， as ensured by higher levels ofthese enzymes. Co-administration ofTCM doses with ACF reportedly (p<0.05) elevated the levels of these enzymes in comparison to the rats treated with ACF only. However， TCM alone showed no effect on the biological activities of these enzymes.**\n\n【114】**CAT： Catalase； SOD： Superoxide Dismutase： POD： Peroxidase： GSH：Reduced Glutathione**\n\n【115】**T. cordata reduced toxicity in liver tissues**\n\n【116】**Table 7 summarizes the hepatoprotective ability of TCM on levels of H，O。 nitrite， TBARS， and total protein.

TCM administration with ACF markedly (p<0.05) reduced the concentration of biochemical markers while an elevation was observed in protein level. Rats treated with TCM alone did not affect the levels of biochemical markers. By reducing the hepatotoxicity caused by ACF， silymarin administration showed a significant(p<0.05) restoration of nitrites， TBARS， H，O， and total protein toward the normallevel.**\n\n【117】**Figure 5： Histopathological analysis of liver tissues after different treatments(CV： Central Vein).**\n\n【118】**Protective role of T. cordata on histology of liver**\n\n【119】**Liver of normal rats showed a normal architecture with intact hepatocytes， central vein and equally distributed cytoplasm. Liver of ACF treated rats showed severe injuries such as sinusoidal obstructions， necrosis， fibrosis， and hepatocellular degeneration as alterations were prominent in morphology of tissue. Administration of high dose of TCM with ACF showed improvement in morphological structure of liver by reducing the liver damages and injuries hence showing protection against liver toxicity while rats administered with low dose of plant TCM along with ACF showed necrosis and some injuries. Liver of rats from TCM alone treated groups had shown normal morphological features of liver . Silymarin (200 mg/kg bw)， a standard drug， was given to restore structural abnormalities and cellular anomalies as shown in Figure 3 and 5C.**\n\n【120】**Discussion**\n\n【121】**Toxic chemical substances cause liver injuries in body which induces oxidative stress and inflammation. Natural antioxidants and food additives help to reduce induced stress and toxic effects of xenobiotics by scavenging free radicals. Humans have been using plants as a source of conventional medicines for hundreds of vears. Many herbal extracts， prepared from plants， have been examined for their antioxidant， anti-inflammatory， andhepatoprotective properties against liver injuries in various experimental animal models 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[34\\]</u>. In the present study， a phytochemical qualitative study confirmed the presence of alkaloids， flavonoids， tannins， coumarins， phenols， and saponins in T. cordata fractions.**\n\n【122】**The production of ROS is correlated with a number of severe**\n\n【123】**and persistent body disorders which embraces liver， pulmonary， neurodegenerative， and digestive infections. Diet is a rich source of antioxidants and can help the body to regulate the deficiency of antioxidants endogenously and thus restore all the damage caused because of oxidative stress.**\n\n【124】**Phenolics and flavonoids such as rutin， quercetin， gallic acid， catechin and caffeic acid were found in the HPLC analysis of TCM. Rutin is a well-known standard antioxidantandprotective compound against toxicity and getting recognition due to its medicinalproperties通用删除6(英):<u>\\[35\\]</u>. On the other hand， catechin shows strong activity against free radicals thus having antioxidant activities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[36\\]</u>. Thus， the presence of these compounds in TCM extract could be the reason for scavenging free radicals when evaluated against DPPH and showing antioxidant activity. The presence of antioxidants in TCM is also linked with the inhibition of denaturation of bovine serum albumin and showing anti-inflammatory potential. Our findings are similar to the studies of Naz et al. which claimed that phytochemicals of Pilea umbrosa have antioxidant properties 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[34\\]</u>.**\n\n【125】**ACF has been identifieddascommonly associated with hepatotoxicity and oxidative stress and it is also assumed as the major cause of cellular disorder by damaging the antioxidant enzymatic system， acute hepatitis， and increasing peroxidation of lipids. Hepatotoxicity from NSAIDs can be found at any time after initiation of treatment， but like most severe drug reactions， it occurs after 6 to12 weeks after administration. In the liver， ACF causes activate lipid peroxidation， necrotic and apoptotic cell death， and deterioration of membranal structure leading to the secretion of enzymatic components in blood. According to previous research， a significant increase in levels of biochemical markers i.e.，ALP， ALT，and AST can be seen after oral induction ofanimal models with Aceclofenac \\[5，37\\]. Toaccess the protective potential ofour plant， an Aceclofenac exposed system is created in rats. Our research has clearly demonstrated that treating the animal models with Aceclofenac at higher dose for about eight weeks on alternate days resulted in the induction of hepatic damage and oxidative stress， while T. cordata showed promising protective results against stress and organ damage. Our results are in line with a previous study 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[37\\]</u>.**\n\n【126】**This study has also found that TCM did not cause injurious alterations in hematological markers， including the count of HB， MCV， WBC， HCT，RBC，and platelets in rats， even at a high dose of3000 mg/kg. TCM is found to be non-toxic， as any signs of discomfort or pain was not obvious in TCM-treated rats. Similar results for the methanolic extract of the plant are declared by previous findings 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[34\\]</u>.**\n\n【127】**Body weight is an important factor in the conflicting effects of hepatotoxins and is replicated as an element that limits toxicity studies. In the current study， the percent increase in body weight of rats was reduced， whereas absolute and relative liver weight was enhanced with ACF administration. Basically， NSAIDs induce oxidative stress by producing free radicals in the body that cause an increase in the organ weight by affecting the metabolic process of different organs. Same results are represented by previous research Bort et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[38\\]</u>.**\n\n【128】**Naturally， our body has a specific antioxidant defense mechanism that includes endogenous enzymatic antioxidants such as CAT， SOD， POD， and glutathione. These enzymes along with exogenous antioxidants protect the organ and body from damage caused by oxidative stress by capturing ROS. Catalase has ability to neutralize hydrogen peroxide H.O， via a catalytic transformation or through**\n\n【129】**peroxidation metabolism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[39\\]</u> while superoxide dismutase is a metallic enzyme that helps in the conversion of superoxide radicals to H，O， and O， by dismutase reaction to reduce the toxicity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[40\\]</u>. Glutathione peroxidase causes the neutralization of peroxides and thus providing protection against toxicity of ROS. Abnormal necrosis in liver is stimulated by decreased levels of GSH 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[41\\]</u>. All these antioxidant enzymes and GSH level in cells were reduced markedly in ACF treated group， which have caused injury in liver cells through deposition of ROS. Administration of TCM along with ACF has significantly restored antioxidant enzyme concentration near to normal range. TCM contains many bioactive components which are efficient in balancing the levels of antioxidants as well as in combating different infectious diseases. Increasedlipid peroxidation is associated with higher levels of TBARS that result in tissue destruction and failure of antioxidant defense mechanisms \\[5，35\\]. ACF-intoxicated rats treated with TCM (300 mg/kg) reduced the lipid peroxide levels compared with rats treated with ACF only.**\n\n【130】**An extreme notch of disruptions in hepatic cells consisting of cellular hypertrophy， intrusion of inflammatory cells， intrusion of the central lobule，and sinusoidal obstruction was observed in rats treated with ACF dose through histological examination of tissues.Low/high doses of TCM with ACF dose reduced these losses in the bodytissues. No morphological changes were observed in the liver anatomy of groups treated with TCM doses alone. Similar results have been declared by Gupta and Pandey， who claimed that Terminalia bellirica fruit extract has a protective aptitude against Aceclofenac endured hepatic damage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Many biocomponents and polyphenols are present in TCM extract， which have potential antioxidant properties and thus help the plant to prevent tissue damage by reducing peroxidation of lipids in body organs， including the liver.**\n\n【131】**Conclusion**\n\n【132】**The current study illustrated the potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory propensity of T. cordata extract. The presence of flavonoids and polyphenols are claimed for the possible antioxidant， anti-inflammatory and hepatoprotective mechanism of T. cordata. Our data also revealed protective effect of TCM by regulating the levels of enzymatic markers， anti-inflammatory mediators and serum markers against the intoxicated effects of ACF. Moreover， TCM reduces the injuries of liver architecture， hence restoring the hepatic morphology.**\n\n【133】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【134】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**1\\. Schieber M， Chandel NS.

Innate immune component of both COVID-19 and IRIS centers on aberrant activation and signaling of macrophages and monocytes， by the immunomodulatory effects of cytokines produced， particularly interleukin-18通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.**\n\n【5】**Case Presentation**\n\n【6】**OPEN ACCESS**\n\n【7】**A 1-year 9-month-old boy presented with fever (100-102 F) for 10 days along with neck stiffness and extreme irritability. The caretaker of the child was diagnosed with tuberculosis two months back with sputum beingpositive foracid fastbacilliand GeneXpert detecting thepresenceofMycobacterium tuberculosis sensitive to Rifampicin. Subsequently， the parents had recovered from COVID-19about six weeks back. In view of baby having CNS symptoms along with history of contact with a patient of tuberculosis， the baby was suspected to have TB meningitis and relevant investigations were sent accordingly. Computed Tomography (CT) chest revealed necrotic mediastinal nodes. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) brain showed moderate communicating hydrocephalus with meningeal enhancement. Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) study revealed lymphocytic pleocytosis (Cell count- 640/cmm，lymphocytes 98% and neutrophils 2%) with elevated protein (1463 mg/100 ml) and normal glucose (75 mg/100 ml). CBNAAT from sputum and CSF was negative. In addition， COVID IgG antibody was positive. He was diagnosed as tubercular meningitis and started on 4Anti-Tubercular Drugs (ATD) along with oral prednisolone. Baby was afebrile and playful within a week and repeat MRI brain after one month showed moderate communicating hydrocephalus with mild reduction in the ventricular size and regression ofperiventricular interstitial edema. Clinically the baby remained asymptomatic， ATD were continued， and steroid was gradually tapered off over next 4 weeks.**\n\n【8】**_\\*Correspondence：Mohini Bhelo， Department of Pediatric_ _Medicine， Institute of Child Health，_ _Kolkata， India_ Received Date： 19 Jun 2023 _Accepted Date： 27 Jun 2023Published Date：01Jul 2023_**\n\n【9】**Six weeks after stoppage of prednisolone， the baby developed cough and was found to be COVID RT-PCR positive.

This modelhas recently been used frequently as part of best evidence medical education in framing the question for gathering and using evidence in medical education 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Hart and Harden， based on the best evidence in medical education recommended five steps in gathering and using evidence in medical education including framing the question， developing a search strategy， evaluating the evidence， implementing change and evaluating that change 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. The PICO model used in this article is an innovation of the five steps that incorporate developing a search strategy， evaluating the evidence， implementing change and evaluating that change intothe last two steps of comparison and outcome analysis. The innovative PICO model aims**\n\n【21】**to reflect the change of medical educational approach from opinion-based to evidence-based medical education 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. The aim of this article is to examine the effective use of this model in the senior medical students’ clinical placement learning through reflection of clinical cases on an elective exchange program. The literature on the clinical case will be reviewed to maximize the students learning with the use of innovative PICO model. An atypical case of metastatic malignant melanoma was selected for the PICO model discussion from medical educational perspective for both medical students and medical educators. Australia has the highest incidence (men 12% & women9%) of melanoma in the world with thirty Australians diagnosed with melanoma every day and more than 1，200 death from the disease each year (Understanding Melanoma-Melanoma Institute Australia，2019)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. China has a much lower melanoma incidence rate of 0.17%with approximately eleven Chinese diagnosed with melanoma every day (International Agency for Research on Cancer China Globocan，2018) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. The five equal first authors of this article are interns of the First Affiliated Hospital，Sun Yat-Sen University， Guangzhou， China. They visited Curtin Medical School， associated teaching hospitals in Perth and general practice clinics for four-week' supervised electives as medical observers. Their supervisor was the corresponding author and has identified this atypical case of malignant melanoma in general practice clinic for the learning of holistic and comprehensive care from the medical educational perspective. By reviewing the management course of this atypical case of metastatic amelanotic melanoma to brain， the innovative PICO model was used to review the updated treatment of metastatic melanoma with comparing various treatment modalities and the outcomes of treatment. The academic benefit for the Chinese students'learning is achieved in the management of melanoma， which is a relatively rare skin cancer in China， while management discussion in this case will certainly enrich management options and provide valuable input into future research direction with a relatively common skin cancer in Australia.**\n\n【22】**Case Presentation**\n\n【23】**John， a 39-year-old Caucasian man presented to his general practitioner with 2 years history of depression and treated with sertraline (SSRI) with minimal improvement， he also developed chronic low-grade headache for 4 months. In view of his depression and chronic headache， MRI brain was ordered with surprised finding of multiple ring-enhancing lesions with craniotomy biopsy confirming metastatic melanoma， subsequent skin check found an unpigmented mole 2 cm ×2 cm appearing like seborrheic keratosis to be nodular amelanotic melanoma.MDT discussion after review of the literatures indicated the best plan of treatment includes removal of primary lesion and monoclonal antibody treatment with ipilimumab with good effects initially， metastatic lesions reduction in size in 6months MRI review. The next 3 months’ ongoing treatment did not show any further improvement clinically and radiologically. He simply deteriorated with frequent seizures despite optimal doses of anti-epileptics， and was then referred to palliative care for symptom control and holistic care to ensure good quality of life care. A clinical geneticist was consulted as well for the benefit ofhis sister and brother in terms of melanoma screening and regular skin cancer check.**\n\n【24】**Methods and Results**\n\n【25】**Investigation and methods**\n\n【26】**In this article， we identify this atypical metastatic malignant melanoma for demonstration of the innovative PICO model for**\n\n【27】**the medical educational purpose of the five Chinese exchange senior medical students. The five students were required to use the innovative PICO model to analyze their daily cases load and identify one case for the daily group debrief with their supervisors. The average case load for each student is eight cases per whole day to apply the innovative PICO model for academic learning. The group has chosen the atypical metastatic melanoma case to demonstrate the PICO-style clinical placementlearning.**\n\n【28】**Salient leaning points and results of group feedback regarding the use of the PICO model**\n\n【29】**PICO is a relatively new term in both evidence-based medical research and evidence-based medical education in China. The five students have used the innovative PICO model for their daily case studies in symptom analysis， relevant investigation， diagnosis confirmation and treatment modality decision. The feedback from the PICO model use was that it was an excellent and most valuable tool for the busy schedule of clinical placements in hospital and general practice clinics. It has certainly improved the retention of academic knowledge and helped immensely in attaining the clinical reasoning skills to become a competent intern and clinician in future clinical training and practice.**\n\n【30】**Comparison and outcome with salient points and literature review**\n\n【31】**In this section of the article， we have used the innovative PICO model to demonstrate the learning of holistic and comprehensive care via evidence-based and individualized approaches by reviewing the management course of this atypical case of metastatic amelanotic melanoma to the brain. We use the opportunity to review the updated treatmentof metastatic melanoma with differenttreatment modalities from different perspectives. Through this case and the innovative PICO model， we have maximized the medical educational benefits for both medical students and medical educators about evidence-based and individualized clinical reasoning with personalized management approach. The perceived benefit will help medical students establish a universally holistic approach in their individual specialty career asa holistically competent clinician. The current concept of holistic approach is defined as optimal patient care in a biological-psychological-social-political-economical-spiritual way.**\n\n【32】**In the next few sections， we llbe discussing the differenttreatment modalities and its literature review on this atypical metastatic melanoma.**\n\n【33】**Surgery on the primary site of melanoma**\n\n【34】**Surgical excision with histologically negative margins is the recommended and first-line treatment for primary cutaneous melanoma of any thickness， as well as for melanoma in situ. Surgical margins should be based on tumor thickness 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.**\n\n【35】**However， as for distant metastatic melanoma， surgery is generally not an option for first-line therapy. For one thing， surgery is rarely curative since the majority of patients with distant metastases have widespread micro-metastatic lesions even if clinical and imaging criteria suggest limited spread. For another， the application of some advanced systemic therapies， such as checkpoint inhibitors， has been proved to be highly effective for patients with metastatic melanoma. Therefore， surgery is mainly performed for limited， isolated soft tissue and nodal metastases that can be completely resected or for complications of metastatic disease in need of urgent palliation (e.g bleeding or obstructing gastrointestinal lesions).**\n\n【36】**Surgery is an attractive option for dermal metastases because patients are quickly rendered “disease-free” with relatively limited associated morbidity. In contrast，systemicallyadministered therapies require prolonged treatment courses to achieve relatively inferior local response rates 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Besides， excision of systemic， particularly solitary lung melanoma metastases may also increase patient survival 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Wong et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u> reported a 5-year survival rate of 20%in 144 patients who underwent surgical resection of non-regional melanoma metastases and a phase II trial by the Southwest Oncology Group reported overall 3- year and 4-year survival rates of 36% and31%， respectively， in stage IV melanoma patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.**\n\n【37】**In thecondition ofbrain metastatic melanoma like whatpresented in this article， resection is mainly limited to patients with a solitary or single brain metastasis and is often performed for symptomatic relief. Goldinger et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u> have demonstrated an overall survival benefit in all patients with single brain metastases who undergo resection compared with radiation therapy alone. There may also be a role for resection in oligometastatic disease of dominant， symptomatic lesions. As the field comes closer to achieving integrated histologic and genetic diagnoses for these patients， a secondary benefit of de bulking is the procurement of adequate tumor tissue for molecular characterization. Investigators in one study compared the genomics of matched brain metastases and primary tumors across multiple histologies and demonstrated that >50% of brain metastases harboured genetic alterations that were not detected in the clinically sampled primary tumor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.**\n\n【38】**When surgery is considered， careful patient selection is important and treatment must be individualized. Factors to be considered include the severity of symptoms， pace of disease progression， previous treatment and treatment response， patient age and medical condition， and the desires of the patient. Quality of life should be the principal goal of treatment for many patients.**\n\n【39】**In our case， the brain metastatic lesions are multiple， so resection is not considered as a feasible option. We only performed the removal of the primary lesion with the goal of durable local control as recommended in guidelines 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.**\n\n【40】**Target Therapy**\n\n【41】**Molecular researches on progression of melanoma have led to drugs targeting specific mutated point of tumor cells.**\n\n【42】**The largest genomic subtype of melanoma is BRAF V600 mutant which takes up approximately 50% of all advanced melanoma (Cancer Genome Atlas Network，2015) Vemurafenib and dabrafenib are both potent BRAF inhibitor that significantly improved overall survival for patients with metastatic melanoma harboring BRAF mutant(vemurafenib vs.dacarbazine， OS 13.6 m vs. 9.7 m，P=0.03；dabrafenib vs. dacarbazine， median PFS 5.1 m vs. 2.7 m， P<0.0001)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. MEK also plays an important role in pathogenesis of melanoma with BRAF mutant. Trametinib is a highly specific inhibitor of MEK which is proved to significantly prolong PFS in patients with BRAF-mutation positive metastatic melanoma (Trametinib vs. chemotherapy， 4.8 m vs. 1.5 m，P<0.001). Cobimetinib and Binimetinib are the other two MEK inhibitors approved by the FDA in 2015 and 2018 respectively. Combination of BRAF inhibitor and MEK inhibitor is recommended as first line treatment for metastatic melanoma with BRAF mutation. In 2019， a randomized phase III clinical trial showed that patients receiving dabrafenib plus trametinib achieved PFS rates of 21% at4 years and 19% at 5 years as well as a complete response rate of**\n\n【43】**19% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. It is a dramatically improvement in patients with BRAF-mutation positive metastatic melanoma.**\n\n【44】**The other subtypes of metastatic melanoma include NRAS and KIT mutation. Interestingly， binimetinib has shown clinical activity in patients with metastatic melanoma harboring NRAS， who failed to response to immunotherapy. Imatinib is a non-specific c-kit inhibitor， which has also presented with significant clinical responses in patients with KIT alterations. However， these responses are more likely to be seen in tumors harboring KIT alterations of proven functional relevance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>.**\n\n【45】**Next-generation sequencing has identified our patient as BRAF V600E mutation， which indicates combination treatment of BRAF inhibitor and MEK inhibitor. It is found that B-sitosterol could attenuate melanoma cell growth in vitro and inhibits brain metastasis in vivo， which represented as a promising adjuvant to BRAF inhibitor therapy in patients with， or at risk for， melanoma brain metastasis通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. Combination targeted therapy plus B-sitosterol can be a reasonable choice.**\n\n【46】**Chemotherapy**\n\n【47】**Chemotherapy has become a secondary treatment option due to the advances of immunotherapy and targeted therapy. Systemic chemotherapy is considered an alternative therapy only in patients who are not candidates for immunotherapy or target therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>.**\n\n【48】**Dacarbazine， temozolomide， fotemustine and nab-paclitaxel are common singe-agent chemotherapy for metastatic melanoma. Dacarbazine and temozolomide are most widely used. Dacarbazine is an intravenous cell cycle nonspecific alkylating agent that is generally well tolerated， with most common side effects of nausea and vomiting. Temozolomide is an orally absorbed analog of dacarbazine. A randomized phase III study showed temozolomide demonstrates equal efficacy to dacarbazine in treating metastatic melanoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. Temozolomide can penetrate the blood-brain barrier due to its lipophilic feature， which presents with better efficacy in patients with brain metastasis of melanoma \\[19，20\\]. In 2015，aclinicalphase II study showed patients with BRAF mutation and low MGMT expressions had a better response to temozolomide based chemotherapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>. Fotemustine is a nitrourease agent that is considered as a second line chemotherapy after dacarbazine. Given its high lipophilicity， fotemustine also proved its efficacy in cerebral metastasis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. Nab-paclitaxel is nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel interfering with disassembly of microtubules to suppress tumor cell proliferation. A randomized controlled phase III trial in 2015 showed that nab-paclitaxel significantly improved PFS compared with dacarbazine in chemotherapy-naivepatients with metastatic melanoma(nab-paclitaxel vs. dacarbazine， 4.8 m vs. 2.5 m， P=0.044) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>. Combination regimens including dacarbazine/temozolomide and carboplatin/paclitaxel are second or third line chemotherapy. There is no evidence to confirm superiority of combination regimens to single-agent chemotherapy.**\n\n【49】**Chemotherapy did not play a significant role in initial treatment forour patient who had multiplebrain metastases with only mild extra cranial cutaneous lesion. However， it could be applied after failure of response to immunotherapy or target therapy. In that situation， temozolomide or fotemustine could be an appropriate option.**\n\n【50】**Im munotherapy**\n\n【51】**options in an attempt to improve theprognosis ofadvanced melanoma通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u>， including special subsets like metastatic brain melanoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u>， mucosal melanoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>， recurrent female genital tract melanoma通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u>. It is critical to determine the timing of onset of immunotherapy， combining radiotherapy with immunotherapy or targeted therapy in metastases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[28\\]</u>.**\n\n【52】**Immune checkpoint inhibitors，such asnivolumab(anti-programmed cell death.11，PD-1)，ipilimumab{anti-cytotoxic Tlymphocyte-associatedantigen 4， CTLA-4)， pembrolizumab(anti-PD-1) are monoclonal antibodies approved for treatment of unresectable metastatic melanomaa\\[24.While combining ipilimumab and nivolumab as first-line regimen， treatment-naive patients with unresectable stage IIIC/IV melanoma achieved higher overall objective response rate than those with failure prior BRAF/MEK targeted therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[29\\]</u>. Furthermore， retreatment by nivolumab in challenging subgroups with progressed advanced melanoma on or after ipilimumab displayed safety and effective outcome in phase II clinical trials 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[30\\]</u>.**\n\n【53】**Despite of widely used， variant anatomical metastases illustrated different responsepatter ns as well as pseudo-progression and acquired resistance on ipilimumab and nivolumab therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[31\\]</u>. Subsequently， a new strategyto realize personalized evaluation of individual patient before initiating anti-PD-1 antibodies is demanding 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[32\\]</u>. An updated algorithm， that analyses clinical parameters of tumor linked with the activation rate of CD8+ T cells as well as the net tumor growth rate， is potentially applicable for predicting the progressive time and making better clinical decisions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[33\\]</u>.**\n\n【54】**If received nivolumab-plus-ipilimumab therapy， the patient with brain metastatic melanoma in this case were likely to achieved the progression-free survival of more than 60.0 months. As recently reported， significant immune-related adverse events of immunotherapyinclude cutaneous and neurocutaneous autoimmune or autoinflammatory diseases， e.g.scleroderma， psoriasis and dermatomyositis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[34\\]</u>. Besides， symptomatic neurologic oedema for brain metastases is a remarkable complication which is a way to focus on in the future 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u>.**\n\n【55】**Additional immune-based drugs (cytokine) for metastatic or surgically resected ‘high-risk melanoma， composes of aldesleukin， interferon-a2b， PEGylated interferon-a2b 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u>. As another evolving immunotherapy， an oncolytic virus therapy with intra-tumorally administrated Talimogene laherparepvec (T-VEC) also shows a benefit in survival of metastatic melanoma， whose mono therapy has been approved in the current National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines and combination therapy are undergoing clinical trials 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[35\\]</u>.**\n\n【56】**Interestingly， in combination with immune checkpoint therapy， PD-L1 antagonist， Dendritic Cell (DC)-targeted nano-vaccine is promising to boost anti-tumor effects against melanoma in future perspective 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[36\\]</u>.**\n\n【57】**Radiotherapy**\n\n【58】**Melanoma is a tumor relatively resistant to radiation， so it serves mainly as a palliative treatment to the symptomatic metastases to the organs like brain， bone， spinal cord， soft tissues and so on in cases with advanced melanoma as an adjuvant to systemic treatment， as chemotherapy plays a limited role in CNS due to inadequate penetration through the blood-brain barrier.**\n\n【59】**Brain metastases are common in cases with advanced melanoma and are an important cause of death. Surgical removal of masses is effective in symptom control，but there will be a high rate of recurrence通用删除6(英):<u>\\[37\\]</u>. So， for patients with brain metastases， they were treated with surgery followed by whole-brain radiotherapy traditionally to reduce or delay the occurrence of further brain macroscopic diseases. Although advances in radiotherapy techniques like Stereotactic Radio Surgery (SRS) has made great progress in the control of brain metastases adjuvant to systemic treatment， whole-brain radiotherapy is controversial now. As there are new drugs like ipilimumab effective in the brain metastases that cross the blood-brain barrier， and the advent of widespread MRI and screening MRI help discover brain metastases when asymptomatic and small， there's a greatly reduced need of whole-brain radiotherapy， which has late neurocognitive toxicity， in this radiation-resistant tumor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[38\\]</u>. However， there are also many reports stating that combination of radiotherapy and immunotherapy will lead to a significant improvement in the clinical outcomes， as BRAF inhibitors have radio sensitization effect in melanoma cells 39，40.**\n\n【60】**Visceral metastases present a better radio sensitivity than brain metastases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[41\\]</u>. However， radiotherapy is not applicable in the intestinal metastases because the intestines move in an irregular way. So the beam could be off-target， making radiotherapy ineffective. In contrast， metastases to the mobile organs like liver and lung can be treated with new techniques like Cyber knife. Besides， fixed foci are amenable to radiotherapy， like the duodenum， para-aortic lymph nodes and adrenal glands 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[42\\]</u>.**\n\n【61】**Bone metastases-Radiotherapy is very effective in the symptom control of bone metastases， with a documented rate of up to 96percent in the long-term pain improvement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[43\\]</u>. For patients with symptomatic bone metastases， Stereotactic Body Radio Therapy(SBRT) may be preferred over External Beam Radio Therapy (EBRT).**\n\n【62】**Lymph nodes and skin metastases are also common in patients with advanced melanoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[44\\]</u>. Surgery is the first choice for the cases without extensive distant metastases. But radiotherapy is alternatives if surgery is not feasible. They provide symptomatic control including pain，bleeding and compression of surrounding structures.**\n\n【63】**As for the choice of total dose and fractions for each patient， there are many documented recommendations for different kind of situations， but each case must be individualized.**\n\n【64】**Palliative Care Management and Genetic Counseling**\n\n【65】**Palliative care is an interdisciplinary medical specialty， focusing on symptom management and involving psychosocial， spiritual， ethical， legal support both to patients and their family caregivers. We will focus on symptom management in this article. For advanced melanoma， palliative radiation therapy is an effective method of pain relief except pain-killers for skeletal metastases， cutaneous and lymph node metastases， cerebral melanoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[45\\]</u>. Besides pain control， treatments of brain oedema and seizure are also important for improving patients life quality. Systemic loading-dose glucocorticoids are initially for decreasing brain oedema surrounding metastases and relieving neurologic defects. And then minimum effective dose of steroids for long-term reduces steroid sequelae 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[46\\]</u>. If the patient has a seizure， antiepileptic medications are needed. But potential interactions with other anticancer agents should raise doctor's attention 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[47\\]</u>.**\n\n【66】**The etiology of all cancers involves the combined actions between environmental and genetic factor. Ultraviolet exposure is the most significant environmental risk factors for melanoma. Genetic factors， the most common of which are mutations of CDKN2A tumor suppressor gene in familial form of melanoma， also greatly modify the incidence of melanoma. So genetic testing may be indicated for the patients who have individually multiple primary melanomas， or multiple family members with melanoma， coexist with other primary tumors especially pancreatic cancer.However，even in the presence of these criteria， germline mutations in CDKN2A are uncommon， with the prevalence of 1% to 2%通用删除6(英):<u>\\[48\\]</u>.**\n\n【67】**Conclusion and Future Perspectives：Outcome and Outlook**\n\n【68】**Throughthis case duringthe students’four weeks electives， wehave demonstrated our innovative PICO model learning for all the cases. The treatment modality review on metastatic malignant melanoma provides us both a new insight and a deeper understanding into melanoma treatment in future. The perceived benefit will certainly see our medical students adopting a universally holistic approach in their individual specialty career as a competent clinician. The current concept of holistic approach is defined as optimal patient care in a biological-psychological-social-political-economical-spiritual way.**\n\n【69】**Final Discussion**\n\n【70】**The PICO model used by the students in this article is innovative and consolidates the students'learning and increase the retention of academic knowledge and clinical skills， especially in clinical placement setting. It is highly recommended by the authors of this article to introduce this innovative PICO model into the routine undergraduate clinical placement curriculum at both hospital and general practice teaching.**\n\n【71】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【72】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**l.

Tramadol undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism by a number of pathways including CYP2D6， CYP3A4 and by conjugation with subsequent renal excretion. The maximum recommended dose is 400 mg/day. One of the most important adverse effect of tramadol is seizure which usually occurs at high dose and often generalized tonic-clonic type and， self-limiting. Here we present a case of patient with inflammatory low backache who developed seizures while on low-dose oral tramadol. After one hour of taking first tablet Tramadol， he developed morbilliform rashes all over the body. One day later he developed generalized tonic clonic seizure followed by loss of consciousness for 5 min. Patient was admitted in the hospital and managed conservatively with Injection lorazepam and Tramadol was stopped. In general if applied in overdose， tramadol can only incite seizures in patients already suffering from some sort of disorder related to seizure or if it is administered along with antidepressants， alcohol etc. But here， only with the use of 37.5 mg oral application， the incidence of seizure happened.**\n\n【14】**Keywords： Tramadol； Seizure； Low dose； Rash**\n\n【15】**Introduction**\n\n【16】**Tramadol is a weak mu (p) opioid receptor agonist that acts by inhibition of serotonin and nor epinephrine reuptake 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Tramadol undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism by a number of pathways including CYP2D6， CYP3A4 and by conjugation with subsequent renal excretion. Tramadol is composed of 1：1 racemic mixture of± enantiomers and± enantiomers.**\n\n【17】**±Tramadol inhibits serotonin reuptake and 通用删除7(英):<u>(-)</u>-Tramadol inhibits Norepinephrine reuptake. The major metabolite of ± Tramadol activates mu (p) receptor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. The range of blood levels in adults is approximately 100 ng/ml to 300 ng/ml (0.1 ug/ml to 0.2 ug/ml). The recommended dose of400 mg/day is considered as maximum approved dose 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Tramadol hydrochloride is a lipophilic substance that completely penetrates the barrier between blood and brain. The level of plasma besieges peak around 1.5 h after taking and 5 h to 6 h is the half life of plasma exclusion. One of the complications of the tramadol use is the seizure which is most often generalized tonic-clonic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Here we are presenting a case report of a 29-year-old male patient， who had an episode of seizure， following single oral dose of Tramadol.**\n\n【18】**Case Presentation**\n\n【19】**A 29 year old male patient came to the orthopedic OPD， with history of low back pain following fall from height. He was prescribed oral tablet tramadol hydrochloride 37.5 mg twice daily for five days. After one hour oftaking first dose oftablet tramadol， he developed morbilliform rashes all over the body. One day later he developed generalized tonic clonic seizure followed by loss of consciousness for 5 min. The patient was rushed to emergency department and managed conservatively with injection lorazepam and tramadol was stopped. He had no history of similar episode in the past. On examination the patient was conscious， oriented to time， place and person. The temperature was 39°C， the heart rate 136 beats per min， the blood pressure 130/80 mmHg， and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. On neurological examination， the patient's mental status was normal. There was no involvement of cranial nerve. Motor testing revealed full symmetric strength in the arms and legs. Deep-tendon reflexes were2+ and symmetric. Other systematic examinations were also normal. Blood levels of electrolytes， glucose， vitamin B12 (cobalamin) were normal， as were results of tests of kidney， liver， and thyroid function. The complete blood count， erythrocyte sedimentation rate， and creatine kinase level were normal. His Electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed atrial fibrillation with controlled ventricular rate(Figure1). Computed Tomography(CT) of the head，performed after theintravenous administration of contrast material， was normal. An Electroencephalogram (EEG) was done after neurology**\n\n【20】Figure 1： Electracardiagram (ECG) revealed atrial fibrillation with cantrolled ventricular rate.\n\n【21】**Figure 2： Repeat ECG was done on day 2 of admission and showed normal sinus rhythm.**\n\n【22】**consultation and revealed normal study. Cardiology consultation was taken for atrial fibrillation and was advised for transthoracic echocardiography which revealed normal study. The repeat ECG was done on day 2 of admission and showed normal sinus rhythm (Figure2). Patient improved with the conservative management and was discharged uneventfully and was found to be doing well at regular follow-ups.**\n\n【23】**Discussion**\n\n【24】**Tramadol is a“bimodal agent that possesses activity at opioid and monoaminergic (serotonergic and non-adrenergic) pathways in the CNS. Tramadol is commonly used in place of other potent opioid analgesics for treatment of moderate to moderately severe pain associated with osteoarthritis， rheumatoid arthritis， and low back pain and neuropathic conditions \\[4，5\\]. There are controversies about the seizure inducing effect oftramadol. Some earlier studies suggested that Tramadol when given in overdose in patients with extant disorder of seizure or when used along with antidepressants， alcohol etc. instigates seizure \\[6，7\\]. It was also disclosed from other studies that Tramadol also instigates seizure when used as monotherapy in approved dose. It has also been found that appearance of seizure following tramadol use is not dose dependant 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. However， in our patient the seizure occurred at a dose of 37.5 mg oral tramadol hydrochloride. Tramadol-induced seizures have been reported to be generalized tonic-clonic in nature， without aura and focal deficit， as seen in our patient. Tramadol has very less abuse potential when compared to other opioids. So， it is prescribed very commonly in clinical practice. A recent cross-sectional study conducted by Labate et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u> in 2005 examined 106 patients with tramadol induced seizure found the entire patient had tonic clonic seizure within 12 h of oral intake of tramadol in supratherapeutic and recommended doses. Among those， 13% had history of epilepsy which was well controlled and didn’t recur before one year of their evaluation. Tramadol induced seizure may be associated with agitation， tachycardia， confusion and hypertension， leading to serotonin syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. In the present case， the continuing tachycardia ranging from 120 bpm to140 bpm was found to be the only salient observation that could be accountable to low serotonergic action.**\n\n【25】**Conclusion**\n\n【26】**Tramadol has been otherwise a safe drug over many years； however with evidence of serious reaction like seizure even at low doses， the scientific community should consider ensuring strict pharmacovigilance with respect to its use especially in the developing countries where such monitoring systems are inadequate.**\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**1\\.

Our patient had multiple vascular variants including azygos anterior cerebral artery， hypoplasia of the left A1 segment and， anterior communicating artery， aortic origin and， hypoplasia of the left vertebral artery with left main terminal branch Posterior Inferior Cerebellar Artery (PICA)， old occlusion of the amputated basilar artery at the top with collateral circulation by bilateral Anterior Inferior Cerebellar Artery (AICA) arteries and， via PICAS.**\n\n【15】**Discussion： The set of brain anatomical variants found in the anterior and posterior circulation and post-infarction changes via bilateral AICA and right PICA is rare in the literature， especially about the clinical presentation of the patient. Following the above， it is important to report this case due to the low prevalence of the set of anatomical variants described and the absence of similar cases described in the literature.**\n\n【16】**Keywords： Brain anatomical variants； Acigos artery； Brain infarction posterior circulation； Infarction basilar artery**\n\n【17】**Introduction**\n\n【18】**Anatomical variants in the central nervous system are frequent， especially in the Willis Polygon， which has a classic structure only in 20% to 25% of people \\[1，2\\]. The variants can be classified as fenestrations， duplications， hypoplasia’s， agenesis， infundibular origins and， persistent communicating anomalous anastomosis \\[2，3\\].**\n\n【19】**These variants are mainly found incidentally but sometimes are associated with ischemic events that tend to differ from the classically described vascular territories， the most clinically relevant variants are： 1) Bilateral infarcts by anterior Azygos and， Percheron artery 2) Infarcts of Choroidal or Heubner's arteries and，3) Stem syndromes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.**\n\n【20】**The objective of this article is to present multiple vascular anatomical variants documented in a patient who was admitted to our hospital with a right posterior cerebral artery infarction.**\n\n【21】**Case Presentation**\n\n【22】**A 56-year-old man with a history of migraine， without cardiovascular risk factors， presented with intense holocranial headache， stabbing type， sudden loss of left peripheral vision and， left upper limb paresthesia， subsequently decreased alertness with retrograde amnesia of the event. Neurological examination showed lower left quadrantanopsy and， hypoesthesia of the left upper limb，the initial head Computed Tomography (CT) was normal .**\n\n【23】**Figure 1： Simple computed tomography， axial brain slices， at the level of the thalamus and occipital lobes， without observing alterations.**\n\n【24】**Later he presented an increase of the support polygon and， lateralization in gait to the left， the Contrast-enhanced Magnetic Resonance Image (C-MRI) revealed areas of restricted diffusion in the right thalamus， posterior horns of the lateral ventricle and， right occipital lobe， compatible with acute multiple brain infarction in the right Posterior Cerebral Artery (PCA) territory . Angiotomography was performed revealing a filling defect of the Basilar Artery (AB)， absence offlow within the PCA，hypoplasia of the pre-communicating portion (A1) of the left Anterior Cerebral Artery(ACA) and， in the intracranial portion (V4) of the left Vertebral Artery (VA).**\n\n【25】**Additionally， a subsequent pan-angiography confirmed the occlusion at the top of the basilar artery， absence of the Posterior Communicating Arteries (PCoA) without direct cortical irrigation， since this irrigation was given by an extensive network of vascular collateralization to the ischemic territory from the Anteroinferior Cerebellar Arteries (AICAs) and， the right Posterior inferior Cerebellar Artery (PICA). It also noted a hypoplastic left vertebral artery with its origin at the aortic arch， hypoplasia of the left A1**\n\n【26】**segment and， absence of anterior communicating artery， with azygos system from A2 but dependent on the right ACA (Figures3-5). Capillary and venous phases with normal characteristics， dural sinuses with flow pattern and normal appearance. Malformations of the brain parenchyma were not observed.**\n\n【27】**In the controls by clinical neurology at 3， 10， 13 months post-infarction， he did not present subsequent neurological deficit， his return to work (mechanical technician of industrial machinery) and social was without difficulties. The control paraclinical tests at11 months were positive antinuclear antibodies 1：320 fine granular pattern， positive antinuclear antibodies 1：320 centrosome pattern. Control images (pan-angiography， Doppler of renal arteries) and rheumatology evaluation were requested； however， as of the date of this case report， the patient has not had them performed.**\n\n【28】**In resume， the most relevant findings were right azygos ACA， absence of left A1 and， A2 segments， hypoplastic left VA with an aortic origin， absent ACoPs and， finally AB with distal flow occlusion and， extensive collateralization by AICAs and， PICAs allowing the necessary irrigation to the posterior cerebral circulation. The combination of these anatomical variants is infrequent and， even more so with the clinical findings of the patient， we started dual antiplatelet therapy with a diagnosis of minor cerebrovascular attack. Post-discharge follow-up was performed， without neurological deterioration，left lower quadrantanopsia persisted. Other studies are summarized in Table 1.**\n\n【29】**Discussion**\n\n【30】**It is important to know the cerebral vascular anatomical variants； the presences of associated cerebral vascular anatomical infarcts or arterial variants do not usually follow the classically predetermined vascular territories 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.

However， despite a high percentage of graft success 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>， the development of Graft Versus Host Disease (GVHD) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u> and the appearance of serious infections secondary to delayed immune reconstitution continue to be the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in this type of therapeutic procedure \\[4，5\\].**\n\n【17】**The development of graft manipulation techniques， such as T-cell depletion， has significantly reduced the risk of acute and chronic GVHD in the absence of prophylactic post-transplant immunosuppression 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6-10\\]</u>.

Although HHV-6 infection can be life-threatening， there is a lack of strategy in prophylaxis， early detection， and monitoring ofthe virus. Moreover， there is no established treatment for HHV-6 infection， although foscarnet or ganciclovir have been recommended for the treatment of encephalitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.**\n\n【19】**A case of acute HHV-6 infection following a fully matched unrelated donor myeloablative HSCT with a CD45RA T cell-depletion graft is presented. Despite close monitoring by PCR and early treatment with combined foscarnet and ganciclovir， a rapid and fatal evolution was observed.**\n\n【20】**Case Presentation**\n\n【21】**A 42-year-old Caucasian male with no relevant personal medical history was diagnosed with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia with t(9；22) (q34.1；q11.2) in June 2022. He received intensive induction chemotherapy with vincristine， daunorubicin， prednisone plus imatinib (600 mg daily) and standard intrathecal chemotherapy， achieving morphologic complete remission. Afterwards，consolidation chemotherapy was given according to the PET THH1EMA LAL Ph+ 2008 protocol for patients under 55 years ofage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. Complete remission was maintained but minimal residual disease(0.04% BCR-ABL/ABL) was detected. Due to the high risk of disease progression an HSCT was indicated，andan unrelated searchinitiated，asthepatient did nothavean HLA matched family donor.**\n\n【22】**A fully matched unrelated donor peripheral blood HSCT conditioned with total body irradiation (12Gy) and cyclophosphamide (60 mg/Kg for two consecutive days) was performed. For GVHD prophylaxis， a CD34-positive selection followed by a CD45RA naive T cell-depletion was planned. Therefore， 8.71×10\\* CD34+ cells/kg were infused followed by an infusion of1×10\\* /kg CD45+ depleted CD3+cells. The total number of residual CD3+CD45RA+ cells infused was5.4 ×10/kg. The patient also received prophylactic antimicrobial treatment with rifaximin，trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole， acyclovir， letermovir， and fluconazole.**\n\n【23】**Early post-transplant complications were grade 4 mucositis requiring intravenous morphine and total parenteral nutrition and radiodermatitis on face， neck， armpits， and groin， successfully treated with topical silver sulfadiazine. On day +3 post-transplant neutropenic fever of unknown origin appeared and empirical progressive antibiotic treatment with meropenem was started. Fever without microbiological documentation persisted and amikacin， vancomycin and posaconazole were added to the empirical antibiotic treatment. On day +12 post-transplant， an erythematous， non-pruritic skin rash appeared on the arms， legs， and neckline. A skin biopsy was negative for GVHD， implant syndrome or infection. However， all the symptoms subsided with prednisone 1 mg/kg/bid. Granulocyte engraftment (>0.5×10/L， absolute neutrophil count) was achieved at day +11 and platelet engraftment (>20×10/L， without transfusions) by day +8. An early complete donor chimerism was observed on day +15.**\n\n【24】**On day +13 post-transplant a new onset of persistent fever was detected in parallel with elevated acute phase reactants and progressive cytopenia’s. Extensive and repeated blood， urine and fecal microbiological tests and imaging studies were performed but they were all negative ((bacterial and fungal cultures， multiviral PCR testing including HHV-6 and high-resolution turaco-abdominal scans). However， only three days later， a new PCR for HHV-6 was positive with 164，872 copies/mL. On day +19 post-transplant a bone marrow study detected hemophagocytosis and ruled out leukemic recurrence. Due to the concomitant presence of hypertriglyceridemia(1，241 mg/dl)， increased LDH (14，847IU/L)，elevated ferritin (356，000mg/dl)， thrombocytopenia (36×10/L) and monocytosis (11.3x10/L)， a diagnosis of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis secondary to acute infection by HHV-6 was made. Treatment with intravenous immunoglobulins (30 g/d， two days)， foscarnet (90 mg/Kg/bid， ganciclovir (5 mg/kg/d)， etoposide (100 mg) and anakinra (200 mg/day) was started. Dexamethasone was not included due to the viral infection. After administration ofetoposide， the patient developed an acute renal failure showing creatinine 4.5 mg/dl， hyperuricemia (12.7mg/dl)， hyperphosphatemia (7.3 mg/dl)， hyperkalemia (5.4 mmol/L) and hypocalcemia (5.7 mg/dl) and requiring rasburicase and intensive fluid therapy with electrolytes balance. Despite treatment， the HHV-6 infection reached 5，811，644 copies/ml and the patient worsened clinicaly and analytically， developing SIADH with hyponatremia(119 mmol/L)， Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC)(fibrinogen of 73 mg/dl) and a generalized hemorrhagic rash. Two days later， the HHV-6 levels subsided (1，858，396 copies/ml)， but the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit due to multi-organ failure (renal， hepatic， pulmonary， neurologic， DIC) and died on day +25 post-transplant with a concomitant septic shock from _Enterococcus faecium._**\n\n【25】**Discussion**\n\n【26】**Transplant related mortality following allogeneic HSCT has been significantly reduced due to better donor selection and improvement in transplant techniques 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. To prevent the onset of GVHD and the need for long immunosuppressive treatments， new graft manipulation techniques， such as CD45RA or CD3aB/CD19 depletion of lymphocytes， have been developed \\[6，7\\]. These techniques have successfully controlled GVHD， but they induce a delaved immune reconstitution that may increase life-threatening fungal or viral infections. Among these are HHV-6 infections， that can cause exanthema， kidney and liver failure， encephalitis， graft failure， or even the development of GVHD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12-15\\]</u>. Therefore， it is important to recognize the variety of initial clinical manifestations that HHV-6 infection may produce， including fever， cutaneous rash， or mild neurological signs and start a diagnostic procedure immediately. Our case illustrates a highly aggressive HHV-6 infection that progressed to multi-organ failure and death after a fully matched unrelated donor myeloablative HSCT whose graft was manipulated with a CD34-positive selection followed by a CD45RA naive T cell-depletion. This is consistent with a recently reported increased incidence of HHV-6 infections and the use of naive T cell-depleted grafts of haploidentical stem cell transplantation in pediatric patients， although， in contrast with our case， the clinical evolution of these patients was not fatal \\[18，19\\]. Moreover， we describe an HHV-6infection in an adult patient and after a different type of transplant， a matched unrelated donor HSCT.**\n\n【27】**Although there are some preliminary initiatives with the infusion of NK cells immediately posttransplant as a prophylaxis of viral infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>， there is no generally accepted strategy in terms of detection， early monitoring， or prophylactic treatment for HHV-6 in patients undergoing allogeneic HSCT with or without manipulated grafts. However， pre-transplant and post-transplant serial PCR determinations could help to make an accurate diagnosis and， consequently， establish early treatment with ganciclovir or foscarnet. A previous negative HHV-6 PCR does not exclude the need for further PCR tests， especially when symptoms or signs consistent with HHV-6 reactivation appear. Due to the high number of viral copies detected and rapid clinical deterioration， ganciclovir and foscarnet were introduced simultaneously in this case. Despite an initial drop in viral copies， the patient developed a multi-organ failure and died of septic shock from Enterococcus faecium.**\n\n【28】**It is important to consider that HHV-6 can be integrated in germline， being these subjects strongly positive in PCR 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u> and making diagnosis difficult. A previous negative HHV-6 PCR excluded this possibility in our patient. Another relevant aspect is the rarely described relationship between HHV-6 and the development of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis， mainly in pediatric patients\\[22，23\\]. This HHV-6 related hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis may be a serious and potentially life-threatening complication 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u>.**\n\n【29】**This very severe case reflects that HHV-6 infection must be highly suspected not only in haploidentical HSCT but also in fully matched unrelated donor HSCT， especially when CD45RA T cell-depleted grafts are infused. The clinical evolution may be rapidly fatal even when combined treatment with ganciclovir and foscarnet is used. Therefore， it is important to make the diagnosis and start antiviral treatment as soon as possible， for which serial PCR determination is highly suggested whenever a clinical suspicion of HHV-6 infection appears.**\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>1\\.

These lesions can present with a variety of clinical symptoms and some of them have the potential to cause serious morbidity ifleft untreated. We presenta case ofa 51-year-old patient with a giant right arteriovenous malformation. Excellent outcomes and the preservation of renal function were obtained through an arteriographic study of the right renal vessel combined with coil embolization of the tributary artery branch.

The management oflarge lesions can be challenging. We present a case of a giant arteriovenous malformation that was successfully and minimally invasively treated by embolization， allowing preservation of the renal uinit.**\n\n【17】**Introduction and Background**\n\n【18】**Renal vascular malformations are conditions that involve renal veins and arteries and include Arteriovenous Malformations (AVM) and Arteriovenous Fistulas (AVF). They may be acquired， congenital， or idiopathic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.**\n\n【19】**Congenital arteriovenous malformations are characterized by abnormal communication between the renal arterial and venous systems， and they are typically diagnosed in the third or fourth decade oflife 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. They are thought to represent focal spontaneous failures of vascular development occurring during the first trimester of pregnancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2-4\\]</u>. The right kidney is affected more frequently than the left one， and women are three times more likely to be diagnosed with a renal AVM than men 5.**\n\n【20】**Three types of congenital renal AVM can be distinguished based on the vessel architecture： The angiomatous type， which is characterized by a single large artery feeding multiple interconnecting distal branches； the cirsoid type， the most common， with multiple arteriovenous interconnecting varix-like vascular communications； and the aneurysmal or cavernosaltype， which is more common in elderly patients， occurring typically from a pre-existing arterial aneurysm which has eroded into an adjacent vein 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.**\n\n【21】**Acquired arteriovenous fistulae resulting from instrumentation or kidney surgery are the most prevalent kind of renal vascular abnormalities. Additionally， they could be caused by pyelonephritis， renal-cell carcinoma， or blunt or penetrating trauma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.**\n\n【22】**Clinical manifestations of kidney vascular lesions are varied， and they range from asymptomatic presentation， flank or back pain 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>， hematuria， which is the most common presentation \\[6，8，9\\]， abdominal mass \\[10，11\\]， hypertension 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>， and high output heart failure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12-14\\]</u>. Ifleft undiagnosed and untreated， these lesions may result in considerable morbidity and mortality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.**\n\n【23】**The ideal course oftreatment can be chosen after extensive clinical evaluation and non-invasive imaging and angiographic studies. The preferred initial diagnostic technique for assessing the kidneys is ultrasonography. On Computed Tomography (CT) imaging， AVM appear as masses of vascular density with dilated draining renal veins通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. The best method for displaying the precise vascular anatomy of a renal vascular abnormality is still angiography， which can define the main arterial supply， the presence of a nidus， the size of the arteriovenous shunt and venous drainage \\[4，9\\].**\n\n【24】**Surgical treatment of these anomalies has been replaced by endovascular embolization， which is considered the procedure of choice， because it allows occlusion of the vascular lesion with preservation of the unaffected renal parenchyma\\[5，10，14，15\\].**\n\n【25】**We present a clinical case， imaging studies and management related to a patient with a giant congenital right renal AVM that was treated with endovascular embolization.**\n\n【26】**Case Presentation**\n\n【27】**The case of a 51-year-old woman with no significant medical history other than recurrent Urinary Tract Infection (UTI) is presented.**\n\n【28】**An ultrasound was requested during follow-up of her urological pathology， and it revealed a mass in the lower pole of the right kidney with a longitudinal axis of approximately 4 cm. It had an irregular morphology and a partially calcified， echogenic wall. Doppler study revealed that it was a vascular structure. The rest of the examination and blood and urine tests were normal. The patient did not report back pain， hematuria or other symptoms derived from the lesion described.**\n\n【29】**arteriovenous malformation was evident occupying the entire lower third of the kidnev. The malformation measured 42 mm x22 mmx26 mm and was dependent on an inferior polar artery of hilar origin.**\n\n【30】**After careful discussion of the case with the local staffand with the patient， the decision was to perform angiography and embolization of the lesion under local anesthesia by interventional radiologists.**\n\n【31】**Catheterization of the right femoral artery and a selective arteriography of the right kidney were performed with a 7F curved guide catheter， revealing that the inferior polar artery was feeding the aneurysmal sac.**\n\n【32】**Endovascular treatment was successfullyperformed by deposition of small caliber fibrous micro-coils until complete occlusion of the aneurysmal sac and nutritional artery .**\n\n【33】**The patient remained in the hospital ward for 24 h and was discharged with no immediate complications and with stable renal function.**\n\n【34】**An abdominal CT scan performed 1 month after the procedure showed the embolization material correctly positioned， with no recanalization of the vascular malformation and good perfusion of the remaining renal parenchyma . Serum creatinine was normal (0.9 mg/dL). The CT scans at 3- and 6-months follow-up show no changes.**\n\n【35】**Discussion**\n\n【36】**Renal arteriovenous malformations are rare vascular anomalies with.heterogeneousmanifestations.Thieepatient may remain asymptomatic， and AVM are frequently diagnosed incidentally on imaging studies performed for a different reason \\[6，16\\].

Multiple materials have been used with excellent results reported \\[5，14\\]. Surgery is occasionally necessary for very large anomalies or unstable patients.**\n\n【44】**Follow-up after endovascular treatment for renal AVM is not well defined. The main endpoint is symptom resolution， if previously present. Furthermore， control of renal function should be performed within the first 48 h after the procedure. Initial worsening with progressive improvement is common. Blood pressure should also be monitored通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.**\n\n【45】**The imaging test of choice during follow-up is contrast-enhanced CT， which allows to assess the success of the procedure， to determine the existence of a parenchymal infarction and to evaluate the hypothetical coil migration and its consequences 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. There is some experience with the use of angiography during follow-up to assess parenchymal perfusion， although coils may limit image quality. Imaging tests should be performed prior to discharge and during follow-up within the first 12 months， unless new symptoms occur making earlier testing necessary 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.**\n\n【46】**Conclusion**\n\n【47】**Congenital renal AVM are uncommon disorders with a wide range of clinical manifestations. The treatment of large lesions can be challenging. Minimally invasive management by embolization allows treatment ofeven large lesions while preserving the renal unit.**\n\n【48】**Acknowledgement**\n\n【49】**We would like to express our gratitude to the Radiology Department staff members who support us in providing correct diagnoses and treatments.**\n\n【50】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【51】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**1\\.

Although SARS-CoV-2 is known to be responsible for primary pulmonary disease， including pneumonia and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome(ARDS)， many extrapulmonary manifestations of COVID-19 have been detected by clinicians 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. We report a metabolic acidosis due to ketoacidosis in an eglycemic diabetic patient with COVID-19pneumonia.**\n\n【20】**Case Presentation**\n\n【21】**A 55-year-old woman applied to emergency unit with fever and cough. She had a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus， obesity and hypertension. Her blood glucose was regulated with oral anti-diabetic drugs at home. At the time of hospital admission her blood glucose was： 248 mg/dL， creatinine： 0.62 mg/dL， CRP： 127.62 mg/L，leukocyte： 4630 (lymphocyte： 730). Her D-dimer：and procalcitonin results were detected 305 ng/mL and 0.14 respectively. Her infection was due to coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV-2) infection that confirmed by computed tomography of chest (Figure1，2) in connection with a positive Reverse-Transcriptase-Polymerase-Chain-Reaction in line with(RT-PCR) assay. In the absence of another etiology， we concluded she had pneumonia possibly associated with COVID-19 infection， and started on Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) 400 mg per day and ceftriaxon 1 gr twice daily. Due to higher D-Dimer levels， low molecular weight heparin4000 unit per day subcutaneously was also added to her treatment regimen. On the sixth day of admission her dyspnea， shortness of breath， repetitive cough with fever were worsened and she was transferred to intensive care unit. Treatment was continued with favipiravir， piperacillin-tazobactam and low molecular weight heparin. On the seventh day her venous blood gas analysis as follows； pCO2 was 20.2 mmHg； pH was 7.28； HCO3 was 10.5 mmol/L.， serum lactate was 1.9； glucose was 151 mg/dL， creatinine： 0.53 mg/dL， sodium： 135； color： 104 mEq/L and anion gap： 20.5. Her blood glucose monitoring was done and glucose levels were between 150 mg/dL to 200 mg/dL； glucose was negative and ketone was +3 in her urine test. On the ninth day of hospitalization her dyspnea progressed and she had hypoxemia consistent with respiratory failure. Thus， she was intubated her arterial blood gas analysis as follows； pO2 was 54.3 mmHg， pCO2 was 48.1 mmHg； pH was 7.22 HCO3 was 19.4 mmol/L， serum lactat was 1.53； procalcitonin： 2.67. Kidney and liver functions were normal. Immune plasma treatment was also given to the patient. Her respiratory failure was improved during ICU follow up and then she was extubated. The patient was transferred to the service after 25 days hospitalization in ICU. Total 37 days of hospitalization she recovered and discharged from hospital.**\n\n【22】**Diabetes is the one of the most frequently detected comorbidities in patients infected with COVID-19. When current data are examined， increased risk of COVID-19has not been detected in diabetic patients compared to the general population. Nevertheless， diabetes mellitus can increase the risk of severe and critical forms of COVID-19， as a result of this the need for an intensive care unit and/or use ofinvasive mechanical ventilation might increase， with high mortality rates 31.**\n\n【23】**The clinical symptoms of COVID-19 infection vary but mainly cause fever and cough. Although mild upper respiratory disease and gastrointestinal disease are mostly observed in COVID-19 infection， severe viral pneumonia with systemic organ failure， or even death might be seen.**\n\n【24】**Recently some studies have reported that older age or medical comorbidities， such as cardiovascular disease， diabetes mellitus， hypertension， and obesity are risk factors for severe illness and mortality among patients with COVID-19 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. A few case reports also were published that COVID-19 may trigger acute hyperglycemic crises (DKA/HHS) in patients with inadequately controlled diabetes， as well as newly diagnosed diabetes \\[5，6\\]. In a retrospective study from China， Li et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u> reported that； 42 (6.4%) patients admitted with COVID-19 had ketosis out of which 15 (35.7%) had diabetes. Three (20%) out of 15 patients with diabetes had DKA， five patients(26.7%) with diabetic ketosis died， and one of these (25%) presented with acidosis. Two (7.4%) and four (14.3%) of the non-diabetic ketotic patients developed severe acidosis and died， respectively， one of these (25%) presented with acidosis.

This case reports reflects upon a healthy 46 year old female who presented with subtype of true neoplasm called a neural fibrolipoma arising from the plantar nerve. The patient was referred by her GP for an evaluation of an unknown painful soft tissue mass present in the right plantar aspect of the mid foot. The mass had been present for approximately 2 to 3 years and had recently increased in size in the last 4 months. This 17 mmx7 mm x11 mm painful soft tissue swelling was detected by USS and showed it extended deep to the plantar fascia not arising from it hence ruling out the common misconception of plantar fibromatosis.**\n\n【11】**When reviewing such patients， it is imperative to rule out any malignancy before excising the mass which is why referring this patient to a Sarcoma MDT was essential. Other infectious differentials including septic arthritis and osteomyelitis were ruled out early since Blood counts showed CRP -1.2 mg/L， White cell count - 5.1×10/L，Neutrophils -3.47×10/L. Arthritic differentials such as Gout were also ruled out based on blood parameters which revealed Urate -287.**\n\n【12】**The patient opted for surgical excision biopsy of the lesion. Post operative period was uneventful with good healing of the wound She was followed up 2 months and at with the histology findings results revealed a rare soft tissue neural neoplasm in keeping of a neurofibrolipoma. The patient was happy with the overall outcome and discharged. This case report highlights the need to consider the neural fibrolipoma as a rare case of plantar/heel pain and excision of the lesion would provide an excellent outcome.**\n\n【13】**Keywords： Plantar nerve； Neural fibrolipoma； Neuroma**\n\n【14】**Introduction**\n\n【15】**A neuroma can be defined as benign tumour of nerve tissue. Neuromas can be differentiated into 3 categories. Firstly a true neuroma， secondly neuromas associated with trauma and finally neuromas as part of a syndrome such as neurofibromatosis or MEN2b. Neuromas are overlooked as a differential diagnosis for heel pain， and they are diagnosed by a combination of physical examination， history taking， and radiological imaging and by histopathological findings following excision.**\n\n【16】**A Neural fibrolipoma， also known as a lipofibromatous hamartoma is a benign， soft-tissue neoplasm generated by the proliferation of mature nerve sheet fibroblast and adipocytes leading to the formation of a palpable subcutaneous mass. The exact pathogenesis of a neural fibrolipoma is unknown however chronic irritation and trauma have known to play a precipitating factor. Often seen in nerves with high risk of compression such as the median nerve， it is very rare to present in the plantar nerve.**\n\n【17】**Case Presentation**\n\n【18】**A healthy 46-year-old female who was referred by her GP for an evaluation of a painful soft tissue mass present in the right plantar aspect of the mid foot. The mass had been present for approximately 2 to 3 years and had recently increased in size in the last 4 months. The patient described the feeling as walking on a hard stone. There was no history of trauma or significant familyhistory. Upon inspection there was no apparent infection or skin changes. Upon examination the patient had bilateral planovalgus feet with bilateral hallux valgus worse on the right side. This swelling had led to chronic pain with some sensitivity and numbness over that area. Following**\n\n【19】**Figure 1： USS Right foot plantar showing mass deep to plantar fascia.**\n\n【20】**Figure 2： MRI with contrast - right foot -sagittal view.**\n\n【21】**the patients' first appointment the patient received an injection of80 mg Depo-medrone and 1 ml of 1% Lignocaine under ultrasound guidance into the second MTP to temporarily provide symptomatic relief for the pain whilst an ultrasound was arranged to rule out plantar fibromatosis. X-rays ruled out any bony injury or obvious bone malignancy.**\n\n【22】**USS described this swelling in the plantar aspect of the mid-foot as well defined， hypoechoic tender lesion within the plantar subcutaneous tissue measuring approximately 17 mm x7 mm×11mm. More importantly the lesion extended deep to the plantar fascia**\n\n【23】**not arising from it hence ruling out plantar fibromatosis . In order to rule out any aggressive pathology an MRI with contrast was arranged which revealed a 2 cm by 5 mm tubular oblique lesion in the plantar subcutaneous fat. MR imaging was also able to rule out sinus tarsi syndrome and any internal derangements . She was referred to orthotics for a medial support arch to help with pain. Since the exact characteristics of this lesion were still unknown the case was referred to the Yorkshire Sarcoma MDT. The outcome of this meeting concluded that there were no radiological features of a sarcoma. She still experienced excruciating， sharp stabbing pain in her right foot. Pain score was 10/10. She opted for surgical excision biopsy of the lesion. The post operative period was uneventful with good healing of the wound. She was followed up 2 months and at with the histology findings results revealed a rare soft tissue neural neoplasm in keeping of a neurofibrolipoma. The patient was happy with the overall outcome and discharged. She was reviewed again after 2 years for a further foot and ankle problem in the other foot and at the time of review she was completely pain free in the right foot with an excellent outcome.**\n\n【24】**Discussion**\n\n【25】**A.true neuroma can come in various sizes andlocations including a vestibular schwannoma， acoustic neuroma， ganglioneuroma， neurothekeoma， nerve sheath myxoma. These neuromas have their own unique characteristics and origin. The true incidence of many these neuromas vary in different literature as often neuromas go undetected until they become symptomatic. In the cases ofan acoustic neuroma or vestibular schwannoma patients can present with tinnitus hearing loss and vertigo. In this case the patient presented with chronic pain in her right foot.**\n\n【26】**When reviewing such patients， it is imperative to rule out any malignancy before excising the mass which is why referring this patient to a Sarcoma MDT was essential.Other infectious differentials including septic arthritis and osteomyelitis were ruled out early since Blood counts showed CRP - 1.2 mg/L， White cell count - 5.1×10/L， Neutrophils -3.47 10/L. Arthritic differentials such as Gout were also ruled out based on blood parameters which revealed Urate -287. Given that the pain was focused on the plantar aspect of the heel and not primarily in the posterior heel conditions such as Achilles tendonitis，retroachiles bursitis or retrocalcaneal bursitis were ruled out. Furthermore， given the age of the patient was not an adolescent Severs disease (calcaneal apophysitis) was also excluded 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1-6\\]</u>.**\n\n【27】**It is important to recognize that this true neuroma originated from aperipheral nerve such as the medial plantar nerve and not from the inter-digital nerve as that would make it a Morton's neuroma.**\n\n【28】**During excision the medial plantar nerve was preserved ensuring the patient preserved motor function of the abductor hallucis， flexor digitorum brevis， the flexor hallucis brevis and the first lumbrical muscle.**\n\n【29】**Conclusion**\n\n【30】**This case report highlights the need to consider the neural fibrolipoma as a rare case of plantar/heel pain and excision of the lesion would provide an excellent outcome.**\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**1\\.

The individual who takes the drug assigns multiple meanings both to the drug itself and to the fact of taking it 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Considering that today's patients often seek diagnosis online before visiting a doctor， and verify the recommendations received after the appointment itself， they often arrive at their doctor's doorstep having already formed a preconceived opinion about their alleged condition and the treatment required. In some cases， this can make consultation easier； in others， it may result in increased difficulties in introducing the correct drug therapy. In the latter case， the doctor's clinical experience may prove to be of paramount importance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. This paper describes the case of an individual suffering from generalized anxiety disorder who presented for counselling with a self-diagnosis of dissociation and a hesitant attitude towards pharmacological treatment. The first step enabling the introduction of treatment was to reformulate the patient's prior beliefs.**\n\n【5】**Case Presentation**\n\n【6】**A 38-year-old IT company employee came forward with complaints of \"derealization and dissociation\"， which he diagnosed himselfwith based on descriptions available online， claiming that“there are no cures for this\"， also based on internet sources.**\n\n【7】**First appointment**\n\n【8】**OPEN ACCESS**\n\n【9】**_\\*Correspondence：_**\n\n【10】**_Slawomir Murawiec， Mental Health_ _Centre， Harmonia Luxmed Medical_ _Centre， Warsaw， Poland，_**\n\n【11】**The patient described the symptoms experienced in a way that mostly corresponded to his self-diagnosed condition， saying： \"I have been in a state of permanent dissociation and derealization for3 weeks. In these states， I feel like I'm doing everything on autopilot； my consciousness is watching what I'm doing； these states are exacerbated in stressful situations. My stress resistance has dropped to zero.\"Further， he added the following： \"I have also read that there is no treatment for dissociation and derealization， only psychotherapy can help.**\n\n【12】**_E-mail： smurawiec@gmail.com_ Received Date： 14 Feb 2023Accepted Date： 23 Feb 2023Published Date： 27 Feb 2023 _Citation：_**\n\n【13】**The meaning structure imposed by the patient at the onset of the appointment was based on a diagnosis formulated by the patient himself and a narrowing of the range of treatment options available. Yet， at the same time， the patient reported to a psychiatrist rather than a psychotherapist， which indicated uncertainty about his own attitude. During anamnesis， it was established that the patient had already experienced such a state of mind before. He recounted： \"I had already felt like this at one point， the previous time was after a party， during which I had taken a psychoactive substance.**\n\n【14】**_Murawiec S.

Sharing this concern expanded the scope of the conversation to include a new area： Anxiety. This made it possible to go beyond the meaning of \"dissociation and derealization\"-for which \"there are no cures\"- as proposed at the beginning. It soon turned out that the patient was facing an increased workload and experienced more pressure at work (which he caused himself) and believed his workplace intellectual performance to be declining. His interpretation was as follows： \"I am not so efficient at work because I had damaged my brain at that time； this damage has permanent consequences\".**\n\n【17】**Subsequent statements by the patient directly pointed to anxiety symptoms**\n\n【18】**“My thoughts are that I'm very scared it's going to get worse； I'm going to run out of strength to fight it. I feel like I'm losing my identity in a way. I have this question about who I am， what I want and what is important lingering over my head. Profoundly philosophical. I am afraid this condition will get worse. I am afraid that something might happen to me， a serious illness. If I wake up in this state at night， allI want to do is survive； sometimes panic sets in.\"**\n\n【19】**He also reported experiencing a “constant feeling of anxiety\"and claimed： \"I have always been thinking of what might go wrong； my head couldn’t stop； I would go from a minor thing to tragic consequences. The patient had a multifaceted neurological diagnosis. No features of CNS neurological problems were found.**\n\n【20】**This statement by the patient also indicated another aspect of the treatment that proved crucial. One important value for the patient was his identity -the question \"Who am I?\". Indeed， this question made the context of treatment more meaningful still. It made it clear that the patient would not accept treatment that would lead to a subjectively discernible violation of his sense of identity. The patient needed to be in control of himself and that which concerned him. After all， he reported to the doctor with a ready-made self-diagnosis and views on the possibility of receiving help. In the subsequent part of the conversation，he stressed the importance of his sense of self， of who he was.**\n\n【21】**After reformulating the diagnosis from1“dissociationi and derealization\" to \"anxiety disorder\"， to which the patient agreed，he was presented with a description of generalized anxiety disorder. The patient fully identified with this description. Treatment with pregabalin was then suggested， which included a reference to the presentation ofdrug-related information and the summary ofproduct characteristics. The remainder of the visit was spent discussing the patient's fears， anxieties and beliefs about the possible use of the drug. While the patient ultimately agreed to take pregabalin， he did indicate that he had an appointment with another psychiatrist to get a \"second opinion\".**\n\n【22】**Further treatment stages**\n\n【23】**The second opinion he sought confirmed the recommendation to take pregabalin. At the follow-up appointment， the patient reported that \"This drug has helped a little， I don't have as many panic attacks\". He was taking 75 mg of pregabalin at the time； however， he did not consent to an increase in the dosage of the drug. He feared that taking higher doses would make him lose his identity. Subsequent appointments with the patient can be described as a \"negotiation\"between the desire to take higher doses of pregabalin， linked to perceived improvements in mood and function， and fears of losing control. Although the patient had carefully read the information about the drug， including the dose range starting from 150 mg， and did not dispute this information，he expressed strong concerns about increasing the drug dosage (and simultaneously a desire to do so). These concerns applied even to the threshold dose indicated in the leaflet. The patient was concerned about losing control over himself and his well-being， as well as suffering a loss of identity， and feeling a sense of dependence on a drug-a factor beyond his control.**\n\n【24】**After increasing the dose of pregabalin to 150 mg， the patient experienced a marked improvement， including in terms of mood and function throughout the day. As a result， he grew even more hesitant**\n\n【25】**about the drug he was taking. The drug's effect proved to be very helpful； the irritating and function-limiting symptoms he had been suffering from for years began to disappear. On the other hand， this confronted the patient with the feeling that his well-being was not entirely up to him and was not fully un der his control， raising his fear and，ironically， creating some anxiety. Nonetheless， so great were the benefits of taking pregabalin that the patient opted for another dose increase to 225 mg. The features of generalized anxiety have subsided， and the patient's functioning in many spheres has significantly expanded in capacity. The patient reframed his mindset， recognizing that “I'm myself the way I am now\". He was satisfied with the new opportunities to meet other people (which had previously been significantly limited)， to travel and go on trips， and the significant improvement in his workplace status and image.**\n\n【26】**Conclusions**\n\n【27】**An important feature of generalized anxiety disorder is a specific form of anxiety- thinking of negative scenarios of future events， anticipatory anxiety and having anxious thoughts about the future. Individuals suffering from this disorder often craft elaborate scenarios full of negative expectations based only on a piece oftrivial information 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.**\n\n【28】**Their anxiety can take many forms， some of which do not directly indicate that they are experiencing it. Patient complaints can include a range of somatic and psychological symptoms， as well as a variety of behaviors. To formulate a diagnosis， it is necessary to carry out a more thorough history taking and discuss with the patient the content of the experiences underlying the reported symptoms.**\n\n【29】**Individuals suffering from anxiety may express fear of _SDe_ treatment and various aspects of it， including those of a highly improbable nature. This fear should be thoroughly discussed to ensure the patient's cooperation in treatment. If the patient's hesitant attitude towards treatment is dominated by fears rather than hope for improvement， their cooperation in the treatment will be incomplete**\n\n【30】**In treating mental disorders， the dimension of subjective and psychological aspects of treatment is often crucial 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1-3\\]</u>. Such phenomena often determine cooperation in treatment. They are based on the subjective feeling of the drug's effect (the perception of \"what the drug does to me) and the interpretation of this effect 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. These interpretations are individual and result from the patient's life history and numerous psychological conditions like confidence levels， values held or culturally based perceptions about the effects of substances prescribed by psychiatrists. The sense of identity， of being oneselfand of \"not compromising one's personality\" during treatment is vital to the success of treatment in some patients with mental disorders.**\n\n【31】**_F_ ersonalized selection of pharmacological treatment appropriate to the diagnosis and the given patient plays an important role here 7，8.**\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>1\\.

However， the development of PET/CT system， which includes a digital PET/CT system and reconstruction algorithms， has been shown to increase the detection and visualization of internal properties for breast cancer due to its higher spatial resolution 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Here we report a case of breast cancer in which heterogeneous IBF-FDG accumulation demonstrated on digital PET/CT correlated with intratumoral heterogeneity histopathologically.**\n\n【19】**Case Presentation**\n\n【20】**A 56-year-old Japanese woman presented to our medical center with a palpable mass in her right breast. She had no previous or family history of breast or ovarian cancer. Elastic hard mass was palpable in her right breast. Mammography and ultrasound revealed a lobulated shaped mass in the breast and multiple enlarged lymph nodes in the right axilla suspicious of breast cancer with multiple axillary lymph node metastases. The internal echo was homogeneous on ultrasound. The MRI appearance was of a lobulated mass surrounded by slight rim and septal enhancement within the tumor. Biopsy of the lesion revealed invasive ductal carcinoma.**\n\n【21】**The patient underwent 'F-FDG PET/CT of the right breast and axillary lesions as part of the preoperative work-up. Scanning was performed using a digital PET/CT scanner (Discovery MI； GE Medical Systems， Milwaukee， WI) about 60 min after the intravenous administration of 5.49MBq/kg oflF-FDG. PET was performed from the skull base to the proximal thigh with the patient in the supine position； the patient was then moved into the prone position using a hand-made breast positioning device， and single-bed PET/CT was performed of the breast region alone. The CT and PET acquisition parameters were as follows. Non-contrast whole-body and additional regional CT scans were obtained at 120 kV with automatic dose modulation， and PET was performed with acquisition time of 2.10 min per bed position in three-dimensional mode. The PET images were then reconstructed using Q.Clear (GE Medical Systems； B=400) with attenuation correction. The**\n\n【22】**interval between the two PET/CT scans was 17 min. The images revealed marked focal IF-FDG uptake with SUVmax of 27.9 that corresponded to the breast lesion identified on other modalities. The tumor appeared heterogeneous accumulation on PET image (Figure1). No distant metastases were detected. The clinical staging was T2N1M0 Stage II. Right modified radical mastectomy was performed. Histological analysis revealed invasive ductal carcinoma， mixed type， with pleomorphic carcinoma components. The histological appearance was of a mixed tumor with solid and cystic components bounded by fibrous septa. Areas with abundant tumor cells in the lesion identified with Hematoxylin and Eosin (HE) staining and with Ki-67 staining matched the site of marked IF-FDG accumulation seen on the PET images， and fibrotic or cystic sites corresponded with areas of hypo-1F-FDG accumulation seen on the PET images.**\n\n【23】**Discussion**\n\n【24】**In the present case of invasive ductal carcinoma， the tumor demonstrated heterogeneous accumulation on PET that correlated to intratumoral heterogeneity histopathologically.**\n\n【25】**The role of PET/CT in breast cancer has been the pre-treatment systemic staging of locally advanced breast cancer. Several breast cancer guidelines have not recommended PET/CT for women with**\n\n【26】**apparent early-stage breast cancer or even for those with operable stage III breast cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The use of PET/CT for imaging primary breast lesions is hampered by its low spatial resolution， which reduces its sensitivity by missing small lesions； in addition， it is less sensitive than sentinel lymph node biopsy for assessing axillary lymph node involvement. The low prevalence of distant metastases in these patients and the relatively high risk of false-positive findings are considered to detract from the usefulness of PET/CT for distant staging in these patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.**\n\n【27】**The development of dedicated Breast PET (dBPET) systems has enabled detailed high-resolution imaging by setting the detector close to breast lesion. An association between baseline tumor glycolytic activity and tumor biology have been reported. Masumoto et al. reported that intratumoral heterogeneity on dBPET can predict the malignancy grade of breast cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. They considered that such intratumoral heterogeneity could not be demonstrated on conventional PET/CT. However， the dBPET is specialized for breast scan， it cannot obtain whole-body image at same equipment.**\n\n【28】**Advances in PET/CT technology have improved image quality and the ability to detect small lesions. In a previous study， the quantitation and detectability of sub-centimeter spheres was higher with a digital PET/CT system compared with conventional OSEM-based reconstruction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. In the present case of invasive ductal carcinoma， PET/CT imaging acquired with a digital PET/CT system demonstrated heterogeneous 18F-FDG accumulation. A. marked abundance of tumor cells identified within the lesion histopathologically with HE staining matched the region of marked18F-FDG accumulation identified on the PET images， and fibrotic and cystic sites matched those of 1F-FDG hypo-accumulation. It is known that US and MRI have high tissue resolution； however， the present case shows the ability of digital PET/CT to evaluate the internal properties of tumors.**\n\n【29】**In conclusion， we report a case of invasive ductal carcinoma that demonstrated heterogeneous IF-FDG accumulation on novel digital PET/CT that correlated to histopathological intratumoral heterogeneity. Digital PET/CT imaging shows potential for evaluating the internal properties of a lesion and may enable prognostic prediction.**\n\n【30】**with Ki-67 staining (c， d) that matches areas of marked 1F-FDG accumulation on the PET images.

We report a case of a large pleomorphic adenoma in the upper lip in a 42-year-old man with a 6-month evolution， which due to its size could be mistaken for a malignant lesion. Biopsy is essential to close the diagnosis in these cases and to exclude the hypothesis of a malignant lesion； the treatment was performed with surgical excision.**\n\n【12】**Keywords： Pleomorphic adenoma； Salivary gland tumor； Benign neoplasm**\n\n【13】**Introduction**\n\n【14】**Pleomorphic adenoma is the most common benign mixed tumor of the salivary glands. May occur in both major and minor salivary glands \\[1，2\\]. This tumor usually presents as a solitary， painless， slow-growing nodular mass， with prevalence in females and with a higher occurrence between the third and sixth decade of life. Histologically， the lesion may present variable epithelial， myoepithelial and mesenchymal elements， usually presenting a well-circumscribed capsule. Epithelial cells can form ducts， islands， or cords of cells \\[3，4\\]. Differential diagnoses include mucoepidermoid carcinoma， salivary gland tumors， mucocele， neurofibroma， schwannoma and secondary infections. Treatment consists of surgical excision of the lesion with a safety margin. Incomplete removal cases can cause recurrences. Post-surgical follow-up is essential to assess the possibility of malignant transformation \\[3，5，6\\].**\n\n【15】**Case Presentation**\n\n【16】**Male patient， 42 years old， sailor， was referred to our department for presenting a painless swelling in the upper lip region. The patient reported evolution of the lesion of six months. During the anamnesis， the patient had a good general condition and reported being hypertensive controlled by medication. In the intra-oral clinical examination， the patient presented a large， solitary， painless， hardened， normocolored， pedunculated， smooth-surfaced tumor lesion in the region of the upper left labial mucosa， with an evolution of six months . Patient had a urine test result， performed six days before our appointment， without the presence of abnormalities.**\n\n【17】**Given the different diagnostic hypotheses， an excisional biopsy of the lesion was requested to clarify the diagnosis. The macroscopic material sent for analysis consisted of a soft tissue fragment， with a smooth surface， irregular shape， firm consistency， brown in color， measuring 20 mm x10 mm ×10 mm . Histological sections revealed a fragment of glandular neoplasia. Neoplastic cells form ducts with two or seven layers of cells containing hyaline material in their interior. In some fields， neoplastic cells displayed eccentric plasmacytoid-like nuclei. In other fields， the presence of deposition of hyaline material and myxoid material was observed. The neoplasm was delimited by dense fibrous connective tissue and showed， in some fields， neoplastic cells with a polyhedral shape that， sometimes，presented eccentric nuclei with a plasmacytoid shape. Completing the histopathological picture， a discrete mononuclear inflammatory infiltrate， extravasation of red blood cells and ectatic blood vessels of varying sizes were present in the specimen . The final diagnosis was compatible with pleomorphic adenoma.**\n\n【18】**The treatment was performed by surgical excision of the lesion and was uneventful . Antibiotic， anti-inflammatory， and analgesic were prescribed to control postoperative symptoms. The patient had a satisfactory recovery and within the expected parameters.**\n\n【19】**Figure 1： A) Initial appearance of the lesion.B) Surgical process. C) Surgical piece measuring 20 mmx 10mmx 10 mm. D) Immediate postoperative final appearance.**\n\n【20】**Figure 2： Neoplastic cells forming duct of cells containing hyaline material in their interior (H&E；100x).**\n\n【21】**Discussion**\n\n【22】**Salivary gland tumors are complex lesions that are differentiated by the clinical-histological pattern. These lesions are rare and represent about 3% to 10% of all head and neck neoplasms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Most represent benign tumors， about 75% to 85%； females are the gender most affected by these tumors， the parotid gland represents the most affected location， it can occur in any age group， however， the highest reports occur between the third and sixth decade of life 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7-9\\]</u>.**\n\n【23】**The AP represents the most common neoplasm of the salivary gland. Most of these tumors arise in the parotid gland. Intraorally， the most common sites are the palate， upper lip and buccal mucosa， areas that have many minor salivary glands. The name of this lesion refers to its varied histology， composed of epithelial， myoepithelial andmesenchymal structures \\[1，2，9\\]. Clinically， the lesion is usually present as a unilateral， asymptomatic， slow-growing， well-circumscribed and most often encapsulated tumor， the overlying mucosa most often does not present ulceration \\[1，8\\].**\n\n【24】**Minor salivary gland tumors are uncommon and among them the pleomorphic adenoma is the most frequent. In a study of 82 cases of tumors in minor salivary glands carried out by Toida et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>， pleomorphic adenoma was the most common tumor intraorally， with the palate being the most common site (44 cases) and females the most affected， with a male/female ratio of 1：3.2通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. The occurrence of pleomorphic adenoma in the lip represents about 20% to 40% of**\n\n【25】**all intraoral pleomorphic adenomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. In the study by Toida et al.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>， of the 54 cases of intraoral pleomorphic adenoma， only 3 were in the upper lip 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. The upper lip is more affected than the lower lip in a ratio of 6：1， the exact cause of this discrepancy is not known， but it is believed that it is due to differences in the embryonic development of the upper and lower lips， another theory is that the cells tumors would be destroyed by the continuous presence of inflammatory cells in the lower lip induced by frequent traumatic events 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11-13\\]</u>. Adenomas that occur on the lips appear to occur at a younger age than those that occur elsewhere， with a peak incidence between the third and fourth decade of life， with a mean of 33.2 years \\[2，6\\]. According to a bibliographic survey of 38 cases of AP in the lip performed by Suka，2021，the upper lip was the most affected， with a predominance of the left side， males (21 cases) were more affected than females (17 cases)， the mean age was 43.3 years and the mean diameter of the tumors was2.6 cm 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. This information corroborates our case， as it is a 42-year old male patient with a lesion in the upper lip on the left side.**\n\n【26】**Due to its nonspecific clinical features， the differential diagnosis of AP in the upper lip includes a wide variety of pathologies： benign and malignant neoplasms of the salivary glands， sialolithiasis， leiomyoma， hemangioma， neurofibroma， schwannoma or infection with a foreign body \\[2，6\\]. The diagnosis of pleomorphic adenoma is made by histopathological analysis： It usually presents as a proliferation of encapsulated epithelial and myoepithelial cells with the presence of stroma， which can be myxoid， chondroid or hyalinized. The epithelium may form ducts and cystic structures or may appear as islands or nests of cells \\[2，4\\]. Imaging tests， such as magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography， can aid in the diagnosis， as they allow a better visualization of the location and size of the lesion， in addition to being useful for differentiating between a benign or malignant lesion \\[3，12\\].**\n\n【27】**The treatment of choice for AP in the lip is tumor excision with a safety margin， but some authors suggest performing aspiration biopsy before definitive removal of the tumor，the prognosis is good. Recurrence cases may be associated with incomplete tumor excision or capsule rupture. Malignant transformation presents about 2% to7% of cases \\[5，14\\]. Some authors report that the occurrence of AP in the upper lip is more related to benign tumors， while the lower lip is more related to malignant lesions \\[2，11，15\\].**\n\n【28】**Conclusion**\n\n【29】**Finally， AP should be investigated and considered as a differential diagnosis in cases of painless tumor masses of the lips. Due to its non-specific clinical characteristics， diagnosis may be difficult， and for this， biopsy is indispensable，imaging tests can also be useful. Surgical excision is the treatment of choice for this lesion and periodic follow-up should be performed to reduce the chances of recurrence and malignant transformation.**\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**1\\.

Pseudoporphyria is a related blistering skin condition that shares clinical and histopathologic features of PCT but lacks the enzyme deficiency associated with bullous formation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Anticoagulants， mainly heparin， are known to cause various cutaneous eruptions such as skin necrosis， hematomas， and bullae 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Cutaneous reactions secondary to the initiation of newer direct oral anticoagulants (e.g.，apixaban，rivaroxaban) have rarely been reported in the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4-7\\]</u>. This case report describes an 83-year-old female with stable PCT who presented with acute bullous eruption after recent hospitalization and treatment for extensive bilateral Deep Venous Thromboses (DVT) with apixaban.**\n\n【12】**Case Presentation**\n\n【13】**An 83-year-old female with a 10-year history of PCT， in addition to Crohn’s disease and hereditary hemochromatosis presented to her primary care physician with worsening eruption of bullae on her lower extremities. The patient had recently completed a 6-day hospital stay for extensive bilateral lower extremity DVTs and was started on a 7-day course of apixaban 10 mg oral BID. On day 4 of her hospital stay， she developed severallarge， painful， and edematous blisters with seeping serous fluid on her bilateral lower extremities.**\n\n【14】**A week and a half after hospital discharge， the patient presented to her primary care office in visible distress from her worsening and enlarging bullae， with the largest bulla measuring 10 cmx20 cm. The patient even developed a new serous-filled blister during the visit. Emergency medical services were called， and the patient was taken to a local hospital for better pain control. Further workup revealed full-thickness skin loss with loose skin involving the entire medial aspect of the right calf， a large eschar separating from the deep soft tissues with exposed muscle on the left calf， and additional large serous-filled blisters . The patient was transferred to a high-level burn center for intensive wound care management and surveillance.**\n\n【15】**During her hospital stay at the burn center， the patient underwent tangential excision and debridement of over 400 cm² of full-thickness lower extremity bullae on two separate occasions. Cultures sent from the wound fluid grew E faecalis， Citrobacter farmeri， and GPR's consistent with diphtheroids， for which the patient was placed on Zosyn. The pathology report of multiple incisional biopsy specimens revealed an entirely denuded epidermis with nonspecific dermal fibrosis and minimal dermal inflammation. Subcutaneous and deep vessel wall calcifications were noted with no evidence of vasculitis. PAS stain with diastase was noncontributory. Thehistopathologic features were compatible with but not specific for porphyria. Immunofluorescence was not performed due to patient preference but was recommended with a repeat biopsy if clinically indicated. The patient underwent two additional debridement procedures the following week with Kerecis fish-skin graft placement to the bilateral lower extremities. At the time of discharge， the patient's Kerecis grafts were dressed in Adaptic dressing and Aquaphor while her skin tears were dressed in Xeroform and Bacitracin. Three weeks post-op，patient had no complications and wounds were slowly healing with Kerecis grafts .**\n\n【16】**Discussion**\n\n【17】**Porphyria cutanea tarda is a photodermatosis characterized by fragile， hemorrhagic bullae and erosions with associated milia， hyperpigmentation， and hypertrichosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.

Due to the unusual nature of this patient's presentation along with a complex medical history， the etiology behind this eruption was not entirely understood. The differential for this patient included a PCT eruption， bullous hemorrhagic dermatosis， cutaneous Crohn's disease manifestation， autoimmune bullous skin disease， and other subepidermal bullous diseases (e.g.， epidermolysis bullosa acquisita， bullous pemphigoid) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.**\n\n【23】**We hypothesize that the combination of our patient’s lower extremity edema secondary to bilateral DVTs， predisposition to subepidermal bullous formation due to PCT， and initiation of apixaban for DVT treatment contributed to her painful bullous eruption. Thehistopathologic features ofuniformly absent epidermis， nonspecific dermal fibrosis， and minimal dermal inflammation all support the diagnosis of an atypical PCT eruption with the recent initiation of apixaban as a potential trigger. A more extensive dermatologic investigation in the outpatient setting， including a repeat biopsy with immunofluorescence， is necessary to elucidate if one of our patient’s other comorbid conditions contributed to her reaction. Ultimately， our patient was successfully treated with IV antibiotics and fluids， surgical debridement， narcotics， and wound care management at a high-level burn unit.**\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**1\\.

Unusual locations of endometriosis have been reported. We report the case of a32-year-old nulliparous black woman with no previous history of invasive abdominal or vaginal surgeries presenting with bilateral inguinal masses. Clinical examination revealed tender and fixed indurations. Magnetic resonance imaging confirmed the presence of one endometriosis lesion in the canal of Nuck along with implants in the pelvis. First by laparoscopy pelvic endometriosis was treated. Right inguinal dissection revealed numerous tumefactions. We removed the biggest mass and stopped due to mismatch between clinical and radiological findings. Histopathology confirmed inguinal endometriosis infiltrating the striated abdominal muscles. Inguinal endometriosis is rare and usually affects the right groin. A history of pelvic endometriosis or invasive abdominal and vaginal surgeries may lead to the accurate diagnosis. This case reported in unique in the bilateral localization of the lesions in a nulliparous woman with no medical or surgical histories. Inguinal endometriosis is a challenging disease that should be a differential diagnosis of painful inguinal masses in women.**\n\n【12】**Keywords： Inguinal endometriosis； Extra-pelvic endometriosis； Inguinal mass**\n\n【13】**Introduction**\n\n【14】**Endometriosis affects 10% to 15% of reproductive-age women 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.

This report is the first publication of a bilateral inguinal endometriosis case in a nulliparous woman with no history of deep endometriosis or gynecologic surgeries.**\n\n【15】**Case Presentation**\n\n【16】**A 32-year-old nulliparous black woman presented to our department for inguinal masses. Her medical and surgical histories were unremarkable besides a hysteroscopy 7 weeks ago for irregular vaginal bleeding due to a simple endometrial hyperplasia. The woman noticed the masses nine months ago with a constant pain and cyclic exacerbations during menses. Clinical examination revealed a bilateral firm and tender masses of 3 cm and 2 cm located lateral and superior to the pubic tubercle with no impulse with cough or Valsalva maneuver. Magnetic resonance imaging confirmed the presence of one cystic heterogeneous mass containing endometriosis implants of 3.3 cm×3cm x1.7 cm on the right side and a smallerleft inguinal lesion along with signs of pelvic endometriosis， consistent with the diagnosis ofendometriosis in the pelvis and in the canal of Nuck， yet the patient had no clinical sign of deep endometriosis.**\n\n【17】**A laparoscopy was decided to assess the pelvis for deep endometriosis and to resect inguinal nodes. Endometriosis was found on ovaries， round and uterosacral ligaments. All lesions were coagulated. There was neither inguinal hernia or hydrocele.**\n\n【18】**Then， inguinal dissection showed an extensive infiltration by numerous firm masses that were in continuity with the extra peritoneal portion of the round ligament.

After percutaneous coronary intervention was performed for the RCA， Two-dimensional transthoracic echocardiography showed the pacemaker lead passed though patent foramen ovale and placed on the mid inferior septum on left ventricle.**\n\n【13】**Keywords： Malposition； Temporary pacemaker； Patent foramen ovale； Percutaneous coronary interyention**\n\n【14】**Introduction**\n\n【15】**Malposition of pacemaker lead in the left ventricle is an unusual complication 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The temporary cardiac pacing may be required in acute myocardial infarction setting for the occurrence of Atrioventricular (AV) block during Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) \\[2，3\\]. Inferior ST- Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI) is especially prone for AV blocks， because of the blood supplyto AV nodal tissues and the inferoposterior surface of the heart share the same arterial territory. Apical septum in Right Ventricle (RV) is usual site for pacing lead and we could check it by using by not only the characteristics of pacing rhythm but also fluoroscopic cardiac anatomy. However， there have been some case reports about inadvertent malposition of transvenous pacing lead in the Left Ventricle (LV)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4-15\\]</u>. In this report， we describe the malpositioning oftemporary pacemaker lead on LV septum， passed through Patent Foramen Ovale (PFO)， detected by Trans Thoracic Echocardiography (TTE) after PCI.**\n\n【16】**Case Presentation**\n\n【17】**A 72-year-old man with hypertension and diabetes mellitus had a sudden onset of substernal chest pain a day before he came to the hospital. Findings on the physical examination were unremarkable. Vital signs were as follows： Temperature 36.6'C， heart rate 76 beats/min， respiratory rate 22 breaths/min， blood pressure 95/52 mmHg，and oxygen saturation 100% on room air.**\n\n【18】**His electrocardiogram showed ST-segment elevation and T wave inversion in leads II， III， and a VF. Laboratory evaluation revealed following： CK-MB 113.1 ng/ml； TnI above 22.78； BNP 558.4pg/ml. A heparin bolus (60 U/kg)， aspirin 300 mg and ticagrelor 180 mg were given.**\n\n【19】**Emergent coronary angiography was immediately performed and revealed a total occlusion in the middle of Right Coronary Artery (RCA). Before RCA intervention， prophylactic temporary pacemaker was inserted via right femoral vein approach for the AV block during the procedure. With the help of fluoroscopic images， a pacing lead was advanced until it reached RA. Then， the pacing catheter was passed smoothly to the ventricle without any resistance . PCI was performed for the RCA， and coronary blood flow recovered completely. The patient was moved to Coronary Care Unit (CCU) immediately after PCI. The patient was stable without any symptom. Surface ECG at CCU showed normal sinus rhythm with coincidental two pacing beats with Right Bundle-Branch Block (RBBB) morphology and early pre cordial transition **\n\n【20】**TTE performed 4-h later after PCI. The TTE showed preserved systolic function (Ejection**\n\n【21】**Figure 1： Fluoroscopic images during the PCl. The white oblique dotted line indicates the direction of inteventricular septum. AP： Anteroposterior； LAO： left anterior oblique**\n\n【22】**Figure 2： 12-Leads surface ECG shows the pacing beats was RBBB pattern with superior axis.**\n\n【23】**Figure 3： Two-Dimensional transthoracic echocardiography images show the pacing wire passed through interatrial septum and located on apical inferior septum in LV. A) Apical four chamber view； B) apical three-chamber view； C) parasternal short-axis view； D) subxiphoid view. LV： Left Ventricle**\n\n【24】**Fraction (EF)=50%) with infero-posterior a kinesis on LV.**\n\n【25】**On the two-chamber/four-chamber views， the pacemaker lead tip was located apical inferior septum in LV ， passed though the incidental PFO . Finally， the temporary pacemaker lead was removed with the guidance ofTTE.**\n\n【26】**Discussion**\n\n【27】**In this case， the physician didn’t have focus on the adequate pacemakerlead site during the coronary intervention procedure. This is a unique case that temporary pacemaker lead tip was crossed the PFO and located on LV septum and suggests that pacing rhythm on surface ECG and fluoroscopic images are important to guide proper lead position. Fortunately， we found RBBB morphology on surface ECG by chance at CCU. Follow-up TTE confirmed the pacemaker lead was on the LV septum and we removed it.**\n\n【28】**We usually establish temporary pacemaker before emergency PCI for acute inferior MI against AV block \\[2，3\\]. Mostly， the pacing wire**\n\n【29】**Figure 4： Two-Dimensional transthoracic echocardiography images suggest the evidence of PFO without shunt flow. The white arrows indicate the site of PFO.**\n\n【30】**PFO： Patent Foramen Ovale**\n\n【31】**tip locates on RV apex only with catheter manipulation without any difficulty. In rare cases， the lead cross interatrial septum and locate on LV pass through mitral valve. If there is a PFO or ASD， the lead tip can pass through the interatrial septum easily like this case. As a standpoint of interventional cardiologists， coronary intervention is the most important procedure. So they didn’t care about the adequate site of adequate pacemaker lead site during the procedure.**\n\n【32】**There have been several complications related with the pacemaker leads unintentionally located on LV， such as， thromboembolic stroke and ventricular perforation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4-14\\]</u>. Lead malposition in the LV should be prevented by a high index of suspicion at implant. Consequently， we should at least check the pacemaker catheter tip site during procedure with the guidance of pacing ECG and fluoroscopic images. First of all， if the pacing site is RV， the pacing QRS on V is usually LBBB pattern， the other way， if it is LV， the pacing QRS on V is usualy RBBB pattern. Fluoroscopic image is another important method to check the lead site. If we could find the ostium of RCA， we could differentiate inter ventricular septum with LAO view.**\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>1\\. Dunbar RD.

Recently， clinicians and physiotherapists can measure the ankle-ROM using smartphone applications. However， these measurement methods cannot be done remotely and body integration is required. For this reason， our study aim is to develop a smartphone application that can measure ankle-ROM remotely and to investigate the its correlation with the universal goniometer.**\n\n【12】**Methods： Twenty-two of healthy university students with 44 feet were recruited in the study. DijiA application was developed for Android smartphone to measure ankle dorsiflexion and plantar flexion ROM remotely. 44 feet were evaluated by both universal goniometer and DijiA application. After completion of testing， all of the participant were filled out the System Usability Scale (SUS) survey for measuring usability of application.**\n\n【13】**Results： The variation in Pearson Correlation Coefficient between the Universal Goniometer and DijiA Smartphone App result showed that there was a moderate positive relationship Between the Universal Goniometer and DijiA (r=0.323 for DF，r=0.435 for PF).**\n\n【14】**Conclusion： Smartphone-based ankle ROM measurement with“DijiA app can be used to assess active ROM ofthe ankle joint without weight-bearing. The result of the study showed that usability of DijiA app is satisfactory and above the standards.**\n\n【15】**Keywords： Ankle 1； Application 2； Range of motion 3； Smartphone**\n\n【16】**Introduction**\n\n【17】**Ankle Range of Motion (ROM) is an important parameter for assessing the functional status of the ankle joint 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The assessment of ankle ROM is commonly performed in both clinical and research settings. Traditionally， ankle ROM measurements have been taken using a universal goniometer， which is a reliable and valid tool for measuring joint angles 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. However，advancements in technology have led to the development of Smartphone applications that claim to be a simple and accurate alternative to the traditional goniometer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.**\n\n【18】**In recent years， there has been a growing interest in using IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) sensors and image processing techniques using a Smartphone camera system for analyzing the motion or posture of the foot and ankle region 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. IMU sensors are small， wearable devices that can measure movement and orientation， and can be used to assess joint angles during ROM measurements \\[4，5\\]. The use of Smartphone camera systems has also gained popularity in recent years， as they can provide accurate measurements of joint angles without the need for additional equipment \\[6，7\\].**\n\n【19】**However， despite the potential benefits of these technologies， there is still a need for further research to validate their use in clinical settings. Larger patient sample sizes and more robust validation assessments are necessary to ensure that these technologies can provide reliable and accurate measurements of joint angles. Additionally， the use of these technologies may require specialized training for healthcare professionals to ensure proper use and interpretation of the data通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.**\n\n【20】**Despitethe challenges，the use of mobileapps and newtechnologies for ROM measurements holds promise for improving the efficiency and accuracy of clinical assessments 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Many clinical tests have also been computerized using mobile apps. ROM or Goniometric Measurement has gained the attention due to its importance for clinical assessment， quick-and-easy procedures， and more mobile equipment \\[10，11\\]. ROM measurements have been developed for various joints， including the lumbar， knee， shoulder， and wrist 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Despite the fact that multiple studies have showed good reliability， more validation assessments with larger patient sample sizes have been identified as a general route for future research \\[12，13\\]. By providing quick and easy procedures， and more mobile equipment， these technologies could potentially increase patient access to care and improve patient outcomes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11-13\\]</u>. As such， continued research and development in this area will be important for advancing the field of clinical assessment and enhancing patient care.**\n\n【21】**The aim of this study is to investigate the correlation between measurements of ankle ROM taken using a universal Goniometer and a Smartphone application. The use of a Smartphone application has the potential to reduce measurement errors and increase the efficiency of data collection. However， the accuracy and reliability of these applications need to be evaluated before they can be considered as a valid tool for measuring joint angles.**\n\n【22】**The findings of this study will provide valuable insights into the potential use of smartphone applications in the assessment of ankle ROM. This could have significant implications for the clinical and research settings， as it could provide a more convenient and cost-effective alternative to traditional goniometry. Furthermore， the results of this study may also inform the development of future Smartphone applications for measuring joint angles.**\n\n【23】**Materials and Methods**\n\n【24】**Fourteen patients with 28 feet (7 females and 7 males aged 21 to29 years) who have the foot deformity were included in this study. Patients with ankle arthrodesis， acute fractures， or other major acute illness were excluded.**\n\n【25】**Study design**\n\n【26】**DijiA application was developed for Android smartphone to measure ankle DF and PF ROM remotely. The purpose of the pilot study was to test the reliability of DijiA in ankle DF & PF-ROM**\n\n【27】**measurement compared with UG. According to this， twenty-two of healthy university students with 44 feet were recruited in Yeditepe University. All subjects were applied applications'evaluation\\*(\\[age， gender， existing chronic diseases， surgical conditions and injuries， morning， activity and severity of night pain and System Usability Scale (SUS) survey for android\\]， Figure 2) form before testing.

Individuals might access a consent page under the KVK's(Turkish Personal Data Protection) privacy policy before proceeding to the app's home page. The participants were then requested to provide information about their sociodemographic factors \\[age， gender， height， weight\\]， dominant side， diabetes， neurological and internal disorders， history of ankle injury， trauma， and surgery. VAS was used to rate the degree of foot and ankle pain in the morning during activity， andat night . To eliminate problems caused by a lack of technological understanding， the interface was designed to be user-friendly and straightforward.**\n\n【30】**In order to meet with the requirements described above， a system designed and implemented. As show in Figure 1， the system is formed by a mobile component and a cloud component.**\n\n【31】**The mobile component will consist of the mobile application (The DijiA app) developed in accordance with the mobile device and device operating system on which the software will run. Accordingly， the mobile component will consist of software that creates a user interface suitable for the screen sizes of the device used， instantly stores the collected user data， communicates with the cloud component， and safely directs the stored data to the right service.**\n\n【32】**A cloud component is a platform that keeps collected data on a designed system for access via a web server. It runs on Amazon Web Services (AWS) consisting of three EC2 Ubuntu servers which are functionally a web server，an application server， and a database server in a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). The web server welcomes the data packets coming from the mobile component to the cloud component and provides access to information stored in the primary database**\n\n【33】**Figure 2： DijA screenshots.**\n\n【34】**which locates on the database server. Media files sent to the cloud component were kept in the file system of the database server as well. Application server runs a ROM measurement service which takes the media files from database and process to find the ROM angle of the patient. The mobile component， cloud component and ROM measurement service supplied by the cloud component are detailed in the paragraphs below.**\n\n【35】**The researcher created a systematic questionnaire and present to the user via mobile component. The first section of the questionnaire asked about age， weight， height， gender， existing chronic diseases， surgical conditions and injuries， morning， activity， and night pain severity. The second component ofthe questionnaire concentrated on the System Usability Scale (SUS)， a \"quick\" and dependable tool. It is a ten-item questionnaire with five response options (strongly agree-strongly disagree) that evaluates a wide range of products and services(software， hardware， mobile devices， websites， and apps). According to studies， SUS scores above 68 are considered above average， while anything below 68 is deemed below ordinary 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>.**\n\n【36】**The DijiA app， whose screenshots are shown in Figure 2， was initially available offline after being downloaded. Until the user has an internet connection， patient s data was saved in the local database**\n\n【37】**(SQLite) on the mobile device. The video shooting step in the mobile app decided the ROMs of the patients. During the video recording phase， patients were requested to do DF and PF movements in a lengthy sitting position with a rolled towel orfand pillow under the knee. Patients were shown the steps of this procedure via video simulation via the app.**\n\n【38】**Following the completion of the mobile app's optimization and testing， those who volunteered to participate in the study were requested to download the mobile app to their phones in order to carry out the pilot study. Individuals uploaded their information onto the app， which they then downloaded to their phones and used to provide their ankle normal range of motion measures by capturing videos through the app.**\n\n【39】**Individuals completed the usability tests for evaluating the mobile app after uploading their videos to the system. The prototype of the mobile device app was tested for usability so that the latest releases contain messages that are clear，effective， consistent with the purpose， and easily understood by the target audience， and do not provoke negative responses. This test provided researchers with data on how individuals perform on questions and the app (colors， music， sounds， timing). Mixed methodologies (direct observation， interviews with**\n\n【40】**individuals， and satisfaction surveys) were utilized in the pilot study to explain areas of progress in a cross-sectional way.**\n\n【41】**The information and video gathered from the patient are sent to the cloud component. The video file stored in database server is taken by the application server to be processed. This process can be named as a human pose estimation which is a challenge of estimating the articulated joint locations of a human body from one image or a sequence of photos of that person. This challenge has been tried to be solved with the methods developed over time. Thus， it has been observed that advances in computer learning provide more accurate human body part detection. In the light of these in-formation， we used deep learning and image processing techniques to determine the angle between leg and foot.**\n\n【42】**For segmentation of the ankle area，Mask-RCNN， a deep learning algorithm， trained with COCO dataset is used. After segmenting the region of interest， we applied image processing techniques such as CLAHE， skin segmentation， contouring and skeletonizing.

The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was applied to assess the distribution of the data. Descriptive statistics were used to define features of study groups. Pearson correlation coefficients were utilized to find significant correlations between the outcomes of two instruments. The 0.05 significance value was used.**\n\n【45】**Results**\n\n【46】**Twenty-two healthy university students with 44 feet (14 females and 8 males aged 18 to 24 years) were included in the study. DijiA pilot study participants descriptive data (age， weight， and height) are presented in Table 1.**\n\n【47】**For comparing the Universal Goniometer (UG) and DijiA， 44 feet were available in Table 2. The mean of ROM measured with the UG were DF for 19.93 ±8.00， PF for 38.59 ±6.46 and measured with the DijiA were DF for 37.45±29.52， PF for 78.55±56.54.**\n\n【48】**According to Pearson Correlation Coefficient between the Universal Goniometer (UG) and the DijiA in measuring ankle dorsiflexion and plantarflexion were significant with DF； 95% CI=0.06-0.65； PF； 95% CI=0.21-0.64 .**\n\n【49】**The variation in Pearson Correlation Coefficient between the Universal Goniometer and DijiA Smartphone App result was showed in Figure 4.

The Survey results for measuring usability of DijiA smartphone app were displayed in Table 4. In the literature， A SUS score of 68 or more is regarded above average， while anything below 68 is considered below standard. SUS score was report as 76.5 (higher perceived usability). It can be interpreted that the application usability is high and people liked it .**\n\n【52】**The overall score given by the participants to the application was recorded by evaluating it out of 10， and the average was found to be 8.26. In addition， feedback was received from the participants expressing their opinions and suggestions for the application. Accordingly， 3 people out of 15 gave the feedback which is written in the Table 5.**\n\n【53】**Discussion**\n\n【54】**Chronic medical problems (osteoarthritis， diabetes mellitus， for example)， anatomical (pes planus-cavus)， better shoe wear， prolonged standing on hard surfaces， sports activity， and biomechanical(increased pronation subtalar joint， AT tightness， limited dorsi-plantar flexors weakness) factors are all associated with hindfoot pain 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15-17\\]</u>. Early recognition and assessment of HP risk factors can lead to successful control and prevention of these symptoms and their chronicity \\[15，18\\]. Many manual and device-based techniques are available in the literature for the early detection and evaluation of the risk factors listed above (especially foot deformity and ankle-ROM). Many techniques can be used to determine ankle joint mobility， including tape measures， digital gravity goniometers， visual estimation， inclinometers， or measurement of joint angles after radiographic visualization in maximal flexion or extension， and Universal Goniometers (UG) \\[19，20\\]. Using eye evaluation or mechanical goniometers is inexpensive， simple， and quick， but it has significant error.

Munteanu et al. discovered that UG reliability (ICC 14 0.65-0.89) was worse than digital inclinometer(ICC 140.88) and acrylic plate apparatus dependability (ICC 14 0.89) in earlier research when they examined ankle joint DF in a weight-bearing position with the knee extended 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>.**\n\n【69】**Moreover， Venturini et al. discovered that UG is simple to use and inexpensive； investigations have showed that goniometric results obtained by different examiners are inconsistent 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u>. Despite this issue， UG remains the gold standard in clinical practice for measuring ROM \\[24，25\\]. Furthermore， because of their accessibility， low cost， and simplicity， a growing number of mobile applications on smartphones are being employed in medical settings instead of traditional measuring equipment such as UG 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>. Previously， the validity and reliability of numerous smartphone ROM measurement apps were tested， and they were discovered to be validiand trustworthy in measuring ROM in a range of joints (elbow，knee， and fifth metatarsophalangeal joints) \\[20，27\\]. According to Williams et al.，who evaluated ankle DF-ROM in weight-bearing using the mobile goniometer app TiltMeter downloaded on a smartphone (ICC 0.8 or higher)， measurement intra/inter-rater reliability with knee extend-flexed was shown to be excellent 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[28\\]</u>. Two more studies \\[29，30\\]**\n\n【70】**demonstrated moderate to excellent reliability and validity in the use of IOS-based goniometer applications to test weight-bearing DF-ROM.

There could be several explanations for why their reliabilities were higher. The most prominent documented example is the use of various mobile goniometer applications on different types of devices with different operating systems (Android vs. iOS) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[28\\]</u>. Another consideration is that applications may have an impact on measurement differences， and their respective software platforms must be extensively evaluated. Any new version of the program that is released should be validated again \\[20，27\\].**\n\n【71】**Weight-bearing ankle-ROM assessments are nevertheless limited in that they cannot be used if weight-bearing is forbidden， and the process appears to be less objective than non-weight-bearing ones because the applied load is required to achieve the final position\\[23，32\\]. Cox et al. investigated ankle joint PF-ROM measurements in non-weight-bearing position and found that The Plaincode Smartphone app was a viable instrument for measuring PF-ROM(right foot r=0.92， p=0.00， left foot r=0.92， p=0.00， combination r=0.92， p0.00) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[33\\]</u>. Walaa et al. also investigated the validity and intra-rater reliability of the Smartphone app \"Clinometer\" for assessing ankle ROM in non-weight-bearing position using a digital inclinometer as the reference standard.

Furthermore， a SUS score was regarded as having higher perceived usefulness， with a total average usability score of 76.5  通用删除6(英):<u>\\[35\\]</u>.**\n\n【72】**The study has a few limitations. The first was the lack of a one-year follow-up assessment period and any outcomes from the combination treatment techniques long-term impacts. Second， DijiA， one of the Smartphone apps we created， was for Android. These apps should be built into all phone OS， and their usefulness should be evaluated. Furthermore， based on the findings of the usability survey， we believe that the inter-face design of the DijiA application should be altered， and the correlation relationship should be strengthened by continuing optimization testing of the DijiA application.**\n\n【73】**Conclusion**\n\n【74】**HP can effectively reduce and avoid these symptoms， as well as their chronicity. As a result， we created a Smartphone application(DijiA) and studied its usefulness and correlation for assessing ankle range ofmotion. The\"DijiA\"app on a smartphone can be used to assess active ROM of the ankle joint without weight bearing. The study's findings revealed that the usability of the DijiA app is satisfactory and beyond industry standards. Smartphone ankle ROM assessment apps allow patients to monitor their possible risk factors without purchasing pricey hardware. This encourages patients to engage in enthusiastic self-rehabilitation and allows for the identification of risk factors in individuals suffering from hindfoot discomfort. Patients， physiotherapists，and doctors can use these apps to remotely monitor ROM at home or in the clinic using a mobile Smartphone. The findings of this study may influence practice guidelines for the management of hindfoot pain and the usage of Smartphone apps for injury prevention.**\n\n【75】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【76】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**1\\.

It has become an important adjunct for clinical diagnosis and procedural guidance. We present a case report of a patient who presented to our Pediatric Emergency Department (PED) and was diagnosed with myocarditis using cardiac ultrasound at the start of her resuscitation. Point-of-care ultrasound was found beneficial in making a crucial diagnosis of myocarditis at the initial stage ofresuscitation. POCUS directed the quick management and eventual connection of the patient to Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) which contributed to the better outcome of the resuscitation.**\n\n【11】**Case Presentation**\n\n【12】**A 15 months old female child was referred to the PED of a tertiary care， university-affiliated， urban facility， due to 4 days of vomiting， restlessness and high fever. Apart from atopic dermatitis， the child was previously healthy and fully immunized.**\n\n【13】**Parents reported that 3 days prior to her presentation， she developed fever and shortness of breath. She was prescribed antibiotics by her pediatrician for pneumonia.**\n\n【14】**On the day of presentation to the PED， the pediatrician did not see any improvement in her condition and referred her to our PED since she appeared pale and lethargic.**\n\n【15】**On arrival to the PED she was obtunded， in severe respiratory distress and pale. Her vital signs were as follows： Oxygen saturation of 70%， heart rate160 bpm， blood pressure 85/58 mmHg， temp37.30°Cand a capillary refill time of 4 sec.**\n\n【16】**Further examination revealed clearlung sounds bilaterally， rapid heart sounds with no murmurs and no jugular vein distention. Her abdomen was soft， non-tender， with no enlargement of the liver or spleen. Peripheral pulses were felt very weak on palpation.**\n\n【17】**From triage， the child was transferred immediately to the resuscitation room. While attempts were being made to establish an IV access， the PED， POCUS trained， attending performed a POCUS examination following the \"RUSH\" protocol - Rapid Ultrasound for Shock and Hypotension. Cardiac echo revealed severely poor cardiac function  with an enlarged IVC and multiple B-lines  in both lung fields. Based on these findings， the child was deemed to be suffering from myocarditis with severe cardiac failure. She was connected to fluids and given a small bolus of 10 ml/kg with normal saline and later， due to poor response， inotorpe treatment was initiated.**\n\n【18】**Her initial blood tests revealed leukocytosis of 26，000 cells/pl with 34% neutrophils， hemoglobin9.7 g/dL and thrombocytosis of 543，000 cells/ul sodium level was 137 meq/L， potassium 7.6 meq/L， albumin 3.8 g/dL， uric acid 13.7 mg/dL， LDH 1024 U/L with a slight elevation in liver function tests. C-Reactive Protein (CRP) level was 0.4 mg/dL， venous blood gases demonstrated a pH of 6.9 with pCO， 34 mmHg，pO， 32 mmHg and HCO3 of 8.4 mmol/L.**\n\n【19】**Despite all efforts undertaken， blood pressure was not restored and after consultation with the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit (CICU) team， the child was intubated and put on an Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) machine in the PED resuscitation room. Once connected，blood pressure stabilized and the child was transferred to the CICU.**\n\n【20】**At the CICU the infant remained connected to the ECMO machine for a period of 8 days with gradual improvement of her cardiac function. After two weeks， she was weaned off from mechanical**\n\n【21】**Figure 1： Parasternal long image of the heart. The image has been taken at the maximal opening ot the mitral valve.**\n\n【22】**ventilation. Her nasopharyngeal swab culture subsequently revealed influenza A.**\n\n【23】**An echocardiogram prior to discharge showed mild dilation with low systolic function of the left ventricle and mild mitral regurgitation. The child was neurologically intact at discharge**\n\n【24】**In the following months， the child was admitted twice to our emergency department. She was found to be with poor cardiac function and was later diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy.**\n\n【25】**Ultrasound Technique**\n\n【26】**The RUSH protocol assesses three main components： the pump- i.e. the cardiac system； the tank - i.e. volume status； and the pipes _一_ \\-i.e. the vascular system. A useful acronym in order to remember the exam components by is HI-MAP： Heart， IVC， Morrison's pouch(FAST)， Aorta and Pneumothorax.**\n\n【27】**Since aortic aneurysm or deep vein thrombosis are rare in children our exam focused on cardiac evaluation and volume status as reflected by the IVC and pulmonary edema.**\n\n【28】**The cardiac exam looks at the heart in four views：**\n\n【29】**_1\\._ Subxiphoid - the transducer is placed underneath the xiphoid with the probe marker directed to the right of the patient. The transducer is directed to the patient's left shoulder.**\n\n【30】**_2\\._ Parasternal long- the transducer is placed to the left of the manubrium with the probe marker towards the patient's right shoulder.**\n\n【31】**_3\\._ Parasternal short - while maintaining the same position as**\n\n【32】**for the parasternal long view， the transducer is rotated 90° towards the patient's right hip.**\n\n【33】**_4\\._ Four chamber views -the transducer is placed at the point of maximal impulse， probe marker towards the patient's right and the transducer is angled towards the patient s right shoulder.**\n\n【34】**These views enable a gross assessment of cardiac function -normal， moderately decreased， severely decreased. In addition， the heart is inspected for pericardial effusion.**\n\n【35】**The IVC is examined by placement of the transducer beneath the xiphoid， probe marker towards the patient’s right and the transducer is perpendicular to the xiphoid. The diameter of the IVC is compared to the aorta where the normal ratio would be 0.8 to 1.2.**\n\n【36】**The lungs are examined by placement of the transducer in a mid-clavicular line with the probe marker towards the patient's head， over the right and left lung. Finding of lung gliding would rule out a diagnosis of pneumothorax. Finding of multiple B lines may suggest pulmonary edema**\n\n【37】**Review of the Literature**\n\n【38】**Several studies have reported on the benefit of rapid use of ultrasound in the emergency department as a tool which influences the decision on how to manage a patient in an unstable condition1-3.**\n\n【39】**Ultrasound assessment of patients in shock is becoming the standard of care in emergency and critical care settings worldwide. One of the most common protocols used for this assessment is the Rapid Ultrasound in Shock (RUSH) examination.**\n\n【40】**The RUSH exam， a rapid evaluation of cardiac function， key vascular structures， and likely sources of hypotension， represents a comprehensive algorithm for the integration of bedside ultrasound into the care of the patient in shock. By focusing on a stepwise approach for evaluation the cause of shock defined here as \"Pump， Tank， and Pipes\"， clinicians will gain crucial anatomic and physiologic data to better care for these patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.**\n\n【41】**Bagheri-Hariri et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u> reported an overall sensitivity of the RUSH exam of 88% and specificity of 96% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u> with no significant difference between the emergency physician and radiologist as operators of this protocol 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.**\n\n【42】**The value of using the RUSH protocol has been reported in two case files of patients， one with hypotensive shock and the other with cardiac tamponade， who presented to the emergency department in shock and were managed promptly using the RUSH protocol during resuscitation71**\n\n【43】**ECMO is used in cases of cardiopulmonary failure to reestablish cardiac output and organ perfusion so that permanent end-organ injury， while awaiting reversal of cardiac and other organ disease processes， is prevented. An overall survival rate of 51% was seen in children who were supported with rapid-response ECMO after suffering from in-hospital cardiac arrest that did not respond to conventional CPR 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.**\n\n【44】**The use of Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) is still limited owing to low availability， especially in emergency departments. Nevet et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u> reported two children with acute myocarditis successfully treated with ECMO in the emergency department of a tertiary pediatric medical center. Given the urgency**\n\n【45】**of their condition and its presumably reversible (viral) etiology， treatment with ECMO was initiated in the department's resuscitation room. The outcome was excellent， and cardiac function remained normal throughout the 6 and 10 months follow-up.**\n\n【46】**Myocarditis among pediatric patients varies in severity from mild disease to a fulminant course with overwhelming refractory shock and high mortality. Because the disease is potentially reversible， it is reasonable to use ECMO to bridge patients until recovery or transplantation. Nahum et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u> reported on the course and outcome of 12 children with acute fulminant myocarditis who were managed by ECMO due to refractory circulatory collapse. They demonstrated that ECMO can be safely and successfully used for children with acute fulminant myocarditis without a need for heart transplantation.**\n\n【47】**ThenewPALS recommendations from 2015 emphasize the advantage of connecting the patient toECMO during cardiopulmonary resuscitation. These recommendations rely on evidence from 4 observational studies of pediatric IHCA that have shown no overall benefit to the use of CPR with ECMO compared to CPR without ECMO， but have shown better outcomes when used during cardiac arrest in children with underlying cardiac disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.**\n\n【48】**While ECMO has been recognized in the latest PALS guidelines， ultrasound was not mentioned in the PALS section and only noted in the adult advanced cardiovascular support section， where the authors recommend that “Ultrasound (cardiac or non cardiac) may be considered during the management of cardiac arrest， although its usefulness has not been well established\".**\n\n【49】**We believe that due to the noninvasive nature of ultrasound and its ability to provide rapid and repeated assessment of physiology during resuscitation， this modality should move to the front line of emergency care. Integration of POCUS techniques such as the RUSH exam has the potential to augment the clinical evaluation and guide resuscitation to improve the patients outcomes.**\n\n【50】**Conclusion**\n\n【51】**This case illustrates the potential clinical impact of POCUS in the management of shock in the pediatric emergency department. The use of POCUS at the very start of resuscitation enabled the treating team to arrive to the diagnosis of severe myocarditis， and the early initiation of the complicated， drastic， yet lifesaving therapeutic option of ECMO， which ultimately improved the child’s prognosis.**\n\n【52】**It is reasonable to think that the rapid intervention enabled by the POCUS examination contributed to the good neurologic outcome in such a severe case.**\n\n【53】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【54】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**1\\.

Its clinical and radiological manifestations are not entirely clear due to the rarity of the disease； and hence diagnosis of this condition can be delayed due lack of knowledge associated with the disease. We present a case of a 63-year-old man who presented with a few weeks of cognitive deficits with dysphasia and marked impairments in short term memory. His MRI brain showed subtle FLAIR and T1contrast abnormalities near the lateral ventricles abutting the temporal lobe at the choroid plexus. On brain biopsy he was noted to have perivascular atypical B lymphocytes consistent with PCNSL. High-dose methotrexate， teniposide， BCNU， prednisolone and Rituximab， followed by 5 months of consolidative chemotherapy with cytarabine resulted in clinical and radiological improvement. He subsequently relapsed twice and salvage chemotherapy with consolidative radiotherapy was delivered. Unfortunately， 6 months later his condition worsened and he was referred to palliative care， and then deceased. PCNSL of the choroid plexus is very rare and cases of relapsed disease generally have poor outcome despite a variety of chemo and radiotherapy options. Targeted therapies with optimal penetration of the blood brain barrier are warranted.**\n\n【14】**Keywords： Primary CNS lymphoma； Choroid plexus； Brain malignancy**\n\n【15】**Introduction**\n\n【16】**Approximately 4% of all intracranial tumors are primary CNS lymphomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>， of which intraventricular neoplasms are rare representing 1% to 10% of primary CNS malignancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. There is an increased incidence of primary CNS lymphoma in individuals with acquired or inherent immunodeficiency 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Involvement of the choroid plexus by lymphoma is rare with only less than10 individual case reports in the literature. The aim of this report is to present a case of a 63-year-old man who presented with cognitive deficits and after a myriad of investigations on brain biopsy was found to have primary CNS lymphoma of the choroid plexus. The case highlights the challenges in diagnosis， the rarity of such cancer affecting the choroid plexus and the response to treatment where treatment efficacy might be reduced due to location of the lesion.**\n\n【17】**Case Presentation**\n\n【18】**A 63-year-old man was brought into the ED by his partner， dueto a1-weekhistoryof\"confusion\"， short-term memory loss and inability to recall directions. There was no history of recent headaches， photophobia， neck stiffness， or seizures. He did not have fevers or night sweats but according to his partner， had lost 3 kg in weight in the past 3 months. His past medical history included a lumbar spinelaminectomy 10 years ago and he was a current smoker (30 pack-year history) but had recently quit. He worked as a farmer and had horses， cattle， dogs， and sheep in the farm. He sailed regularly and his most recent travel was to Japan 3 months prior to his presentation.**\n\n【19】**On examination he was afebrile with a blood pressure of 122/74 mmHg. There was no palpable lymphadenopathy no hepatosplenomegaly. Visual acuity was normal with pinhole correction.**\n\n【20】**Figure 1： MRI images showing (A) FLAIR signal changes and (B) T1 with contrast abnormality during the patient's initial admission to hospital. Images C-F are when the disease relapsed with C and D showing FLAIR sequences and E and F showing T1 post contrast. White arrows indicate site of abnormality.**\n\n【21】**Cranial nerve， gait and neurological limb examination， and fundoscopy were normal.**\n\n【22】**There were no abnormalities on examination of higher centers， frontal， parietal or occipital lobe functions， however marked deficits in recall with retrograde amnesia extending for at least one week with inability to form new memories. He scored 17/30(0/3 recall) on Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and NUCOG of 71/100 with deficits in short-term memory. Formal neuropsychological testing confirmed specific deficits in recall of recent events.**\n\n【23】**Full blood examination， renal and liver function， inflammatory markers， Vitamin B12， folate，TSH，ANA，dsDNA，rheumatoid factor， pANCA and cANCA were all normal. Anti-GAD， anti-NMDAR and VGKC antibodies were negative. HIV serology was negative. Immunoglobulin levels were normal. Serum protein electrophoresis detected a paraprotein band of IgMlambda 4g/L.CT chest/abdomen/pelvis revealed no evidence of malignancy with no enlarged lymph nodes seen.**\n\n【24】**Lumbar puncture showed an opening pressure of 4 cm， H，O with 48 ×10/L polymorphs， 177 × 10/L lymphocytes and 0 x10/L red blood cells. Glucose was 1.5 mmol/L and protein was 3.93g/L. Cytology showed chronic inflammation with no evidence of malignancy. There was no clonal B- or T-cell populations identified by flow cytometry. Cryptococcal antigen， Herpes virus multiplex PCR and syphilis screen were negative. Electrophoresis was normal. NMDA receptor and neuronal antibodies were not detected in CSF.**\n\n【25】**MRI brain with gadolinium revealed thickening of the choroid plexus at the level of the atria of the lateral ventricle (extending to the temporal horns)， more pronounced on the right side associated with marked enhancement ofthe choroid plexus . There was no pathological contrast enhancement within the brain parenchyma outside the ventricular system， and the brain parenchyma was of normal volume with no volume loss of the hippocampal formation. The differential diagnosis from the MRI findings included malignancy， sarcoid or infection. A diagnostic biopsy of the choroid plexus lesion confirmed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma consistent with PCNSL on histology and immunohistochemistry  showing presence perivascular atypical CD20 positive B cells， which were MUM1positive and a Ki-67 index of approximately 80%. A bone marrow biopsy for staging showed no evidence of lymphoma involvement.On slit lamp examination，there was no ocular lymphoma involvement.**\n\n【26】**Figure 2： Histological images of brain biopsy (choroid plexus) results showing：(A) H and E stain showing large atypical cells (black arrowheads) with a perivascular distribution.

Scale bar 20 um.**\n\n【27】**He was subsequently referred to Hematology and commenced treatment withmulti-agentchemotherapy with high-dose methotrexate， teniposide， BCNU， prednisolone and Rituximab(monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody). He received 2 cycles， following which a MRI scan showed near complete resolution of his CNS lymphoma.Hlee then receivedconsolidation with high-dose cytarabine. Five months later， he presented with deterioration in gait and MRI brain scan showed recurrence of periventricular/choroidal enhancement. He received 8 cycles ofsalvage chemotherapy withhigh dose methotrexate and rituximab with the addition of temozolomide on odd-numbered cycles. Restaging MRI showed resolution of the CNS lymphoma consistent with improvement in clinical symptoms. He preceded with 30 Gy of consolidative whole brain radiotherapy delivered in 20 fractions. Unfortunately， six months later， patient exhibited worsening cognition and short-term memory loss and MRI scan confirmed relapsed disease in the ependymal surface of all ventricles， most pronounced in the lateral ventricles of both hemispheres. There was increased T2 signal extending into the white matter and this pattern of disease was in similar distribution to his original scan in June 2014 . Due to his poor prognosis， palliative treatment was discussed with him and his partner and he died within a month of his second relapse.**\n\n【28】**Discussion and Conclusions**\n\n【29】**PCNSL is an uncommon variant of extra nodal Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL) that involves the brain， leptomeninges， eyes， or spinal cord without evidence of systemic disease \\[1，2\\]. The CNS normally lacks lymphoid aggregates and it remains speculative whether malignant transformation develops locally within normally trafficking CNS lymphocytes， or from within a sub-population of lymphocytes with specific tropism for the CNS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Such tropism may be facilitated through the expression of specific cell-surface adhesion molecules， such as CD44 and CD18，and various chemokine receptors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Spreading of malignant lymphoid cells within the CNS is believed to involve a complex interaction of selection and cadherin molecules， such as adhesion molecule CD44 and transmembrane protein receptor Fas (CD95) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.**\n\n【30】**Intraventricular neoplasms consist of two categories： those that originate from the ventricular wall， and those that originate from structures within the ventricular system such as choroid plexus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. The choroid plexus is a leaf-like structure with a granular surface attached to the ependyma by a thin stalk in the lateral， third and fourth ventricles. It produces CSF and is crucial in maintenance of ionic balance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Tumors arising from the choroid plexus are extremely rare， and include choroid plexus papilloma， choroid plexus carcinoma and non-neoplastic lesions. Of these，lymphoma is an extremely rare form of choroid plexus tumor. A PubMed search revealed only less than 8 cases of primary CNS lymphoma of choroid plexus， highlighting the rarity of the disease.**\n\n【31】**The risk factors for PCNSL include： iatrogenic immunosuppression， congenital immunodeficiency including ataxia-telangiectasia， Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome and severe combined variable immunodeficiencies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. PCNSL can also arise from EBV-mediated clonal expansion and malignant transformation of B-lymphocytes， a process that is likely regulated by immune mechanisms 5\\].**\n\n【32】**High-dose methotrexate-based induction chemotherapy is currently the first-line of treatment. As monotherapy， high-dose methotrexate achievesa 35%to74%response rate 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>andcombination chemotherapy regimens have increased response rates to 77% to 85%\\[9，10\\]. However， 35% to 65% of patients still relapse and radiation therapy is utilized as salvage treatment for relapsed or refractory disease with neurocognitive long-term toxicity a major concern 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. In a recent study Yang and colleagues reported the outcomes of 11cases of intraventricular primary CNS lymphoma showing that the majority (70%) relapsed and in the majority of cases salvage therapy(high does methotrexate and radiotherapy were required) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. The overall prognosis for relapsed PCNSL is poor with salvage radiation treatment increasing median overall survival by approximately 11months in radiotherapy-naive patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Another multi centre study used induction therapy with rituximab， high dose methotrexate and temozolomide followed byhigh dose consolidation with etoposide in addition to cytarabine (without whole brain radiotherapy). A complete response to rituximab， methotrexate and temozolomide of66% and progression free survival at 2 years of 57% were seen 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Other studies have reported high dose chemotherapy-autologous stem cell transplantation as a first line treatment for primary CNS lymphoma； and in a phase 2 trial of 30 patients， 5 year probability of relapse-related death was 21% for all patients (n=30) and 8.7% for patients treated with high dose chemotherapy plus autologous stem cell transplantation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.**\n\n【33】**The case that we presented died from relapsed disease where salvage chemotherapy was ultimately ineffective in controlling the underlying illness. Age and premorbid function are thought to be independent risk factors for future prognosis in PCNSL通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. A complete response on neuroimaging after two courses of chemotherapy is also reported to be predictive of progression-free survival 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. The case presented did not have complete resolution of radiological changes after the course of chemotherapy. One reason could have been that the location of the neoplasia being within the choroid plexus was presumably hard to access for the therapeutic agents. Future studies are required to decipher PCNSL location and its association with future outcome.**\n\n【34】**PCNSL of the choroid plexus is a very rare tumor. We present a case of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma of the choroid plexus with extension into the temporal horns ofthe lateral ventricle. Radiological and clinical improvement were achieved with high-dose methotrexate combination treatment with Rituximab but the patient experienced 2relapses within 5 to 6 months of completion oftreatment， heralding a poor prognosis. This is consistent with the literature where recurrent or relapsed PCNL has been reported to have poor outcome despite the many varieties of therapies that have been trialed. Targeted therapies that could penetrate the blood brain barrier are required to deal with this highly invasive brain cancer. Recent efforts on the use of agents such as ibrutinib， lenalidomide and immune checkpoint inhibitors for treatment of PCNL is underway.**\n\n【35】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【36】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**1\\.

Metastasis to the placenta is an uncommon finding in pregnant women， and there is only one reported case causing placental abruption， which involved a cancer of unknown primary. Triple-negative breast cancers tend to be more aggressive overall and have a worse prognosis.**\n\n【15】**Results： A 35-year-old Hispanic woman was diagnosed at 24 weeks gestation with widely metastatic triple-negative breast cancer to the lungs， liver， peritoneum， lymph nodes， and thoracic spine. Chemotherapy was subsequently started with carboplatin and paclitaxel. She was induced at 36weeks and had a placental abruption despite lacking significant risk factors. Pathology of the placenta revealed intervillous malignant cells consistent with the placental spread of cancer.**\n\n【16】**Conclusion： Breast cancer in pregnancy can be difficult to manage regarding therapy options and timing of therapy. Chemotherapy after the first trimester is relatively safe to mother and fetus. However， common agents like trastuzumab and tamoxifen are not recommended due to their teratogenic effects. Pregnancy itself does not increase the risk of mortality in breast cancer； however， diagnosis and treatment are delayed， and pregnant women are more commonly diagnosed with advanced stages of cancer compared to their non-pregnant counterparts. Although placental involvement of cancer is rare， it relays a poor prognosis， and any underlies the importance of placental micro examination in all women with known cancer.**\n\n【17】**Keywords： Metastasis； Chemotherapy； Breast cancer**\n\n【18】**Introduction**\n\n【19】**_org_**\n\n【20】**One in eight women will be diagnosed with breast cancer. Unfortunately， the incidence of breast cancer in young women aged 24 to 35 is rising 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Women who are diagnosed with breast cancer at age 40 or less have a higher mortality rate in Hormone-Receptor (HR) positive breast cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Recent data suggests that annual screening in women beginning at age 40 has greater mortality reduction than current mammogram screening recommendations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. This new screening recommendation has now been endorsed by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG)， the American College of Radiologists (ACR)， the National Consortium of Breast Centers (NCBC)， the National Cancer Center Network (NCCN)， and the Society of Breast Imaging (SBI). Since the incidence of breast cancer in young women is increasing， and women are delaying childbearing until later in life， it is likely that breast cancer in pregnancy will become more common in the future 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. We describe a case of a 35-year-old woman who was diagnosed with aggressive， Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) at 24 weeks gestation， which metastasized to her placenta， causing placental abruption.**\n\n【21】**Case Presentation**\n\n【22】**A 35-year-old G3P2 Hispanic woman at 22 weeks and six days gestation presented to her obstetrician complaining of pain in her left breast and swelling in her axillary region for the past four days. Her physical examination revealed a large， firm and immobile mass of her left breast at the 1 o’clock region with associated lymphadenopathy of her left axilla along with areolar erythema and dimpling. The mass was confirmed by ultrasound， and a core biopsy revealed grade 3 invasive ductal carcinoma. Immunohistochemical evaluation revealed that the tumor was estrogen receptor， progesterone receptor， and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2**\n\n【23】**(HER2) negative. Further analysis revealed a low tumor mutational burden and 0% programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression. Additional immunohistochemical information includes positive cytokeratin (CK) 7. A CT scan of her chest revealed a large breast mass with pulmonary and hepatic metastases， pericardial effusion， ascites， peritoneal implants， a T4 lytic bone lesion， as well as hilar， axillary， and mediastinal adenopathy. An endobronchial biopsy and cytology from her ascites fluid revealed malignant cells positive for CK7 and negative for GATA3， thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1)， and ER. Shortly after， she began chemotherapy with carboplatin and paclitaxel. After three cycles of chemotherapy， repeat imaging showed a decrease in the size of her metastases. Chemotherapy was then held for her labor induction at 36 weeks and 0 days gestation. Prior to delivery， she began to have significant vaginal bleeding with worsening tachycardia and was diagnosed with placental abruption. She underwent amniotomy， and the infant was successfully delivered via forceps assisted vaginal delivery. Placental pathology revealed retroplacental hemorrhage consistent with abruption， as well as atypical intervillous cell clusters. These cells had a high mitotic rate and did not stain as trophoblastic. The cells stained positive for CK7and CK20 and were negative for GATA3， TTF-1， and ER. This was consistent with metastatic breast cancer to the placenta. The patient's health declined， and she elected comfort measures. She died shortly afterward.**\n\n【24】**Discussion**\n\n【25】**Cancer during pregnancy is not a rare phenomenon and has a reported incidence ofapproximately 1 in 1，000 women 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. The most common cancers reported in pregnancy are breast cancer (incidence of 1 in 3，000)， followed by cervical cancer， Hodgkin's lymphoma， and melanoma \\[6，7\\]. Treatment of breast cancer in pregnancy can be a complicated decision as many common agents are teratogenic， especially older alkylating agents (e.g.， procarbazine， busulfan)， antimetabolite drugs (e.g.， aminopterin， methotrexate)， tamoxifen， and trastuzumab \\[7，8\\]. The decision of when to initiate chemotherapy should be a mutual decision between the patient and physician after a thorough explanation of the risks and benefits. Teratogenic effects have been noted primarily in the first trimester， while administration of chemotherapy in the 2n and 3 trimester has been shown to have minimal fetal effects 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. While paclitaxel and carboplatin， the agents used in the above case， do not appear to increase fetal malformations， there have been reports of cytotoxic therapy causing growth restriction， death， prematurity， and myelosuppression 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. The data is limited to small numbers of case reports.**\n\n【26】**Pregnancy itself does not appear to lead to increased mortality， although there is an average delay of 5 to 7 months in diagnosing breast cancer in pregnant women which leads to more advanced staging and worse outcomes \\[10，11\\]. A 2007 case review revealed that65% to 90% ofpregnant women would present in stage II or stage III disease compared to 45% to 66% for non-pregnant women 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.**\n\n【27】**Metastasis to the placenta is a rare occurrence. A 2003 case series showed 87 cases of placental and/or fetal metastasis between the years of 1866 and 2003 with the most common cancers being melanoma， breast， lung， leukemia， and lymphoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Fetal metastasis is even more uncommon， with only 15 of the 87 cases involving the fetal transmission and nearly half of those cases secondary to melanoma. Placental metastasis indicates a poor prognosis for the mother， and fetal metastasis has a poor prognostic factor for the fetus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. In most cases placental metastasis is limited to the intervillous space；**\n\n【28】**however， there are cases reporting the villous invasion of cancer， placing the fetus at risk for involvement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. There has only been one reported case of abruption from placental metastasis， which was from cancer of unknown primary associated with disseminated intravascular coagulation. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. In our case， the patient lacked major risk factors for abruption， including smoking， hypertension， pre-eclampsia， alcohol use， cocaine use， trauma， thrombophilia， or previous thromboembolism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. Although a slightly increased risk of abruption exists in women over 35 years old， the abnormal cells at the abruption site suggest aggressive cancer as the cause of abruption.**\n\n【29】**Conclusion**\n\n【30】**Ultimately， it is predicted that more women will be affected by malignancy in pregnancy. Although rare，there is a risk for metastatic involvement of the placenta that can affect both mother and fetus. Microscopic examination of the placenta is important in all cases of abruption， especially in the setting of women with known or prior cancer. Chemotherapy remains a suitable and relatively safe option in women after the 1 trimester. Breast complaints during pregnancy are common， but they should be thoroughly evaluated as there is a notable delay in diagnosis of breast cancer in pregnant women.**\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**1\\.

According to the World Health Organization， the number of disabilities and deaths caused by PD is higher than any other neurological disorder. That nearlyone million Americans are living with PD. Most evidence suggests that the disease affects nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons in the basal ganglia and produces less dopamine， which causes movement problems associated with PD. The classic PD motor features cardinal symptoms of bradykinesia， cogwheel-like rigidity， tremor at rest， and postural instability. Treatment is symptomatic and there is no treatment to prevent progression of the disease \\[1，2\\].**\n\n【10】**Case Presentation**\n\n【11】**The patient is a 64-year-old female who presents to the emergency department with seizure and consciousness disturbance. She was diagnosed with PD at the age of 51， received regular medication (Madopar， Switane， Bromocriptine， Lexapro， Lexotan)， and got well-controlled. This was accompanied by decreased tendon reflexes and rigidity of four limbs， resting tremor， bradykinesia， and progressive change with wheelchair bound since 2019/02. The Hoehn and Yahr Scale was from stage IV to V. According to her family， she has frequent tremors， sweating and trismus episodes about twice a day after COVID-19 pneumonia in May 2022. On outpatient Examination Electroencephalography (EEG) on September 2022， showed diffuse background slowing，predominantly at 7 Hz to 8 Hz， and frequent sharp waves in the right temporal. In October2022， she has discharged from our hospital for bloodstream infection and urinary tract infection. During admission， intermittent seizure episode without consciousness change was noted， and Valproic acid was prescribed. The EEG was followed and showed excessive beta activity (14 Hz to18 Hz) in the frontal area， but no epileptiform discharge. However， a seizure was noted again and consciousness disturbance (E2 V2 M4) and the patient came to our ER. Desaturation and bilateral pneumonia were noted， intubation was performed， and she was transferred to the intensive care unit for further management.**\n\n【12】**At admission， intermittent generalized tonic-clonic seizures developed and fluctuated consciousness level， which subside after Lorazepam injection. The lumbar puncture was performed， CSF routine and panel of meningitis pathogens showed no evidence of CNS infection. Bloodstream with Corynebacterium species infection and sputum FilmArray concern of MDR K. pneumonia ESBL， Carbapenem wass prescribed as ID physician recommendation. Bronchoscopy was performed， and the final sputum report Burkholderia cepacia complex (Meropenem MIC 1 mg/L). We kept catheter free due to urinary tract infection with Escherichia coli (only Amikacin MIC 16mg/L). The cEEG was performed showed no epileptiform discharge. Because of the generalized dyskinesia in the cluster and intermittent agitation， we already gave her Lorazepam， charged the AEDs to Briviact with Lacosamide， tapered Madopar， and added Biperiden regularly， but to no avail. Under the impression of time-locked to Levodopa administration， we discontinued Levodopa and titrated Biperiden， but no response was noted. We then titrated a low dose Midazolam infusion， and her consciousness returned to clearness. Yo-yoing or biphasic dyskinesia was suspected，and Amantadine， Neupro patch and low dose Clozapine were administrated. The patient showed no more motor complications in the recent 72 h and we discontinued Briviact. However， an episode of involuntary movement with alert consciousness was detected， it was resolved 10 mins after the infusion of Lorazepam.HLA-B typing revealed that the patient was not a carrier of the warning gene， and we switched Lacosamide to Trileptal. The patient passed the weaning test and was extubated with smooth respiratory pattern.**\n\n【13】**Discussion**\n\n【14】**Uncontrollable movement disorders associated with the use of certain medications， especially the side effects of anti-psychiatric drugs， include dyskinesia and akathisia. Parkinsons disease is the best-known movement disorder， causing recurrent involuntary movements without disturbance of consciousness. Dyskinesia is characterized by short， twisting movements ofthe face，mouth，fingers， or extremities.

Our patient’s clinical manifestations include unusual movements， mouth twisting， writhing movements of the four limbs， tightly closed eyes， and sweating. The movements may resemble tics corresponding to dyskinesia.**\n\n【15】**Ahlskog and Muenter 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u> reported in a meta-analysis that patients who received levodopa treatment for 4 to 6 vears had about40% motor fluctuations and up to 90% median dyskinesia when treated for 9 years. In advanced disease stages of the disease， the therapeutic window of levodopa becomes narrower and the major of patients develop motor complications， which are especially more common in young onset PD. We need to reduce the levodopa to preserve the levels and avoid treatment complications such as motor and nonmotor fluctuations and Levodopa-Induced Dyskinesia (LID). Long-term motor complications of levodopa therapy were response fluctuations (hypokinetic phenomena) and involuntary movements(hyperkinetic phenomena)， such as yo-yoing or diphasic dyskinesia通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6-8\\]</u>.

Drug-induced AKI is a common phenomenon of Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR)， but azithromycin-induced AKI is a rare event.**\n\n【13】**Case Report： A 76-year elderly patient came to our hospital with the history of breathing difficulty with wheezing， tightness of the chest and low grade fever. He was admitted in the general Intensive Care Unit (ICU). On the admission day， his urine output was normal with normal serum creatinine level， but there was no history of defecation in the last 48 hrs before admission. On the second day of ICU-admission， as a prokinetic agent， a single dose of injection azithromycin (1 g， intravenously) was administered to him. On the following day， his serum creatinine level was raised sharply (2.1mg/dL) and renal output reduced to 27 mL/hr. Azithromycin was suspected for that event and stopped immediately. On the next day， his serum creatinine level was reduced remarkable (1.2 mg/dL) and urine output was normalized (45 mL/hr).**\n\n【14】**Conclusion： Nephrotoxic drugs generally contribute in developing AKI but to date， azithromycin is considered as a safe drug. However， azithromycin-induced AKI is an unusual event and caution should be taken in use.**\n\n【15】**Keywords： Acute kidney injury； Azithromycin； Nephrotoxic drugs**\n\n【16】**Introduction**\n\n【17】**Acute Kidney Injury (AKI)， also termed as acute renal failure or acute renal insufficiency， is a condition of abrupt renal function deterioration based on depletion of renal creatinine clearance with reduced renal output. AKI is associated with increased rate of mortality and complications in patients' disease states and associated therapeutics 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. In hospital settings， 20% AKI episodes are occurred by drugs and in adult patients，66% drug-induced AKI incidences were recorded \\[2，3\\].**\n\n【18】**Azithromycin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic of macrolide class and indicated in common bacterial infections mostly in upper and lower respiratory tracts， and also in sexually transmitted diseases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Worldwide， azithromycin as a well-tolerated drug， prescribed for both children and adults. Acute nephrotoxicity due to azithromycin in different age groups is a very unusual context and this is a rare Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR) criterion of azithromycin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. In this case， we found an azithromycin-induced AKI event in an elderly patient.**\n\n【19】**Case Presentation**\n\n【20】**A 76-year elderly patient came to our hospital because of his history of breathing difficulty with wheezing， tightness of the chest and low grade fever. He had previous history of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Diseases (COPD)， diabetes mellitus， hypothyroidism and systemic hypertension. He was admitted at general intensive care unit (ICU)，immediately. His SpO2 was 88% in room air and was undertaken mechanical ventilation support， immediately. At the time of admission， his body temperature was 101.3°F， blood pressure was 160/90 mmHg， pulse rate was 105 beats/min， heart rate was 115 beats/min，respiration rate was 24 breaths/min，random blood sugar was 7.4 mmol/L， serum creatinine level was 0.8 mg/dL， urea was 66 mg/dL， Serum albumin was 2.5 mg/dL， TCO2was 24 and normal serum electrolyte levels. His leukocytes count was 12.6 K/uL of blood. After intubation，his Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) was recorded as E 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u>，V(T)and M 通用删除7(英):<u>(5)</u>. His bowel sound was very sluggish and defecation was absent for the last 48 hrs before admission. His urine output was 60 mL/hr.**\n\n【21】**For this hyperthermia management， he was treated with injection acetaminophen(1 g，intravenously，8-hourly). He also received human albumin (25%/100 mL， intravenously， 12-hourly)， Levosulbutamol/Ipratropium nebulization， Levothyroxin (50 ug， orally， 24-hourly) and amlodipine/atenolol (50 mg+5 mg， orally， 24-hourly). On his second day of admission， there was no significant change in his biochemical test reports. On that day， as a prokinetic agent， he was administered with a single dose of injection azithromycin (1g， intravenously). On the next day， there was no significant change observed in his biochemical test reports but the serum creatinine level was abruptly raised to 2.1 mg/dL. Urine output was reduced to 27mL/hr and AKI was determined. The only newly added azithromycin was suspected for this adverse event and stopped. On the next day， his serum creatinine level was reduced to 1.2 mg/dL and urine output again increased to 45 mL/hr. During the rest of his ICU stay time，he was not experienced with AKI again. No other drug's involvement was observed to that AKI event except azithromycin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.**\n\n【22】**Description**\n\n【23】**ADR is an unpleasant medication-associated injury that can be developed with the regular dose of a prescribed medication and AKI is one of the most common consequences of ADR 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.AKI is associated with increased mortality rates range between 25-80 percent and anomalous treatment outcomes \\[1，7\\]. Multifactorial causes are the basis of developing AKI events and additionally， several known and unknown patient-specific factors contribute in developing AKI. Drug-induced AKI is a common phenomenon for some drugs such as， Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAID)， several antimicrobials and different chemotherapeutic agents 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Multiple studies found that a drug becomes nephrotoxic with its one or more pathogenic mechanisms and these mayinclude inflammation，tubular cell toxicity， altered intraglomerular hemodynamics， thrombotic microangiopathy and crystal nephropathy. However， the drug-specific mechanisms are very crucial to recognize and to identify the real facts behind an event 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Patient-oriented risk factors sometimes enhance the possibility of developing AKI and these may include age over 60 years； diseases such as， diabetes， heart failure， septic shock， volume depletion and underlying renal insufficiency 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. In case of admitted patients， a sudden raise in serum creatinine level within 48hours indicates a predisposition to AKI which is completely justified by its definition. To identify an AKI event， the most popular method is to compare the previous serum creatinine level with the current serum creatinine level and this also express the duration as well as the intensity of an AKI event 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.**\n\n【24】**Azithromycin is considered as one of the safe antibiotics of the macrolide group and because of having broad spectrum coverage with good patient-safety profile， azithromycin was the best-selling antibiotic in the United States in 2012 according to IMS Institute for Health Informatics market data 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.**\n\n【25】**In spite of having efficient therapeutic outcomes of azithromycin worldwide， study found that azithromycin causes interstitial nephritis and this may be resulted in persistent renal injury 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. In this case， we found that administration of azithromycin resulted in increased serum creatinine level which clearly identified an AKI event， and later on， in a reversible manner， serum creatinine level reduced to the normal level just after discontinuing azithromycin and restored the kidney functions again. In our case， we assume that azithromycin played one or more notorious mechanism(s) in that elderly patient. We believe that some further studies are also required to evaluate the potentiality of azithromycin to develop AKI with or without one or multiple risk factors.**\n\n【26】**Conclusion**\n\n【27】**Azithromycin is a well established drug of choice in the treatment of respiratory tract infection. However， in elderly patient as one of the patient-associated risk factors， azithromycin may develop a reversible acute kidney injury. The complete mechanism behind this adverse event is still unclear but some studies justified it as azithromycin-induced interstitial nephritis. So， patient-monitoring should be performed carefully when using azithromycin specially， in elderly patients.**\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>1\\.

If not managed appropriately it can lead to chronic pain and suffering. This case report presents a 55-year-old postman who was seen in the clinic complaining of persistent pain over the instep of his right foot with no history of trauma. His pain was localized to the first metatarsophalangeal joint with some radiation to the heel. MRI revealed an isolated avulsion fracture ofthe first metatarsal， which was initially missed on X-ray. In this case， the patient was successfully treated with a mixture of steroid and local anesthetic injections. Following our intervention， the Manchester Oxford Foot Questionnaire reduced from 33 to 0. The goal of this article is to raise awareness of this rare finding for doctors who may face this in A&E， Orthopedic clinics or at a GP practice.**\n\n【12】**Keywords： Avulsion fracture； Peroneus longus； Conservative management**\n\n【13】**Introduction**\n\n【14】**An isolated fracture of the peroneus longus tendon at the base of thelst metatarsal joint is a rare entity often unable to diagnose using X-ray upon the initial presentation. There is no gold standard treatments by which these injuries can be managed. Various case reports have shown where surgeons have used a combination of their own personal preference and the clinical picture in front ofthem. Management options vary from conservative using a lower leg cast 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u> and restricted physical exertion with regular follow up 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. In the case of failed conservative management we must also consider surgery which includes percutaneous fixation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>， or excision of the non-healed fracture fragment and arthrodesis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. This case therefore possesses both a diagnostic and management challenge to doctors who face it.**\n\n【15】**Case Presentation**\n\n【16】**This case report brings to light a 55-years-old postman who presented to clinic with pain in his right foot for over two months. The pain was confined to the right first metatarsophalangeal joint with occasional radiation to instep and over the heel. This pain was in association with occasional cramping in his right calf muscle and was aggravated by standing or walking and relieved at rest. There was no history of trauma to his foot and this pain was insidious in onset.**\n\n【17】**Upon examination he was able to stand erect with plantigrade feet. There was a prominent bunion over the right foot. Both heels were in normal valgus alignment and went into varus on standing at the tip of toes.**\n\n【18】**Further examination revealed the patient was tender over the posteromedial aspect of calf just above the heel and as well as at the knot of Henry. It was noted that the pain got worse on hyperextension at the first metatarsophalangealjoint. The patient also had hallux valgus of moderate degree that was partially correctable. The affected foot itself demonstrated a satisfactory range of motion at the ankle， subtalar， mid foot and forefoot. The distal neurovascular status was found to be unremarkable.**\n\n【19】**Based on this examination the initial impression was tendinosis of the flexor hallucis longus. To confirm this diagnosis and rule out any other bony injury an MRI scan was requested of the right foot and ankle. Imaging revealed an avulsion of peroneus longus tendon at base of first metatarsal with a possible non-union as well .**\n\n【20】**This case was further discussed in the regional foot and ankle meeting. The outcome was to inject the painful nonunion located at the base of the 1st metatarsal on the plantar surface of the foot with**\n\n【21】**Figure 1： T1 sagittal view showing non union of the avulsion fracture.**\n\n【22】**Figure 2： T2 sagittal view showing non union of the avulsion fracture.**\n\n【23】**Figure 3： Coronal T2 view showing the non union of the 1 metatarsal avulsion fracture.**\n\n【24】**a mixture of local anesthetic and steroid injections. Post-procedure there remained no neurovascular deficit. The patient was reviewed at three months and his pain score and functional outcome improved significantly. Moreover following our intervention， the Manchester Oxford Foot Questionnaire (MOXFQ) reduced from 33 to 0. At the one year follow up he remained symptom free and discharged.**\n\n【25】**Discussion**\n\n【26】**The peroneus longus tendon has a role in eversion and plantar flexion of foot along with providing stabilization to arches of foot 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The pattern of injury to this tendon is based on two factors one is the mechanism of insult， if injured， and second is the variation in the insertion pattern of peroneus longus tendon itself. The common agreed mechanism of injury is forced dorsiflexion and inversion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.**\n\n【27】**Moreover， the shear tensile force on the peroneus longus tendon is also considered as a contributory factor to injury 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. During cadaveric dissection a variation in tendon insertion has also been identified which includes insertion at the lateral aspect of cuboid and lateral aspect of calcaneum， fifth metatarsal bone and fibular trochlea of calcaneum as well 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.**\n\n【28】**Although both operative and conservative methods of treatment have been documented in the literature with a variability of success rates， the choice varies on the type of injury， treating surgeon and most importantly the patient. There are some notable factors which do favor non-operativetreatment compared to surgery. These in volve the size and displacement of fracture. Studies show small fragments or minimally displaced， undisplaced or multi fragmental fracture patterns will do better with non-operative treatment \\[21.**\n\n【29】**Hodor et aldescribes a non-weight bearing strategy of conservative treatment as a choice of regimen for this type of injury however， Zematten et al. findings were not supportive of this therapy as they were of the view that patient will represent with a painful non-union at six months and will require excision of the bony fragment along with arthrodesis following a trial conservative treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.**\n\n【30】**Literature regarding the role of physiotherapy in relation to these injuries is limited and at the moment there are no specific guidelines in practice. Some researchers have claimed to treat chronic ankle pain in patients following multiple subtle injuries to their joint by means of physiotherapy to provide an improved functional ability 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.**\n\n【31】**Conclusion**\n\n【32】**To conclude isolated avulsion fracture of peroneus longus tendon insertion are rare injuries and it is important to be aware of such injuries when patients present with pain over the instep. Mixed injections of local anesthesia and steroids was a successful way of managing un-united avulsion fracture ofperoneus longus in this case however it is important to always take patient selection and clinical judgment into account in managing such injuries.**\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**1\\.

Wide excision with proper margin is still as the main modality of treatment for Malignant Phyllodes Tumor. Large postoperative defects will be a challenge for surgeons in reconstructing the chest wall after excision. Thoracoabdominal flap is one of the preferred techniques for closing the defect of breast surgery in countries with limited resources such as in Southeast Asia. This technique is relatively easy and has low complication rate.**\n\n【10】**Case Report： A 42-year-old woman complains of a lump in her right breast that reappeared after breast surgery one year ago. We performed a wide excision of this tumor with a margin of 2 cm and the defect was closed using a Thoracoabdominal flap. Patients have been re-educated about the importance of postoperative radiotherapy.**\n\n【11】**Keywords： Malignant phyllodes tumor；Thoracoabdominal flap； Recidive**\n\n【12】**Introduction**\n\n【13】**Phyllodes tumor is a fibroepithelial neoplasm of the mammary gland. This tumor is quite rare in the community. Muller， in 1838 reported that the prevalence ranged from 0.3% to 0.8% of all breast tumors in women. Meanwhile， Parker， in 2001， stated that the prevalence of this tumor is less than1% of all breast neoplasms. The literature states that 10% to 30% of cases of Phyllodes tumors are found to be malignant \\[1，2\\].**\n\n【14】**Malignant Phyllodes Tumor has potential to be recidive and metastatic. Surgical treatment with a wide excision technique is the best option in treating this tumor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. This procedure has an impact in the form of a large postoperative defect， so this will pose a challenge for surgeons to reconstruct the chest wall. Thoracoabdominal flap can be one of the surgeon's options in the closure of large postoperative defects of the breast. Rao et al. in 2015 reported that the Thoracoabdominal flap has the same ability as skin grafts in closing large defects， but with capability to shortening operating time， have less bleeding， and good healing results. Patients can also undergo radiotherapy after defect closure is done 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.**\n\n【15】**Presented in this case report is our treatment of Recidive Malignant Phyllodes Tumor with extensive postoperative defects. Thoracoabdominal flap was chosen as a method of closing the defect with consideration of its effectiveness and good results.**\n\n【16】**Case Presentation**\n\n【17】**_Citation：_**\n\n【18】**A 42-years-old woman came to our clinic with complains of a lump that reappeared in the right chest for 1 month ago. The lump appeared on the surgical scar initially measured 1 cm ×1 cmx1cm and rapidly growing in 1 month to 10 cmx10 cmx8 cm. The lump is painful， ulcerated， and bleeds.**\n\n【19】**From her history， the patient complained of a right breast lump appearing initially four years ago. The lump was located under the skin with enlarged veins on its surface， slowly growing and there were no ulcers on the surface. The patient underwent a simple right-sided mastectomy 1 year ago at district hospital and the histopathological examination revealed as a Malignant Phyllodes Tumor. The patient was advised to undergo postoperative radiotherapy， but she refused to do it because of financial problem. Four months after surgery， a lump reappeared on the right chest. It was stated that the tumor has been recidive. Regional lymph node examination， thoracic radiology and abdominal ultrasonography did not show any metastatic process .**\n\n【20】**The patient underwent wide excision with a free margin of 2 cm from the recidive tumor by**\n\n【21】**Figure 1： Preoperative clinical picture and excision design.**\n\n【22】**pectoralis major muscle.**\n\n【23】**Figure 3： Final closure of surgical defect with Thoracoabdominal Flap (a) and 6th day post operation wound condition (b).**\n\n【24】**including a previous surgical scar to prevent a recurrence. The operation took only 120 min. Surgical removal of the tumor is done by excisioning the pectoralis major muscle at the base of the tumor because of infiltration process of tumor . A rhombus-shaped postoperative defect was laid with an area of 440 cm’ on the right chest. We performed a Thoracoabdominal flap to close this wide defect. The flap consists of two components： the right side， and the left side. The skin on the inferior side of the defect is divided in half and an incision is made downward along the width of the defect， then continues to divide to the right and left. Those two skin flaps were raised superiorly and used to cover the surgical defect. The abdominal flap defect was closed primarily by bringing the right and left sides closer together. We also put two vacuum drains in the operating area to collect fluids and blood after surgery . The patient has been evaluated at the surgical outpatient clinic on the sixth day**\n\n【25】**Figure 4： Laterally and Medially based TA Flap.**\n\n【26】**after operation. There were no complaints of fever， pain， or surgical infection. The flap was assessed as viable and there was no necrotic area on the wound. The results of histopathological examination revealed a Malignant Phyllodes Tumor of the breast and the tumor cells were no longer found in all excision margin. The patient was educated and scheduled to undergo radiotherapy.**\n\n【27】**Discussion**\n\n【28】**A Phyllodes Tumor is a tumor that is quite rare in the community. These tumors are classified histopathologically into 3 groups： Benign， borderline， and malignant. Anderson Cancer Center in 2012 reported the incidence of Phyllodes Tumor based on histopathology was58% for benign tumors， 12% for borderline tumors， and 30% for malignant tumors. Benign and borderline Phyllodes tumors never recur once the tumor has been completely excised (with tumor-free incision margin). Meanwhile， Malignant Phyllodes Tumors require more aggressive treatment because of the high risk of recurrence and metastasis. The recurrence rate of this tumor was recorded at 14% to21%\\[1，4，5\\]. Surgery is the main treatment for Malignant Phyllodes Tumor. Surgeon can decide between wide excision with safety margin1 cm or simple mastectomy in manage this tumor. Those treatments will leave wide surgical defect which become a surgeon's attention after excision.**\n\n【29】**Broad and radical excision of the breast will leave a large defect so that primary closure usually cannot be performed. Various methods have become the surgeon's choice to reconstruct this wide defect， such as Skin Graft technique， Cutaneous flaps (ex： Thoracoabdominal Flap， Thoracoepigastric Flap， Bilateral Advancement Flap)， and Myocutaneous flaps (ex： Latissimus Dorsi Flap and Transverse Rectus Abdominis Myocutaneous Flap). The Thoracoabdominal flap (TA flap) was originally introduced by Brown in 1975. However， this flap becameless popular after the Myocutaneous flap has been introduced in 1985\\[3，6，7\\].**\n\n【30】**In principle， the TA flap is a rotational-advancement flap of skin and fascia. This flap has two bases of pivot point： The medial base and the lateral base. The medial base blood flow comes from the superior deep epigastric perforating artery， whereas the lateral base blood flow comes from branches of superficial lumbar，subcostal， intercostal and thoracic arteries. The TA flap with a medial base is also known as the Thoracoepigastric Flap (TE Flap). The two flap bases are mirrors of each other， as shown in Figure 4 \\[3，7-9\\].**\n\n【31】**Srinivasa 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u> stated that the TA Flap procedure in post-mastectomy defects in case of locally advanced breast cancer will give satisfactory results. The TA flap is considered easy to perform for surgeons who are not familiar with myocutaneous flap procedures. This flap is not only easier but also faster healing than skin graft**\n\n【32】**technique. Patients can immediately undergo radiotherapy for local control after the TA flap wound has healed. This flap is also useful in developing countries with limited resources because surgeon needs no expensive equipment \\[3，7-9\\].**\n\n【33】**Das and Choudhury 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u> in 2013 reported that 1 in 20 patients(5%) who underwent TA flap surgery in cases of locally advanced breast cancer experienced complications such as wound dehiscence. These complications can be managed directlywith secondary suturing and wound closure. The study explained that the majority of patients were able to go home from the hospital on 3 to 4 postoperative days and underwent radiotherapy with good results. There was no recurrence in 18 months after surgery. It can be concluded that the TA flap procedure is simple，low-cost， and provides good tolerance for radiotherapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.**\n\n【34】**Deo et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u> in 2003 has conducted research comparing TA flaps to Myocutaneous flaps (LD and TRAM flaps) in breast cancer cases. The TA flap requires a shorter operating time， shorter hospital stay， and significantly minimal risk of blood loss compared to the Myocutaneous flap. The morbidity and risk of local recurrence were not significantly different. The study concluded that the TA flap may be the first choice in patients with extensive post-mastectomy defects \\[8，9\\]. Joo Seok's study stated that the TA flap had a faster recovery time than the TE flap. Baroudi et al. wrote that TE flap was hemodynamically weak and fragile because of tissue tension on vascular. The risk of necrosis at the end of the flap is high. If this morbidity occurs， the patient must be re-debrided and followed by a skin graft to close the defect. However， this was disputed by Burattini et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u> who conducted a study on the safety and viability of the TE flap. In this study， it was found that the risk of dehiscence was only 7%. Persichetti stated that the TA flap is very useful in post-mastectomy breast defects with an area of less than 600 cm \\[2，3，7，10，11\\].**\n\n【35】**In our patient， we modified the TA flap by dividing the flap into2 sides at the inferior defect. This flap is a combination of the TA flap on the lateral side and the TE flap on the medial side. We made this modification to provide free skin mobility and to minimize necrotic risk of tissue. Both of the TA Flap base will gain vascular supply maximally with minimal tissue traction.Nowadays， there is no consensus about surgical technique to close post-mastectomy defect. It depends on the experience of the surgeon， patient preferences， facilities， and the size of the defect. However， it is universally recognized that myocutaneous flaps are still better than cutaneous flaps in terms of reducing the risk of necrosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.**\n\n【36】**Conclusion**\n\n【37】**Closure of the breast excision defect using a Thoracoabdominal flap may be an option for a surgeon who is not familiar with**\n\n【38】**performing myocutaneous flaps in chest wall reconstruction. This technique has ability to minimize duration of operation， cost， has rapid healing time， and simple to do by a general surgeon. We have described in this case report about our experience in treating of Recidive Malignant Phyllodes Tumor with a Thoracoabdominal Flap as defect closure technique.**\n\n【39】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【40】通用结尾删除-1:<u>1\\.

Finding the characteristic manifestations oftuberculosis， such as pulmonary miliary nodules， would be helpful for diagnosis.**\n\n【17】**Introduction**\n\n【18】**Although coronavirus disease 2019 has caused millions of deaths worldwide， Tuberculosis (TB) remains the most common cause of death 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1-3\\]</u>. TB treatment protocols have not changed for many years， ensuring a cure rate of >90% once diagnosed. However， due to its low detection rate， many patients with TB do not complete standardized treatment， thereby increasing the proportion of Multidrug-Resistant TB (MDR-TB) cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. As such， the early and accurate diagnosis of TB is important for management.**\n\n【19】**Typical TB can be diagnosed almost accurately via radiography and Computed Tomography(CT). In contrast， when imaging findings are atypical or the patient has multiple disease conditions， the differential diagnosis can be difficult 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. In this article， we describe the 'F-Fluorodeoxyglucose(F-FDG) Positron Emission Tomography and Computed Tomography (PET/CT) findings in a patient with TB， who showed thickened mucosa of the nasal cavity and ethmoid sinus， as well as systemic lymph node enlargement and pulmonary TB， which resembled lymphoma. A brief overview of the differential diagnosis and presentation ofrelevant literature is also provided.**\n\n【20】**Case Report**\n\n【21】**A 25-year-old male presented with a month-long history of swollen cervical and axillary lymph nodes. Chest and abdominal CT scan showed multiple small nodules with increased density in both lungs and multiple enlarged lymph nodes in the axilla， subclavian chain， mediastinum， and retroperitoneum. Lymphomatous lung infiltration was initially considered. PET/CT examination revealed mucosal thickening of the nasal cavity and ethmoid sinus， diffuse and unevenly distributed small nodules in both lungs， and multiregional lymphadenopathy in the whole body， with varying degrees of hypermetabolism (SUVmax=10.2-18.6).Lymph node lesions without obvious necrosis were the main manifestations in this case. Furthermore， the metabolism of the respiratory nodules was not as high as that of whole-body lymph nodes. Following cervical lymph node biopsy， our initial assessment of lymphoma with pulmonary involvement was revised to TB .**\n\n【22】**Figure 1A： 18F-FDG PET/CT in a 25-year-old male with systemic TB： Hypermetabolic mucosal thickening of the nasal cavity and ethmoid sinus (SUVmax=16.7).**\n\n【23】**Figure 1B： 18F-FDG PET/CT in a 25-year-old male with systemic TB： Miliary nodules in both lungs (SUVmax=2.2-12.8).**\n\n【24】**Discussion**\n\n【25】**Pulmonary TB and extrapulmonary TB of the brain， joints， urinary， liver， and gastrointestinal tract， among others， are known**\n\n【26】**manifestations of TB infection. Particularly， localized or systemic TB of the lungs and lymph nodes are the most common 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6-14\\]</u>. For the early detection of such cases， IF-FDG-PET-CT has been known to be very sensitive， but its lack of specificity is a major limitation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.**\n\n【27】Figure 1C： 18F-FDG PET/CT in a 25-year-old male with systemic TB： Systemic lymph node enlargement (SUVmax=16.8).\n\n【28】Figure 1D： 18F-FDG PET/CT in a 25-year-old male with systemic TB： Intermuscular lymph nodes of the lower extremities (SUVmax=13.9).\n\n【29】**Extra Nodal NK/T-Cell Lymphoma，Nasal Type (ENKTCL-NT)， is another common condition that often manifests as nasal mucosal thickening and increased metabolism；locallymph node enlargement may be associated. PET/CT is the gold standard for the diagnosis and clinical staging of ENKTCL-NT and plays a role in prognostication通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. In comparison， although Mycobacterium tuberculosis could**\n\n【30】**adhere to the extracellular matrix in areas of mucosal damage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>， primary TB of the head and neck mucosa is rare 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. Moreover， the localized inflammation is often observed with inflammation in cervical lymph nodes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. The case we described was very similar to lymphoma； however， cervical lymph node biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of TB. In retrospect， nasal lymphoma generally does not**\n\n【31】**Figure 2： Microscopically， the granulomatous lesion showed caseous necrosis in the center， which is surrounded by more epithelioid cells and a few multinucleated giant cells. The autermost area shows fibraus hyperplasia and lymphocyte infiltration (hematoxylin and easin stain， H&E，x100).**\n\n【32】**present with diffusely enlarged lymph nodes throughout the body and miliary nodules in the lungs. Therefore， the possibility of TB should also be considered when nasal polyps are found.**\n\n【33】**Most cases of primary pulmonary TB present as consolidations， miliarynnodulesS，小1lymphadenopathies，and pleuiral effusions. Meanwhile， miliary TB may present with acute or chronic lung nodules， and may involve multiple organs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. Although PET/CT has certain advantages in assessing TB activity and guiding biopsy localization 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>， malignant lymphoma may mimic miliary TB due to diffuse micronodular radiographic findings 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. However， it should be noted that miliary nodules are still characteristic of pulmonary TB. In this case， bilateral pulmonary nodules were not typical of acute or chronic miliary nodules， systemic diffuse enlargedlymphadenopathy， thickened nasal mucosa， and hypermetabolism. As such， we mistook these findings as lymphoma with pulmonary infiltration. Thus， pulmonary miliary nodules should be the main diagnostic basis of this disease.**\n\n【34】**Systemic lymph node enlargement is typical of lymphoma and should be distinguished from TB lymphadenitis and necrotizing lymphadenitis \\[21，22\\]. In addition， imaging findings in TB vary at different stages of the disease. For example， the images of granulomatous formation are mostly solid nodules or masses without obvious necrosis and calcification， which may involve multiple parts. Granulomas may appear hypermetabolic due to the presence of many active macrophages that take up F-FDG， making these lesions indistinguishable from tumors. In this case， lymph nodes showed increased FDG uptake without signs of significant necrosis， representing the acute active phase of TB. Because of these factors， we misdiagnosed the case as lymphoma with pulmonary involvement.**\n\n【35】**Given these ffindings， radiologists and nuclear medicine physicians should be familiar with the imaging findings of pulmonary TB 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>， especially since the differential diagnosis mainly relies on the morphological features of CT combined with metabolic character assessment and clinical data.**\n\n【36】**Conclusion**\n\n【37】**Imaging findings in TB are variable.ISF-FDG-PET/CT is sensitive for the early detection of TB but lacks specificity in distinguishing TB from lymphoma. However， BF-FDG PET/CT played an important**\n\n【38】**role in assessment of systemic lesions and guiding the treatment of this patient. For similar cases in the future， TB should be included in the differential diagnosis， and the final diagnosis should still be based on pathological examination. For this case， the patient was treated for TB and is now considered cured and TB-free.**\n\n【39】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**Acknowledgment**</u>\n\n【40】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**We would like to thank our patient for allowing us to share his case and Editage www.editage.cn for English language editing.**</u>\n\n【41】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**Author Contributions**</u>\n\n【42】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**Yongjun Luo： collection of patient data and writing-original draft preparation， Yuping Han and Xie yijing： manuscript modification， Furong Wang： image data processing Junlin Zhou： manuscript proofreading； All the authors individually did final proofreading of the manuscript before submission.**</u>\n\n【43】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**Ethical Approval**</u>\n\n【44】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**This paper does not contain any research on animals by any of the authors.

Evaluation of pancreatic enzymes did not show a constant trend， and had 3 times microscopic hematuria， an obvious pancreatic inflammation was observed in CT scans. Patient was diagnosed with acute necrotizing pancreatitis. There was no definite cause for patient’s pancreatitis， except for the recent use of herbal drug (containing Ginsengcompounds) for weight gain that taking it 10 days before the onset of symptoms has started and then stopped. Since the patient's symptom gradually decreased by stopping the drug， probably drug-induced pancreatitis is to be present.**\n\n【15】**Keywords： Acute Necrotizing Pancreatitis； Ginseng Compounds； Hematuria**\n\n【16】**Introduction**\n\n【17】**Pancreatitis is a pancreatic inflammation that including two types， acute and chronic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Acute Pancreatitis (AP) includes a wide range of diseases， from its low-risk symptoms to a fulminant process with multiple organ damage and high mortality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.**\n\n【18】**The incidence of AP has increased over the past 20 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Common symptoms of AP include nausea and vomiting， and the abdominal pain that mostly spreads to the back. AP has different causes， some of which include： gallstones， alcohol consumption， hypercalcemia， hyperlipidemia， idiopathic， autoimmune， and anatomic (pancreas divisum)， infection， tumors and drug-induced. AP can be recurrent. Multiple and recurrent attacks of AP can lead to chronic pancreatitis， which can ultimatelylead to pancreatic insufficiency. AP has various complications， one of the most severe complications is necrotizing pancreatitis， which is due to tissue ischemic and necrosis and has high mortality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Here we describe the case of a young woman with acute necrotizing pancreatitis induced by Ginseng compounds administration. Necrotizing pancreatitis has a very poor prognosis and is associated with high mortality (15%)， which， if infected， can reach up to 30% to 39%， which is the major cause of mortality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Intervention is generally required for infected pancreatic necrosis and less commonly in patients with sterile necrosis who are symptomatic (gastric or duodenal outlet or biliary obstruction). Fever， elevated white blood cell count， and abdominal pain suggest infection of this fluid， and percutaneous aspiration is confirmatory. Percutaneous drainage and IV administration of antibiotics should be instituted if infection is present.**\n\n【19】**Case Presentation**\n\n【20】**The patient is a 29-year-old Iranian woman that sent to Sina Hospital， Tehran University for further evaluation and treatment from Ilam. The patient’s problems began with the fever and chills intermittently， and then 2 days later， suddenly suffered abdominal pain in the epigastrium， which was persistent and progressive， gradually spreading to the entire abdomen and not radiating anywhere. The patient’s pain was worse with eating and it was not associated with defecation and2 days later， the patient developed another symptom. The symptoms included： non-bloody watery diarrhea， nausea and vomiting， and anorexia， and during the last 通用删除7(英):<u>(3-9)</u> months weight loss was 15kg. There is no history of this problem in the past.**\n\n【21】**Her past medical history was otherwise negative and she had no allergies. She denied alcohol intake or tobacco use. She has a two-time history of cesarean section， which was last two years ago.**\n\n【22】**The only drug used recently was weight gain that contains Ginseng compounds that only consume 10 of them and discontinued with the onset of symptoms.**\n\n【23】**In the family history， cousin's aunt， he has pulmonary tuberculosis.**\n\n【24】**Figure 1： Intraoperative photograph showing seeding.**\n\n【25】**On examination she was febrile (T=39.5)， with a heart rate of 140beats/min， blood pressure was 100/70 mmHg and respiratory rate of18/min.**\n\n【26】**Abdominal examination revealed tenderness and generalized rebound tenderness in epigastrium. There were non-palpable masses and bowel sounds were normal. Lung examination had bilateral rales.**\n\n【27】**In Ilam， a CT scan is performed for the patient， in which the free fluid in the abdomen was reported， with a suspicion of perforated appendicitis，patient was under laparotomy that there was an obvious as cites and seeding that the drain was embedded and the omentum and the multiple point sampling that has been examined twice by the pathologist， which has not been malignancy， also， the sample was examined once by a pathologist in Tehran， which was not been malignancy .**\n\n【28】**After surgery， 2 days were treated with Imipenem， the patient's leukocytosis was 25000， and bilateral pleural effusion was found and the respiratory distress was found， so transferred to the ICU， and in consultation with the professor of Surgery in Sina Hospital in Tehran has provided double-sided chest tube and has been sent to Tehran by Intubation.**\n\n【29】**The patient was admitted to Tehran for about 17 days in ICU， who had 10 days of intubation and had 5 days of C-pap， and was extubated and transferred to the ward after 2 days， during which time she was treated with antibiotics. The patient's leukocytosis was from25000 to 13000， and transferred to the ward.**\n\n【30】**According to the history and physical examination findings， differential diagnosis was made for the patient， which was done to achieve the final diagnosis of paraclinical measures； including， complete lab tests， abdominopelvic ultrasound， CXR， CT scan， endoscopy， colonoscopy， and EUS were performed.**\n\n【31】**Complete Blood Count (CBC diff) was at its onset of 24000leukocytosis with 80% PMN， rising progressively in the course of the disease，and the highest level of 25000， which was found to belowered**\n\n【32】**with antibiotic therapy and reached 6160 on the day of discharge.**\n\n【33】**Patient's differential diagnosis including：Rheumatologic disorders， TB， brucellosis， malaria and in general infectious diseases， lymphoma，Imalignancy， pancreatic dysfunction (necrotizing pancreatitis， pancreatic cancer， andautoimmune _P_ pancreatitis)， thyroid disorders.**\n\n【34】**For rheumatologic disorders， rheumatology tests were performed completely， all of which were negative.

The patient had no symptoms including： coughing， hemoptysis， night sweats.**\n\n【36】**Brucellosis tests were negative. For malaria PBS， it was normal. Viral markers were negative.**\n\n【37】**Forlymphoma and malignancy， tumor markers were checked to be negative， did not have lymphadenopathy and night sweats， and also with suspicion of gastrointestinal cancers， inflammatory bowel disease， endoscopy and colonoscopy were performed. Colonoscopy was normal. Endoscopy was highly suggestive for gastric cancer which was taken biopsy， was chronic gastritis and ulceration， and malignancy was rejected， due to in consistency of endoscopic findings with pathological outcomes， endoscopy was performed again， which， as before， was suspected of stomach cancer， and biopsy， showed only**\n\n【38】**a ulceration .**\n\n【39】**About pancreatic dysfunction， amylase and lipase， liver tests， albumin， and urine analysis were checked several times， the procedure was as follows， and the microscopic hematuria was present in three examinations. Other study performed for the evaluation of the pancreas was CT scan ， which included pancreatic inflammation that CT scan with pancreatic cut was performed for a more accurate evaluation which revealed a pancreatic tail and body inflammation and brief duct dilatation. According to the patient’s CT scan results， EUS was performed， with a normal pancreas reported， and an emphasis on the atypical Crohn’s disease . Thyroid and renal tests were normal.**\n\n【40】**Discussion**\n\n【41】**The most common causes of AP are gallstones alcohol and hyperlipidemia respectively， however， nearly 20% of cases it is idiopathic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.

Recent studies， conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of this therapy，have， almost， proven its weaknesses.

We experienced a case of AP associated with normal serum enzyme levels. Patient was diagnosed based on clinical and radiological evidence. She was successfully treated with intravenous fluids， antibiotic therapy， and radiologic external percutaneous drainage with clinical and laboratory improvement. The importance of this case report is the unlikely presentation of AP. We believe that more research is needed to determine the exact proportion of AP patients who first present with normal serum lipase， since similar cases have been seen in case reports.**\n\n【62】**Conclusion**\n\n【63】**Patients with AP are susceptible to a wide spectrum of diseases：alcoholabuse，cholelithiasis， infection，lesions，tumors，hypercalcemia，**\n\n【64】**hyperlipidemia， and drug-induced. These diseases range from mild self-limiting symptoms to a fulminant process with multiple organ failure and high mortality. The etiologic factors contributing to AP include a wide range with some being rare. Cholelithiasis or sustained alcohol abuse is the factor which attributes to， approximately， 80% of cases12-14.**\n\n【65】**Having stopped the drugs， the symptoms resolved in this patient； this shows that the drug-induced pancreatitis is probably present in her 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>.

Effects of this condition on perinatal outcomes were inconclusive across a broad range of studies. We reviewed the literature on isolated oligohydramnios with perinatal outcomes. Electronic databases like PubMed，CINAHL， Web of Science，EMBASE，and Medline were searched from inception to 2022 using keywords and MeSH terms for perinatal outcomes and isolated oligohydramnios. Observational studies (Cohort， case-control) and systematic review & meta-analysis studies published in English were included. Whereas， letters of personal communications， case reports， and case series were excluded. Studies with singleton and low-risk pregnancy， cephalic presentation， and oligohydramnios (amniotic fluid index ≤5 cm) were included. Exclusion criteria were studies that include pregnancies with fetal malformation， chromosomal anomaly； growth restriction， and interventional drugs. We obtained 557 full texts from electronic databases but only35 articles met the inclusion criteria. The narrative review revealed that an association does not exist between isolated oligohydramnios and low Apgar score， non-reassuring fetal heartbeat pattern， fetal distress， and umbilical artery/vein pH less than 7.1/7.2. However， isolated oligohydramnios is significantly associated with higher rates of labor induction and cesarean sections. Nevertheless， the impact of isolated oligohydramnios on meconium-stained amniotic fluid and neonatal intensive care unit were inconclusive across the finding. Further large-scale follow-up studies are needed to better elucidate the available evidence.**\n\n【10】**Introduction**\n\n【11】**Adequate amniotic fluid volume is a sign of normal placental functioning and it is the most important component of biophysical profile for fetal well-being tests 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1-3\\]</u>. Amniotic Fluid Index(AFI) is the preferred method of amniotic fluid measurement. To measure AFI， the uterus is divided into four equal quadrants. AFI is the sum of the deepest pocket from each quadrant. The normal range of AFI is 5 cm to 24 cm. Any value greater than 24 cm is considered as polyhydramnios and a value below 5 cm is oligohydramnios 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Isolated Oligohydramnios (IO) refers to the presence of oligohydramnios without any fetal and maternal underlying conditions. Globally， IO incidence ranges from 0.5% to 5%\\[5，6\\].**\n\n【12】**Oligohydramnios has been associated with a variety of adverse perinatal outcomes prospective study conducted among 180 pregnant women at 37 to 40 weeks of gestation with IO with an AFI ≤5h percentile associated with low Apgar score and cesarean delivery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Likewise， study conducted among 3，050 women showed oligohydramnios carries an increased risk of adverse perinatal outcome， even in low-risk pregnancies after 40 weeks 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Moreover， study conducted on oligohydramnios at or beyond 34 weeks gestation was showed antepartum oligohydramnios is associated with increased perinatal morbidity and mortality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. A meta-analysis of studies showed an antepartum or intrapartum amniotic fluid index of less than or equal 5.0 cm is significantly increased risk of cesarean delivery for fetal distress and a low Apgar score at 5 min 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Similarly， studies revealed， perinatal death， non-reassuring fetal status， meconium-stained fluid， need for resuscitation， admission to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU)， and risk of Operative Vaginal Deliveries (OVD)\\[11，12\\].**\n\n【13】**However， recent studies showed IO is not associated with fetal growth restriction or an increased risk of adverse perinatal outcomes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Adverse perinatal outcomes were associated with IO due to the higher rates of obstetrical interventions \\[14，15\\]. Additionally， a five retrospective cohort study isolated oligohydramnios showed at term by itself is not associated with increased obstetrical morbidity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>.**\n\n【14】**In contemporary obstetrics， termination is a recommended intervention for term pregnancy complicated with oligohydramnios通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. The time of intervention for IO complicated pregnancy remained controversial. However， clinicians are managing IO as they do for oligohydramnios at term 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. This approach leads to unnecessary obstetric intervention without a benefit 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. Besides， some studies suggested that AFI is not a good predictor of perinatal outcome alone in the case of IO 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. Hence， routine intervention for oligohydramnios at term may not be justified 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>.**\n\n【15】**Findings about the effect of IO on obstetric and perinatal outcomes are inconclusive. Updated evidence on the effect of this condition on adverse outcomes will help health care providers to improve clinical interventions. This narrative review was designed to compare perinatal outcomes related to IO in low-risk singleton pregnancies and normal amniotic fluid volume.**\n\n【16】**Literature Search**\n\n【17】**Studies for this review were obtained from Pub Med， CINAHL， Web of Science， EMBASE， and Medline databases from inception to 2022 published the English language. The following keywords/MeSH terms were used for searching. Amniotic fluid， pregnancy， amniotic fluid index， perinatal outcome， obstetrics outcome， fetal outcome，neonatal outcome， isolated oligohydramnios， induction of labor， cesarean delivery， operative vaginal delivery， mode of delivery， instrumental delivery， Apgar score， non-reassuring fetal status， meconium stained amniotic fluid， meconium aspiration syndrome， perinatal morbidity， perinatal mortality， admission to neonatal intensive care unit， neonatal resuscitation， umbilical artery PH， and fetal weight. The bulian words (AND/OR) were used to combine the aforementioned keywords. Also， the search strategy has been complemented by checking the reference lists of the retrieved articles for additional articles.**\n\n【18】**Study Selection**\n\n【19】**We included observational studies (cohort and case-control) and meta-analysis. Inclusion criteria for this review were articles with a singleton pregnancy， cephalic presentation and define Amniotic Fluid Index (AFI) ≤ 5 cm， and outcomes compared with/without a control group (pregnancies with normal amniotic fluid volume). Exclusion criteria were studies that included pregnancies with fetal malformation， chromosomalanomaly or growth restriction and other obstetric complications. In addition， we excluded studies that did not clearly define the timeframe between measurements of the amniotic fluid index. Letters of personal communications， case reports， case series， and non-English language articles were also excluded.**\n\n【20】**The initial database search returned a total of 557 articles and 8meta-analysis review articles were retained for the narrative review. After the initial electronic database search， 7 additional relevant articles were identified through manual reference and Google searches. Though， this review is synthesized from 35 sources (Figure1). A summary table is presented with study year， study design， sample size， key points， and limitation for the studies include in the review .**\n\n【21】**Findings**\n\n【22】**Isolated oligohydramnios and antepartum feta surveillance**\n\n【23】**Antepartum fetal surveillance is one of the indicators for fetal well-being in utero. IO was associated with an increased risk of**\n\n【24】**abnormal Doppler indices of the umbilical artery， non-reactive for Cardio Topography (CTG) and a non-stress test \\[7，20\\]. Similarly， a prospective matched case-control study revealed deceleration of fetal heart rate was significantly associated with IO 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>. Furthermore， a review of meta-analysis indicated， when oligohydramnios cases were followed using fetal electronic monitoring during labor abnormal findings were detected. For this reason， obstetric interventions were high 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>.**\n\n【25】**Isolated oligohydramnios and maternal outcomes**\n\n【26】**Isolated oligohydramnios and induction of labor： According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG)， diagnosis of oligohydramnios after 37 weeks is an indication for labor induction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. Two prospective cohort studies aimed to evaluate perinatal outcomes in women with IO， depicted a risk of induction Wassignificantly highfor isolated1oligohydramnios\\[23，24. Correspondingly， a prospective case-control study over a period of 21 months from November 2014 to July 2016 was conducted on50 pregnant women complicated with complicated with IO. The result showed increased rate of induction of labor among women complicated with IO 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u>.**\n\n【27】**Furthermore， a retrospective cohort study (IO=987 & normal AFI=22，280) to analyzed the obstetric and perinatal outcome on IO showed higher labor induction among pregnancies complicated with IO 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. Also， IO was associated with significantly higher rates of labor induction as compared to pregnancies of normal amniotic fluid volume for fetal/maternal indications \\[21，26\\]. These findings strengthen by a systemic review and meta-analysis study； in the twelve studies were included with 35，999 women： 2，414(6.7%) with isolated oligohydramnios and 33，585 (93.29%) with normal AFI. Women with isolated oligohydramnios had significantly higher rates of labor induction (OR=7.56， CI： 4.58，12.48)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u>.**\n\n【28】**Retrospective matched case-control study (IO=206， normal AFI=206) showed IO has no significant association with failure to the progress of labor or failed induction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. A retrospective case-control study conducted on 138 women with uncomplicated oligohydramnios (IO) at term (AFI ≤ 5 cm) and a low Bishop score(≤ 6) compared with 67 women at 42 weeks’ gestation underwent induction oflabor showed insignificant difference between the group in induction progress 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>. Similarly， Rainford and Manzanares et al. were reported there were no differences between the two groups in progress of induction of labor \\[15，28\\]. In contrast to these findings， one study reported significantly higher rates of failed induction among preterm gestations presented with IO 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[29\\]</u>. The possible difference might arise from the study included only preterm pregnancy. Moreover， a single study conducted on women with IO required the use of drugs to manage tachysystole/hyperstimulation通用删除6(英):<u>\\[30\\]</u>. Further longitudinal study is needed to accept for the impact. However， study conducted on there was no difference in duration of labor， need for oxytocin， and augmentation between women with IO and normal amniotic fluid index \\[7，31\\].**\n\n【29】**Isolated oligohydramnios and mode of delivery： A meta-analysis showed a higher incidence of obstetric interventions in the IO group (89/657；13.5%) compared with the control group(165/3306；5.0%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. Moreover， pregnancies complicated with IO showed a statistically significant association with operative vaginal delivery \\[15，16\\]. However， a small Randomized Controlled Trial(RCT) showed there were no significant difference in assisted vaginal deliveries 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. The difference might be due to the small sample size**\n\n【30】**Table 1： Summary of studies on adverse abstetric and perinatal outcomes.**\n\n| **Author and year**  | **Design and sample size**  | **Key points**  | **Limitation**  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Fatima Chaudhry etal.2020**  | **Randomized Control Trial** **O=72** **lO (expectant management)=72**  | **IO is not associated with a low Apgar score or MSAF.**  | **Used Chai square test and smallsample size.**  |\n| **Musthaq et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u>**  | **Prospective cohort** **O=70** **Normal AF=140**  | **IO didn't show any statically significant difference in perinataloutcome.**  | **Used Chai square test.**  |\n| **Nefise Nazli et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[31\\]</u>**  | **Prospective case-controlO=159** **Normal AF=165**  | **Io is not associated with a higher rate of cesarean section.**  | **Used Chai square test and inclusion ofpost-term pregnancy for comparison.**  |\n| **Samata Gupta et al.2018**  | **Retrospective case controlO=51** **Normal AF=176**  | **IO is not an indicator of adverse perinatal outcome.**  | **Used Chai square test (it showedweak association).**  |\n| **Neeta Sarma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[38\\]</u>**  | **Prospective case-controlD=100** **Normal AF=300**  | **IO adversely affects the perinatal outcome.

Similarly， a prospective cohort study was carried out in women with isolated oligohydramnios(n=70) and normal pregnancy (n=140))were included. The finding revealed significant number of IO women have undergone emergency caesarian section (X=12.98，p=0.003) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[29\\]</u>. In addition， numerous findings of prospective， retrospective and case control studies depicted women with IO had a higher rate of cesarean delivery compared to women of normal amniotic fluid \\[15-17，21，24-26，33-39\\]. These finding supported by pioneer meta-analysis study which includes eighteen reports (10，551 women) showed， women with IO were associated with a significantly increased risk of cesarean delivery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Likewise， the recent meta-analysis which includes six studies (27，526 women)； women with isolated oligohydramnios were significantly higher rates of Cesarean delivery (RR： 2.16；95% CI； 1.64-2.85)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[40\\]</u>. However， study conducted on 87 women pregnant beyond40 completed weeks showed no significant effect of IO on the risks of CD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>.Moreover， a prospective matched case-control (matched for gestational age and Bishop-score) study conducted on women with IO 120， and normal AFI=116， women with isolated oligohydramnios were not significantly different to the control group 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[30\\]</u>. Similarly， Convey and Ghosh et al. studies showed no difference between the groups in the rate of CD for fetal distress \\[14，41\\]. The difference might be due to the inclusion of high-risk pregnancies in the control group 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u> and inclusion of preeclamptic women in control group and analysis of small sample size (IO=49 Normal AFI=284) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[41\\]</u>.**\n\n【36】**In addition to meta-analysis discussed above and multiple longitudinal studies indicated， cesarean deliveries specifically for the reason of NRFHRP/fetal distress were significantly lower in women with normal amniotic fluid than IO \\[7，15，16，19，23，25，27，31，38，40\\]. A finding from a prospective cohort study conducted in Pakistan revealed that the risk of CD was increased by 3-folds among women with isolated oligohydramnios under the induction of labor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[33\\]</u>. Nevertheless， statistically significant association was not reported in these studies \\[14，21，42\\]. The difference might be inclusion of high-risk pregnancies， showing weak association and inclusion high blood pressure pregnant women in the studies respectively.**\n\n【37】**Additionally， a large retrospective cohort study conducted on 987pregnancies complicated by isolated oligohydramnios and to 22，280low-risk pregnancies with normal AFI. The showed intrapartum cesarean delivery due to NRFHRP and dystocia was significantly associated with IO. However， after controlling potential confounders like parity and induction of labor the risk of CD in IO was similar to their counterparts 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. This finding may be supported by a higher rate of CD in IO which might partially attributable to obstetricians’**\n\n【38】**practice choices 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[43\\]</u>.**\n\n【39】**A retrospective cohort study exclusively conducted on IO complicated pregnancies showed that rate of CD in early term and late-term pregnancies were high compared to full-term pregnancies. However， there is no significant difference between the early period(37.8%) and the late period (35.3%). Also， there was no significant difference in induction of labor in term pregnancy classifications通用删除6(英):<u>\\[44\\]</u>. Therefore， to conclude the cause for cesarean delivery directly related with IO or other possible risk factors， it needs further RCT studies with controlling potential confounders.**\n\n【40】**Neonatal and perinatal outcomes**\n\n【41】**Isolated oligohydramnios and Apgar score： Apgar score can be used for rapid assessment of newborn well-being and it has five components： appearance， pulse rate， respiration， reflex irritability， and muscle tone. First minute Apgar score shows how well the baby tolerated the birthing process and the 5h-minute tells the health care provider how well the baby is doing outside the uterine environment通用删除6(英):<u>\\[45\\]</u>. Although low fifth minute Apgar score is associated with long-term severe neurologic sequels \\[46-481， many studies in the literature showed an absence of association between IO and fifth minute Apgar score 14，15，17，20，21，23-26，28，32-37，39，41-43，49，50.**\n\n【42】**Similarly， a prospective case control study conducted on 80women with isolated oligohydramnios and these were compared with 320 with normal AFI. The finding showed there is no difference between the cases and controls as regards of fifth minute Apgar score通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. Matched case-control study conducted on IO=120， Normal AFI=116 also revealed the same finding 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[30\\]</u>. This evidence supported by with large retrospective cohort (IO=987 Normal AFI=22，280) study conducted by Ashwal et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. In addition， meta-analysis of four articles which includes 3，943 pregnant women (IO=679(17.2%)， Normal AFI=3264(82.8%)has the same result 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>.**\n\n【43】**Correspondingly， a large retrospective cohort study conducted on after induction of labor women with normal AFI and induced labor because of IO had no significant effect on the first minute Apgar score less than four 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[32\\]</u>. Additionally， retrospective matched case-control study conducted on women with IO=206， and Normal AFI=206showed no significant difference in first minute Apgar score between the groups 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. Those findings is also supported by a comparative study among women with IO and normal amniotic fluid after 41weeks of pregnancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[31\\]</u>. Similarly， findings from two studies were revealed isolated oligohydramnios is not associated with low first minute Apgar score \\[17，251. Furthermore， a small RCT conducted among actively and expectantly managed women with IO revealed no significant difference on first， fifth-， and tenth-minute Apgar score通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>.**\n\n【44】**On the contrary， a meta-analysis indicated that IO was associated with low first and fifth minute Apgar scores. However， after they excluded studies with extreme values， IO had evidence of effect only**\n\n【45】**on the first minute Apgar score less than seven 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u>. Similar findings were reported from two meta-analyses \\[19，40\\]. A meta-analysis on IO published by Chauhan et al. showed antepartum and intrapartum oligohydramnios were associated with low fifth minute Apgar score， which might be because of the inclusion of high-risk pregnancies in the analysis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>.**\n\n【46】**Isolated oligohydramnios and non-reassuring fetal heartbeat pattern/fetal distress & umbilical artery acidosis Case-control and retrospective cohort studies showed Io had an association with NRFHBP \\[15，23\\]. NRFHBP and the first minute Apgar score have poor sensitivity for fetal status and outcome， cord pH is a direct measure of the fetal oxygenation status 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[51\\]</u>. Also， many published works including meta-analyses explicitly showed no relationship between IO and NRFHBP， fetal distress and umbilical artery/vein less than 7.1/7.213-16，21，26，27，32，35，41，42.**\n\n【47】**Isolated oligohydramnios and meconium-stained amniotic fluid： Meconium-stained amniotic fluid during the intrapartum period is an indicator of fetal distress. Most recent studies suggest that an association exists between IO and MSAF\\[19，21，23，24，28，29，31，32，39，40，52-54\\]. In contrast， other studies concluded IO had no effect on MSAF\\[14-16，19，27，34，36，40，42，49，50\\]. However， the association of MSAF and IO was gestational age-dependent \\[13，55\\]. A meta-analysis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[40\\]</u> showed no difference in the rate of meconium-stained amniotic fluid and IO. However， it increased the risk of meconium aspiration syndrome (RR： 2.83， CI1.41-5.70). Conclusive evidence is needed on the association of MSAF with meconium aspiration syndrome and poor neonatal outcomes， and status of meconium (thick or thin). Moreover， the inclusion of different indicators of fetal compromise along with MSAF is important 56\\].**\n\n【48】**Isolated oligohydramnios and admission to neonatal intensive care unit： Many prospective/retrospective cohort， case-control and meta-analysis studies showed IO has no significant effect on NICU admissions\\[13，15，16，19-21，23，24，26，31-33，35，36，54\\]. However， a meta-analysis and some epidemiologic studies revealed IO has a significant effect on admission to NICU \\[7，27，37，38，40，57\\]. The observed difference might be due to the inclusion of preterm and intrauterine growth restriction neonates in the studies \\[40，54\\]. For conclusive results， a large RCT is important.**\n\n【49】**Isolated oligohydramnios and neonatal morbidity/mortality：IO has no association with the following outcomes： immediate cry， hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy， need for neonatal resuscitation and phototherapy， transit tachypnea of the newborn， hypoglycemia， sepsis， seizure， hypothermia， meconium aspiration syndrome， jaundice， intubation， and stillbirth \\[16，38\\]. Similarly， IO showed an absence of significant association with composite adverse neonatal outcomes (cesarean/operative vaginal delivery due to NRFHRP， low Apgar score， umbilical artery pH<7.10， neonatal intensive care admission， meconium aspiration syndrome， and intubation or hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. Moreover， IO did not show differences in perinatal mortality or morbidity compared to normal amniotic fluid volume \\[17，19\\]. However， a study conducted in Nepal evidenced an association between early neonatal death and IO 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[37\\]</u>.**\n\n【50】**Isolated oligohydramnios and birth weight： Neonatal/fetal weight indicates fetal wellbeing in the uterus. Comparison studies showed there was no difference in birth weight less than 2000/2500gramsbetween门pregnancies complicated bby IOand normal**\n\n【51】**amniotic fluid volume 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. Neonates born to mothers with isolated oligohydramnios had a higher risk of low birth weight compared with normal amniotic fluid volume. However， their weight difference had no clinical significance\\[16，25，26，29，31-33，35，37，42，49\\]. Furthermore， a similar finding was observed from a meta-analysis study 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>.**\n\n【52】**Conclusion**\n\n【53】**Studies show that IO increases the rate of induction. Moreover， a lot of findings depicted woman with IO had a higher rate of cesarean delivery compared to a woman with normal amniotic fluid. More than 20 studies including meta-analyses reported low first， fifth， and tenth-minute agar score has no relation with IO. Similarly， this narrative review revealed that a relationship doesn’t exist between IO and NRFHBP， fetal distress and umbilical artery/vein less than7.1/7.2. Moreover，IO didn'tshow differences in perinatal mortality or morbidity compared to normal amniotic fluid volume. Even though the weight difference had no clinical significance， neonates born from mothers with isolated oligohydramnios had a higher risk of low birth weight compared with their counterparts. Furthermore， the impact of IO on MSAF and neonatal intensive care unit was inconclusive across the results. For decisive evidence large RCT and inclusion of different indicators of fetal compromise along with MSAF is important.**\n\n【54】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【55】通用结尾删除-1:<u>1\\.

Baby was resuscitated and put on ventilator SIMV mode. Antibiotics started as per protocol. On further examination subgaleal bleed was suspected so baby was put on hematocrit and head circumference monitoring. Head compression dressing done to prevent further bleed. Baby was transfused packed red blood cell due to fall in hematocrit and increasing head circumference. Baby had seizures at 4 h of life controlled on antiepileptics and Inj Midazolam drip. Cranial ultrasonography revealed diffuse subgaleal hematoma. On day2 baby had high grade fever and investigation revealed very high procalcitonin levels (>100)， total leucocyte count was 46，000 with 82% neutrophils， coagulation profile was deranged and fibrinogen degradation particles were positive (>20). Chest X-ray showed consolidations on right lung.

Out of six two babies had AKI， one is having oliguria and others were having normal urine output. Both babies with AKI improved and were discharged. One baby is having mildly deranged kidney function test at 60 h of life. All three babies with deranged kidney function tests were having inappropriate weight gain as presenting clinical symptom. Babies were put on fluid restriction and extraneous monitoring. All babies were managed conservatively and kidney function tests started improving in 3 days.**\n\n【34】**All babies diagnosed with acute kidney injury had serious intracranial bleed (Subarachnoid hemorrhage and Grade 4Intraventricular Hemorrhage) along with subgaleal hematoma. Perinatal asphyxia and Septicemia can be worsening risk factors for acute kidney injury.**\n\n【35】**Subgaleal Hemorrhage (SGH) is bleeding in the potential space between the skull periosteum and the scalp galea aponeurosis. It is rare and lethal complication. Pediatricians should be notified whenever an operative vaginal delivery has been attempted as such neonates should be closely observed. All vacuum-related injuries in term neonates were evident within 10 h of birth. Hence， neonates may be discharged10 or more hours after vacuum delivery if no complications are evident 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Neonatal death from SGH can be prevented ifappropriate attention is paid to identification of risk factors， early diagnosis， close observation and aggressive treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. SGH can present with anemia， metabolic acidosis， hyperbilirubinemia， intracranial hemorrhage， respiratory distress， seizures， shock， and death.**\n\n【36】**In previous studies while extra-cranial hematomas and skull fractures have been associated with vacuum assisted deliveries， a causal link to neonatal intracranial hemorrhage (intracranial hemorrhages， subarachnoid， subdural， and intracerebral) is less evident.**\n\n【37】**Acute Kidney Injury： The incidence of acute kidney injury in NICU is 8% to 24% and associated mortality rate is 20% to 50% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. AKI is common and associated with poorer outcomes in perinatal asphyxia. The presence of perinatal asphyxia and its severity appears to correlate with increasing incidence of AKI \\[6，7\\].

This study reminds us the association of serious intracerebral hemorrhage and AKI. But limitation of this study is etiology of AKI was not explored further .**\n\n【38】**Conclusion**\n\n【39】**Since there is recent surge in vacuum delivery it is important that obstetric care providers are aware of neonatal risks and related co-morbidities associated with such deliveries. Neonate should be monitored for diagnosis of intracranial bleed and acute kidney injury as early treatment can be implemented. Early suspicion especially when baby have inappropriate weight gain can be helpful.**\n\n【40】**Direct association between serious intracranial bleed and acute kidney injury can't be established due to small sample size of study.

This is to extract the nail retrograde way.**\n\n【23】**Figure 1： Irreducible deformity of the right leg.**\n\n【24】**Figure 4： Frontal flexion at the junction 1/3 mid-1/3 inferior of the tibia.**\n\n【25】**Figure 5： Nail retrograde way.**\n\n【26】**Figure 2： Irreducible deformity of the right leg at 45°.**\n\n【27】**Figure 3： Irreducible deformity of the right leg at 45° lateral flexion.**\n\n【28】**Figure 6： Anteramedial approach with a distal tibial corticotomy flap.**\n\n【29】**With regard to osteosynthesis， we have been able to perform a conventional osteosynthesis by medial distal tibial plate LCP 3.5.**\n\n【30】**Discussion**\n\n【31】**The deformation of osteosynthesis material is frequent in cases of nonunion due to a progressive and irreversible embrittlement of the metal. In the vast majority of cases， the diagnosis is made at the time of the rupture of the latter and the extraction of this material is carried out in semi emergency. There are many methods of extraction通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. The authors focus mainly on tactics with proximal anterograde extraction and distal percutaneous or retrograde extraction. In all clinical cases reported， there is no simple deformation but a complete rupture ofthe metallic material \\[4，7\\].**\n\n【32】**Figure 7： Conventional osteosynthesis.**\n\n【33】**The deformation of material in traumatic cases is much less frequent 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. The extraction of the material is made very complicated by this deformation. Yip et al. reported extraction of two tibial nails**\n\n【34】**by standard route 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. By carefully studying the deformations， one realizes that these were not important and finally allowed a classic extraction of the nail. One case reported by these authors had 13° of**\n\n【35】**anterior flexion and 20° of valgus. Our clinical case had a much larger deformity.**\n\n【36】**The idea of deforming the tibia by an external force to obtain a realignment allowing the conventional extraction of the nail has not been seriously considered. Some authors have tried with total failure7.**\n\n【37】**Some authors propose a minimal approach on the deformation focus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. The goal is to cut the nail with a plier or saw. Thus， one can realign the limb and proceed to the extraction as in the case of a rupture on a nonunion. Some authors believe that the use of a saw is not advisable because of metal chips and the risk of bone burns 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.**\n\n【38】**We decided preoperatively to perform a distal corticotomy. We were then able to seize the nail to carry out a retrograde extraction. All the proximal diaphysis was intact. The bonyhood was then rested and fixed by a provisional strapping and a very long bone plate was placed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.**\n\n【39】**In conclusion， the presence of osteosynthesis equipment may expose to complications in case of trauma as illustrated by our clinical case. However， it seems that a complication at this degree of severity is exceptional in the literature. According to our service habits， the removal of osteosynthesis equipment must be included in the therapeutic project from initial management， particularly in a population at high risk oftrauma.**\n\n【40】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【41】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**1\\.

This report aimed to highlight a rare case of tongue-base angioleiomyoma excised by TransOral Robotic Surgery (TORS). A rare case report of angioleiomyoma of the tongue base in a 72-year-old man who presented with hoarseness， muffled voice and stridor. Preoperative endovascular embolization was performed owing to the high vascularity of the lesion， followed by TORS using the da Vinci Robotic System.

It usually measures from a few millimeters to 2 cm. As the tumor is painless and slow-growing， diagnosis may be delayed. Median age at diagnosis is 45 years； there is a small male predominance (58%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. ALM appears histologically as a well-circumscribed capsulated tumor； alpha-Smooth Muscle Actin (SMA) positivity on immunohistochemistry is considered a good diagnostic marker 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Treatment is by surgical excision. Recurrence is uncommon， unless the tumor was not removed completely，and prognosis is good. Malignant transformation has not been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.**\n\n【14】**ALM rarely occurs in the oropharynx and oral cavity， especially the tongue base. This report describes a case of tongue-base ALM and the first use of TransOral Robotic Surgery (TORS) for the treatment of ALM in this location.**\n\n【15】**Case Presentation**\n\n【16】**A 72-year-old man presented with hoarseness， muffled voice， stridor， and mild dyspnea that appeared during minor physical activity， in addition to unintentional weight loss of 4 kg in the last vear. His medical history was remarkable.**\n\n【17】**Clinical examination revealed an oropharyngeal tongue-base lesion and an offensive smell from the oral cavity. Laryngoscopy exposed a vascular 2.6 cm mass pushing the epiglottis posteriorly and filling the vallecula inferiorly . Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) revealed an oval well-circumscribed space-occupying lesion located between the tongue base and epiglottis，hyperintense throughout and strongly enhanced on T2-weighted scans. The lesion caused partial obstruction of the oropharyngeal airways with slight asymmetry to the left . No metastases were identified.**\n\n【18】**Considering the benign appearance of the tumor and its high vascularity， a preoperative biopsy was not taken to avoid the risk of excessive bleeding which could lead to airway obstruction. Accordingly， concerns of intraoperative bleeding prompted the use of preoperative endovascular embolization， which was performed by an invasive neuroradiologist under general anesthesia. Diagnostic catheter angiography demonstrated that the left lingual artery was the sole supply source to the lesion. Therapeutic catheterization was followed by endovascular embolization using a coaxial catheter system. During navigation of the microcatheter， minor bleeding was observed from**\n\n【19】**Figure 1： Laryngolagy findings. Preoperative laryngoscopic examination exposes vascular mass of diameter 2.6 cm in the tongue base， dislacating the epiglottis.**\n\n【20】**Figure 2： Imaging findings. MRI scans demonstrate an oval， well-circumscribed，space- accupying lesion  arising from the base of the tongue and dislocating the epiglottis. Strongly enhanced signal on sagittal T1-weighted scan with gadolinium.**\n\n【21】**Figure 3： Intraoperative TORS images. The whole tumor (arrow) covered the epiglottis completely.

Total devascularization of the tumor-feeding artery was achieved without complications. The absence of distal obstructions was verified by iniections to the vertebral arteries.**\n\n【23】**TROS was performed under general anesthesia 3 days later (Figure3). Surgery was preceded by preventive tracheotomy for intraoperative protection of the airway and safer postoperative management. The**\n\n【24】**Figure 4： Histopathological findings (hematoxylin and easin， original magnification x20). Histopathology reveals a well-circumscribed non-encapsulated benign tumor lined by squamous epithelium with no mucosal invalvement. The tumor is compased of numerous vascular channels surrounded by myocytes. Smooth muscle cells with low mitotic activity and no nuclear atypia are seen. The blood vessel walls are covered in endothelial cells in which there are erythrocytes. There are no signs of malignancy， necrosis， or ulceration.**\n\n【25】**tongue base was exposed using a Crowe retractor， and visualization of the oropharynx was achieved with an 8 mm， 30-degree， three-dimensional endoscope that was inserted， facing upward， through the retractor. A 5 mm monopolar cautery and 5 mm Maryland dissector were then inserted and brought into endoscopic view. The tumor was excised en-bloc with 0.5 cm margins using the da Vinci Robotic System \\[Intuitive Surgical Inc.， Sunnyvale CA， USA). The TORS procedure took 110 min. Moderate bleeding events occurring during the procedure were managed with electrocautery， vascular clips， and biological glue； there was no excessive intraoperative bleeding or other perioperative complications.**\n\n【26】**The postoperative course was uneventful. The patient was fed via a nasogastric tube for the first 2 days and then proceeded to soft oral intake. He was treated with antibiotics (cefamezin and metronidazole) and decannulated prior to discharge within 5 days. At the 1-year follow-up， there were no signs of local recurrence， and the stoma was closed.**\n\n【27】**Postoperative histopathologic examination revealed _a_ well-circumscribed 2.3-cm ALM composed of myocytes and vascular spaces， with no nuclear atypia and low mitotic activity. Immunohistochemistry staining was negative for HMB45， S100， and desmin， and positive for SMA. Ki67 proliferation index was 4% to 5%， indicating a benign neoplasm .**\n\n【28】**Discussion**\n\n【29】**We presented a case of ALM in the tongue base. To our knowledge， a few cases of tongue ALM have been described， and only several specifically in the tongue base 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4-6\\]</u>.**\n\n【30】**The clinical differential diagnosis of ALM of the tongue includes hemangioma， lymphangioma， vascular malformation， abscess， lingual thyroid， and other benign mesenchymal tumors such as fibroma， neurofibroma， and granular cell lesion. In our case， the intense enhancement of the lesion on T2-weighted images and T1-weighted images with gadolinium pointed to a hypervascular pattern， narrowing the differential diagnosis to a vascular mass.**\n\n【31】**Surgical approaches to tongue-base tumors include transoral excision， submandibular approach， suprahyoid OT lateral pharyngotomy， and lip split with mandibulotomy. For small and well-encapsulated lesions， transoral excision is preferred. However， gaining adequate access to the tongue base can be challenging owing**\n\n【32】**to its remote location and the presence of important neurovascular structures 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.Fan et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u> used an ultrasonic harmonic scalpel with an advanced hemostasis mode in 12 patients with other tongue-base benign lesions. The technique yielded good outcomes with minimum complications but was limited by lack of depth perception and low visualization ofthe surgical field with inadequate lesion exposure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.**\n\n【33】**More recently， Danic et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u> and Kim et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u> described two cases of tongue-base ALM， in a 76-year-old man and a 2-month-old infant， respectively， who underwent endoscopic surgery with a harmonic scalpel. Additionally， Marden et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u> managed a tongue-base ALM that bled vigorously during diagnostic biopsy with endovascularembolization followed one daylater byhemiglossectomy with mass resection.**\n\n【34】**In the present case， the vascularity of the tumor prompted our decision to perform preoperative endovascular embolization of the selective tumor-feeding branch (left lingual artery)， as described by Marden et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>， followed by surgical excision. However， unlike the previous cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4-6\\]</u>， we used a TORS approach. TORS has been reported to overcome the limitations of traditional surgical methods andto improve surgeon dexterity，precision， and depthperception 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. By providing three-dimensional visualization， it allows for complete tumor removal with fewer complications while preserving important structures and nerves. We found the procedure to be safe and efficient for excision of a tongue-base ALM. The main disadvantages of TORS are the relatively high operating costs and absence of tactile feedback. However， the advantages seem to outweigh the disadvantages. This report supports the use of a robotic minimal invasive technique for excision and partial glossectomy of benign lesions at the tongue base， especially vascular lesions like ALM.**\n\n【35】**In conclusion， we report a rare case of a tongue-base ALM that posed treatment challenges owing to its vascularity and difficult location. Treatment consisted of embolization and tracheostomy followed by TORS excision. To our knowledge， this is the first report documenting treatment of tongue-base ALM using TORS. We achieved optimal visual exposure that allowed for safe and complete tumor excision with minimal complications.**\n\n【36】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**Acknowledgment Data availability statement**</u>\n\n【37】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**The data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.**</u>\n\n【38】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**Ethics statement**</u>\n\n【39】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and any accompanying images.**</u>\n\n【40】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【41】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**1\\.

However， these PSG studies require high costs withal long waiting time for appointments due to the limited number of sleep laboratories despite the presence of increasing demand 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. In addition， some patients tend to prefer home-based studies rather than hospitalization required methods because of the higher comfort afforded by natural sleep environment通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.

The present case report was aimed to describe utilization of a novel home-based evaluation technique that was consisted of sleep app and PO in short-term follow-up of Mandibular Advancement Device (MAD) therapy applied for a moderate OSA patient with habitual snoring.**\n\n【18】**Case Presentation**\n\n【19】**A 43 year-old Caucasian male patient was referred to the otolaryngology， head and neck surgery clinic ofour hospital with the complaint of severe snoring， witnessed apnea and excessive daytime sleepiness. In clinical interview， he reported he had a serious traffic accident one year ago caused by daytime sleepiness. The patient’s history did not contain any systemic disorders， cigarette smoking and alcohol or drug abuse.**\n\n【20】**On the physical examination， the waist and neck circumferences and body mass index of the patient were 108 cm， 42 cm， and 29.8kg/m²respectively. Not any signs were detected during temporomandibular joint examination. On intraoral examination， presence of elongated soft palate， moderate macroglossia and slightly narrowed oropharynx were noted. Oropharengeal relationship of the patient was classified as Class 4 according to the Mallampati scale. His Epworth Sleepiness Scale (EPSS) was 16 and the provisional diagnosis was OSA. Thus， overnight PSG evaluation was required for definitive diagnosis.**\n\n【21】**According to the medical history， the patient had been referred to a sleep laboratory by a chest physician two years ago. However， having had difficulty in falling asleep and felt discomfort arising from cables and electrodes he had left the test unfinished. Therefore， it was decided to perform overnight PO recording at home in order to check his cardiorespiratory stability during sleep. In addition， snoring monitorization was planned concurrent with the PO recordings. Thus， a sleep app (SnoreLab， Reviva Soft works Ltd， London， UK) was downloaded and set as the creators'instructions. To obtain the most accurate data， the noise level of the patients' bedroom was checked with a sound level meter (LM-8102， Lutron Ltd， Taipei， Taiwan) and conveniences of the room conditions were confirmed. The patient was informed in detail about the working principals of the PO and the app. The Smartphone (IPhone 4S， Apple， CA， USA) was switched and the app was activated before sleep. Finally， the PO (Beurer PO80， Beurer Medical， Ulm， Germany) was inserted by a sleep technician and overnight recordings were performed at the patient’s home. In total， three recordings were executed in order to minimize the error margin.

Impressions were made with irreversible hydrocolloid material (CA37， Cavex， Haarlem， Holland) and the master casts were obtained from Type III dental stone (Moldano， Heraeus Kulzer， Hanau， Germany). Maxillary and mandibular occlusal splints were manufactured with Autopolymerising Clear Acrylic Resin Material (ACARM) (Ortocryl， Dentaurum， Ispringen， Germany) on isolated master models such as to cover occlusal and incisal surfaces of the existing dentition. Prepared splints were inserted in the mouth and adjusted on dental arches. Afterwards，intermaxillary relationship was recorded at 75% of maximal mandibular protrusion and intraoral records were mounted on a semi-adjustable articulator (Artex Type NK， Amann Girrbach， Pforzheim，Deutschland). The vertical openingamount was increased up to 10 mm，approximately. Maxillary and mandibular splints were**\n\n【31】**attached to each other using ACARM and finishing procedures were performed. After intraoral adjustments， the MAD was delivered to the patient with recommendations. Three Follow-Up Recordings(FRs) were performed at the end of the 6th month of the MAD treatment. The same recording procedure applied in the DRs was also performed during Frs. Insertion of the MAD during sleep was the only difference between DRs and FRs protocols. The results of the last snoring recording were shown in the Figure 1.**\n\n【32】**At the end of the six months follow-up period， the EPSS of the patient dramatically decreased at 3. The mean ODI of the patient was improved significantly with the MAD therapy. In addition， significant improvement in HRV was observed with the MAD therapy. Moreover， therapeutic effect of the MAD was recorded successfully with the sleep app. All snore scores obtained by the sleep app showed**\n\n【33】**highly compatible alterations both with EPSS and PO values. Not any serious complaints were reported by the patient except dry mouth that generally occurred in mornings.**\n\n【34】**Discussion**\n\n【35】**According to our knowledge， this is the first report describing the utilization of a sleep app and PO in the management of a moderate OSA patient with habitual snoring. Gradually increasing usage of the PO in sleep studies can be observed from the current literature， and its diagnostic value has been qualified by previous studies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1-3\\]</u>. However， there exist some studies notifying the variable sensitivity of PO according to the severity of the OSA. Chung et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u> stated that PO recordings could be more sensitive for the patients having ODI above 10 (93%). The reason of the highly coherent ODI values obtained from three DRs could be arisen from the moderate severity of the OSA in the present case. In fact， three ODI values obtained from the DRs was extremely close to each other. However， a little less proximity was detected among ODI values obtained from FRS Nevertheless； strong and coherent relations was seen among EPSS， PO and sleep app values in terms of DRs and FRS Moreover， EPSS， PO and sleep app values dramatically decreased in chorus at the end of six months.**\n\n【36】**As seen in the present case， snoring may be the foremost signs of OSA directing the patients to seek a medical assistance. However， there is no agreement in the literature on the accuracy of snoring severity predicted with the provided information by bed partners. In fact， objective findings may affect the treatment planning of patients or have an importance for avoiding elective surgical interventions通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. In the present case， simultaneous decrease in EPSS， IDO， HRV and snoring scores displayed not only treatment efficiency of the MAD therapy for a moderate OSA patients， but also problem solving capacity of sleep apps on the existence of an objective method to score the snoring severity of subjects in home conditions. Thus，using a sleep app in the scoring of snoring severity may be an option for the home based sleep studies at the foreseeable future. However， some unknown titles should be made clear to take yet another turn， as previously stated by Stipping et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Numerous brand of SP with different hardware and software have been presented in market up to now. Thus， structural properties of the Smartphone's can be quite varied from each other’s and their recording quality may be affected from these variations. In addition， some of them may record human**\n\n【37】**snoring sounds more effectively than the others. However， there are not any comprehensive studies in the literature which responds to these queries， yet. Therefore， absence of data about the reliability and repeatability of sleep apps algorithms should be fulfilled.**\n\n【38】**Unfortunately， an in vivo study about the usage of sleep apps has not been published yet. Thus， impossibility of making a comparison is one of the most important limitations of the present case study. However， absence of any PSG data， which can be enabled the verification of obtained results， is the major limitation of the present case. Additionally， findings of this single case cannot be extended to all related population. Therefore， present findings need to be verified by further studies conducted with inclusion of more participants. Moreover， not only sufficiency of widely used SPs but also accuracy and repeatability of existing sleep apps should be evaluated with further studies. More preferably， standard PSG evaluations can be used to constitute a reference point to compare accuracy and repeatability of both SPs and sleep apps. Despite it is as yet too early to make a definite decision， using a sleep app in the scoring of snore sounds seems like a promising innovation for the future sleep studies to be executed in home conditions.**\n\n【39】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【40】通用结尾删除-1:<u>1\\.

It has been the object of growing interest since its frequency tends to augment as life expectancy has increased globally considered. In this work， we study the eventual neuroprotective effect of Progesterone (P) injected a few days before establishing a Reserpine (R) model of Parkinsonism in adult male rats. We focused on cognitive (Novel Object Recognition test； NOR)， affective (Forced Swimming Task； FST) and motor (Catalepsy Test； CT) outputs. We performed the appropriate tests along with the administration for two weeks of low doses of R. Our results show very clearly that P prevents the impairment of several tasks regarding the deleterious effects of R， without affecting negatively other areas of the subject behavior. In total accordance with current information， we show here that P -in particular- and neuroactive steroids -in general- are promising molecules to delay diverse manifestations of neurotransmitters depletion.**\n\n【16】**Keywords： Progesterone； Neuroactive steroids； Parkinsonism； Neuroprotection； Male rats**\n\n【17】**Introduction**\n\n【18】**Parkinson's disease is a threatening health problem in the world. It is the second most common neurodegenerative disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Besides many advances in the management of the illness， it remains complicated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. This is so -at least in part-because what was once the hallmark of the disease， the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra， has since changed to consider the disease as a multi-systemic degenerative process involving several pathways， structures and neurotransmitters通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Ongoing research is highly interested in the possibility of using neuroprotective drugs to avoid the damages of the disease or at least delay them long enough to give the patient a better quality of life.**\n\n【19】**Neuroactive steroids are a well-known set of molecules that comprise steroids from any source that show effects on the Central Nervous System (CNS). Among them， there are a group of neuroactive steroids-collectively named neurosteroids- that are synthesized the novo in the CNS， and that exert autocrine and paracrine effects only 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Both groups of molecules have a renowned target as putative molecules regarding neuroprotection. Progesterone (P) is one of the major players among them 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Parkinson’s disease remains elusive in terms oftreatment， being one major reason that the disorder， once thought as merely a motor illness， is a complex set of signs and symptoms that involve cognitive， affective and motor expressions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Today， a major goal is to recognize early subtle behavioral (cognitive， affective and motor) signs of malfunctioning to promptly begin with the treatment.**\n\n【20】**There are several animal models of Parkinsonism that have proved to be very useful in researching several essential aspects of the disease， from behavior to molecules 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. In this work， we try to study whether or not P. could be eventually neuroprotective when administered just a few days before of injecting our subjects with severallow doses of Reserpine (R) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. We selected R as our model since it affects not only dopaminergic neurons but also catecholamines and indoleamine as a whole 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. What was once a disadvantageous situation， today it has been reverted since the human disease involves a much more complex landscape that the mere loss of dopaminergic**\n\n【21】**neurons. Additionally， the method-comparatively- is a rapid way of establishing the deficits in the subiects and also testing the effects of putative protective molecules.**\n\n【22】**Methods**\n\n【23】**Subjects**\n\n【24】**Male Sprague-Dawley rats， 60 days old， and 450 g average weight were used. Animals were housed in groups of three individuals per cage. Room temperature was maintained at 22℃±2C， on a 12 h artificial light/dark cycle (light from 7：00 am to 7 pm). Commercial rodent food and water were provided ad libitum. All procedures were approvedbythelocal committee for care and use ofanimals in medical research (CICUAL， Facultad de Ciencias Medicas， Universidad Nacional de Cuyo， cicual@fcm.uncu.edu.ar)， and experiments were performed in accord with the National Institutes of Health guide for the care and use of laboratory animals.**\n\n【25】**Reagents and solutions**\n\n【26】**Reserpine (R) and Progesterone (P) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich St Louis MO， USA. R was diluted in glacial acetic acid (final concentration 0.5% acetic acid in distilled water) and subcutaneously administered (SC) at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg. P was dissolved in ether， benzyl alcohol was added， and finally， it was resuspended in corn oil. P administration was also SC， at a dose of 4 mg/kg.**\n\n【27】**Experimental design**\n\n【28】**The experimental protocol was carried out along 21 days， according to Figure 1. From day-5 to-1 animal received either a daily Intraperitoneal (IP) injection of sterile saline or an SC injection of P. On odd days from 1 to 13 animals received either daily reserpine or sterile saline according to the group . Catalepsy test was carried out on even days from 2 to 14. Novel Object Recognition test(NOR test) was performed on day 8， and Forced Swimming Test(FST) was performed on day 9.**\n\n【29】**At the beginning ， animals were randomly assigned to one of 4 groups (n=10 each) injected with： 1) Sham (S)， saline-saline；2) saline-reserpine (R)； 3) Progesterone-Reserpine (P+R)； and 4) Progesterone-Saline (P+S).**\n\n【30】**Reserpine model**\n\n【31】**Reserpine (R)， a monoamine depleting agent， is an ester alkaloid derived from Rauwolfia sp. root utilized initially for the treatment of hypertension 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. R was underused for years as a useful reagent to induce animal Parkinsonism since it was not selective for dopamine， the hallmark neurotransmitter whose lack by death of dopaminergic neurons in the substantial nigra was always considered to be the responsible for the pathophysiology of the illness， according to Jenner in 1989 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Today this is not the case anymore as different monoamines besides dopamine (noradrenaline， serotonin) and different nuclei besides the substantia nigra (raphe nuclei and locus coeruleus) are all known to be affected by the disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Today， R is a well-established model to induce animal Parkinsonism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.**\n\n【32】**Catalepsy test**\n\n【33】**In the catalepsy test， the subject is placed in an unusual posture and then the observer measures the time that takes to the animal to correct this unusual posture 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. We used a horizontal Plexiglass bar held between two vertical support bars located at 9 cm from a smooth surface. Animal's front limbs were positioned on the bar and the latency time to step down from the bar was recorded. Three trials were made per rat on each observation. Result for each observation**\n\n【34】**was the mean value. We establish catalepsy like behavior criteria， considered as immobility posture time. Maximum time allowed for the whole test was 180 sec.**\n\n【35】**Novel object recognition**\n\n【36】**The experiment was realized as described elsewhere \\[10，11\\]. Briefly， the apparatus consisted of a wooden box (70 cm x 45 cmx30 cm) with a white acrylic floor. It was located in an isolated testing room that was dimly lit by constant indirect illumination from the primary source， a 25 Wlight bulb suspended over the box. The objects utilized as familiar (previously experienced object) or unfamiliar(object not previously experienced， i.e. the novel one) were three copies of a pink truncated pyramid and a grayish-opaque candlestick of approximately the same size， all of them heavy enough to prevent accidental displacement by the subjects.**\n\n【37】**The animals were allowed to get used to the experimental room for at least 1 h. The day before training， each animal freely explored the apparatus with no objects for 2 min. A training session (T1) was followed by a test session (T2) 24 h later. During the training session， animals were placed in the arena containing two identical objects(pink truncated pyramids). In the test session， a familiar object was changed for an unfamiliar one (grayish opaque candlestick). Both training and test stages were 3 min each. The position of the objects(familiar and unfamiliar) and the extreme of the box used to place the objects were randomly exchanged for each experimental animal to avoid the use of potential confounding spatial clues. Exploration was defined as the orientation ofthe animal’s snout toward the object within a range of 2 cm or less from the object. Running around the object or sitting on it was not recorded as exploration. The objects and floor were carefully cleaned with ethanol (10%) after each trial to equate olfactory cues. The experiments were recorded with a camcorder digital camera JVC Everio GZ-MG330 (Japan) using a black and white recording mode to improve the register. The measures in the object recognition test were as follows： 1) total time spent by the subject exploring both objects during training (T1)； 2) total time spent by the subject exploring just the novel object during T2； and 3) discrimination index， the difference between time spent exploring unfamiliar and familiar objects during T2.**\n\n【38】**Forced swimming test**\n\n【39】**The FST was slightly modified from the original one 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. The device consists of a plexiglass cylinder 38 cm in diameter and 60 cm in height. The cylinder contained water at 25C， 45 cm in height. Rats were individually introduced into the cylinder for 5 min and removed to be dried before returning them to their home cages. The test was videotaped . The following parameters were scored：1) Immobility time： time spent with the head above the water surface， and the necessary movement to maintained it； 2) swimming time： movements through the apparatus with front limbs inside the water； 3) climbing time： Movements with the front limbs against the cylinder wall； and 4) diving： Events of exploratory movements under the water with all the body submerged**\n\n【40】**Statistical assays**\n\n【41】**All data were analyzed by a one-way ANOVA test followed by a Tukey post hoc test and expressed as the mean ± SEM. A value of p<0.05 was considered statistically significant.**\n\n【42】**Results**\n\n【43】**In the present work， when compared to another study 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>， relatively small but repeated doses of R (0.1 mg/Kg) were used to**\n\n【44】C= Control group； R=Reserpine group； P=P group； P+R=P plus reserpine group. Results are expressed as mean ±SEM. p<0.05， \"p<0.01，p<0.001.\n\n【45】**obtain subtle but reliable motor changes as well as cognitive and affective ones. In this sense， we were able to induce Parkinsonism signs in our subjects since all of the animals treated with R developed changes in each of the testing conditions.**\n\n【46】**These changes included： a) More time spent in the bar during the catalepsy test， indicating a definite impact on motility， particularly from day 10 of R treatment until reaching a peak on day 14 (Figure2)； b) subjects significantly spent less time swimming during the forced swimming task， which is a clear indication of what is known as a \"depression\" like behavior in rodent models when compared to controls without treatment or subjects treated with P alone (Figure3). The diving activity was measured by the number of accumulated events. Control group made 21 dives， while in the reserpine group we observe only 4 events.**\n\n【47】**Reserpine group previously treated with progesterone obtained a cumulative result of 11 dives， while for the group treated only with progesterone the cumulative result was 16 dives； c) also in the**\n\n【48】**recognition of the novel object during the test， controls， and P alone treated subjects did not have any problem at all in recognizing the new object. On the other hand， R treated subjects， nonetheless spending the same total amount of time in exploratory behavior -also a clear indicator of what is supposed to be expected from animals that did not suffer from any lack of motivation and/or translation problems ignored the condition of new object during the test day， indicating an impact on memory， a cognitive component of the model. These results， when taken together， allow us to consider our subjects as a valid model of monoamine depletion. By extension also as a modelofpremotor and motor signs of Parkinsonism， suitable for being used to study eventual neuroprotection by the neuroactive steroid P.**\n\n【49】**Discussion**\n\n【50】**Regarding P， it was striking the effect when administered for five days before the injections of R. In fact， in every condition tested， P. prevented the impairment of all the components previously**\n\n【51】C =Control group； R=Reserpine group； P=P group； P+R=P plus reserpine group.

It is important to note that P had not any effect per se. Additionally， we must stress here that the model we used in the present work allows us to study the acute effect of neuroprotection instead of addressing neurorestoration， being more useful for the later models based on intrastriataladministration of toxins like 6-Hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>.**\n\n【55】**Several papers stress the importance of sex steroids and neurosteroids as neuroprotective factors \\[14，15\\]. Men are more susceptible than women to Parkinson's disease， at least until women reach menopause 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>， which is highly suggestive for a role of sex steroids like estrogen 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. Moreover， steroid hormones synthesized by the brain have been shown to display neuroprotective properties eventually useful for the prevention and treatment of**\n\n【56】**neurodegenerative diseases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. Probably， what it is particularly interesting here are twofold：1) the validity of reserpine as a reagent suitable for generating a deficit constellation in rodents that remembers what happens -at least in part- in Parkinson's disease. It does so relatively quickly when compared to another method通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>， and it does consistently every time according to our results. Additionally， the whole picture is reversible when R is discontinued； and 2) P. prevented impairments in all areas-again consistently-when administered for a short time before R administration. There are advantageous animal models of Parkinsonism that are widely used 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. However， all of them involved some cumulative changes and cell death with compensatory changes as well. In this work， we show short bursts of P. before Rtreatment， and a short Rtreatment to induce the reported malfunctions.**\n\n【57】**Parkinson's disease is a very complex disorder in which probably many factors contribute to the onset and later stages of the disease通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. At present， there is no single successful treatment to stop the progression of the illness 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. As such it results interesting the possibility of addressing the role of several treatments at once acting synergistically to prevent neuronal death or restore brain damage. In this sense -among others- gonadal steroid hormones have been shown to result promising. As we mentioned earlier， since women are less prone than men to present Parkinson's disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u> at least until menopause- it looks promising to think about gonadal steroids as putative candidates to be one of the combined strategies to treat the disease. In fact， and besides that estrogens have been less contradictory that progestin's in showing beneficial effects， P also has been reported to be useful 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. In our lab， treatment with P. for 3 days after 6-OHDA injections improved behavioral targets as well as normalized glutamatergic and dopaminergic activities\\[11，18\\]. However， here we are dealing with acute effects， instead of the chronic model of neuronal death by 6-OHDA， which poses the question of that， apparently， at least， we could talk of dysfunctional neurons here more than dead cells. Since one of the possible targets of Parkinson’s disease is neurotrophic factors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>， it would be possible that P. before administration of reserpine could -acting quickly- exert their protective effect on membrane progesterone receptors， stimulating neurotrophic factors， such as BDNF. In our lab we have seen an increase in BDNF levels in response to administration of allopregnanolone， an endogenous neurosteroid derived from progesterone that acts as a GABAA positive allosteric modulator (unpublished data). Since nigral Dopamine (DA) neurons are sensitive to several neurotrophic factors (BDNF among them) it would not be impossible to think of P as inducing an increase of such neurotrophic factors and then， preventing DA neurons of becoming dysfunctional and hence， avoiding the potential proinflammatory damage of reserpine. Interestingly， Jarras et al.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u> reported that in mice gut -gastrointestinal symptoms are also common in Parkinsons disease- lesioned with 1-Methyl-4-Phenyl-1，2，3，6-Tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) they showed neuroprotection and immunomodulation of DA neurons (they had previously shown also neuroprotection in brain DA neurons；通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>).**\n\n【58】**In brief， we suspect (being careful of taking into account the great complexity ofthe first motor disorder in human beings) that， at least in early stages ofthe disease there could be a possible proinflammatory situation enhanced by some kind of oxidative stress that would be deleterious for-among others-DA neurons in substantia nigra. Based on the evidences， we suggest that neurotrophic factors could protect the neurons under dysfunctional state. In this sense， P. could be in**\n\n【59】**part responsible for stimulating such trophic factors； however， more studies become necessary to test this hypothesis. Actual efforts are underway to increase our understanding in this devastating disease.**\n\n【60】**Funding**\n\n【61】**The work was supported by grants from the National Research Council of Argentina CONICET (PIP 11220100100126)，Universidad de Mendoza (133/10)， and Fondecyt 102-0581.**\n\n【62】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【63】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**1\\.

Histology of the tumor in the lower gastric body was adenocarcinoma with papillary or tubular structures in the mucosal area. However， in the submucosal area， majority of tumor cells was changed to clear cells resembling cytotrophoblasts as seen in trophoblastic neoplasms. Furthermore， solitary growth of the spindle cells resembling Syncytiotrophoblast cells was apparent in the layers of muscularis propria and subserosa. Immunohistochemically， syncytiotrophoblast type cells were positive for beta-subunit of Human Chorionic Gonadotropin(HCG). Three out of 28 regionallymph nodes had metastases of the neoplasm with adenocarcinoma as well as choriocarcinomatous components. The tumor on the posterior wall of pylorus was a tubular adenocarcinoma only recognized in the mucosal layer. The tumor did not contain any trophoblastic components.**\n\n【12】**Choriocarcinomatous differentiation of the gastric carcinoma was suggested to occur during the down growth of the neoplasm. Present gastric choriocarcinoma supports the concept that gastric choriocarcinoma arises from alternate differentiation pathway of adenocarcinoma. Such synchronous occurrence of double carcinomas in the stomach may also suggest a higher oncogenesis stage of the stomach of this woman.**\n\n【13】**Introduction**\n\n【14】**Stomach may be a common site oforigin of non-gonadal， non-gestational trophoblastic tumors， although gastric cancers with germ cell tumor components are uncommon. Choriocarcinoma， hepatoid adenocarcinoma， carcinoma with enteroblastic differentiation， and York sac tumor like carcinoma are known as special type of gastric cancer. Choriocarcinoma is a trophoblastic tumor as a rare primary miscellaneous tumor in the stomach. It is known that some of gastric cancers have choriocarcinomatous components 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1-3\\]</u>. Regarding the pathogenesis of gastric choriocarcinoma， retro-differentiation or dedifferentiation theory has been accepted upon the observation that gastric choriocarcinoma are found with coexistent adenocarcinomas or adenocarcinoma components \\[4，5\\]. In a few tumors， the primary gastric lesion was pure adenocarcinoma and the choriocarcinomatous differentiation only became manifest in the metastasis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Certainly， it is plausible that since all cells contain the entire genetic material for the whole organism， cancers may differentiate in unusual directions， including even the formation of malignant trophoblasts. However， precise mechanisms for the trophoblastic differentiation of gastric cancers are still unknown. Presently， we report a unique case with a carcinoma exerting choriocarcinomatous differentiation and another separated adenocarcinoma in the stomach. Significance of such synchronous gastric carcinomas particularly for the point ofassociation between tumor growth and differentiation is discussed.**\n\n【15】**Case Presentation**\n\n【16】**A78-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital for evaluation of epigastralgia. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed existence of a type 3 tumor on the greater curvature of lower gastric body and a type 0-IIa+IIc lesion on the posterior wall in pylorus. By biopsy， both lesions were diagnosed as adenocarcinomas， suggesting that the stomach had double cancers with different stages. The distal gastrectomy with D2 lymph node dissection \\[7，8\\] was performed. The**\n\n【17】**Figure 1： Resection specimen of the stomach. The type 3 tumor mass on the greater curvature of lower gastric body 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> was measured 40 mmx 40 mm. The type 0-lla+llc neoplastic mass on the posterior wall in pylorus 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> was measured 18 mm x 18 mm.**\n\n【18】**Figure 2： A low-power view of the tumor on the greater curvature of lower gastric body.**\n\n【19】**Papillary or tubular growth of the neoplastic cells are recognized in the surface area. In the submucosal area (lower half)， are growing the tumor cells with clear cytoplasm. A few elongated cells with amphophilic cytoplasm are mixed in these areas (HE-stain). A high-power view of the clear cell population showing coexistence of dark cells with more pleomorphic nuclei(insert).**\n\n【20】**tumor mass on the greater curvature of lower gastric body measured40 mm x 40 mm was a nodular， irregular， gray-pink appearance having central ulceration with a raised rolled margin. The neoplastic mass on the posterior wall in pylorus measured 18 mmx18 mm was a polypoid lesion with surface erosions； type 0-IIa+IIc . On the operation， the tumors looked to be localized in the stomach wall and metastases to lymph nodes and other organs were not confirmed. On microscopy， the surface area of the neoplasm on the greater curvature of lower gastric body exhibited common features of adenocarcinoma with papillary or tubular growth. However， the main neoplastic cells infiltrating laminapropria and occupying submucosal space were changed to those composed of single nucleus， vacuolated or clear cytoplasm. They were relatively uniform population and lacked typical glandular structures. Less number of bizarre cells resembling syncytiotrophoblast cells with more pleomorphic nuclei， deeply eosinophilic to basophilic cytoplasm and less distinct cell membranes was mixed with the clear cell population . The tumor infiltrated through the muscularis propria into the sub serous space. In the layers of muscularis propria and subserosal area， solitary growth of syncytiotrophoblast type cells which were**\n\n【21】**Figure 3： Invasive growth of tumor cells resembling syncytiotrophoblastic cells in the muscularis propria (a). The same area with positive reaction of beta-subunit of Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (HCG) (b).**\n\n【22】**Figure 4： Histology of the tumor located on the posterior wall of pylorus. Both features of well differentiated and moderately differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma are mixed. The carcinoma is growing only in the mucosal layer.**\n\n【23】**encountered infrequently with clear cells in the submucosal area， was often recognized . Immunoreaction of HCG was localized exclusively to these syncytiotrophoblast type cells (Figure3b). Three out of 28 regional lymph nodes had metastatic lesions of the neoplasm. Interestingly， the metastatic lesions also contained adenocarcinomatous as well as choriocarcinomatous components with immunoreaction of HCG. Immunostaining of Cytokeratin(CK) 7 was strongly positive for all neoplastic cells in the all layers of the stomach. However， CK 20 was negative in any tumor cells. Furthermore， Carcinoembryonic Antigen (CEA) was clearly positive in the cells of adenocarcinomatous features. Production of Alpha-Fetoprotein (AFP) was not recognized in any tumor cells of this tiimor.**\n\n【24】**Histology ofthetumorlocated on theposterior wall of pylorus was a combined type of well differentiated and moderately differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma . The carcinoma was growing only in the mucosal layer. It is assumed that the tumor in the pylorus had multifocal origin， since the carcinoma was a combined type andsome normal epithelium was remained among the neoplastic epithelium. The tumor did not contain any trophoblastic components. HCG， CEA and AFP were not immunoreactive. CK 7 was partially positive in the tumor tissues， although CK 20 was negative.**\n\n【25】**Postoperatively， the patient has been stable， and no evidence showing possibility of malignancy in other organs including ovary and uterus was recognized. She had taken S-1 for six months as adjuvant chemotherapy \\[8，9\\]. The recurrence and metastases of the gastric cancer have not been recognized for a year. However， the patient unfortunately died two years after the operation due to the**\n\n【26】**abdominal dissemination of the neoplasm.**\n\n【27】**Discussion**\n\n【28】**Presently， HCG positive syncytiotrophoblast type cells came into existence mainly in the layers of muscularis propria and subserosa， not in the mucosal area where was present only the cells with features of adenocarcinoma. Thus， choriocarcinomatous differentiation is suggested to occur during the down growth of the tumor. In this case， typical mix of cytotrophoblast and syncytiotrophoblastic elements as seen in representative choriocarcinomas was not apparent. However， clear cells lacking HCG activity often coexisted with syncytiotrophoblast type cells in the submucosal area. Furthermore， morphology ofthese cells resembles cytotrophoblasts of trophoblastic neoplasms. Accordingly。appearance of such cell population was suggested to be an evidence for the choriocarcinomatous differentiation of the adenocarcinoma.**\n\n【29】**Cytogenetic study on the gastric choriocarcinoma also supports the theory that gastric choriocarcinoma arises from alternate differentiation pathway of adenocarcinoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Although， HCG-producing cells were not confirmed in the normal antrum mucosa in this study， some authors reported presence of immunoreactive cells against beta subunit of HCG in the neck region of normal antral mucosa \\[11，12\\]. Such specific feature of the stomach might be related to the choriocarcinomatous differentiation.**\n\n【30】**In this case， synchronous development of two separated carcinomas was present in the stomach of the woman. Furthermore， the intramucosal carcinoma in the pre-pylorus was suggested to be multifocal. There is evidence that some of larger early gastric carcinomas may result from collision of smaller neoplasms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Thus， existence of multiple cancers in the stomach of this woman implies a higher oncogenesis stage of this organ. The concept of field cancerization is recognized in different human organs. Regarding the mechanism of field cancerization of human stomach， genetic instability in the mucosal cells is suggested to relate 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. Meanwhile， McDonald et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u> reported from the analysis using mitochondrial DNA mutations that human gastric body units are clonal and contain multiple multipotential stem cells， thereby mutated gastric stem cells spread widely within the stomach. In the present case， the patient developed two separated gastric carcinomas， one of which accompanied choriocarcinomatous differentiation. Similar case with double carcinomas of the stomach is reported by Eom et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. Recently， collision tumor of choriocarcinoma and small cell carcinoma of the stomach was reported by Fukuda et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. In the present case， the carcinoma with choriocarcinomatous differentiation showed the staining pattern of CK 7 positive and CK 20 negative. Similar staining pattern of cytokeratin is also confirmed in a gastric carcinoma with choriocarcinomatous differentiation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. CK 7 is evaluated as an accurate intracellular marker to assess the purity of human placental villous trophoblast 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. Choriocarcinomatous differentiation may be concerned with function of some cytokeratin， although evidence is uncertain.**\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**1\\.

He is referred to the Radiology Department of the Fann University Hospital Center for a chest X-ray. The latter showed a right apical pulmonary destruction with tracheal attraction associated with a rounded opacity surmounted by crescent air giving the classic appearance of a fungus ball . Diffuse bilateral reticulonodular opacities are also noted. The diagnosis of an aspergillar graft on pulmonary tuberculosis is retained and the patient is referred to the pulmonary department for therapeutic management.**\n\n【13】Aspergilloma is the development of the fungus (Aspergillus) in situ in a pre-existing cavity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.
