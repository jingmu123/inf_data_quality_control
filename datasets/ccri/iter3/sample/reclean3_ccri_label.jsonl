SBMA characterized by bulbar and limb muscle weakness， atrophy， and fasciculation. The weakness could be symmetrical or asymmetrical， involving proximal and distal muscles. Also， SBMA is associated with endocrine abnormalities due to resistance to androgen， causing defective spermatogenesis leading to gynecomastia and infertility 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>.\n\n【5】William Kennedy first defined SBMA as a lower motor neuron and bulbar muscle degenerative disease in 1968. The incidence is 1/30，000 male births 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. It is caused by the repeated expansion of CAG on the X chromosome. The age of presentation depends on the numbers of CAG repeats， with an average of 43 years but varying from 18 to 64 years. Weakness in the limbs， cramping， and tremors， as well as dysarthria， dysphagia， tongue fasciculation， and nasal speech， are the most prevalent complaints. The progression of the disease is slow， an estimated 2% decrease in muscle strength per year， measured by quantitative muscle testing (QMT)通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. Therefore， until late disease， these patients have good function and mobility preservation； however， involvement in the gait and hip muscles can limit the patients to a wheelchair. Usually， they have a normal life span until the involvement of bulbar and respiratory muscles， resulting in aspiration 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. Symptoms such as twitching of the muscle without loss of muscle strength are present in heterozygous females.\n\n【6】Since many of the clinical characteristics of SBMA are comparable to other neurodegenerative diseases such as Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and late-onset Tay-Sachs disease， a definitive diagnosis is always required 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. We present a unique case of a 53-year-old Hispanic patient present in our institute.\n\n【7】Case Presentation\n\n【8】A 53-year-old right-handed Hispanic man with a history ofessentialtremor presented with a 6-7month history of progressive weakness and cramps in his lower extremities followed by weakness in the upper extremities. Initially， he noticed difficulty in walking more than a block due to pain and weakness in his legs. Three months later， he developed pain in his lower back， and he realized that he could not lift his arms above his head at work because of weakness. He felt fatigued quickly with physical activity. His older brother reportedly had a similar weakness for some time.\n\n【9】On examination， he was alert and responsive. His neurologic examination showed normal删除表格换行denotation， but dysarthria was noted. He had bilateral facial weakness， more prominent around the orbicularis oculi， and there were fasciculation and atrophy of the tongue. Other cranial nerves were normal. His motor examination showed wasting of the bilateral triceps， biceps， and deltoid muscles. Fasciculation was noted in the right deltoid， biceps and triceps. The tremor was observed in both hands and chin. Motor strength tested on the Motor Research Council(MRC) scale was as follows： Neck Muscles： Flexion 4/5， Extension4+/5， Deltoid， Biceps， and Triceps 4/5 bilaterally.\n\n【10】Table 1： Sensory Nerve conduction study.

Reflexes， Biceps/ Triceps， and Patella were 1+ bilaterally； Ankle Jerks were absent， No Babinski noted. He was able to walk without support. Cerebellar and sensory exam was normal.\n\n【13】Diagnostic workup： MRI of the cervical and lumbar spine was ordered to evaluate possible radiculopathy given the history of back pain with weakness. MRI of the Lumbar Spine reported bilateral L5 pars defects and mild degenerative changes. MRI cervical spine showed mild to moderate degenerative spondylosis of the cervical spine with no significant focal disc herniation. Because of bulbar symptoms and facial weakness， MRI of the brain was also ordered， and it was normal. In addition，comprehensive blood work and Nerve Conduction Study (NCS)/Electromyography (EMG) was performed. Blood work was significant for mildly elevated liver enzymes and CPK. The neuropathy panel was normal， including serum and urine immunoelectrophoresis.\n\n【14】Nerve conduction study ：\n\n【15】normal peak latencies and Conduction Velocities (CVs) in the bilateral median and ulnar nerves； however， normal left radial and bilateral sural sensory responses were noted in the Lower Extremities(LE).\n\n【16】Motor Nerve Conduction Studies in multiple motor nerves in the left upper and lower extremities were normal in distal latencies， amplitudes， and CVs. There was no conduction block noted.\n\n【17】Needle EMG  performed in three limbs， and thoracic paraspinal muscles showed widespread active denervation，including fibrillation， positive waves， and fasciculation potentials. In addition， limb muscles showed large Motor Unit Action Potentials (MUAPs) with increase polyphasicunits， consistent with chronicre-innervation. MUAPs recruitment was also reduced in multiple muscles.\n\n【18】In Summary， the electrodiagnostic findings showed diffuse active and chronic denervation in multiple muscles of three limbs and in the thoracic paraspinal muscles， suggested Motor Neuron Disease(MND)； however， low Sensory Nerve Action Potentials (SNAPs) are not typically seen in MNDs such as Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis(ALS) or its variant， Progressive Muscular Atrophy (PMA).\n\n【19】During his visit for electromyography， additional clinical examination showed gynecomastia and testicular atrophy. Clinical findings in conjunction with electrodiagnostic data were consistent with the diagnosis of Kennedy Disease， which was confirmed with gene testing.\n\n【20】Discussion\n\n【21】SBMA is a rare hereditary motor neuron disorder also associated with endocrine abnormalities. Typically bulbar weakness follows the删除表格换行limb weakness； however，limb weakness is occasionally the presenting complaint. Involvement of the bulbar musculature may be expressed as difficulty in chewing， swallowing， and speaking 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>.\n\n【22】Table 2： Motor Nerve Conduction Study\n\n| Nerre and site  | Lat ms  | Amp mV  | Segment  | Dist mm  | Lat Diff ms  | CV m/s  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Median.L to Abductar pallics brevis (C8-T1).L  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Wrist  | 3.2  | 7.5  | Abductar pallics brevis (C8-T1)-Wrist  | 70  | 3.2  |  |\n| Elbow  |  | 6.8  | Wrist-Elbow  | 230  | 3.8  | 61  |\n| Axilla  | 9.3  | 6.4  | Elbow-Axilla  | 160  | 2.3  | 70  |\n| Ulnar.L to Abductor digiti minimi m.(C8-T1).L  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Wrist  | 3.1  | 9.3  | Abductar digiti minimi m.(C8-T1)-Wrist  | 70  | 3.1  |  |\n| Below elbow  | 6.5  | 8.7  | Wrist-Below elbow  | 220  | 3.4  | 65  |\n| Above elbow  | 8.5  | 8.1  | Below elbow-Above elbow  | 120  | 2  | 60  |\n| Peroneal.L to Extensar digitarum brevis (L4-S1).L  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Ankle  | 3.9  | 7.1  | Extensor digitorum brevis (L4-S1)-Ankle  | 90  | 3.9  |  |\n| Fibula(head)  | 9.6  | 7  | Ankle-Fibula(head)  | 280  | 5.7  | 49  |\n| Popliteal fossa  | 11.6  | 6.7  | Fibula(head)-Popliteal fassa  | 100  | 2  | 50  |\n| Tibial.L to Abductor hallucis (S1-S2)L  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Ankle  | 3.9  | 6.4  | Abductor hallucis (S1-S2)-Ankle  | 90  | 3.9  |  |\n| Popliteal fossa  | 10.8  | 5.1  | Ankle-Popliteal fossa  | 350  | 6.9  | 51  |\n| Median.R to Abductor pallics brevis (C8-T1).R  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Wrist  | 3.1  | 7.8  | Abductor pollics brevis (C8-T1)-Wrist  | 70  | 3.1  |  |\n| Elbow  | 7.4  | 6.5  | Wrist-Elbow  | 230  | 4.3  | 53  |\n| Axilla  | 9.5  | 6.4  | Elbow-Axilla  | 140  | 2.1  | 67  |\n\n【24】Examination of the cranial nerves usually shows evidence of weakness in the facial， palatal， and tongue muscles. Fasciculations are seen easily in affected muscles. Muscle strength shows a classic pattern of proximal-greater-than-distal weakness， beginning in the legs. However， Ferrante and Wilbourn showed the variation of initial weakness ranging from symmetry to asymmetry， from proximal to distal predominant weakness， and from the upper extremity to lower extremity 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. Reflexes are variable， ranging from normal to depressed and are usually absent at the ankles. Generally， no upper motor neuron dysfunction occurs in these patients 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. The sensation is often clinically normal to the modalities of vibration perception， position sense， sharp touch， and light touch， despite the demonstration of abnormalities in electrophysiological studies 通用删除6(英):<u>[8，9]</u>.\n\n【25】Gynecomastia is probably the most common non-neurologic finding on examination， but it is not a criterion for diagnosis. Testicular atrophy and erectile dysfunction may be present and typically occur in advanced cases. The study by Alves et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u> defined the case of SBMA as tremors in extremities with weakness and fasciculation in limbs， atrophy， and fasciculation of the tongue， like our patient.\n\n【26】Diagnostic Work\n\n【27】Depending on the clinical presentation and positive familyhistory， immediate genetic testing for SBMA may be performed to confirm the diagnosis， eliminating the other tests； however， usually， like in our patient， this is not the case. Our patient was initially evaluated and treated for lumbar radiculopathy and essential tremors. His older brother probably also had SBMA； however， the diagnosis was删除1换行never confirmed. In addition， appropriate initial testing is indicated because of associated conditions in these patients， such as diabetes mellitus， lipid disorders， and other endocrine disorders.\n\n【28】Some following differential diagnoses should be considered while performing diagnostic workup or if gene testing is negative.\n\n【29】1. Multilevel cervical spondylosis， ifthe patient does not show bulbar signs on presentation.\n\n【30】2. Early presentation of ALS without the manifestation of upper motor neuron signs yet.\n\n【31】3. Adult-onset of spinal muscular atrophy\n\n【32】4. Late-onset Tay-Sachs disease (GM2 gangliosidosis).\n\n【33】5. Motor neuron syndromeswithlymphoproliferative disorders： Lymphoma (Hodgkinornon-Hodgkin)， multiple myeloma， chronic lymphocytic leukemia， Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia.\n\n【34】6. Motor neuron syndromes in lung， breast， and other cancers can produce an indirect paraneoplastic degeneration of the motor neiirons.\n\n【35】The patients with SBMA and ALS usually have high Creatine Kinase (CK) level as it was noted in our patient 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u> and high liver enzymes because of the rapid loss of muscle fibers secondary to denervation. Sometimes based on high CK， they are given the wrong diagnosis and treatment， such as inflammatory myopathy.\n\n【36】Electrodiagnostic studies\n\n【37】NCS and needle EMG are a standard part of the evaluation of SBMA and other motor neuron disease. EDX studies are most helpful when clinical findings to support the diagnosis of SBMA are limited.\n\n【38】In general， the electrodiagnostic evaluation includes multiple\n\n【39】Needle EMG Examination删除表格换行motor and sensory conduction studies in two or three limbs and detail needle EMG of multiple muscles in three or four limbs， thoracic paraspinal region， and/or bulbar region.\n\n| Muscle  | InsertionActivity  | Spontaneous Activity  |  |  |  | VolitionalMUAPs  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Muscle  | InsertionActivity  | Fiba  | PSW  | Fase  | Other  | Poly  | Amp  | Dur  | Rate  | Pattern  | Effort  |\n| 1s dorsal interasseaus (C7-T1).R  | Increasec  | 2+  | 2+  | 3+  |  | Few  | Incr  | Incr  | Norma  | Min Red  | Normal  |\n| Biceps brachii (C5-C6).R  | Increased  | 1+  | 2+  | 2+  | CRD  | Few  | Iner  | Iner  | Iner  | Min Red  | Normal  |\n| Triceps brachii (C6-C8).R  | Increased  | 3+  | 3+  | 1+  |  | None  | Incr  | Iner  | Norma  | Mod Rec  | Normal  |\n| Flexor carpi radialis (C6-C7).  | Increased  | 3+  | 2+  | 2+  | CRD  | Few  | SlIncr  | SlIncr  | Normal  | Normal  | Normal  |\n| Tibialis anterior (L4-L5).R  | Increasec  | 2+  | 3+  | 2+  |  | Few  | Sllncr  | SlIncr  | Normal  | Mod Rec  | Normal  |\n| Gastrocnemius (Medial head) (S1-S2J.R  | Increased  | 2+  | 3+  | 1+  |  | Few  | Iner  | Iner  | Normal  | Normal  | Normal  |\n| Vastus Lateralis (L2-L4).R  | Increasec  | 1+  | 2+  | 1+  | CRD  | Few  | Iner  | Iner  | Iner  | Mod Red  | Normal  |\n| Gluteus medius (L4-S1).R  | Increasec  | 2+  | 3+  | 删除8:<u>门 </u> | CRD  | Few  | Incr  | Iner  | Iner  | Min Red  | Normal  |\n| T11 paraspinal.R  | Increased  | 2+  | 2+  | 删除8:<u>门 </u> |  | None  | Normal  | Normal  | Normal  | Normal  | Normal  |\n| 1st dorsal interasseaus (C7-T1).L  | Increasec  | 0  | 2+  | 2+  |  | None  | Incr  | Incr  | Normal  | Normal  | Normal  |\n| Biceps brachii (C5-C6).L  | Increased  | 1+  | 2+  | 0  | CRD  | Few  | Iner  | Incr  | Iner  | Mod Red  | Normal  |\n| Triceps brachii (C6-C8)L  | Increased  | 2+  | 2+  | 2+  | CRD  | Few  | Incr  | Incr  | Iner  | Mod Red  | Normal  |\n\n【41】Motor nerve conduction study is usually normal； however， loss of motor axons in severely atrophic muscles can cause reduction of the CMAP amplitude， and it may be associated with mild slowing of conduction velocity. Motor conduction block should be absent.\n\n【42】Sensory nerve conduction study is typically normal in MNDs； however， in SBMA，SNAPs are usually lower despite normal sensory examination like in our patient. The literature also supports these findings. Ferrante MA， Wilbourn AJ evaluated 19 patients with Kennedy's disease and found that the SNAPs abnormalities were high通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>.\n\n【43】The Needle EMG examination is always abnormal.It shows combined features of acute and chronic denervation and reinnervation. Acute denervation findings include fibrillations and positive sharp waves. Fasciculations should be present in multiple muscles of the limbs and thoracic paraspinal. Chronic denervation and reinnervation findings include large-amplitude； long-duration， MUAPs with neurogenic recruitment， and a reduced interference pattern should be present in multiple muscles oflimbs.\n\n【44】The EMG abnormalities noted in muscles of patients with SBMA or in other MNDs are not pathognomonic for the disease but can be seen in any disease-causing active and ongoing chronic denervation， such as in diffuse motor neuropathy or multilevel cervical and lumbar radiculopathy. However， the diagnosis should be suggested by the observation of similar abnormalities in many muscles of proximal and distal limbs， in the absence of radiologic abnormality of corresponding nerve root compression. In addition， denervation should be present in the thoracic paraspinal and bulbar muscles.\n\n【45】Histopathology examination reveals depletion of motor neuronal cell bodies in the brainstem and spinal cord. Muscle biopsy shows atrophy， splitting， centralized nuclei， and fiber degeneration of muscle fibers. There are also changes in the white brain matter that show frontal lobe hypometabolism 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>.\n\n【46】In Summary， the EDX features of SBMA are consistent with diffuse， slowly progressive chronic degeneration ofanterior horn cells删除1换行coupled with a sensory neuropathy/neuronopathy (degeneration of dorsal root ganglia).\n\n【47】Conclusion\n\n【48】The clinical findings of our case are compatible with the cases present in the literature and give an understanding that， although SBMA is uncommon， it must also be taken into consideration in the differential diagnosis of motor neuron disease 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>. In order to obtain the right diagnosis， it is important to avoid delaying the diagnosis and ineffective treatment. In addition， it is always necessary to assess the patients clinically with thorough neurological examinations， to perform necessary testing such as appropriate labs， neuroimaging (If indicated) and electrophysiological studies along with genetic testing. As SMBA is often confused with other neurodegenerative diseases， adequate diagnosis can prevent excessive delay in management and allow appropriate genetic counseling.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

From 2015 onwards， the observed order of serovars prevalence was Typhimurium， Enteritidis， or Infantis according to the year， followed by Newport. In the United States， it was S. typhimurium， Enteritidis followed by Newport， and monophasic Typhimurium 4，通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>， 12：i：-. S. enteritidis， Typhimurium， monophasic Typhimurium1，4，通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>，12：i-， Infantis， and Newport in the European Union 通用删除6(英):<u>[8，9]</u>. Although the role of animal-based foods in the transmission of this pathogen to humans has been previously demonstrated， the prevalence of Salmonella serovars in these products is not yet fully understood. The prevalence in different food matrices varies according to countries and regions， influenced both by culture and food production practices， as well as by geographic location and economic power. Furthermore， production animals are often asymptomatic carriers， and after entering the slaughterhouse， Salmonella can be transferred to other substrates during industrial processing 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>.\n\n【15】Salmonella typhimurium represented29.4% ofthetotal(918/3，113isolates) being the main serovar agent of salmonellosis in Brazil. The results reported here confirm that the Typhimurium serovar shows a cosmopolitan profile. It is considered an example of a generalist serovar. Therefore， these results corroborate those associated with S. typhimurium and its monophasic variant from a global point of view confirming that pork meat is the main source of this serovar. Thus， it is not surprising that it ranks second in Europe 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u> and third in the United States 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u> in reports of human salmonellosis. Despite the decrease in the number of diseases caused by S. Enteritidis this serovar ranked second with 20.8%(647/3，113 isolates) of the total.In this study， S. enteritidis was found to be the most prevalent serovar associated with human cases up to 2014. This is in agreement with the global increase in the incidence of this serovar since the 1980s associated with consumption of eggs and poultry and its decrease in the 2010s. It’s followed by S. Infantis with 5.1%(159/3，113 isolates). Table 1 details the top 10 serovars of each year in the analyzed period. Most of these serovars have a wide host range that can colonize several animals and are primarily transmitted to humans bv foods of animal origin， such as raw meat， pork， poultry， and eggs. Seafood， fruits and vegetables can also serve as vehicles 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Several countries reported S. typhimurium， S. enteritidis， and S. Infantis as being the most related to enteric and invasive diseases in humans 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. In 2015 S. Heidelberg emerged among the main serotypes causing human salmonellosis with the peak of cases in 2016， becoming the second most common删除1换行serovar. However， as of 2017， the frequency of serotyped strains such as S. Heidelberg from humans began to decrease， thus leaving the ranking of the 5 most frequently isolated serovars in humans as of2019.\n\n【16】In conclusion we present important data on the main Salmonella serotypes that have caused human salmonellosis in Brazil over the past ten years. Tracing the profile of circulating serotypes is the first step to understanding the epidemiology， and with this data produces actions to mitigate and control this pathogen.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

It affects 6 per 100，000 with the highest prevalence in males， whites， and people with 60 years of age or older， with age increasing both， its prevalence and incidence. Potential risk factors for ALS include family history， heavy manual labored occupations， football， agricultural work， pesticides， chemicals， smoking and electric shocks 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>.\n\n【11】The primary symptoms include unilateral but progressive weakness in the distal limbs without remission and relapse. Atypical presentation can include weight loss， cognitive impairment， emotional alteration and fasciculations. Muscle cramps and twitches with positive Babinski sign is also seen 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. The duration between the onset of symptoms and diagnosis of ALS is about a year. And by that time nearly 50% to 70% of motor neurons become nonfunctional通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. The Cleveland group， based on experimental design hypothesizes that the onset of disease is due to the vulnerability of motor neuron itself， whereas disease progression is the result of immune responses characterized by neuroinflammation，particularly the activation of microglia 通用删除6(英):<u>[2，3]</u>.\n\n【12】In the early 1990s， riluzole (rilutek)， a putative blocker of glutamate release， was established as the first drug for ALS. Riluzole became the gold standard drug which paved the way for newly formulated drugs in the treatment of amyotrophiclateral sclerosis. There are currently five drugs for the management of ALS， namely Rilutek， Tiglutik， Exservan，Radicava and Nuedexta 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. The first three being different formulations of generic Riluzole. Furthermore， Neudexta is indicated for the treatment of certain unspecific neurologic symptoms， but not for ALS itself.\n\n【13】FDA has approved a new oral drug named “Relyvrio” for the treatment of ALS in adults 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. Experts had concerns regarding the effectiveness of the drug which were ruled out in updated clinical trials data. Relyvrio is a compound of two drugs， sodium phenylbutyrate and taurursodiol. Sodium phenylbutyrate helps in elimination of ammonia from the body while taurursodiol helps liver in detoxification 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>.\n\n【14】The drug formerlyknown as AMX0035 can be taken orally or be administered through a feeding tube 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. Relyvrio is taken within 1 h of its preparation either orally or through feeding tube. Initial dosing is one packet per day for starting three weeks (3 weeks) followed by a maintenance dose of one packet twice daily.\n\n【15】The efficacy of Relyvrio was tested in a 24-week multicenter， randomized， double-blind，placebo-controlled，parallel group study. The trial showed that the patients treated with relyvrio had a slower decline in daily functioning with longer overall survival as observed， as compared to controls on placebo 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>.\n\n【16】The pathophysiological mechanism of action is aimed to reduce endoplasmic reticulum stress and mitochondrial dysfunction associated with protein misfolding and aggregation， the ultimate pathogenesis of ALS. Some potential side effects seen with the administration of relyvrio were diarrhea， abdominal pain， nausea， and upper respiratory tract infection. Taurursodiol， a bile acid， can affect patients with problems associated with enterohepatic circulation of bile acids， thus patients with liver dysfunction or with other known comorbid should consult a specialist before删除1换行intake. The prescribing information lists additional risks associated with relyvrio's administration 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. It’s not known whether it's contraindicated in pregnantladies or children.\n\n【17】ALS is a debilitating disease with a difficult diagnosis， poor prognosis， shorter survival periods and currently has no cure 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. With the advances being made in drug therapies， relyvrio can be a breakthrough in the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis， with its enhancing effects on life expectancy，as compared to the old drugs in use for ALS. More studies investigating the efficacy and efficiency of Relyvrio in patients with ALS and other related neurological disorders and comorbidities are required to give a better insight of the long-term outcomes of the usage of drug for which longer and larger trials are required.\n\n【18】删除6:<u>2.上Boillee S， Yamanaka K， Lobsiger CS， Copeland NG， Jenkins NA， Kassiotis G， et al.

The common genetic factor that is associated with T2D is single nucleotide polymorphism. The aim of the present study was to assess the association between rs5219 of the KCNJ11 gene and rs11196205of the TCF7L2 gene with diabetes type 2. Total of 300 samples (150 T2DM patients and 150 non-diabetic controls) together with demographic factors were taken from public and private hospitals of the Southern Punjab. This was a case-control study and contained 150 T2D patients and 150controlled samples. To analyze the polymorphisms in KCNJ11 and TCF7L2， PCR-RFLP and Tetra-arm PCR were used. The findings of this study were that in KCNJ11 gene， homozygous AA genotype was predominant (83.33%) than the GG genotype (14%) and heterozygous genotype GA was present in very a small amount (2.66%) while in case of TCF7L2 gene， CC 28.00%， GG 27.33%and GC 44.67%. The insignificant statistical association was found between rs5219， rs11196205 and T2D as p-value of KCNJ11 (rs5219) is 0.4125 and TCF7L2 (rs11196205) is 0.6. The conclusion of this study is that rs5219 of the KCNJ11 gene and rs11196205 of TCF7L2 gene are not associated with diabetes type 2 in the Southern Punjab population.\n\n【2】Keywords： KCNJ11； TCF7L2； PCR-RFLP； Tetra-arm PCR； Insignificant\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus is a chronic multifactorial disorder described by high blood glucose level (hyperglycemia)， which is due to the resistance of insulin or lower insulin secretion 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Both genetic and environmental factors play a significant role in the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Environmental factors are age， obesity， lack of physical activity， hypertension， diet， and smoking 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. International Diabetes Federation reported that in 2017， the number of patients with diabetes was 425 million and this ratio will increase to 629 million in 2045 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. Pakistan is South Asia Country and diabetes and obesity is more common in South Asia. 12，000 deaths are noted every year in Pakistan due to diabetes. Different studies revealed that people in urban areas are more affected by this disease due to lack of physical activity， hypertension， and intake ofhigh-calorie food 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. For diabetes， Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) identified different susceptibility genes. Genetic factor is more involved in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus because of Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. Different studies found many genes that are associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Among these genes， the potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily J member 11 (KCNJ11) gene and TCF7L2 gene are the main candidate genes for the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus. KCNJ11 gene is situated on the human chromosome at 11p15.1 and consists of one exon with no intronic sequences 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. Inward rectifier potassium ion channel (Kir6.2) protein is encoded by this gene. KCNJ11 gene plays a significant role in the secretion of insulin. Kir6.2 protein with Sulfonylurea Receptor 1 (SUR1)， forms K， channel 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. In the K channel， when these two proteins are combined then it mediates the secretion of insulin 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>. When the level of glucose increases then it results in the closing ofthe K， channel and activation of voltage-gated calcium channels. The Channel of K allows the potassium ions entry. The Intracellular level of calcium ion increases when the cell membrane becomes depolarized due to the increased amount of potassium ions and result in insulin secretion 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>. Insulin production and its secretion are controlled through glucose metabolism by the K， channel. Many KCNJ11 gene SNPs have been identified and among these SNPs， rs5219 has been gaining more consideration for its association with type2 diabetes mellitus 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>. KCNJ11 gene polymorphism rs5219 is caused when at codon 23， glutamic acid is substituted into lysine amino acid 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>. In this variation， guanine is changed into adenine. The Sensitivity of the potassium channel is reduced due to this variation and this substitution caused删除1换行insulin resistance and leads to diabetes mellitus 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>.\n\n【5】The genes which are elaborate in the cell multiplication and distinctness are regulated by the Transcription Factor 7-like 2 genes(TCF7L2) 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>. This gene contains the High Mobility Group (HMG) box and also elaborates in the Wnt signaling channel that plays the principal role in galactose stability and this gene is the master regulator of the proinsulin a nuclear receptor for B-catenin is encoded by this gene that involved in lipid metabolism. Variants of TCF7L2gene increased the risk of T2DM with an impaired insulin secretion showed a strong association 通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u>. Wnt wave channel is essential during normal functioning and this function is done by the same receptors in which Frizzled (Fz) and LDL receptor-related proteins are included 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>. B-catenin is also important for the activation of many genes when it binds to the TCF receptor. In which Glucagon-Like-Peptide-1(GLP-1) is also included in this way the beta-catenin level is increased and also increased the growth of beta cells. When the mutation in the TCF7L2 gene impaired the secretion glucagon-like peptide-1 due to which production of insulin is low and beta-catenin level also reduced， also disturb the beta-cell proliferation 通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>.\n\n【6】Objectives of this study was to determine the SNP association with body mass index， fasting blood glucose， random blood glucose in controlled and cases subiects. The aim of this study was to determine the correlation between rs5219 of KCNJ11 gene and rs11196205 of TCF7L2 with type 2 diabetes mellitus in the population of Southern Punjab， if any.\n\n【7】Materialand Method\n\n【8】Study participants\n\n【9】A total of 300 were selected for the analysis including 150 cases and 150 controlled subjects from government and private hospitals of the Southern Punjab.\n\n【10】Data collection\n\n【11】To study the epidemiological factors such as age， gender， body mass index， smoking， and personal medical history， questionnaire was conducted for this purpose.\n\n【12】Anthropometric and biochemical evaluation\n\n【13】By using a standard protocol， anthropometric measurements such as height， weight， and waist were acquired. The calculation of BMI was done by dividing the body weight in kilograms by square of height in meters. A routine investigation of patients such as fasting and random blood glucose level， HbA1c was measured.\n\n【14】DNA extraction\n\n【15】In EDTA tubes， Sample of blood (3ml to 5 ml) from each participant was preserved and kept at -4℃ for storage. Inorganic DNA extraction method was used for DNA extraction and DNA was collected from the collected samples of blood and stored at-20C.\n\n【16】Genotyping KCNJ11 E23K Variant\n\n【17】For amplification of KCNJ11E23K polymorphic region，\n\n【18】PCR-RFLP method was used for this purpose， Oligonucleotide primersSsequences55GACTCTGCAGTGAGGCCCTA 3 and5'ACGTTGCAGTTGCCTTTCTT 3were used. Master Mix of 25 ul was prepared that consist of 3 pl DNA， 2 ul of 25 mM MgCl。 2 pl dNTPs， 12 pmol ofeach primer， 1 pl Taq polymerase and 5 ul Buffer. The amplification started with a preliminary denaturing step at 94C for 5 min along with 28 cycles of 94°C for 30 s， annealing at 59°C for30 s， and ultimate extension at 72°C for 30 s with a final elongation step at 72°C for 5 min. 209 bp PCR product was analyzed on 1.8%agarose gel electrophoresis. PCR product was restricted by Ban II enzyme. Restriction was carried out in volume of 20 u1. 8 ul PCR product，1 ul Ban II enzyme， 5 ul tango buffer and 6 ul distilled water. Keep it at 37 for °C sixteen hours. By electrophoresis on 3% agarose gel， restriction products were separated and presence of bands was shown under the fluorescence of UV light. 100 bp ladder was used to know the exact position of particular band size which differentiated the genotypes of KCNJ11 i.e.， for 150， 59 bp (GG)， 150， 59， 209 bp(GA) and 209 bp (AA).\n\n【19】Genotyping of TCF7L2 rs11196205 variants\n\n【20】The genotyping of rs11196205 (C/G) was done by the Tetra-ARMS-PCR(Tetra Primer Amplification Polymerase Chain Reactions) for the detection of single nucleotide polymorphism in TCF7L2 gene. The primer that was designed and their product size for rs11196205 in TCF7L2 gene is following and mention in this table.\n\n【21】Master Mix of 25 ul was prepared that consist of 3 pl DNA，2ul of 25 mM MgCl。 2 pl dNTPs， 12 pmol of each primer， 1 pl Taq polymerase and 5 pl Buffer. The amplification started with a denaturation followed by 30 cycles in which initial denaturation at95°C for 6 min， final denaturation at 95°C， annealing at 64°C for 45s， and elongation at 72°C for 45s and a final elongation step at 72C for6 min. PCR product was analyzed on 2% agarose gel electrophoresis and presence ofbands was shown under the fluorescence of UV light.100 bp ladder was used to know the exact position ofparticular band size which differentiated the genotypes of TCF7L2 i.e.， for 235 (GG)，253(CC)and 434(GC).\n\n【22】Statistical analysis\n\n【23】Minitab  software was used for analyzing the results. The significance level was considered at P<0.05. The correlation between DM and all demographical variables was studied by using binary logistic regression followed by logistic regression analysis which was carried out to find the association between DM and selected biochemical factors. A Chi-square test was performed for determining the risk factors frequency between control and diabetic patients. Also， the frequency of genotypes was determined by direct counting whereas，the frequency of alleles was found out with the help of Hardy Weinberg equilibrium calculator and to find the correlation between diabetes and rs5219 (SNP) of the KCNJ11 Chi-square test was applied.\n\n【24】Table 1： Primers and the product size of TCF7L2 genotypes.\n\n| S.NO  | SNP  | Primer Type  | Sequence  | Amplification Size  | Product Size  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1  | rs11196205  | Inner Forward  | CTGAAAGTTCTCAACATTTATAACTGCC  | 434bp  | C：253bpG：235bp  |\n| 1  | rs11196205  | Inner Reverse  | CAACCATAACTCTCTTACATACTGGTC  | 434bp  | C：253bpG：235bp  |\n| 1  | rs11196205  | Outer Fonward  | TAGATTGTCTCCTTTTGTTTCTGCTAC  | 434bp  | C：253bpG：235bp  |\n| 1  | rs11196205  | Outer Reverse  | TAAACATCTGACCTTGAAGCCTACC  | 434bp  | C：253bpG：235bp  |\n\n【26】Results\n\n【27】Genotyping of KCNJ11(rs5219)\n\n【28】KCNJ11 PCR amplification was carried out and produced a band size of 209 bp as shown in Figure 1.\n\n【29】The 209 bp band was digested with ban 2 enzyme and gave different genotypes pattern such as GG： 59 bp and 150 bp， AA： 209bp， GA： 59 bp， 150 bp and 209 bp .\n\n【30】Tetra-ARM-PCR for TCF7L2 analysis\n\n【31】The Tetra-ARM-PCR forTCF7L2 (rs11196205 C/G) that give the amplification of following products size in which 434 bp band as a control， 253 bp C wild type allele and 235 for the G mutant allele.\n\n【32】Association of various demographic and biochemical factors with diabetes\n\n【33】Through binarylogistic regression， different demographic factors were contrasted between cases who were suffering from diabetes and healthy individual.

Its characteristics imitate to that of invasive carcinoma. It mostly occurs in females at menopause or after menopause， but rare in children and men. Here we present a case report 37 years old lady having hyperprolactinemia， who came with complain of the stiffness of breast and nipple discharge of milk since 12 to 13 years. Bilateral mammography showed increased density under the left nipple without calcification and dominant mass. Ultrasound of breast evidenced few abnormally dilated ducts in the retro areolar region of left then right nipple. Therefore， the patient was diagnosed with duct ectasia. It is concluded that hyperprolactinemia can also lead to mammary duct ectasia even in women even at a pre-menopausal age.\n\n【2】Keywords： Mammary duct ectasia； Hyperprolactinemia； Nipple discharge\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Mammary duct ectasia is an inflammatory disorder in breast 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. The pathology behind this includes expansion of the main ducts related to intraluminal blocks of histocytes and periductal inflammation 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. The rate of occurrence of mammary duct ectasia can vary from 1.1% to 75.0%， according to the investigative methods utilized， which can be clinical，histopathological， or based on necropsy 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. Mammary duct ectasia mainly influences those females who are undertaking menopause or about to start menopause but can also take place in younger females， males， and infants 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>.\n\n【5】Smoking is a dangerous feature for duct ectasia. It was discovered that smokers were three times more likely to develop the state of duct ectasia than non-smokers 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. This ailment is leading cause among other common reasons of bloody nipple discharge and sub-areolar masses， radiologically and medically imitating persistent carcinoma， while Nipple discharge， in turn， is the third significant frequent sign nearing to breast health centers， chasing lumps and pain 通用删除6(英):<u>[5-7]</u>.\n\n【6】Here， we present a case report of a female who developed duct ectasia before menopausal age with hyperprolactinemia.\n\n【7】Case Presentation\n\n【8】A 37-year-old woman known case of hypertension came at Doctors Hospital and Medical Centre Lahore Punjab， Pakistan with a history of hypertension and stiffness of breast along with the discharge of milk since last 12 to 13 years. On compression of her breast， nipple discharge of milk more on the left side was also observed. The nipple discharge was often drenching through shirts within a few minutes of throwing on them. The menarche of the patient took place at an average age， but with irregular menstrual periods. The patient married at the age of 21-year. The patient had two children. Among those children， the elder child had correctly breastfed， but the younger child had not been appropriately breastfed. The younger child breastfeeding was stopped due to increased prolactin level and bloody nipple discharge. The patient had never been smoked and did not have a family history of cancer.\n\n【9】On examination endocrinology report for prolactin levels was first done. Report showed prolactin level was 79.5 ng/ml (reference range： 5.18-26.53 ng/ml for female). Mammography was performed and evidenced by increased density under the left nipple. However， no dominant mass or suspicious calcification was seen. There was no architectural distortion of the parenchyma，while， lymph nodes were noted in both axillae . Ultrasound of breast exhibited few dilated ducts\n\n【10】Discussion\n\n【11】Mammary duct ectasia is a seditious (causing inflammation) syndrome in the breast which is linked with inflammation and periductal fibrosis of differing extent 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>. This illness is also recognized as comedomastitis， plasma cell mastitis， and cholesterol granuloma. Duct dilatation is generally not indicated in the early stages 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>.\n\n【12】When it is indicative， mainly general medical appearance is mammary discharge 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>. In most of the incidences， no clear abnormalities are present， but in afterward phases， tender sub-areolar masses along with skin renunciation happen， which can be detected as infiltrative carcinoma， which is wrong. The identification of Mammary Duct Ectasia is generally medical. The irregular thickening of the sub-areolar breast tissue and micro-calcifications is mostly identified via mammography. These thickenings can be imitated as carcinoma 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>. The diameter of ducts greater than 5mm can be identified and assessed with the help of ultrasonography通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>.

Constant or repeated disorders are handled with centered surgical removal of the abnormal ducts below the nipple 通用删除6(英):<u>[15，16]</u>. A right way of surgery for duct ectasia is image guided surgery by ductal endoscopy 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>. There are two theories with respect to the pathology of Mammary Duct Ectasia 通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u>.\n\n【14】First， the main pathological route is believed to be unclear with degeneration of the ducts and glands， pursued via ducts expansion， directing to the apathy of secretion， duct burst， and inflammation. The second contributing incident is offered to exist as an inflammatory progression； periductal inflammation being the primary anomaly， pursued by duct sclerosis， obliteration， and duct ectasia. Alternatively， the etiology of duct ectasia is still unidentified. Other influencing factors consist of squamous metaplasia of the terminal duct epithelium， phenothiazine treatment，cigarette smoking， bacteriall!growth， and hyperprolactinemia.L Tobacco smoking is also a hazardous cause for ductal ectasia. While another study revealed that bacterial infection also leads to duct ectasia 通用删除6(英):<u>[19-211</u>. However， this evidence is not enough as a cause of this disorder. An earlier study illustrated a relationship involving unusual prolactin discharge and Mammary Duct Ectasia 通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u>. Shousha et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u> also analyzed that there is a linkage between specific hypothalamic/pituitary ailments， likely correlated with prolactin secretion and progress of mammary duct ectasia in postmenopausal patients. It is suggested that hyperprolactinemia may also lead to mammary duct ectasia. However， further studies are needed to elucidate the process， so that such kind of disorders can be prevented.\n\n【15】Conclusion\n\n【16】It is concluded that there is a strong relationship between hyperprolactinemia and mammary duct ectasia in a pre-menopausal age also.

We may also not fully full rule out the pain from facet pain or muscle pain. Evaluation with MRI should be not conducted in follow-up to assess the potential of ID-PRF to prevent or to aggravate disc degeneration.\n\n【38】It is concluded that the application of ID-PRF is efficient for the conduct of discogenic neck pain regardless of ID-PRF application duration (7-min vs. 15-min).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

It is linked to genetic determinants associated with Human Leukocyte Antigens (especially HLA-A26，HLA-B27，HLA-B39， HLA-B61)，infections (e.g.，Propionibacterium acnes， Staphylococcus aureus， Haemophilus parainfluenzae， Actinomyces)， and immunological factors (e.g.， increased Th17 cells in the peripheral blood， undetectable plasma IL-10 levels) 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>.\n\n【4】Epidemiologically， the annual prevalence of SAPHO syndrome ranges from 0.00144 per 100，000people (in Japan) to nearly 10 in 100，000 (in people of European descent) 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. It generally affects people in middle age and is more frequent in women. Despite its low prevalence， the syndrome can be masked by other diseases， such as invasive neoplasms， so it is important to be familiar with it and know which diagnostic tests are the most appropriate to identify it. Among the available tests， we focus on PET-CT due to its usefulness in supporting and establishing the differential diagnosis(ruling out seronegative spondyloarthropathies， psoriatic arthritis， anterior chest wall syndrome， and neoplasms)， since SAPHO syndrome can be considered a diagnosis of exclusion 通用删除6(英):<u>[3-10]</u>.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】We present the case of a 51-year-old man with an unremarkable pathological history who presented with a constitutional syndrome， following three weeks of joint pain and bouts of fever of up to 39·C. Physical examination revealed pain at the level of the bilateral sternoclavicular junction and in both tibiotalar joints， as well as weakness in the shoulder and pelvic girdle. The patient had no skin changes or other accompanying symptoms.\n\n【7】Blood tests showed leukocytosis (14，700 cells/pL)， neutrophilia (76% neutrophils)， C-reactive protein of 14.63 mg/dL，and an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 65 mm in the first hour. Muscle enzymes (CPK，LDH， aldolase，GOT，GPT) and tumor markers were normal. ANA (<1/80)，ASMA(<1/80)， and anti-LKM(<1/80) titers were negative， as was anti-citrullinated peptide antibody (<1\n\n【8】IU/mL).\n\n【9】Theultrasound showed increasedspace inthe right subacromiodeltoid bursa and at the level of the tibiotalar joint， an increase in the bilateral Doppler flow and diffuse thickening of both Achilles tendons. There was a dramatic increase in the Doppler flow in both metacarpophalangeal joints and an increase in the adjacent soft tissues. The cervical-thoracic-abdominal CT showed bilateral thickening of the sternoclavicular joints ， with increased uptake in the PET images  along with signs of arthropathy in the dorsal column and two instances of spinous apophysitis.\n\n【10】On suspicion of SAPHO syndrome， a bone scintigraphy was requested， confirming increased uptake in the sternoclavicular joints， predominantly the right one .\n\n【11】Discussion\n\n【12】We present a clinical case of an adult male with polyarthralgia and constitutional symptoms， fever， increased acute phase reactants， and imaging tests that helped guide the clinical judgment and establish the differential diagnosis. SAPHO syndrome is an entity that affects middle-aged adults and presents as frequent osteoarticular pain. In most cases， there is true axial and peripheral arthritis (which most frequently affects the sternoclavicular joints)， sternoclavicular and spinal hyperostosis， and recurrent foci of osteitis 通用删除6(英):<u>[3，4，7，8]</u>. The syndrome may be accompanied by skin lesions such as acne， palmoplantar pustulosis， and hidradenitis suppurativa. In fact， skin involvement usually precedes the onset of joint symptoms， although it can occur at any time during the disease. The epidemiology of this entity is difficult to define given its low prevalence (approximately1/10，000 people， with a certain predominance of middle-aged women)， and it frequently goes undetected or has a delayed diagnosis通用删除6(英):<u>[1，10]</u>.\n\n【13】Diagnostic imaging techniques help to establish a differential diagnosis. CT can show the presence ofhyperostosis， bone hyperplasia at the insertion points of the costoclavicular ligament， foci of osteitis， and other chest wall abnormalities at an early stage of the disease通用删除6(英):<u>[11-14]</u>. Whole-body bone scintigraphy can show the classic “bull's head sign\"in approximately a third of patients (reflecting the elevated uptake at the level of the sternal angle and sternoclavicular joint)， which helps to confirm the suspected diagnosis of SAPHO syndrome通用删除6(英):<u>[11，15，16]</u>. Bone scintigraphy is especially important for diagnosing atypical or incomplete forms of SAPHO syndrome (for example， in the absence or atypical presentation of skin lesions) 通用删除6(英):<u>[9，17]</u>. In early stages of the disease， 85% to 95% of cases will present hyper-uptake of the tracer in the anterior part of the thoracic cavity and the characteristic inflammatory involvement of the sternoclavicular and costosternal joints， with true arthritis in 90% of cases 通用删除6(英):<u>[2，8-14]</u>. The chest X-ray was normal in our patient， as is typical in the initial stages ofthe disease 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>.\n\n【14】In recent years， the use of PET-CT for the differential diagnosis of SAPHO has increased notably. These scans can reveal multiple skeletal lesions in the anterior or spinal chest wall，low-moderate FDG uptake，\n\n【15】In our case， no skin lesions were observed. The appearance of these lesions is not essential for reaching the diagnosis， as they can appear after arthritis in 30% to 60% of cases， especially if the patient does not start and maintain adequate treatment. Typical skin involvement includes palmoplantar pustulosis， persistent conglobata acne， and hidradenitis suppurativa 通用删除6(英):<u>[2，3]</u>.\n\n【16】Following the initiation of treatment with a descending regimen of prednisone 30 mg and follow-up in outpatient clinics， the patient reported adequate pain control andpresented synchronous resolution of polyarthralgia and constitutional symptoms. Acute phase reactants showed normalization on successive visits， with no appearance of skin lesions to date. The course of the disease is usually chronic and eventually resolves spontaneously.\n\n【17】In patients who present constitutional syndrome associated with polyarthritis， especially with joint involvement in the anterior part of the thorax， and elevated acute phase reactants， SAPHO syndrome must be included in the differential diagnosis， even without skin alterations. Bone scintigraphy， CT， and PET/CT will help establish the definitive clinical judgment. To the best of our knowledge， this is the first case of SAPHO syndrome presenting as a constitutional syndrome.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

Pseudoporphyria is a related blistering skin condition that shares clinical and histopathologic features of PCT but lacks the enzyme deficiency associated with bullous formation 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. Anticoagulants， mainly heparin， are known to cause various cutaneous eruptions such as skin necrosis， hematomas， and bullae 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. Cutaneous reactions secondary to the initiation of newer direct oral anticoagulants (e.g.，apixaban，rivaroxaban) have rarely been reported in the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>[4-7]</u>. This case report describes an 83-year-old female with stable PCT who presented with acute bullous eruption after recent hospitalization and treatment for extensive bilateral Deep Venous Thromboses (DVT) with apixaban.\n\n【2】Case Presentation\n\n【3】An 83-year-old female with a 10-year history of PCT， in addition to Crohn’s disease and hereditary hemochromatosis presented to her primary care physician with worsening eruption of bullae on her lower extremities. The patient had recently completed a 6-day hospital stay for extensive bilateral lower extremity DVTs and was started on a 7-day course of apixaban 10 mg oral BID. On day 4 of her hospital stay， she developed severallarge， painful， and edematous blisters with seeping serous fluid on her bilateral lower extremities.\n\n【4】A week and a half after hospital discharge， the patient presented to her primary care office in visible distress from her worsening and enlarging bullae， with the largest bulla measuring 10 cmx20 cm. The patient even developed a new serous-filled blister during the visit. Emergency medical services were called， and the patient was taken to a local hospital for better pain control. Further workup revealed full-thickness skin loss with loose skin involving the entire medial aspect of the right calf， a large eschar separating from the deep soft tissues with exposed muscle on the left calf， and additional large serous-filled blisters . The patient was transferred to a high-level burn center for intensive wound care management and surveillance.\n\n【5】During her hospital stay at the burn center， the patient underwent tangential excision and debridement of over 400 cm² of full-thickness lower extremity bullae on two separate occasions. Cultures sent from the wound fluid grew E faecalis， Citrobacter farmeri， and GPR's consistent with diphtheroids， for which the patient was placed on Zosyn. The pathology report of multiple incisional biopsy specimens revealed an entirely denuded epidermis with nonspecific dermal fibrosis and minimal dermal inflammation. Subcutaneous and deep vessel wall calcifications were noted with no evidence of vasculitis. PAS stain with diastase was noncontributory. Thehistopathologic features were compatible with but not specific for porphyria. Immunofluorescence was not performed due to patient preference but was recommended with a repeat biopsy if clinically indicated. The patient underwent two additional debridement procedures the following week with Kerecis fish-skin graft placement to the bilateral lower extremities. At the time of discharge， the patient's Kerecis grafts were dressed in Adaptic dressing and Aquaphor while her skin tears were dressed in Xeroform and Bacitracin. Three weeks post-op，patient had no complications and wounds were slowly healing with Kerecis grafts .\n\n【6】Discussion\n\n【7】Porphyria cutanea tarda is a photodermatosis characterized by fragile， hemorrhagic bullae and erosions with associated milia， hyperpigmentation， and hypertrichosis 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>. PCT typically develops in the 5th or 64h decade of life and risk factors include alcohol use， estrogen use， viral infections，\n\n【8】This study reports a rare case ofpainfulbullae and eschar formation in a patient with a history of well-controlled PCT， Crohn's disease， hereditary hemochromatosis， and recent anticoagulant initiation. Due to the unusual nature of this patient's presentation along with a complex medical history， the etiology behind this eruption was not entirely understood. The differential for this patient included a PCT eruption， bullous hemorrhagic dermatosis， cutaneous Crohn's disease manifestation， autoimmune bullous skin disease， and other subepidermal bullous diseases (e.g.， epidermolysis bullosa acquisita， bullous pemphigoid) 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>.\n\n【9】We hypothesize that the combination of our patient’s lower extremity edema secondary to bilateral DVTs， predisposition to subepidermal bullous formation due to PCT， and initiation of apixaban for DVT treatment contributed to her painful bullous eruption. Thehistopathologic features ofuniformly absent epidermis， nonspecific dermal fibrosis， and minimal dermal inflammation all support the diagnosis of an atypical PCT eruption with the recent initiation of apixaban as a potential trigger. A more extensive dermatologic investigation in the outpatient setting， including a repeat biopsy with immunofluorescence， is necessary to elucidate if one of our patient’s other comorbid conditions contributed to her reaction. Ultimately， our patient was successfully treated with IV antibiotics and fluids， surgical debridement， narcotics， and wound care management at a high-level burn unit.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "269761a5-b5dd-4a66-8543-623b89104c19", "title": null, "text": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】Pregnancy causes many changes in a woman's body. Some of them are transient in nature， while others remain for the rest of the patient’slife. Dramatic changes do not bypass the Thyroid Gland(TG). Against the background of pregnancy， both hypo- and hyperthyroidism can develop， which should be diagnosed and treated in time. Sometimes changes in thyroid function are so unexpected that they become an unpleasant surprise for a young mother and her doctor.\n\n【2】Clinical Case\n\n【3】A 26-year-old patient with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) was admitted to the endocrinology department. T1DM was diagnosed in 2005 at the age of 10 years. At the onset of the disease， basal-bolus insulin therapy was started.\n\n【4】In October 2018， she became pregnant (at the time of pregnancy， high glycemia levels were noted with high variability from 2 mmol/l to 21 mmol/l)， however， due to an embryony diagnosed at 9 to 10 weeks of pregnancy， vacuum aspiration of the uterine cavity was performed. Due to poor control of diabetes， an insulin pump was installed.\n\n【5】For the second pregnancy careful assessment was performed， including regular TSH control. A repeated increase in TSH up to 3.1 uIU/ml to 3.3 uIU/ml (0.4-4.0) was noticed.\n\n【6】There was a decrease in thyroid tissue echogenicity and diffuse heterogeneity according to the ultrasound data. FT4 (18.46 pmol/l(8.2-24.7)) and fT3 (5.18 pmol/ (2.76-6.45)) were within the normal range with elevated Antibodies to Thyroid Peroxidase (TPOAb) 104.6 IU/ml (<60)， Antibodies to TSH receptors (TSHrAb) were not detected. Taking into account the presence of T1DM and increased TPOAb in combination with slightly elevated TSH during pregnancy planning，levothyroxine 50 mcg/day was prescribed.\n\n【7】Just before pregnancy TSH decreased to 1.3 pIU/ml. During pregnancy， there was a decrease in TSH to a minimum of <0.004 uIU/ml，levothyroxine treatment was cancelled and at the time of childbirth in July 2021 TSH level was 2.139 uIU/ml.\n\n【8】Two months after delivery there was a decrease in T'SH to 0.028pIU/ml. After another 3 months， the patient noticed a significant glycemic variability during the day and was admitted to hospital with high glycaemia.\n\n【9】A decrease in TSH to 0.008 uIU/ml was determined with increase in fT4 up to 31.7 pmol/l(8.2-24.7) and fT3 up to 12.8 pmol/l (2.76-6.45)， TSHrAb were determined (5.12 IUA (<1)). In a hospital tachycardia with heart rate up to 100 beats/min to 120 beats/min was revealed. According to ultrasound of the thyroid gland， the total volume was 6.7 cm， with diffuse changes in the tissue. So， she was diagnosed with Graves' disease.\n\n【10】Thus， the diagnosis “Autoimmune polyglandular syndrome type 3\"as a combination of T1DM and Graves disease was established. As the lactation at the time oftreatment was stopped，antithyroid therapy with thiamazole 10 mg 2 times a day was initiated. Bisoprolol 7.5 mg was prescribed as pulse-lowering therapy.\n\n【11】Approximately 1 month after starting the drug， the patient noted an allergic reaction in the form of erythema on the back ofthe hands. Thiamazole was replaced by propylthiouracil at a dose of50 mg 3 times a day. Against this background， there was a rapid trend towards normalization of the skin condition .\n\n【12】Despite the irregular intake of the drug， a dynamic study after 1and 3 months after the start of therapy showed normal fT4 and fT3and elevation ofTSH， and therefore the dosage ofpropylthiouracil was reduced to 50 mg 2 times a day. Further， the patient also took the drug irregularly. There were some fluctuations in TSH level， however， over the next 7 months， both TSH and thyroid hormones were within the reference values， TSHrAb returned to normal range. As she stopped treatment and had target TSH after 4 months of discontinuation，we didn't resume anti-thyroid treatment and continue monitoring TSH.\n\n【13】Discussion\n\n【14】Despite significant differences in the pathogenesis and clinical presentation between Autoimmune Thyroiditis (AIT) and Grave's Disease (GD) a conversion of one autoimmune disease to another is described in the literature. Observations of the transition of GD to AIT are more common， and much less frequently we can see the development of GD in a patient with AIT. According to one theory， this is due to the absence of a critical mass of thyroid tissue capable to respond to TSHrAb in people with a long history of AIT 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. In any case， hypothyroidism and thyrotoxicosis can occur consecutively in the same patient通用删除6(英):<u> 2]</u>.\n\n【15】According to literature， it becomes obvious that the problem is quite rare in relation to the generalprevalence of autoimmune thyroid disorders， and therefore it is valuable to describe each clinical case.\n\n【16】The reasons for the switch in thyroid function are not completely clear at the moment， however， it is clear that there are several factors that， both individuallyor in combination， can influence the transition from hypo- to hyperthyroidism and vice versa. First of all， this may be due to switching between stimulating (TSAb) and blocking(TBAb) TSHrAb. It was traditionally believed that patients with thyrotoxicosis have only TSAb， and patients with hypothyroidism have only TBAb. However， both types of antibodies can circulate in the same patient. Thyroid function may fluctuate depending on predominating antibodies 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>.\n\n【17】Exact factors leading to the switch from the production of one type of TSHrAb to others aren’t known for certain. There are observations that changes in the type of antibodies sometimes occur under the influence of levothyroxine or antithyroid drugs. During删除1换行treatment period the concentration and mode of action of antibodies can change 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>.\n\n【18】Another possible explanation for the transition from hypo- to hyperthyroidism is that the thyroid tissue， which has undergone very serious autoimmune damage that has led to hypofunction of the gland， eventually recovers sufficiently to respond to subsequent exposure to stimulating antibodies 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. In addition， there are theories that the thyroid function can switch under the influence of various external factors， such as viral infection， pregnancy can also trigger the changes 通用删除6(英):<u>[5，6]</u>.\n\n【19】In case of our patient， there are several options for the causes of GD manifestation after childbirth. According to one theory， pregnancy was the stimulus for the conversion of hypothyroidism into thyrotoxicosis. During pregnancy， thyroid autoantibody levels usually decrease due to immunosuppression and/or hemodilution and are the lowest shortly before delivery， especially stimulatory T'SHrAb levels. However， in the postpartum period， the levels of anti-thyroid antibodies are restored， and then can even increase 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>.\n\nAccording to the second theory， the conversion occurred under the influence of levothyroxine treatment. It is believed that can happen either due to the restoration of thyroid tissue and the better response to circulating TSAb， or due to a decrease in the number of TBAb during levothyroxine treatment and a comparative increase in TSAb通用删除6(英):<u>[3，4]</u>. In our patient， mostlikely， the trigger for the development of Graves’ disease could be both the pregnancy itself and the use of levothyroxine. Unfortunately， there is no data on TSHrAb level before pregnancy， so it will not be possible to establish a precise cause retrospectively|删除段之间换行|As such clinical observations occur sometimes in patients， they are really important for doctors， since in clinical practice a decrease in TSH in a patient treated with levothyroxine， in most cases will be regarded as an overdose of it， which may lead to dose reduction and loss of time， while detection of GD can significantly change the treatmentand favorably affect the prognosis ofthe disease，preventing the development of complications.\n\n【21】Whatever the genesis of the development of GD in our patient， the value of this clinical case is that a patient with T1DM got a second autoimmune disease after pregnancy-GD. Thus， we can diagnose the autoimmune polyglandular syndrome type 3. This clinical case makes us remember the increased risk of developing a second autoimmune disease in patients with T1DM， which may manifest many years after the onset of diabetes， while pregnancy may trigger its manifestation.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "c8b3cd5e-87ae-46ec-96b7-cbb359d4e10f", "title": null, "text": "【0】Abstract\n\n【1】Background： A propagative increase in SARS-CoV-2 transmission has been witnessed in Zambia since the index case was reported in March 2020. Although sociocultural factors in cluding movement patterns， people's livelihood， and way of life have been demonstrated to influence SARS-CoV-2transmission dynamics， the role of environmental risk factors has not been adequately documented. The aim of the study was to investigate environmental risk factors contributing to the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in Zambia using a cross-sectional study.\n\n【2】Results： The positivity rates were 10.5% cell phones， 5.3% door knobs， 2.7% remote controls and2.6% beddings. All the other surfaces came out negative. The sex proportion of the respondents was55% and 45% males and females respectively. Regarding occupancy density， 37.5%(15/40) resided in a 2 to 3-roomed house， 32.5%(13/40) resided in a 4 to 7 roomed house and 30%(12/40) resided in >7-roomed house. Of the 40 respondents， 75%(30/40) used recyclable face masks while 25%(10/40) used non-recyclable face masks. For the non-recyclable face masks， 30% ofthe respondents indicated incineration as a disposal method. A correlation coefficient of 0.25 was documented for the association between occupancy density and surface contamination.\n\n【3】Conclusion： The study revealed that most environmental surfaces particularly mobile phones were rarely disinfected and were most likely to contribute to the transmission of SARS-CoV-2in the community. Furthermore， the majority of the respondents used recyclable face masks which are easily washable. However， those who used non-recyclable face masks disposed of them indiscriminately which has the potential of contaminating the environment and further lead to the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.\n\n【4】Keywords： Environment； Households； Risk factors； SARS-CoV-2\n\n【5】Abbreviations\n\n【6】BSL3： Biosafety Level 3； COVID-19： Coronavirus Disease 2019； PPE： Personal Protective Equipment； qRT-PCR： Quantitative Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction； RNA： Ribonucleic Acid； SARS-CoV-2： Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2； SPSS： Statistical Package for the Social Sciences； WHO： World Health Organization\n\n【7】Background\n\n【8】The COVID-19 pandemic， caused by the highly contagious SARS-COV-2， is a global public health problem and has caused a devastating impact on the immediate environment due to its quick spread from person to person 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Transmission occurs mainly via inhalation of respiratory or aerosol droplets from an infected person， produced via coughing and sneezing. Consequently， due to its rapid spread， a meeting held on January 30h，2020， as per the International Health Regulations(IHR， 2005)， World Health Organization declared the outbreak as a disease of Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) as it had spread to 18 countries with four countries reporting human-to-human transmission. Anadditional landmark occurred on February 26h，2020， as the first case of the disease， not imported from China， was recorded in the United States (US) 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>.\n\n【9】Evidence suggests that environmental factors play a significant role in influencing SARS-CoV-2删除1换行transmission though there is still limited information regarding its spread into the environment. The major environmental factors that can lead to a quicker spread of SARS-CoV-2 include water， air， faecal matter，handling of used face masks， and other medical wastes according to the World Health Organization 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>.\n\n【10】Even though most enveloped viruses are not usually excreted in faeces or urine， there is increased evidence that SARS-CoV-2，or at least their genomes， are excreted in faeces 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. If infective viruses are excreted into the environment， faecal contamination could be a major transmission route and people could be exposed by interacting with water contaminated with untreated faecal matter 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. Discarding face masks and empty bottles of hand sanitizers together with tissue papers results in a huge pile of medical waste in the environment. Discarding of face masks and empty bottles of hand sanitizers together with tissue papers results in a huge pile of medical waste in the environment. Workers involved in the collection of garbage and maintaining the city clean on a daily basis are at high risk of contracting the virus from respiratory shed droplets that could be on discarded masks 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>.\n\n【11】Arising from this fact， it is therefore， imperative to explore the various environmental characteristics that would drive the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through a One Health approach and also identify potential environmental foci and how it may enhance the rapid spread of the infection among the human population. The potential environmental factors identified1wouldenable policy-makers to plan for sustainable collaborative environmental intervention strategies.\n\n【12】Lusaka being centrallylocated has the potential to drive the spread of SARS-CoV-2 to other parts of the country if effective and efficient sustainable interventions are not in place. Although sociocultural factors including movement patterns， people's livelihood， and way of life have been demonstrated to influence SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics， the role of environmental risk factors had not yet been documented. Against the evidence from the literature indicating environmental contamination， it was important to investigate the contribution of environmental risk factors in the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in Zambia.\n\n【13】Aim of the Studv\n\n【14】The aim of this study is to investigate environmental risk factors contributing to the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in Zambia.\n\n【15】Methods\n\n【16】A cross-sectional study was conducted in selected SARS-CoV-2-affected households in the Lusaka district from September to December， 2020. A purposive sampling technique was used to select SARS-CoV-2 affected households from Zambia National Public Health Institute (ZNPHI) database following positive SARS-CoV-2diagnosis. The rationale for selecting the affected households was to maximize the chances of identifying contaminated surfaces that plaved a critical role in the transmission of the virus and also describe the methods of disposal used for face masks. Furthermore， the Lusaka district was one of the epicenters having recorded a high number of SARS-CoV-2 cases.\n\n【17】Environmental samples were collected from door knobs/handles， taps， light switch， floor surfaces， work top surfaces， beddings， remote controls and mobile phones using the DaAnGene 通用删除7(英):<u>(2020)</u> sample删除1换行collection， transport， and processing procedure for tissue and cytopathological analysis specimen preservation. In order to increase the positive predictive value of the environmental sampling process， multiple swabs were taken for each sampling area. The samples were triple packaged and transported to the University of Zambia， School of Veterinary Medicine， BSL3 Virology Laboratory within 24 h after collection.\n\n【18】Total RNAwas extracted from the environmental samples using QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Real-time RT-PCR assays were carried out using The DaAnGene 通用删除7(英):<u>(2020)</u> detection procedure was utilized to identify the presence ofSARS-CoV-2according to the manufacturer’s instructions. To ensure the safety of research assistants and research team members during the training， travel，and data collection process， the use of appropriate PPE and physical distancing was practiced. Extraction of RNA was done in a biosafety level -3 laboratory.\n\n【19】Epidemiological data were collected using a pre-tested close-ended questionnaire to capture exposure risk factors that could lead to household contamination such as the type of dwelling， household size， age， gender， occupation， and cultural practices such as funerals and religious gatherings. Further， the respondents were asked to provide information on methods of disposal of used face masks. Participants were identified by codes to ensure anonymity.\n\n【20】Data were analyzed using the statistical software package SPSS version 21 and all the statistical tests were determined at a5% significance level. The proportion of infected households was determined by dividing the number of positive householdsby the total number ofhouseholds tested similarly， the percentage contamination of surfaces or articles was estimated using the same approach.\n\n【21】Results\n\n【22】A total of 40 respondents as shown in Table 1 from SARS-CoV-2 affected households were interviewed with a breakdown of 55% (22/40) representing males while 45% (22/40) representing females. From this total， 37.5%(15/40) resided in a 1 to 3 roomed house， 32.5%(13/40) resided in a 4 to 7 roomed house and 30%(12/40) resided in >7 roomed house. A breakdown of face mask use was： 75% (30/40) disclosed using recyclable face masks while 25%(10/40) none recyclable face masks. Of the 38 pooled environmental surfaces swabbed and analyzed， 21.05% (8/38) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 contamination. The breakdown was as follows： - cell phones at 10.53%(4/38)， door knobs at 5.26%(2/38)， the beddings and remote control were 2.63%(1/38) and 2.63%(1/38) respectively. A. correlation coefficient of 0.25 was documented for the association between occupancy density and surface contamination.\n\n【23】Discussion\n\n【24】SARS-CoV-2 was detected in only 21.05% of all environmental samples tested. Among the environmental surfaces swabbed， mobile cell phones were more prominently significant to contain SARS-CoV-2 compared with the other environmental surfaces. These results show that there is a risk of transmitting SARS-CoV-2 via mobile cell phones if the appropriate SARS-CoV-2 health guidelines of hygiene are not maintained. A study conducted by Chin et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>， reported that SARS-CoV-2 was viable in the environment at 4°C for a long time however this reduced with a raise in temperature， and at70°C the virus was inactivated in 5 min. This therefore shows that the environment and human behavioral conditions have a critical role in transmitting the virus. Thus， the risk of transmitting SARS-CoV-2删除表格换行from one person to another via contaminated environmental surfaces can be higher if appropriate disinfection measures are less rigorously respected and not adequately conducted upon detection of SARS-CoV-2 cases from different households.\n\n【25】Table 1： Sociodemographic characteristics and SARS-CoV-2 environmental contamination.\n\n| Variable  | Mean (SD)/n (%)  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Age  | 28.43(13.13)  |\n| Gender  |  |\n| Males  | 22(55%)  |\n| Females  | 18(45%)  |\n| Marital status  |  |\n| Single  | 8 (20%)  |\n| Separated  | 6(15%)  |\n| Marriec  | 25(62.5%)  |\n| Widow  | 1(2.5%)  |\n| Number of Occupants per Household  |  |\n| 1-3 Roomed House  | 9(32.1%)  |\n| 4-7 Roomed House  | 11(39.2%)  |\n| Greater than7 Roomed House  | 8(28.6%)  |\n| Type of Face Mask used  |  |\n| Recyclable  | 30(75%)  |\n| None recyclable  | 10(25%)  |\n| Disposal Method for None Recyclable  |  |\n| Incineration  | 3(30%)  |\n| Indiscriminate  | 7(70%)  |\n| Positive Environmental Surfaces  |  |\n| Remote control  | 1(2.63%)  |\n| Beddings  | 1(2.63%)  |\n| Door knob  | 2(5.26%)  |\n| Cell phone  | 4(10.53%)  |\n\n【27】Solid waste materials generated from households with infected or suspected SARS-CoV-2 cases may contain traces of SARS-CoV-2and could be a source of infection for people within and outside the households. As recently discovered， SARS-CoV-2 can stay on hard surfaces for long periods of time， specifically， 72 h on plastic， 48 h on stainless steel and 24 h on paper and cardboard. Therefore， a72-h-delay in the collection does not seem to be sufficient to ensure safety and may lead to SARS-CoV-2 infection amongst solid waste collectors. A poor management of solid waste can possibly increase the chances of SARS-CoV-2 spread in the environment due to transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 through respiratory means and physical touch. Apart from human-to-human transmission，droplets may also stay active on surfaces where the virus could remain viable. Thus， the immediate environment of an infected individual can serve as a source oftransmission 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>.\n\n【28】The study had revealed that the majority of the respondents were using recyclable face masks. The research further established that almost all the closer contacts of SARS-CoV-2 cases at household level were putting on face masks to prevent any possibility of contracting and spreading the virus. This is in agreement with a study conducted by Nzediegwu and Chang， which noted that the total number of face删除1换行masks used during the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak had increased and this depended on the number of contacts closer to SARS-CoV-2 cases， number of occupants per household， face masks acceptance rate(percent) and average daily face masks per capita.\n\n【29】This research established that most of the SARS-CoV-2 cases were reported in both densely and low densely populated sub-districts and that most of the transmissions occurred between household members as described by Hui et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>. Most of the SARS-CoV-2 cases were residing in a three-roomed household structure with an average family size of nine 通用删除6(英):<u>[10-12]</u>. The occupancy density was noticed to be higher particularly in densely populated households thereby increasing the chances of SARS-CoV-2 transmission rates 通用删除6(英):<u>[13，14]</u>. The findings clearly show the importance of testing close contacts of SARS-CoV-2 cases to promptly identify and isolate infections in the incubation period 通用删除6(英):<u>[5，16]</u>. This would also be appropriate if the lower estimated transmission probability of SARS-CoV-2 during the illness period than during the incubation period could be partially attributed to self-distancing within households when the primary cases developed symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>[17，18]</u>. The estimated probability of daily SARS-CoV-2 transmission was higher in households of six people or less than in larger households (more than six people).\n\n【30】Study Limitations\n\n【31】This study was only done in Lusaka and particularly targeted households with affected cases of COVID-19. The results of this study cannot be generalized to the whole Zambian population however； the study provides initial scientific baseline data regarding the environmental risks contributing to the transmission of COVID-19factors. This can help in refining policies that will target the prevention of potential environmental surfaces that would enhance the further spread of COVID-19 in the population.\n\n【32】Conclusion\n\n【33】There is a need to ensure that active case finding and isolation in conjunction with comprehensive contact tracing and quarantine are instituted for preventing infected contacts from spreading the virus during their incubation periods. The positive samples documented were indicative of the presence of SARS-CoV-2 on environmental surfaces. It is thus， plausible to conjecture that the environment could have played a role as a source of infection for SARS-CoV-2in Zambia. There is a need to also explore the long-term association of environmental and climate indicators with the SARS-CoV-2pandemic and to study the inter-district and provincial responses towards the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak to provide a better outlook for understanding the spread of SARS-COV-2.

At presentation， up to 25% of gastrinomas are metastasized， predominantly to the liver. The presence of liver metastases has a negative impact on the prognosis. Liver resection for neuroendocrine metastases is associated to long-term survival advantages and disease control. Nevertheless， the benefits of aggressive liver resection should be weighed against the potential risk of post-hepatectomy liver failure.\n\n【2】Summary： This report presents the case of a 41-year-old female patient who presented severe diarrhea due to a pancreatic functional gastrinoma with synchronic hepatic metastases.

It is caused by secretion of gastrin by duodenal or Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors(pNETs) called gastrinomas. Although gastrinomas are one of the most common functionalpNETs， only 25% of gastrinomas arise in the pancreas 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>.\n\n【9】Recent data suggest that 65% of gastrinomas are malignant， and up to 30% to 40% of patients will have evident metastatic disease at initial presentation. The most frequent site of metastases is the liver (40% to 93%). Because of the poor clinical outcome of patients with advanced and metastatic gastrinomas，and the overall disappointing results with systemic therapy， an aggressive management approach through hepatic resection with curative intent of metastatic NETs is encouraged 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>.\n\n【10】Future Liver Remnant (FLR) function in patients with extensive compromise of liver parenchyma due to metastatic disease ought to be thoroughly evaluated before hepatic resective surgery is performed in order to prevent Post-Hepatectomy Liver Failure (PHLF) 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. Therefore， whenever an insufficient FLR function is predicted， different surgical techniques can be applied to reduce morbidity and mortality due to PHLF by promoting FLR function improvement prior to a major hepatic resection. Associating Liver Partition and Portal Vein Ligation for Staged Hepatectomy (ALPPS) constitutes one of the latest and promising technical advances among these删除1换行complex groups of surgical strategies. More recently， a less invasive ALPPS variant， Mini-ALPPS， has been described by our group minimizing the first stage impact to promote rapid patient recovery and leaving the main surgical procedure for the second stage， thus decreasing morbidity and mortality.\n\n【11】This report presents the case of a 41-year-old female patient who presented severe diarrhea due to a pancreatic functional gastrinoma with synchronic hepatic metastases. Preoperative assessment of FLR function through a newly developed dynamic measure calculated using Hepatobiliary Scintigraphy (HBS)-HIBA index- is described. The present case report underlines surgical management consisting of Mini-ALPPS procedure which allowed primary and secondary lesions to be fully resected.\n\n【12】Case Presentation\n\nForty-one-year-old female patient without relevant prior medical history， who presented at our institution with episodic， watery， and sometimes explosive diarrhea consisting of approximately 10 to 15bowel movements per day， that had been gradually worsening over a 30-month period. The patient had undergone several uneffective empirical and symptomatic treatments at a different center. At our institution， clinical tests were performed， ruling out celiac disease and both bacterial and parasitic infections. Upper and lower endoscopies were performed. Lower endoscopy showed no relevant findings； whereas upper endoscopy revealed a hyperplastic polyp and mild chronic gastritis. Helicobacter pylori were not detected in the gastric biopsy. Consequently， a proton pump inhibitor (omeprazole) was prescribed (20 mg/day). Interestingly， her severe case of diarrhea improved after the first dose of omeprazole. Afterwards， with an etiological diagnostic purpose， an abdominal ultrasound was|删除段之间换行|Based onthepresumptive diagnosis of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome due to pancreatic gastrinoma with liver metastasis， a radical two-stage surgery was performed. Two weeks prior to the first-stage surgery， the patient received one dose of intramuscular octreotide long-acting release.\n\nDuring the first stage a distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy were performed. Moreover， the hepatic metastatic disease was approached as well， by performing the first procedure of Mini-ALLPS technique as previously described by our group 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. Distal pancreatectomy was carried out with a mechanical lineal suture(Echelon Flex” Endopath’ Stapler.

Simultaneously， the first procedure of Mini-ALLPS consisted of|删除段之间换行|In order to prevent PHLF and based on the notion that FLR volume is not equivalent and sometimes overestimates FLR function， a HBS using 99mTc-mebrofenin was performed to assess FLR function. As previously described by our group， the HIBA-index was used to estimate the risk of PHLF (being the risk higher if HIBA-index was <15%). During the first HBS performed 10 days after the first stage， functional analysis through single photon emission computed tomography revealed a FLR function/total liver function of 21%， while HIBA index was 14.76% and Amsterdam index was0.76% min/m. Consequently， the second stage was postponed. A second HBS was performed 30 days after the first stage revealing a FLR/total liver function of 25%，HIBA index of 17% and Amsterdam index of 0.8% min/m.\n\nThe second stage procedure was carried out 51 days after the first stage and it consisted of a right hepatectomy . Once|删除段之间换行|Histopathological analysis ofthe surgical specimen corresponding to the first stage procedure revealed a pancreatic well differentiated pNET (G2， Ki 67 12%)，6 liver metastasis and one metastatic lymph node out of 9 resected lymph nodes. The right liver resected during the second stage presented metastatic lesions from NET as well.\n\n【16】One month and a half after the second stage surgery a follow-up\n\n【17】The patient is currently receiving a monthly dose of intramuscular octreotide long-acting release. To the date， four months after her primary first-stage procedure， the patient remains with good clinical evolution without evidence of disease.\n\n【18】Discussion\n\n【19】Gastrinomas make up 16% to 30% of functional pNETs and hyper-secretegastrin resulting in Zollinger Ellison syndrome， the classic symptoms of which are refractory peptic ulcer disease and secretory diarrhea. Chronic diarrhea is a common problem affecting up to 5% of the population at a given time and， frequently， its etiological diagnosis entails a trying task 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. However， when it presents associated with acid-related peptic disease and improves after prescription of proton pump inhibitors， functional NETs such as gastrinoma， must be ruled out.\n\n【20】Metastases are detected at diagnosis in about 40% to 80% of patients with pNETs. Surgery remains the treatment of choice in selected patients with pNETs and resectable liver metastases， because it may provide cure. Primary tumor resection combined with neuroendocrine liver metastasectomy may have either curative intent， when complete resection is possible， or palliative intent， when the majority of the tumor burden is removed to control the symptoms of the disease 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. Liver resection for neuroendocrine metastases is associated to long-term survival advantages and disease control. Furthermore， this incremental increase in survival time has been described to have occurred regardless of tumor grade. According to guidelines and related studies， the minimum criteria for cytoreductive surgery of liver-metastatic pNETs are as follows：1) G1/G2 liver-metastatic pNET； 2) the primary is resectable； 3) no unresectable extrahepatic disease； 4) younger patients with an acceptable morbidity and low mortality； 5) tumor volume with <25%liver involvement； 6) up to 90% or at least >70% of tumor load is thought to be resectable preoperatively； and 7) treatment decision删除1换行making requires a multidisciplinary approach；8) either one-stage or two-stage surgery may be recommended 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>.\n\n【21】Post-hepatectomy liver failure remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality after major liver resection. Although the etiology of PHLF is multifactorial， an inadequate functional liver remnant is thought to be the most important modifiable predictor of PHLF. For people with a normal liver， an FLR ≥ 25% of total liver volume is adequate to avoid PHLF. Patients with chronic liver disease but without cirrhosis usually require an FLR of at least 30%while patients with cirrhosis but without portal hypertension require an FLR of at least 40%. A shift toward parenchymal-preserving operations has led to a decrease in morbidity and mortality， with excellent oncologic outcomes even in patients with significant disease burden in the liver. Parenchymal-preserving liver surgery is ideal for these well-encapsulated tumors. Non-anatomic resections in combination with ablation offer comparable oncologic results in small tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. Two-staged hepatectomies also provide a feasible resective approach for these patients. Moreover， ALPPS， a novel technique first described by Schnitzbauer et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u> in 2012， thoroughly accelerates FLR hypertrophy increasing the feasibility to complete both stages. As originally described， the technique consists of right portal vein ligation combined with in situ splitting ofliver parenchyma during the first stage， followed by a second stage(resective procedure) performed at surgeon discretion after assessing FLR sufficiency， usually within 7 to 10 days. In 2016， our group put forward a new surgical paradigm for ALPPS called“Mini-ALLPS”， aiming to maximally reduce the aggressiveness and surgical impact of ALPPS first stage. The proposal incorporated the combination of Partial Parenchymal Transection (PPT) with Intraoperative Portal Vein Embolization (IPVE) as well as minimum liver mobilization， without hilar dissection 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. This approach proves useful in cases such as the one presented in this review， where considerable bilobar hepatic disease requires FLR clean-up and functional enhancement， apart from primary pancreatic tumor resection.\n\n【22】FLR function assessment before indicating a mayor hepatic resection or to postpone second-step surgery until satisfactory activity has been reached， is key to the success of this complex procedure. Dynamic 99mTc-mebrofenin hepatobiliary scintigraphy was developed as a quantitative method for evaluating total and regional liver function， including FRL function. In 2017， Serenari et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u> described inter stage assessment of FLR function in ALLPS using HBS and found that HIBA index a newly developed dynamic measure representing the proportion of radionuclide accumulated in the FLR- of <15% to best predict clinically significant PHLF in patients with an already sufficient FLR volume.\n\n【23】To summarize， this case comprises at least three uncommon and/or novel subjects. Firstly， the unusual diagnosis of a pNET after a two-year history of misdiagnosed diarrhea. A high level of diagnostic suspicion must be maintained when pNETs are involved， since their early diagnosis allows for the treatment of a localized disease rather than an advanced one， with the management and technical vicissitudes that this brings about， for the patient， the medical team and the health system.\n\n【24】Secondly， primary pancreatic tumor resection associated with two-stage hepatectomy is a challenging but feasible approach in this type of metastatic disease. Patients with advanced pNETs without extrahepatic involvement benefit greatly from RO resection and the Mini-ALLPS technique proves a useful tool to achieve this goal； its删除1换行primary advantages being： 1) A less aggressive first stage which allows the patient to recover rapidly and uneventfully， 2) induced FLR hypertrophy through PPT and IPVE， and 3) a second stage facilitated by lesser perihepatic and hilar inflammation.\n\n【25】Lastly， in extended liver resections， function rather than volume alone， should dictate the minimal FLR Preoperative or interstage measurement of 99mTc-mebrofenin uptake in the FLR on functional HBShas proved more valuable than measurement ofthe volume ofthe future remnant in the assessment of the post hepatectomy risk of liver failure and liver failure-related mortality 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>. Using HIBA index， the parameter developed by our group， with a 15% cut-off value， second-stage surgery can be postponed until a safe FLR function is achieved in order to reduce the risk of PHLF.\n\n【26】Conclusion\n\n【27】In conclusion liver metastatic pNETs can be approached through an aggressive RO resection with curative intent as long as a meticulous appraisal of FLR function is conducted to ensure the patient's postoperative safe and uneventful recovery.\n\n【28】When pNETs are involved， early diagnosis allows a higher rate of respectability. Primary pancreatic tumor resection associated with two-stage hepatectomy is a feasible approach when managing metastatic pNETs. In order to prevent PHLF， using HIBA index and second-stage surgery can be postponed until a safe FLR function is achieved.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

We present a case of sepsis and thrombosis， co-occurring in a patient with End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD)， associated with the use of central venous catheters.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 54-year-old patient with ESRD on hemodialysis with a past medical history of seizure disorder，hypertension， heart failure， and a cerebral vascular accident with residual right hemiparesis， was transferred to the emergency department from a nursing home due to syncope， falls and altered mental status. Last fall prior to admission was unwitnessed.\n\n【7】On initial assessment， the patient was unable to recall what had occurred prior to the fall. The patient denied palpitations， headache， blurry vision， excessive sweating or weakness. The only complaint was pain in the left arm and hip. Vital signs were within normal limits， except for a temperature of 39.6C. No signs of fracture were noted on X-rays of the cervical spine， left arm， shoulder or hip. No acute injury noted on cephalic non-contrast CT nor any abnormalities on the electrocardiogram or encephalogram. A portable chest X-ray demonstrated a moderate effusion of the right lung field， as well as cavitary lesions at the left lateral base. Lab findings demonstrated a leukocytosis of 30.62×10/3 with an ANC of 27.18×10/3. The Blood chemistry panel revealed a BUN of 84 mg/dl and a creatinine level of 9.81 mg/dl.Lactate level was 1.1 meq/L. The patient was started on antibiotic therapy with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam.\n\n【8】On subsequent investigation， a CT scan of the chest showed bilateral pleural effusions and cavitary lesions scattered throughout the left lung field with a possible consideration for septic emboli. A right internal jugular central venous line extending into the superior vena cava was also visualized. An abdominal CT showed a questionable wedge-shaped hypodensity along the inferior and lateral aspect of the spleen， suspicious for a possible splenic infarct. A pelvic CT demonstrated a small amount of fluid and gas at the entry of a left femoral venous line. A transthoracic删除1换行echocardiogram demonstrated the presence of a fluffy echogenic mass which appeared attached to the catheter， likely thrombotic in origin. The mass traveled across the tricuspid valve to the level of the tricuspid leaflet. The possibility of the mass being colonized with bacteria was possible. Anticoagulation with heparin and warfarin was initiated. A ventilation perfusion scan and Doppler studies of upper and lower extremities showed no abnormalities.\n\n【9】Blood cultures， grew Enterococcus feacalis and Staphylococcus hominis. The tip of the internal jugular dialysis catheter grew Staphylococcus aureus. Sputum cultures grew Candida albicans and normal flora. Antibiotic therapy was switched to gentamicin and ampicillin.\n\n【10】Removal of the femoral venous catheter followed. The right internal jugular venous catheter was removed and replaced by a new catheter in the left internal jugular vein. The patient resumed dialysis during the hospital course and continued dialysis upon discharge.\n\n【11】Prior to discharge a transesophageal echocardiogram still demonstrated a small thrombus at the junction of the superior vena cava and right atrium； no vegetations were visualized. The patient continued anticoagulation therapy upon discharge with Warfarin5 mg PO daily and heparin 8000 units subcutaneously every 12hr. A new chest CT scan demonstrated stable to slightly decreased lung nodules， interval resolution of the right pleural effusion and a grossly stable 4 cm splenic lesion. Further investigation of the splenic lesion via biopsy or laparoscopy was not recommended due to a high surgical risk. Due to the high suspicion of a splenic abscess， the patient was discharged on 500mg of vancomycin and 70 mg of gentamicin. A follow-up with infectious disease as an outpatient was arranged. The patient's leukocytosis was resolved and blood cultures were negative prior to discharge.\n\n【12】Infection andthrombosis arethetwo most common complications of CVC use 通用删除6(英):<u>[1-4]</u>.

Due to the limitations of physical experiments such as difficulty in observation， rapid occurrence of phenomena， and dangers， as well as the impact of subjective and objective factors such as school funding， teacher constraints， and students weak experimental awareness， many physical experiments are not convenient to conduct in the classroom or laboratory， such as wave optics， fluid mechanics， particle physics， and nuclear physics experiments. The development of computer and simulation technology has enabled virtual experiments to be realized 通用删除6(英):<u>[1-3]</u>， but most of the existing physical experiment simulation software in China is two-dimensional simulation 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>， such as Zhang Wenmiaoyun et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>， who implemented optical experiment simulation based on Python， and Cao Fujun et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>，who designed and developed two-dimensional simulated electromagnetic experiments using EWB 5.0. The effect of two-dimensional simulation experiments is not intuitive and visual enough，lacking a sense of immersion 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u> and a sense of restoration， and the teaching effect is limited. The significance of designing the three-dimensional experimental simulation software based on the interest and observability of the experiment 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. Currently， relevant scholars have developed 3D simulation software， such as Guo Tiezheng et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>， who implemented cricket system simulation experiments based on Unity3D， Xiong Yanfan et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>， who discussed the application of VR technology in practical teaching， and Feng Jiao et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>， who implemented flight simulation systems using the WebGL framework Three.js. Most of these 3D simulation software uses Unity3D，VR， and Three.js， with good results， However， using Unity3D 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u> requires downloading and installation， while VR has a high cost of configuring hardware devices. In view of the application requirements of physical experiment simulation software， Three.js， which is lightweight， plug-in free， and can be directly run in a browser 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>， has become the best choice for developing physical virtual simulation software.\n\nThis article takes the classic experiment of fluid mechanics \"Saxon bowl sinking experiment\"as an example， and uses Three js to design and implement a virtual simulation system for physical experiments. This system breaks through the limitations of two-dimensional planes by constructing three-dimensional models， achieving three-dimensional and visualized full simulation of experimental equipment and experimental processes， truly simulating the interaction between teachers and students offline 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>， providing a series of interactive animations to complete simulation details， such as smooth control of object placement Error control when measuring inner and outer diameters with vernier calipers， etc.； Adding multiple tools to reduce experimental errors and|删除段之间换行|providing multiple learning methods such as text， speech， and video greatly increases the interest and observability of the experiment通用删除6(英):<u>[7，13]</u>， improving and enhancing teaching effectiveness.\n\n【6】Three.js Technology\n\n【7】Technical overview\n\n【8】The Three.js library is a 3D engine packaged and running based on native WebGL 通用删除6(英):<u>[14，15]</u>， which is an application programming interface for generating 3D graphics effects on the Web. Three.js not only supports Canvas animation and CSS animation， but also supports more advanced physics-based rendering technology based on general 3D engines 通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>. It provides a set of simple solutions and practical built-in objects for creating 3D graphics. At the same time， it can quickly instantiate elements such as Scene， Light， Camera， and Renderer， greatly improving the development efficiency of 3D graphics during COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n【9】Workflow\n\n【10】The workflow of Three.js mainly includes four parts： creating a scene， configuring a scene， creating model objects， and rendering 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>. The five main elements of 3D graphics rendering are： Scene， camera， object，light， and renderer 通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>. A scene is a three-dimensional space used to place models， lights， and cameras， which are then rendered using a renderer. Objects need to be presented through a camera to determine the observation position， direction， and angle， and to determine the final scene displayed on the display. Objects are three-dimensional models for display. Simple models can be created through Three.js built-in solutions， while complex models need to be modeled using professional 3D drawing software 通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>. Lights provide illumination for the scene， and different light sources and colors can be selected based on the scene effect. The function of the renderer is to render the created scene and the projections of three-dimensional objects observed by the camera on a two-dimensional plane， and present them to the browser .\n\n【11】Introduction to Saxon Bowl and Its Timing Principle\n\n【12】The Saxon bowl is a bowl with a perforated bottom， which is timed by observing the natural sinking of the bowl in water. In this paper， theoretical analysis of the relationship between the Saxon bowl sinking time and related physical parameters is conducted，and experimental simulation is established.\n\n【13】Assume that a bowl with a mass of m。 a thickness ofd， a height of h。 and a cross-sectional area of S holes at the bottom is placed in a liquid with an infinite width and a density of 通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u>. When t=0， the bottom of the bowl is in contact with the liquid surface； At the time of t=t， the bowl mouth is flush with the outer liquid surface， and the physical process of the Saxon bowl sinking within the time period 0≤tsta is analyzed. By establishing a physical model and combining fluid mechanics processes， it is concluded that the settling time of the Saxon bowl in liquid is 通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u>：\n\n【14】Design of Saxon Bowl3DSimulation Experimental System\n\n【15】System architecture design\n\n【16】The simulation experiment platform adopts a hierarchical model： A presentation layer， an application layer， a business logic layer， a data access layer， and a database five-tier structure . The presentation layer is used to display system interfaces and experimental data， display simulation models， and provide interface services for the application layer. The business logic layer processes the system's business logic (rules， workflow， data integrity， etc.). The data access layer provides data.\n\n【17】3D animation design\n\n【18】The Saxon Bowl simulation experiment designed a series ofthree dimensional animations to simulate the real experimental process， and added interactive details of user operations， achieving human-computer interaction beyond the viewing level to enhance the user experience. For example， when measuring mass with a tray balance， the system will determine whether the user has placed items on the tray， and whether they have moved weights or weights， so as to control the left and right swing and placement position of the objects， in order to prevent model overlap and threading The vernier caliper will be opened and closed according to the user's operation； When measuring the density of a liquid with a densitometer， place it in the liquid to be measured and float up and down until it becomes stable； Liquid surface texture in a water tank simulates fluid flow； The Saxon bowl sinks， equipped with a movable bowl rack to ensure that the bowl is in a static state when it first touches the liquid level， and then sinks according to the sinking path simulated by the fitting curve.\n\n【19】During the process， the small hole in the bottom of the bowl flows liquid， and the liquid level in the bowl will rise accordingly.\n\n【20】Implementation of Saxon Bowl 3D Simulation Svstem\n\n【21】Construction of three-dimensional experimental environment\n\n【22】The experimental environment is an important link that affects the visual effect of virtual simulation experiments. In order to enhance the user's experience in experiments and restore the experimental scene of the laboratory Saxon Bowl experiment， it is necessary to build a 3D high-definition rendered virtual scene during COVID-19pandemic.\n\n【23】First， use the three coordinate axes x， y， and z in the scene created by three.js to form a simple virtual simulation experiment three-dimensional space 通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u>， laying the foundation for subsequent3D experimental equipment creation and experimental simulation effects. In order for the 3D model in the scene to also present a 3D删除1换行effect in the human eye rather than a simple planar figure， it is also necessary to create a Perspective Camera that can adjust its own observation range， angle， and distance from the 3D model to make the model present different visual effects. The light sources in the scene can not only enhance the 3D feel of the model， but also highlight the material characteristics of the model. For example， applying a point light source to a tray balance can well highlight its metal texture. In order to meet the requirements similar to those of real experiments， the system strictly sets camera parameters to ensure the effectiveness of experimental equipment measurement data during simulation experiments. In addition， arranging scene lights can also give a three-dimensional sense of the environment. The core code is as follows：\n\n【24】Construction of three-dimensional experimental equipment\n\n【25】Modeling of three-dimensional experimental equipment is the foundation for implementing a three-dimensional simulation system for physical experiments， providing necessary materials for the construction of virtual scenes and the implementation of interactive behaviors20.\n\n【26】Firstly， select an appropriate method to construct 3D model components based on real physical equipment data. Components with regular shapes are constructed using a box (THREE. BoxGeometry)， a cylinder (THREE. CylinderGeometry)， a sphere(THREE. SphereGeometry)， and a cone (THREE. ConeGeometry). Components with irregular shapes need to first obtain data on each vertex of the component， use THREE. Vector3() to store the data， and place it in a vertex array， then， THREE.Face30 stores the triangular faces formed by connecting the vertices of the component， and places them in a triangular face array. Finally， the required components can be constructed using the above two arrays. After all components are built， use the intersection， union， and subtract components in the Three BSP plug-in library to assemble the 3D model. Taking a vernier caliper as an example， the modeling scheme is as follows：\n\n【27】Let scene，camera，ambientLight\n\n【28】scene = new THREE.SceneO；//create a scene\n\n【29】camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(x， width /height， 1，\n\n【30】1000)；//create a Perspective Camera\n\ncamera.position.set通用删除7(英):<u>(-3，1，30)</u>；//position the camera删除1换行camera.lookAt(new THREE.Vector3通用删除7(英):<u>(-10， 0， 0)</u>)；//set camera observation point删除1换行ambientLightt=InewTHREE.AmbientLight(0x606060)；//add light source删除1换行scene.add(ambientLight)；//Adding Lights to a Scene|删除段之间换行|The vernier caliper mainly consists of a ruler body， a depth ruler， a master ruler， a vernier ruler， an internal measuring claw， an external measuring claw， and fastening screws. The master ruler， ruler body， and depth ruler are selected as cuboids (THREE. BoxGeometry)，and the coordinates are placed or embedded in appropriate positions. For irregular shaped internal and external measuring claws， it is difficult to restore true vernier calipers using traditional geometric graphics. Now， it is possible to obtain the data of each vertex of this part through an array and store it. Then， use the connection function of THREE.Face3() to connect each vertex in the space， and finally combine the two parts of the space. The shape of the fastening screw is similar to the cylinder (THREE. CylinderGeometry) in the three.js library. We use the cylinder to construct its shape and place the figure in the appropriate position on the vernier caliper. The above process completes the basic construction of the vernier caliper equipment model，and then uses the THREE. TextureLoader texture map to add a scale to the vernier caliper .\n\n【32】Other experimental equipment such as tray scales， densitometers， and Saxon bowls all use the above modeling ideas. The parts with regular shapes use simple geometric graphics from the three.jslibrary， while the irregular parts use arrays to obtain vertex coordinates and删除1换行construct them in space using aline method. Finally，the two parts are combined during COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n【33】Implementation of three-dimensional interactive behavior\n\n【34】Experimental simulation effect is an important factor affecting its practical value. In addition to presenting realistic visual effects and realistic experimental processes， rich and detailed interaction behavior is also a major factor affecting experimental simulation effect 通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u>.\n\n【35】In the Saxon Bowl simulation experimental platform， the key to achieving interactive behavior is the interaction between a series of behaviors generated during user use and the coordinates of the model in the scene， thereby achieving manipulation of the model behavior. Due to the characteristics of the three.js runtime environment， using a mouse and keyboard is sufficient to change the X， Y，and Z coordinate values of the 3D model， completing all operations such as movingand rotating. By monitoring mouse and keyboard events during use， the model is bound to corresponding events. When the event is monitored and the corresponding event is triggered， the position of the model in three-dimensional space can be changed， achieving corresponding effects. This change in position is not constrained by the movement characteristics on the plane like 2D， and can achieve better 3D effects and experimental simulation effects during COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n【36】In the process of changing the position of a model， other models in the scene monitor their own coordinates and the model coordinates ofthe changed position in real time. Once the relationship between the two coordinates meets the coordinate relationship of the interaction conditions between the pre designed models， the two models will make the specified interaction behavior in time to achieve the ideal interaction effect. For example， during the process删除1换行of manipulating experimental equipment to move and place it on a pallet balance tray， the system will calculate the distance between the coordinates of the experimental equipment and the monitoring area above the pallet balance tray in real time. When the monitoring area above the pallet is reached， the interaction condition between the experimental equipment and the balance is reached， and the balance and experimental equipment will tilt in the corresponding direction to achieve interaction during COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n【37】In order to present 3D interactive effects and enhance the immersive experience of user experimental operations， the renderer. render() in three.js is used to refresh the position of the models in the scene based on coordinates after a very short period of time， and change the virtual simulation scene in real time. Cooperate with a perspective camera and combine model coordinate changes to present different display effects， giving people a sense of realism and achieving realistic 3D interactive behavior.\n\n【38】Simulation system 3D effects\n\n【39】The Saxon Bowl Physics Experiment System is a software based on the B-S mode 通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>， and its main interface is shown in Figure 4. By selecting the \"Experiment Introduction\"， \"Experiment Principle\"， or \"Start Experiment\" buttons， you can jump to the corresponding interface. The user can complete the experiment preview and operation in the measurement and simulation process display area of the four major parameters of mass， radius， density， and time， and fill in the experimental measurement data in a table to save during COVID-19 pandemic .\n\n【40】Conclusion\n\n【41】Aiming at the problem that the existing domestic physical experiment simulation software iss two-dimensional and lacks删除1换行three-dimensional simulation software， this article takes the classic fluid mechanics experiment - Saxon bowl sinking experiment as an example， develops a fluid mechanics experiment simulation system based on Three.js， introduces 3D technology to achieve three-dimensional simulation effects， breaks through the limitations of two-dimensional software planarity， and greatly increases the interest and observability of the experiment.

The recommended dose of400 mg/day is considered as maximum approved dose 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. Tramadol hydrochloride is a lipophilic substance that completely penetrates the barrier between blood and brain. The level of plasma besieges peak around 1.5 h after taking and 5 h to 6 h is the half life of plasma exclusion. One of the complications of the tramadol use is the seizure which is most often generalized tonic-clonic 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. Here we are presenting a case report of a 29-year-old male patient， who had an episode of seizure， following single oral dose of Tramadol.\n\n【6】Case Presentation\n\n【7】A 29 year old male patient came to the orthopedic OPD， with history of low back pain following fall from height. He was prescribed oral tablet tramadol hydrochloride 37.5 mg twice daily for five days. After one hour oftaking first dose oftablet tramadol， he developed morbilliform rashes all over the body. One day later he developed generalized tonic clonic seizure followed by loss of consciousness for 5 min. The patient was rushed to emergency department and managed conservatively with injection lorazepam and tramadol was stopped. He had no history of similar episode in the past. On examination the patient was conscious， oriented to time， place and person. The temperature was 39°C， the heart rate 136 beats per min， the blood pressure 130/80 mmHg， and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. On neurological examination， the patient's mental status was normal. There was no involvement of cranial nerve. Motor testing revealed full symmetric strength in the arms and legs. Deep-tendon reflexes were2+ and symmetric. Other systematic examinations were also normal. Blood levels of electrolytes， glucose， vitamin B12 (cobalamin) were normal， as were results of tests of kidney， liver， and thyroid function. The complete blood count， erythrocyte sedimentation rate， and creatine kinase level were normal. His Electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed atrial fibrillation with controlled ventricular rate. Computed Tomography(CT) of the head，performed after theintravenous administration of contrast material， was normal. An Electroencephalogram (EEG) was done after neurology\n\n【8】Discussion\n\n【9】Tramadol is a“bimodal agent that possesses activity at opioid and monoaminergic (serotonergic and non-adrenergic) pathways in the CNS. Tramadol is commonly used in place of other potent opioid analgesics for treatment of moderate to moderately severe pain associated with osteoarthritis， rheumatoid arthritis， and low back pain and neuropathic conditions 通用删除6(英):<u>[4，5]</u>. There are controversies about the seizure inducing effect oftramadol. Some earlier studies suggested that Tramadol when given in overdose in patients with extant disorder of seizure or when used along with antidepressants， alcohol etc. instigates seizure 通用删除6(英):<u>[6，7]</u>. It was also disclosed from other studies that Tramadol also instigates seizure when used as monotherapy in approved dose. It has also been found that appearance of seizure following tramadol use is not dose dependant 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>. However， in our patient the seizure occurred at a dose of 37.5 mg oral tramadol hydrochloride. Tramadol-induced seizures have been reported to be generalized tonic-clonic in nature， without aura and focal deficit， as seen in our patient. Tramadol has very less abuse potential when compared to other opioids. So， it is prescribed very commonly in clinical practice. A recent cross-sectional study conducted by Labate et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u> in 2005 examined 106 patients with tramadol induced seizure found the entire patient had tonic clonic seizure within 12 h of oral intake of tramadol in supratherapeutic and recommended doses. Among those， 13% had history of epilepsy which was well controlled and didn’t recur before one year of their evaluation. Tramadol induced seizure may be associated with agitation， tachycardia， confusion and hypertension， leading to serotonin syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>. In the present case， the continuing tachycardia ranging from 120 bpm to140 bpm was found to be the only salient observation that could be accountable to low serotonergic action.\n\n【10】Conclusion\n\n【11】Tramadol has been otherwise a safe drug over many years； however with evidence of serious reaction like seizure even at low doses， the scientific community should consider ensuring strict pharmacovigilance with respect to its use especially in the developing countries where such monitoring systems are inadequate.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

They may also present hemoptysis， fever or febrile fever， weight loss， general malaise， wheezing and bronchial hyperresponsiveness 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>.\n\n【23】At the imaging level， chest radiography usually shows the presence of fugitive opacities as indicative of ABPA， and is useful in follow-up， avoiding the need for repeated CT scans. For patients with ABPA， High-Resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT) of the chest is the most sensitive test， as it allows better evaluation of the distribution of bronchiectasis and other findings that are not apparent on radiography. Bronchiectasis and mucoid impaction are the classic ABPA findings on CT 通用删除6(英):<u>[5，10]</u>. In this patient， bronchiectasis was evidenced in the middle lobe and lingula， which， in the context of a patient with a history of asthma， increases the clinical suspicion ofABPA\n\n【24】Regarding treatment， itraconazole and voriconazole are used in the treatment of ABPA and only for patients who cannot taper oral corticosteroid or have an exacerbation of ABPA. The use of other drugs such as Omalizumab， itraconazole and voriconazole are still being investigated10. In this case the patient was prescribed Itraconazole and Prednisone.\n\n【25】In conclusion， we report a case of ABPA witha clinicalpresentation of uncontrolled asthma. It is recommended that serological screening tests for Aspergillus fumigatus be routinely performed， together with high-resolution chest CT， in asthmatic patients， particularly in those with uncontrolled and/or difficult to treat asthma， since a timely diagnosis and treatment will improve the prognosis and quality of life of these patients.\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>1.

{"seq_id": "bbd45e3c-353f-4b39-b64e-92c8f2ea3463", "title": null, "text": "【0】Abstract\n\n【1】Background： Goniometers are commonly used to measure ankle Range of Motion (ROM). Recently， clinicians and physiotherapists can measure the ankle-ROM using smartphone applications. However， these measurement methods cannot be done remotely and body integration is required. For this reason， our study aim is to develop a smartphone application that can measure ankle-ROM remotely and to investigate the its correlation with the universal goniometer.\n\n【2】Methods： Twenty-two of healthy university students with 44 feet were recruited in the study. DijiA application was developed for Android smartphone to measure ankle dorsiflexion and plantar flexion ROM remotely. 44 feet were evaluated by both universal goniometer and DijiA application. After completion of testing， all of the participant were filled out the System Usability Scale (SUS) survey for measuring usability of application.\n\n【3】Results： The variation in Pearson Correlation Coefficient between the Universal Goniometer and DijiA Smartphone App result showed that there was a moderate positive relationship Between the Universal Goniometer and DijiA (r=0.323 for DF，r=0.435 for PF).\n\n【4】Conclusion： Smartphone-based ankle ROM measurement with“DijiA app can be used to assess active ROM ofthe ankle joint without weight-bearing. The result of the study showed that usability of DijiA app is satisfactory and above the standards.\n\n【5】Keywords： Ankle 1； Application 2； Range of motion 3； Smartphone\n\n【6】Introduction\n\n【7】Ankle Range of Motion (ROM) is an important parameter for assessing the functional status of the ankle joint 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. The assessment of ankle ROM is commonly performed in both clinical and research settings. Traditionally， ankle ROM measurements have been taken using a universal goniometer， which is a reliable and valid tool for measuring joint angles 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. However，advancements in technology have led to the development of Smartphone applications that claim to be a simple and accurate alternative to the traditional goniometer 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>.\n\n【8】In recent years， there has been a growing interest in using IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) sensors and image processing techniques using a Smartphone camera system for analyzing the motion or posture of the foot and ankle region 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. IMU sensors are small， wearable devices that can measure movement and orientation， and can be used to assess joint angles during ROM measurements 通用删除6(英):<u>[4，5]</u>. The use of Smartphone camera systems has also gained popularity in recent years， as they can provide accurate measurements of joint angles without the need for additional equipment 通用删除6(英):<u>[6，7]</u>.\n\n【9】However， despite the potential benefits of these technologies， there is still a need for further research to validate their use in clinical settings. Larger patient sample sizes and more robust validation assessments are necessary to ensure that these technologies can provide reliable and accurate measurements of joint angles. Additionally， the use of these technologies may require specialized training for healthcare professionals to ensure proper use and interpretation of the data通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>.\n\n【10】Despitethe challenges，the use of mobileapps and newtechnologies for ROM measurements holds promise for improving the efficiency and accuracy of clinical assessments 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>. Many clinical tests have also been computerized using mobile apps. ROM or Goniometric Measurement has gained the attention due to its importance for clinical assessment， quick-and-easy procedures， and more mobile equipment 通用删除6(英):<u>[10，11]</u>. ROM measurements have been developed for various joints， including the lumbar， knee， shoulder， and wrist 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>. Despite the fact that multiple studies have showed good reliability， more validation assessments with larger patient sample sizes have been identified as a general route for future research 通用删除6(英):<u>[12，13]</u>. By providing quick and easy procedures， and more mobile equipment， these technologies could potentially increase patient access to care and improve patient outcomes 通用删除6(英):<u>[11-13]</u>. As such， continued research and development in this area will be important for advancing the field of clinical assessment and enhancing patient care.\n\n【11】The aim of this study is to investigate the correlation between measurements of ankle ROM taken using a universal Goniometer and a Smartphone application. The use of a Smartphone application has the potential to reduce measurement errors and increase the efficiency of data collection. However， the accuracy and reliability of these applications need to be evaluated before they can be considered as a valid tool for measuring joint angles.\n\n【12】The findings of this study will provide valuable insights into the potential use of smartphone applications in the assessment of ankle ROM. This could have significant implications for the clinical and research settings， as it could provide a more convenient and cost-effective alternative to traditional goniometry. Furthermore， the results of this study may also inform the development of future Smartphone applications for measuring joint angles.\n\n【13】Materials and Methods\n\n【14】Fourteen patients with 28 feet (7 females and 7 males aged 21 to29 years) who have the foot deformity were included in this study. Patients with ankle arthrodesis， acute fractures， or other major acute illness were excluded.\n\n【15】Study design\n\n【16】DijiA application was developed for Android smartphone to measure ankle DF and PF ROM remotely. The purpose of the pilot study was to test the reliability of DijiA in ankle DF & PF-ROM删除1换行measurement compared with UG. According to this， twenty-two of healthy university students with 44 feet were recruited in Yeditepe University. All subjects were applied applications'evaluation([age， gender， existing chronic diseases， surgical conditions and injuries， morning， activity and severity of night pain and System Usability Scale (SUS) survey for android]， Figure 2) form before testing. After completion of testing， all of the participant were filled out the System Usability Scale (SUS) survey for measuring usability of application通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u>.\n\n【17】Instruments\n\n【18】Smartphone application： The Smartphone App were created to collect sociodemographic and particular information about the foot and ankle region and were authored mostly in the native (Turkish) language. Individuals might access a consent page under the KVK's(Turkish Personal Data Protection) privacy policy before proceeding to the app's home page. The participants were then requested to provide information about their sociodemographic factors [age， gender， height， weight]， dominant side， diabetes， neurological and internal disorders， history of ankle injury， trauma， and surgery. VAS was used to rate the degree of foot and ankle pain in the morning during activity， andat night . To eliminate problems caused by a lack of technological understanding， the interface was designed to be user-friendly and straightforward.\n\n【19】In order to meet with the requirements described above， a system designed and implemented. As show in Figure 1， the system is formed by a mobile component and a cloud component.\n\n【20】The mobile component will consist of the mobile application (The DijiA app) developed in accordance with the mobile device and device operating system on which the software will run. Accordingly， the mobile component will consist of software that creates a user interface suitable for the screen sizes of the device used， instantly stores the collected user data， communicates with the cloud component， and safely directs the stored data to the right service.\n\nA cloud component is a platform that keeps collected data on a designed system for access via a web server. It runs on Amazon Web Services (AWS) consisting of three EC2 Ubuntu servers which are functionally a web server，an application server， and a database server in a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). The web server welcomes the data packets coming from the mobile component to the cloud component and provides access to information stored in the primary database|删除段之间换行|which locates on the database server. Media files sent to the cloud component were kept in the file system of the database server as well. Application server runs a ROM measurement service which takes the media files from database and process to find the ROM angle of the patient. The mobile component， cloud component and ROM measurement service supplied by the cloud component are detailed in the paragraphs below.\n\n【22】The researcher created a systematic questionnaire and present to the user via mobile component. The first section of the questionnaire asked about age， weight， height， gender， existing chronic diseases， surgical conditions and injuries， morning， activity， and night pain severity. The second component ofthe questionnaire concentrated on the System Usability Scale (SUS)， a \"quick\" and dependable tool. It is a ten-item questionnaire with five response options (strongly agree-strongly disagree) that evaluates a wide range of products and services(software， hardware， mobile devices， websites， and apps). According to studies， SUS scores above 68 are considered above average， while anything below 68 is deemed below ordinary 通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u>.\n\nThe DijiA app， whose screenshots are shown in Figure 2， was initially available offline after being downloaded. Until the user has an internet connection， patient s data was saved in the local database|删除段之间换行|(SQLite) on the mobile device. The video shooting step in the mobile app decided the ROMs of the patients. During the video recording phase， patients were requested to do DF and PF movements in a lengthy sitting position with a rolled towel orfand pillow under the knee. Patients were shown the steps of this procedure via video simulation via the app.\n\n【24】Following the completion of the mobile app's optimization and testing， those who volunteered to participate in the study were requested to download the mobile app to their phones in order to carry out the pilot study. Individuals uploaded their information onto the app， which they then downloaded to their phones and used to provide their ankle normal range of motion measures by capturing videos through the app.\n\n【25】Individuals completed the usability tests for evaluating the mobile app after uploading their videos to the system. The prototype of the mobile device app was tested for usability so that the latest releases contain messages that are clear，effective， consistent with the purpose， and easily understood by the target audience， and do not provoke negative responses. This test provided researchers with data on how individuals perform on questions and the app (colors， music， sounds， timing). Mixed methodologies (direct observation， interviews with删除1换行individuals， and satisfaction surveys) were utilized in the pilot study to explain areas of progress in a cross-sectional way.\n\n【26】The information and video gathered from the patient are sent to the cloud component. The video file stored in database server is taken by the application server to be processed. This process can be named as a human pose estimation which is a challenge of estimating the articulated joint locations of a human body from one image or a sequence of photos of that person. This challenge has been tried to be solved with the methods developed over time. Thus， it has been observed that advances in computer learning provide more accurate human body part detection. In the light of these in-formation， we used deep learning and image processing techniques to determine the angle between leg and foot.\n\n【27】For segmentation of the ankle area，Mask-RCNN， a deep learning algorithm， trained with COCO dataset is used. After segmenting the region of interest， we applied image processing techniques such as CLAHE， skin segmentation， contouring and skeletonizing. The code is open source under the GNU General Public License v3.0 at https：//github.com/gulsahgg/FootMaskApp. Figure 3， shows the steps to acquire the angle from a video frame.\n\n【28】Statistical analysis\n\n【29】Statistical analyzes were applied by using IBM SPSS Statistics 22Program. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was applied to assess the distribution of the data. Descriptive statistics were used to define features of study groups. Pearson correlation coefficients were utilized to find significant correlations between the outcomes of two instruments. The 0.05 significance value was used.\n\n【30】Results\n\n【31】Twenty-two healthy university students with 44 feet (14 females and 8 males aged 18 to 24 years) were included in the study. DijiA pilot study participants descriptive data (age， weight， and height) are presented in Table 1.\n\n【32】For comparing the Universal Goniometer (UG) and DijiA， 44 feet were available in Table 2. The mean of ROM measured with the UG were DF for 19.93 ±8.00， PF for 38.59 ±6.46 and measured with the DijiA were DF for 37.45±29.52， PF for 78.55±56.54.\n\n【33】According to Pearson Correlation Coefficient between the Universal Goniometer (UG) and the DijiA in measuring ankle dorsiflexion and plantarflexion were significant with DF； 95% CI=0.06-0.65； PF； 95% CI=0.21-0.64 .\n\n【34】The variation in Pearson Correlation Coefficient between the Universal Goniometer and DijiA Smartphone App result was showed in Figure 4. According to these findings， there was a moderate positive删除1换行relationship between the Universal Goniometer and DijiA (r=0.323for DF， r=0.435 for PF).\n\n【35】The System Usability Scale (SUS) is a 10-item questionnaire with5 response options (Appendix C). The Survey results for measuring usability of DijiA smartphone app were displayed in Table 4. In the literature， A SUS score of 68 or more is regarded above average， while anything below 68 is considered below standard. SUS score was report as 76.5 (higher perceived usability). It can be interpreted that the application usability is high and people liked it .\n\n【36】The overall score given by the participants to the application was recorded by evaluating it out of 10， and the average was found to be 8.26. In addition， feedback was received from the participants expressing their opinions and suggestions for the application. Accordingly， 3 people out of 15 gave the feedback which is written in the Table 5.\n\n【37】Discussion\n\n【38】Chronic medical problems (osteoarthritis， diabetes mellitus， for example)， anatomical (pes planus-cavus)， better shoe wear， prolonged standing on hard surfaces， sports activity， and biomechanical(increased pronation subtalar joint， AT tightness， limited dorsi-plantar flexors weakness) factors are all associated with hindfoot pain 通用删除6(英):<u>[15-17]</u>. Early recognition and assessment of HP risk factors can lead to successful control and prevention of these symptoms and their chronicity 通用删除6(英):<u>[15，18]</u>. Many manual and device-based techniques are available in the literature for the early detection and evaluation of the risk factors listed above (especially foot deformity and ankle-ROM). Many techniques can be used to determine ankle joint mobility， including tape measures， digital gravity goniometers， visual estimation， inclinometers， or measurement of joint angles after radiographic visualization in maximal flexion or extension， and Universal Goniometers (UG) 通用删除6(英):<u>[19，20]</u>. Using eye evaluation or mechanical goniometers is inexpensive， simple， and quick， but it has significant error. The higher exposure of radiographic examination prevents it from being widely employed， despite the fact that it is universally recognized as the reference procedure 通用删除6(英):<u>[21，22]</u>. Other methods of ROM measurement (gait analysis， digital goniometers， or删除表格换行imaging with computer image processing) are too time-consuming and expensive to be employed on a regularbasis. Furthermore， the UG is inexpensive and widely used 通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u>. Munteanu et al. discovered that UG reliability (ICC 14 0.65-0.89) was worse than digital inclinometer(ICC 140.88) and acrylic plate apparatus dependability (ICC 14 0.89) in earlier research when they examined ankle joint DF in a weight-bearing position with the knee extended 通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u>.\n\n【39】Table 1： DijiA pilot study participants' descriptive data.\n\n| N=22  | Minimum  | Maximum  | Mean ± SD  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Age (years)  | 18  | 24  | 20.68±1.72  |\n| Height (cm)  | 157  | 183  | 170.27±9.21  |\n| Weight (kg)  | 47  | 91  | 65.09±14.52  |\n\n【41】Data expressed as mean + standard deviation； N： Faot Number； ROM： Range of Motion， DF： Darsiflexion； PF： Plantar Flexion， UG： Universal Goniometer， DijiA：\n\n【42】Dijital Adimlar App Table 2： Summary statistics for ankle Range of Motion (ROM) measurements in the study participants.\n\n| ROM(N=44)  | Minimum  | Maximum  | Mean± SD  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| UG DF PF  | 1025  | 5050  | 19.93±8.00 38.59±6.46  |\n| DitA DIF PF  | 00  | 88.23235.65  | 37.45±29.5278.55±56.54  |\n\n【44】Motion； DF： Dorsiflexian， PF： Plantar Flexion； UG： Universal Goniometer； DijiA：Dijital Adimlar App\n\n【45】Table 3： Pearson correlation coefficient between the universal goniometer and DiiA.\n\n| ROM  | Pearson Correlation  | %95C  | P value  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| DIF UG-DIiA  | 0.323  | (.06-.65)  | <0.01  |\n| PF UG-DIiA  | 0.435  | (.21-.64)  | <0.01  |\n\n【47】Data expressed as mean ± standard deviation； N： Faat Number； ROM： Range of Motion； DF： Dorsiflexion； PF： Plantar Flexion， UG： Universal Goniameter； DijiA：Dijital Adimlar App\n\n【48】Table 4： Distribution of answers to the System Usability Scale (SUS) survey questionnaire for DijiA Smartphone App.\n\n| Questions  | Disagree%(n)  | Not sure%(n)  | Agree%(n)  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Complexity  | 86.6通用删除7(英):<u>(13)</u>  | 6.6通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u>  | 6.6通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u>  |\n| Ease of use  | 0  | 6.6通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u>  | 93.33通用删除7(英):<u>(14)</u>  |\n| Technical support need  | 66.6通用删除7(英):<u>(10)</u>  | 20通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u>  | 13.33通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u>  |\n| Integration of functions  | 6.6通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u>  | 13.33通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u>  | 80通用删除7(英):<u>(12)</u>  |\n| Presence of inconsistency  | 93.33通用删除7(英):<u>(14)</u>  | 6.6通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u>  | 0  |\n| Quick use  | 0  | 20通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u>  | 80通用删除7(英):<u>(12)</u>  |\n| App is slow  | 80通用删除7(英):<u>(12)</u>  | 20通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u>  | 0  |\n| Confident Use  | 0  | 20通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u>  | 80通用删除7(英):<u>(12)</u>  |\n| learn before use  | 66.6通用删除7(英):<u>(10)</u>  | 26.66通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u>  | 6.6通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u>  |\n\n【50】Table 5： The application overall score， suggestions and feedback results for DjiA Smartphone App.\n\n| Application OverallScore (N=15)[minimum-maximum1  | Feedbacks (N=3)  |\n| --- | --- |\n| 通用删除6(英):<u>[0-10]</u>  | Videa uplaad locations can be improved.

Despite this issue， UG remains the gold standard in clinical practice for measuring ROM 通用删除6(英):<u>[24，25]</u>. Furthermore， because of their accessibility， low cost， and simplicity， a growing number of mobile applications on smartphones are being employed in medical settings instead of traditional measuring equipment such as UG 通用删除6(英):<u>[26]</u>. Previously， the validity and reliability of numerous smartphone ROM measurement apps were tested， and they were discovered to be validiand trustworthy in measuring ROM in a range of joints (elbow，knee， and fifth metatarsophalangeal joints) 通用删除6(英):<u>[20，27]</u>. According to Williams et al.，who evaluated ankle DF-ROM in weight-bearing using the mobile goniometer app TiltMeter downloaded on a smartphone (ICC 0.8 or higher)， measurement intra/inter-rater reliability with knee extend-flexed was shown to be excellent 通用删除6(英):<u>[28]</u>. Two more studies 通用删除6(英):<u>[29，30]</u>删除1换行demonstrated moderate to excellent reliability and validity in the use of IOS-based goniometer applications to test weight-bearing DF-ROM. Weight-bearing the inter/intra-rater reliability of the DF-ROM assessment using the mobile goniometer software Spirit level plus loaded on an Android Smartphone was reasonable 通用删除6(英):<u>[31]</u>. There could be several explanations for why their reliabilities were higher. The most prominent documented example is the use of various mobile goniometer applications on different types of devices with different operating systems (Android vs. iOS) 通用删除6(英):<u>[28]</u>. Another consideration is that applications may have an impact on measurement differences， and their respective software platforms must be extensively evaluated. Any new version of the program that is released should be validated again 通用删除6(英):<u>[20，27]</u>.\n\n【53】Weight-bearing ankle-ROM assessments are nevertheless limited in that they cannot be used if weight-bearing is forbidden， and the process appears to be less objective than non-weight-bearing ones because the applied load is required to achieve the final position通用删除6(英):<u>[23，32]</u>. Cox et al. investigated ankle joint PF-ROM measurements in non-weight-bearing position and found that The Plaincode Smartphone app was a viable instrument for measuring PF-ROM(right foot r=0.92， p=0.00， left foot r=0.92， p=0.00， combination r=0.92， p0.00) 通用删除6(英):<u>[33]</u>. Walaa et al. also investigated the validity and intra-rater reliability of the Smartphone app \"Clinometer\" for assessing ankle ROM in non-weight-bearing position using a digital inclinometer as the reference standard. Clinometer was shown to have moderate validity when compared to the digital inclinometer for ankle ROM (r=0.52-0.57)通用删除6(英):<u>[34]</u>. Similarly， in our investigation， we discovered a modest amount of Pearson Correlation between UGand DijiA 通用删除1(英):<u>(r=0.323，p=0.03 for DF；r=435， p.00 for PF， Table 3)</u>. Furthermore， a SUS score was regarded as having higher perceived usefulness， with a total average usability score of 76.5  通用删除6(英):<u>[35]</u>.\n\n【54】The study has a few limitations. The first was the lack of a one-year follow-up assessment period and any outcomes from the combination treatment techniques long-term impacts. Second， DijiA， one of the Smartphone apps we created， was for Android. These apps should be built into all phone OS， and their usefulness should be evaluated. Furthermore， based on the findings of the usability survey， we believe that the inter-face design of the DijiA application should be altered， and the correlation relationship should be strengthened by continuing optimization testing of the DijiA application.\n\n【55】Conclusion\n\n【56】HP can effectively reduce and avoid these symptoms， as well as their chronicity. As a result， we created a Smartphone application(DijiA) and studied its usefulness and correlation for assessing ankle range ofmotion. The\"DijiA\"app on a smartphone can be used to assess active ROM of the ankle joint without weight bearing. The study's findings revealed that the usability of the DijiA app is satisfactory and beyond industry standards. Smartphone ankle ROM assessment apps allow patients to monitor their possible risk factors without purchasing pricey hardware. This encourages patients to engage in enthusiastic self-rehabilitation and allows for the identification of risk factors in individuals suffering from hindfoot discomfort. Patients， physiotherapists，and doctors can use these apps to remotely monitor ROM at home or in the clinic using a mobile Smartphone. The findings of this study may influence practice guidelines for the management of hindfoot pain and the usage of Smartphone apps for injury prevention.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

The incidence of stent loss ranges widely from0.32% to 8.3%， while the success rate of retrieval varies between 45% and 100%. Advances in stent technology， with enhanced flexibility and deliverability， combined with increased experience in stent utilization， have contributed to a decreased occurrence of stent loss 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>.\n\n【8】通用间距删除-1:<u>Citation：</u>\n\n【9】Various types of equipment， including stents， guidewires， and catheters， can be inadvertently misplaced or trapped within or outside the coronary artery. Device entrapment poses a more severe complication than device loss. Retrieval of a dislodged stent can be achieved surgically or percutaneously， utilizing different devices and techniques such as a small balloon catheter， a snare loop， the two-wire technique， grasping forceps， or basket retrieval devices 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>.\n\n【10】In the present case， we describe a complex scenario involving a patient with significant left main disease who underwent Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) with stent placement. Unfortunately， during the procedure， the stent became entrapped within the Left Main artery (LM)， resulting in longitudinal deformation (elongation) and protrusion into the aorta all the way to brachiocephalic trunk during the stent extraction process. To optimize the chances of a successful and safe stent extraction while minimizing potential complications， a comprehensive assessment was conducted using multiple imaging techniques.\n\n【11】Case Presentation\n\n【12】A 72-year-old patient with a history of myocardial infarction and a previous primary Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) on the Circumflex artery (Cx) in 2013 was admitted due to lower limb ischemia and significant carotid disease. The patient presented with rest leg pain and had a medical history of diabetes， managed with insulin， hypertension， dyslipidemia， and normal kidney function(estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate， eGFR). Considering the planned major vascular surgery and risk factors， the patient was referred for preoperative coronary angiography which revealed three-vessel disease with LM stenosis .\n\n【13】Due to the severe calcification of the aorta ， surgical intervention was deemed unsuitable， leading to the recommendation of a staged procedure. The initial approach involved PCI of the LM， followed by vascular surgery， and concluding with PCI of the Right Coronary Artery (RCA).\n\n【14】The procedure was performed using right radial access and a 6F extra backup Guiding Catheter (GC). The chosen strategy employed provisional stenting towards the Left Anterior Descending artery(LAD). After a predilation with a Non-Compliant (NC) 2.5 mm×15 mm balloon， a second-generation drug-eluting stent 3.5 mmx18 mm was implanted from the LM towards the LAD . To optimize the proximal area， a NC 4.0 mm x 6 mm balloon was employed， followed by a \"kissing\" inflation technique involving a NC3.5 mm x 15 mm balloon in the LAD and a NC 2.5 mm x 15 mm balloon in the Circumflex artery (Cx).\n\nAfter obtaining an unsatisfactory result in Cx ， we attempted to implant a DES 3.0 mm × 18 mm， but encountered difficulties in crossing it to Cx. Unfortunately， the stent became dislodged from the balloon and got trapped in the LM while the distal third of the stent was in the guiding catheter. To address this issue， we confined the dislodged stent by using a 2.5 mm ×15 mm balloon at the tip of GC， and then removed the entire system along with the wires . During the removal of the system， the stent fracture occurred， so we were able to extract only a small part of the stent that was inside the catheter trapped by the balloon， while with full body fluoroscopy we were unable to find the larger part of the stent. The patient remained stable without any signs or symptoms of embolization， which led us to make the decision to proceed with the PCI procedure. We performed rewiring and modified our approach to a \"culotte\" stenting technique. Following pre-dilatation with an NC2.5 mm × 15 mm balloon， we successfully implanted a DES 3.0 mm|删除段之间换行|x16 mm from the LM to Cx . Although we encountered difficulties in advancing the wire towards LAD， we managed to overcome the issue by using a hydrophilic wire. Subsequently， we performed angioplasty using an NC 3.0 mm×15 mm balloon， followed by post-dilatation using an NC 4.0 mm x 8 mm balloon.\n\n【16】Two days after the initial procedure on routine echocardiography， a hyperechogenic formation was observed in the aorta. A CT scan revealed a linear formation (possibly metal or calcium) extending from the Left Main (LM) in the ascending aorta towards the brachiocephalic trunk， without any signs of dissection . It was concluded that this could be the larger fragment of an un-implanted stent， and a decision was made to extract it percutaneously.\n\n【17】Dual access was obtained from the left radial and right brachial artery to place a 6F GC in the LM and wire the LAD and Cx arteries to prevent abrupt vessel closure. Optical Coherence Tomography(OCT) revealed a dissection at the proximal LAD without a previously implanted stent and only one stent layer in the LM， confirming that the initially implanted stent from the LM to the LAD was pulled out by the entrapped stent .\n\n【18】Using snare device distorted stent was caught in ascending aorta and brought to the right brachial artery ， this maneuver completely extracted all previously implanted stents from left coronary artery. The stent from LCx ended in right carotid artery and were further extracted using snare from left radial artery after\n\n【19】删除10:<u>A B</u>\n\n【20】Discussion\n\n【21】The dislodgement of a stent can occur due to various factors，删除1换行such as extreme coronary angulation， highly calcified coronary arteries， inadequate coronary artery predilation， and direct stenting通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. Despite the limited number of reports in the literature on the simultaneous removal of a dislodged stent and a previously implanted stent using a snare device， the extraction procedures predominantly targeted stents that were either recently deployed or in the process of being deployed. Conventional balloon expansion tightly secures coronary stents to the vessel wall， making unintentional removal very uncommon 通用删除6(英):<u>[4，5，7-9]</u>. Dislodgement from the delivery system typically happens when the stent-balloon assembly is pulled back into the Guiding Catheter (GC) or when it cannot reach the target lesion due to complex anatomy 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. Percutaneous stent retrieval can be successfully achieved using various techniques， including the small-balloon technique， double-wire technique， or loop snare 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. The snare technique has demonstrated its effectiveness for this purpose， although its successful implementation relies on technical proficiency and is influenced by factors such as the size， flexibility， rigidity， and compressibility of the stent 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>. In our particular scenario， we encountered a situation where the stent became entrapped while attempting to navigate through the layer of the previously inserted stent. Now， the pivotal question arises： What measures could we have taken to prevent such an occurrence? We should have initially used imaging techniques to assess the amount of calcium and the true diameters of the Left Main (LM) and its branches. Although we obtained optimal angiographic results by using a 2.5 mm balloon at12 atm (2.7 mm)and implanting a stent measuring 3.5 mm x18 mm from LM to the LAD artery， we should have also utilized Intravascular Ultrasound (IVUS) to evaluate stent expansion in the LM， specifically checking for under-deployment or possible strut intraluminal protrusion. When dealing with vessels adjacent to previously stented arteries， operators must exercise utmost caution. In the event of stent advancement difficulties， this issue should raise a red flag， indicating the need to address the problem promptly. Under such circumstances， it is advisable to consider under-expanding the previously implanted stent and， if possible， performing additional balloon dilation. Furthermore， maintaining proper coaxial alignment of the guiding catheter plays a vital role in successfully retrieving a stent that cannot be crossed 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. Stent extraction carries risks of the stent struts catching onto the endothelial layer， leading to tearing or disruption. Endothelial tearing can result in various adverse outcomes，including acute thrombosis， vessel dissection， or even perforation. Ragosta et al. meticulously documented complications in a comprehensive analysis of seventeen cases involving stent extraction. Among these cases， a total of seven reported complications， with three instances\n\n【22】删除10:<u>A B</u>\n\n【23】Conclusion\n\n【24】The extraction of previously implanted stents represents a rare", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

Lack of oxygen support， vaccines， and capacity in hospital beds are now the bottlenecks to tackle the second wave of COVID-19 India.\n\n【2】Keywords： COVID-19；India； Second wave； Vaccine； First Wave； Economy\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】The biggest threat in humankind is now COVID-19， which is of Zoonotic origin and spreads through aerosol transmission of respiratory droplets. It started from the seafood market in Wuhan， Hubei， China back in December 2019，and within 2 months， it spread worldwide and WHO declared it as pandemic 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，2]</u>. Most common symptoms include dry cough， fever， difficulty of breathing， and tiredness or fatigue 通用删除6(英):<u>[3，4]</u>. It is estimated that transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is occurring mainly by airborne 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. To tackle the issues， several countries went into a lockdown scheme. During this national lockdown， restrictions were imposed on most of the movement， home confinement was mandatory， and exceptions were given only for essential food shopping 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. Physical distance， use of mask， hand sanitization， respiratory hygiene， prompt self-isolating， and prompt testing are the so-far worldwide COVID-19 prevention techniques. A recent survey of WHO reveals that globally90% of countries are still struggling to come back to their pre-COVID-19 condition in terms of health services.\n\n【5】Now， the world is experiencing a second wave of COVID-19 infection 通用删除6(英):<u>[7，8]</u>. Often the second wave from infectious diseases occurs after a relative decrease in the number of patients with the disease. The second wave may increase among specific age groups or populations， or in particular areas of each country and become as widespread as the first wave. The first wave of a pandemic is followed some months later by a second or third wave of infection. This can be severe as experienced previously in the influenza pandemics of 1918 (H1H1)， 1957 (H2H2)， 1968 (H3N2)， and 2009(H1N1) 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>. It may be a question that why there is always a second wave. Probably the answer is， most often， infected people in one region do not develop herd immunity and they are re-exposed again to the infection from people who got infected from the first wave 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>. After the COVID-19last year， WHO including all research articles， scientists， and researchers， expected that there could be a second wave from COVID-19. The threat arriving from the COVID-19 second wave was already assumed and reported by researchers 通用删除6(英):<u>[11，12]</u>.\n\nSome countries， like South Korea and Singapore， got success to flatten the virus spreading by employing comprehensive testing and tracing regimes. Furthermore， UK， France， Italy， Spain managed to flatten the wave by imposing lockdowns. On June 22nd， 2020，South Korea announced the second wave although the number was low 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>. In this country so far death count was 301 (as of July31，2020).South Korea has conducted 1，295，962 tests since January 3m， 2020， to detect the illness通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u>. On January 23，COVID-19 officially hit Vietnam and by the 8th of September 2020，Vietnam had a second wave 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>. The first wave commenced in Spain， from mid-March 2020 and continued for 3 months and again the second wave started in mid-September 2020 which stayed until 2020Christmas 通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>. Sweden's COVID-19 cases peaked during the first wave with 102 reported deaths(7-day rolling average) on April 215，2020.On December 20h， 2020， COVID-19 deaths in Sweden had reached more than 8，000 通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>. The second wave from COVID-19 was theoretically studied for Iran， where model validation and the prediction were performed using data from January 22nd to June 25h， 2020. It was predicted that the second wave would be more severe than the first wave. The most effective way to the improvement of weakly immune people is to employ appropriate medical|删除段之间换行|Last year one study revealed that India could face a deadly second wave and in present-day India is facing this enormous life-taking wave. Currently， India is facing another wave， or better to say the second wave， and much more in world discussion. In this work， how Indian is dealing with the second wave of COVID-19 and vaccination and other associated issues are discussed.\n\n【7】First Wave in India\n\nIndia is the 2nd most populated country in the world after China， and a center of attraction because of its diverse variation. India has 28 states and 8 Union Territories. Its population is more than 1.35 billion， of which 2.75 million are below the poverty line. A significant variation is present in India where the smallest state Sikkim has a population closer to Bhutan and the largest one Uttar Pradesh has a population similar to Brazil. Goa which has the highest|删除段之间换行|GDP per capita can be comparable to Jordan while the poorest state Bihar is similar to that of Haiti 通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u>. Thus， state-wide variation is not surprising. The health care system in India is also a mixture of public and private health care systems， available in rural and urban locations. The government unfortunately spends only 1.17% of its GDP on health care 通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u>. The overall capacity of private health care is4 times that of the public sector.\n\n【9】January 30h， 2020， was the day when the first case of COVID-19was detected in the southern state of India. Within few weeks， COVID-19 spread throughout the country and reached the count of100 by March and close of 1，600 by end of March. Consequently， the first death from this disease also happened in March. To tackle the spread Indian PM announced a nationwide lockdown without any heads up to the citizen. Initially， the lockdown was until April 14h，2020， which later was extended to May 03， 2020，and then June 012020 通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u>. To understand how the lockdown worked in India， the stringency index was performed which showed that at the starting of lockdown the stringency index was 100 whereas， in other countries which also faced serious lockdown， the in dex was not satisfactory and appeared low. On April 12h， 2020， Italy scored a stringency index of93.5， while Belgium and Peru counted 81.48 on March 22n， 2020，and96.30 on May 015，2020. However， India's score fell to near 82 in May2020， which evidently indicates that lockdown which was followed删除1换行according to the governmental rules at the beginning， did not at the end.\n\n【10】As shown in Figure 1， it is apparent that this lockdown did not help India to stop the spread and India experienced its peak in September 2020. Back in September 2020， India faced 90，000 cases every day including 1，200 deaths. Lockdown had limited success and it drastically impacted the Indian GDP， which fell 23.9% than that of the same quarter in 2019. Sharp unemployment was prominent because of the lack of jobs. Industrial Production (IIP) fell by 36%during the 3 months between April and June of 2020 compared to the previous year 通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u>. Indian government behavior towards migrant workers was negligent which the world experienced last year. Unnecessary death， due to the impact of COVID-19 lockdown which was not directly related to the COVID-19 occurred， was nearly600 by late May 2020 通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u>. The death of 23 individuals from March12h to April 11h， 2020， was recorded due to suicide. Fear of isolation or domestic violence was the reason behind these tragic incidents通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u>. This noticeably indicates that not only economic issues， social health， and mental issues were also key aspects due to the prolonged lockdown period.\n\n【11】The air quality of India is always in bad shape which got an immensely positive impact due to last year’s COVID-19 lockdown. In India， mainly major urban places and cities have poor air quality. Because of the lockdown transport， industries were closed which limited the emission ofharmful gases. Compared with the immediate Pre-Lockdown period (PL3)， the average PM2.5 and PM10 reduced by up to 51% and 47% respectively during the lockdown periods 通用删除6(英):<u>[24-26]</u>.\n\n【12】Second Wave in India\n\n【13】In mid-September， India had a peak of 93，000 cases per day， which started declining， and the Indian government， policymakers， media； politicians thought In dia is free from COVID-19. Restrictions were less and elections campaigns for five states were announced for186 million people to cast their vote. In January 2021 Indian started its vaccine diplomacy by shipping vaccines to foreign countries. Interestingly last year， a research study from MIT suggested that without proper treatment or vaccination， India can surge up to0.287 million cases by early 2021. India reported more than 100，000new cases on April 04h， 2021，and a new record for the country was observed， a level not seen in its first wave. On April 15h， 2021， new COVID-19 infected cases were 0.2 million in India. On May 4h， COVID-19 cases were more than 20.2 million. The western state of Maharashtra， which has been India’s COVID ground zero from the start of the pandemic， is back at the top after briefly reporting a drop in cases. This state， among India， the richest and home to its financial hub， Mumbai， confirmed more than 66，000 cases last night. It is widely agreed among experts that both cases and deaths are being under-reported in India right now. The Lancet COVID-19commission warned that India could experience recording more than2，300 deaths every day by the first week of June.\n\n【14】To understand the COVID-19 cases two factors can be considered： (a) Test Positivity Rate (TPR=total infection/total cases)；(b) Case Fatality Rate (CFR= total deaths/total infections). The Test positivity rate shows whether testing is enough to limit the virus spread by employing quarantine and isolation. According to WHO， TPR below 5% is good which indicates the health care program is working sufficiently. India had over 5% TPR during the first wave and started declining from August 2020. On April 14， 2021，TPR was删除表格换行used.\n\n【15】Table 1： State-wise TPR and CFR in India on April 15m， 2021通用删除6(英):<u>[271</u>.\n\n| State  | CFR  | TPR  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Maharashtra  | 1.6  | 15.7  |\n| Nagaland  | 0.7  | 8.9  |\n| Kerala  | 0.4  | 8.5  |\n| Chhattisgarh  | 1.1  | 7.6  |\n| West Bengal  | 1.7  | 6.5  |\n| Andhra Pradesh  | 0.8  | 6  |\n| Madhya Pradesh  | 1.2  | 5.3  |\n| Tripura  | 1.2  | 5.1  |\n| Rajasthan  | 0.8  | 5.1  |\n\n【17】5.4%.

Emergency Use Listing (EULs) for COVID-19 vaccine was issued by WHO. On December 31， 2020 Pfizer， on February 15h， 2021， two versions of the AstraZeneca/Oxford， (manufactured by the Serum Institute of India and SKBio)， and on March 12h， 2021， Ad26.COV2.S， (Johnson& Johnson) were EUL listed by WHO. According to WHO， the vaccine should be taken if possible and even if you experienced COVID-19.However， it is too early to predict how these vaccines will work and protect and research is continued. It is still advised to take a vaccine because it will develop immunity inside the human body and will probably reduce the risk of illness development. In general vaccine development goes several stages which include pre-clinical(vaccine development in the lab)， Phase 1 Clinical trial (8 participants to 10 participants； for vaccine testing safety)； Phase 2 clinical trial (50participants to 100 participants； for testing vaccine immunogenicity i.e. production of antibodies against virus)； Phase 3 clinical trial (30k participants to 50k participants； for testing actual protection offered by the vaccine) 通用删除6(英):<u>[28]</u>. However， this COVID-19's dreadful impact forced to development of a vaccine within a vear compared to other previous diseases 通用删除6(英):<u>[29]</u>. For example， the development of the polio vaccine took 40 years， 5 years for Ebola， and an average of 15 years for most of the vaccine development 通用删除6(英):<u>[30]</u>. To understand how vaccines are working properly， efficacy is useful term. Efficacy is a degree of relative lessening in threat. To understand it in bete way； if someone has cloned of him/herself which having one version fully vaccinated and other version is not then the vaccinated one will have 95% less risk to get risk. In reality cloning of human being is not possible hence in the lab randomization is employed 通用删除6(英):<u>[31]</u>. According to WHO， vaccine will only is allowed in the market if it has at least 50% efficacy and higher is better 通用删除6(英):<u>[32]</u>. Table 3 lists the vaccines and their efficacy.\n\n【26】India targeted to vaccinate 300 million people by August 2021， and by February 8h， 2021， India was able to vaccinate 6 million beneficiaries countrywide 通用删除6(英):<u>[40]</u>. In India， two different vaccines are available which include Covishield and Covaxin. Covishield vaccine is the same patent technology developed by the AstraZeneca vaccine and manufactured by the Serum Institute of India. According to the Indian Government website， the choice of vaccine is not an option of public， though it will be made available in various parts of India. The first group includes healthcare and frontline workers. The second group to receive the COVID-19 vaccine will be persons over 60 years删除1换行of age and persons between 45 and 59 years of age with comorbid conditions. Vaccines are mostly liquid products. As of May 5h， 2021total vaccination has been done for 16，04，94，188 people.\n\n【27】At the beginning of the vaccination program， vaccines were free from government medical healthcare while private hospitals charged250 rupees ($3) which were changed later. Serum institute decided to sell shots at 150 rupees to central， 300 rupees ($4) to state， and the private hospital for 600 rupees ($8). Bharat Biotech decided to charge 150 rupees to central， 400 rupees ($5.50) and private hospital for 1200 rupees ($16) 通用删除6(英):<u>[42]</u>. European Union paid $2.15 per dose for the AstraZeneca vaccine. According to them， the price reduction is because of the EU's contribution to vaccine development. This high price for Covaxin is shocking as it is made by an Indian company.On the other hand， Covaxin didn't publish yet its phase 3 clinical trial data in a peer-reviewed scientific journal， and has only announced its interim efficacy data-claimed to be around 80% through a press release. Now Sputnik V vaccines got a green signal to be used and at the first phase， 125 million doses will be distributed. Details of the present two vaccines are listed in Table 4 and Table 5， which show the other vaccines that are under process.\n\n【28】However， there is still doubt that the vaccination plan will not work properly as the COVID-19 virus is mutating and new variants as listed in Table 6. WHO has been tracking mutations and variants since the start of the COVID-19 outbreak. Currently， there is no agreed international naming system for variants. In India， the active variants are B.1.617 and B.1.1.7.3.2.\n\n【29】Current issues in India\n\n【30】COVID-19patients with severe conditions suffer from respiratory distress 通用删除6(英):<u>[44]</u>.

However， the director of Inox Air Products， which supplies 50% of the oxygen demands in the country， claims that India has sufficient oxygen to deal with the present condition. India produces more than 7，000 metric tons of liquid oxygen per day. Uneven supply and logistical issues have led to an oxygen crisis in some states. Some other major oxygen manufacturers in India include Indian Linde India， Goyal MG Gases Pvt. Ltd.， National Oxygen Limited 通用删除6(英):<u>[47]</u>. In India， the health care sector consumes 15% of total produced oxygen while the rest are consumed by industry. During this pandemic， 90% of oxygen is now supplied to the medical sector and still， the situation is critical.

Saudi Arabia will send 80 MT of liquid oxygen. 800 Oxygen concentrators from Hong Kong and four cryogenic oxygen containers from Thailand respectively. UAE will send six cryogenic oxygen containers 通用删除6(英):<u>[50]</u>. Indian government revised the Foreign Trade Policy and allowed to import of oxygen for personal use until July 2021.Indian rail (oxygen express) transporting liquid medical oxygen across the country in the name of Oxygen Expresses to fight COVID-19.\n\n【39】To destroy the COVID-19 transmission， different states and UT have imposed either night curfew， mini lockdown， restriction until 8 pm， or just keep open the essential kinds of stuff and close the non-essential shops. For example， Delhi (1 till 19th April 2021and later till May 1，2021)， Maharashtra (till May 15h， 2021)， Uttar Pradesh (till May 44，2021)， Jammu Kashmir (April 30th to May 3r，2021)， Karnataka (from April 27h， 2021， 14 days)， Telangana (May84，2021)， Jharkhand (May 64，2021)， Goa (May 3m， 2021)， Haryana(May 31， 2021)， Gujarat (29 cities till May 54， 2021)； Kerala ( from April 20h，2021)，Bihar (May 15h， 2021)， West Bengal (start from May6，2021) already have imposed such restriction.\n\n【40】From May 1India had a plan to start vaccinating the entire adult which could be around 660 million people.However， vaccine shortage is now prominent and only 12 state out of36 states including UT have enough stock to vaccinating over 18s 通用删除6(英):<u>[51]</u>. Right now in India， three key bottlenecks for the vaccination process are the unavailability of the vaccine， efficacy of the vaccine， and penetration (registration). As删除表格换行of May 10h total vaccination in India is listed in Table 7.\n\n【41】Table 7： Total COVID-19 vaccination as of 10'h May (source from MoHFW).\n\n| Type  | 1et Dose  | 2nd Dose  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Health care workers  | 95，63，406  | 65，05，072  |\n| Front line workers  | 1，40，49，681  | 78，51，075  |\n| People aged 18-44 years  | 25，52，843  |  |\n| People aged ≥ 45 years  | 5，54，97，658  | 71，73，939  |\n| People aged 60 years  | 5，38，00，706  | 1，56，39，381  |\n| Total  | 13，54，64，924  | 3，71，69，467  |\n\n【43】From last year lockdown， Indian education sector suffered a lot. When there was a plan to school student’s returning to school， this second wave created and made the plan delayed again. Indian government made announcements regarding promotion of student to the next classes without any examination，based on their assessments， class tests and projects. Additionally， various states cancelled their state board examinations during serious pandemic situation， directly and severely affecting the education system and standards 通用删除6(英):<u>[52]</u>. It's unclear when situation will be clear again. Because of the closure of education sector， approximately 320 million students have been affected. It can be argued why India didn’t move towards digital education. For 2017-18 years， National Sample Survey office reported that only 23.8% Indians have internet access with 42% in urban and14.9% in rural. According to economic times， during lockdown one in four students in India can’t use the online study because they don’t have laptop or desktop. Thus， in quality and inconsistency of education in digital medium is evident. Even developed country like USA faced challenges to offer equal online education because of the presence of black，Hispanic and low income family student. On other hand， it is also evident that the way students learn in school (offline education)， it is not possible to achieve through online because online education can't replace the interpersonal interactions， essential social skills for holistic growth and development.\n\n【44】Discussion\n\n【45】Totackle this COVID-19 situation， no medication is available now and no one knows fully how to deal with this. Isolation probably one of the best ways to limit at least the spreading of this virus. Lockdown probably the best way to limit transmission 通用删除6(英):<u>[53]</u>. According to WHO， to lift the lockdown， proper health system capacities for testing， trace every contact and isolate and treat every case； maintain social distancing at schools and other essential places， workplaces； minimizing importation of new cases from countries or areas that have not yet contained the outbreak； community willingness to continue social distancing wherever possible and community engagement in all measures are required. It is evident that the lockdown for the first wave in India did not stop the spread of COVID-19 and the economy suffered a lot. However， now the COVID-19 Task Force (set up by the government) and the Supreme Court asked the Indian government to impose again nationwide lockdown to break the transmission. Probably from last year’s experience， the Government is trying to use all efforts and keep the lockdown for the last option. However， according to the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy， this localized lockdown already created a job loss which is around 70 lakhs in various states across the country. Though it is not announced，but， from May 2021， 98% of Indians are under some kind of restriction to break the COVID-19 second wave transmission.\n\n【46】India is dealing with a huge vaccination program for COVID-19and many people even in rural areas were able to have those doses free of cost. However， it has to be remembered that temperature control is essential for the safety and efficacy of the vaccine. Even unwillingly or due to lack of infrastructure， if vaccines are kept at different temperatures， they will be deadly 通用删除6(英):<u>[54，55]</u>. The first wave of COVID-19 affected hugely in urban areas and also for the second wave it is evident that hotspots (and the emerging hotspots) are everywhere in urban areas 通用删除6(英):<u>[56，57]</u>. To have the better result from vaccination it could be the strategy to vaccinate urban areas first and then rural areas or areas where population density is less. However， now there is no scope as COVID-19 second wave also covered the smalltowns and rural areas in India.\n\n【47】It is heartbreaking to see that when India facing this tragic pandemic and suffering from the second wave； pharmaceutical companies are charging a price for vaccines. Indian government failed to stockpile vaccine at an early stage while other countries such as the USA， UK， and Israel started this measure in back September2020. India first purchased 15 million doses and later administered over 140 million doses. However， it is not officially revealed how it will be fulfilled. On February 15， India's finance minister announced Rs 35，000 crores ($4.69 billion) for COVID-19 vaccines. Without a free vaccine， India may move towards another economic downtown if lockdown possess again. Increase COVID-19 cases can create a situation again which requires the forced shutdown， closure of industry which will derail the economy again. Economist believes that Indian government could support the free vaccination scheme， which could only take 0.3% of GDP. By simple calculation， it can be shown that 966 million people should be vaccinated twice which indicates the requirement of 1.93 billion doses. If dose cost Rs 150total cost will be Rs 28，980 crores ( close to 0.14%GDP) and if the cost is Rs 400； total cost will be Rs 77，280 crores (close to 0.38%GDP)通用删除6(英):<u>[58]</u>.\n\n【48】It is evident that India's claim ofbeating the epidemic and younger population are free from this disease， immunity has been developed， and overall victory on the COVID-19 is fully hogwash. Currently， administrative arrogance， lack of doses， hyper-nationalism， and population created a grave burning issue 通用删除6(英):<u>[59]</u>. Probably it can be said that the people of Indian are also equally liable for the occurrence of the second wave. Early letting down the protection (use of mask； sanitization； maintaining social distancing)； started attending weddings and socializing，religious gathering， and no strict restriction norms from government； all added the fuel in this situation. It seems like Indians were in a parallel universe while the rest of the world was experiencing a second wave. As the infection rate waslow， people were not in the mood to take the vaccine. India could slow down the rate by imposing strict vaccination rules， maintaining social distancing， and follow strict COVID-19 restriction measures set by WHO. The government had one-year time to increase the health sector capacity and a complete failure is visible now. People are paying thousands and lakhs of money in the health sector if they are lucky enough to be admitted to hospital. According to the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation， by August 1， India can experience a staggering1 million deaths from COVID-19 通用删除6(英):<u>[60]</u>. To avail herd immunity， India should implement safe， effective， and robust vaccination 通用删除6(英):<u>[61]</u>. Currently population of India is 135 crore. 94.5 crore people must be vaccinated to obtain herd immunity which is only possible if 189crore vaccine doses are available. With India's current vaccination rate，herd immunity is feasible only in 3.5 years.\n\n【49】Conclusion\n\n【50】The second wave of COVID-19 infection was under the radar from last year still it could not be stopped. India is facing the second wave of COVID-19 infection. In this work， how India dealt with COVID-19 first wave and now suffering from the second wave is documented. National lockdown is still not imposed. Last year lockdown could not limit the COVID-19 transmission but due to the closure of industry India faced serious economic down. Pure medical Oxygen is essential for COVID-19 patients but lack of oxygen created the scenario more complex. Vaccination programs started but the price of vaccination is a serious issue. It will take several weeks to vaccinate a large population. Free vaccination could help the Indian economy as a new national lockdown can create another economic dip. Education sector is now another large sector which suffered significantly.

Given the repeated episodes of thrombotic microangiopathy while the patient was on various high-dose immunosuppressive therapeutic regimens， other causes responsible for the relapse of the microangiopathic syndrome had been considered. By exclusion of the causes frequently incriminated in this pathology the determination of ADAMTS13 was determined， the results revealing a deficiency in the activity of this factor. The patient continued treatment with MPD and therapy with Mycophenolate mofetil was initiated. The disease course was favorable with no relapse episodes recorded.\n\n【15】The definitive diagnosis was SLE and thrombotic microangiopathy due to ADAMTS13 deficiency.\n\n【16】Discussion\n\n【17】Thrombotic Microangiopathy (TMA) is a rare condition (3.7cases per 1 million patients) characterized pathophysiologically by an injury to the vascular endothelium of small vessels (most often of autoimmune origin) followed by a microvascular thrombosis， consumption thrombocytopenia， and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia， as well as neurological manifestations (through the mechanism of cerebral microthrombosis) eventually leading to ischemia and infarction in the affected organ 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>.\n\n【18】Etiologically， TMA is divided into：\n\n【19】TMA due to genetic defects 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>\n\n【20】Acquired TMA (Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura(TTP) due to ADAMTS13 deficiency， shiga-like toxin-mediated or Streptococcus pneumoniae-associated hemolytic anduremic syndrome， malignant hypertension， drug-inducedTMAA-by overdose or intolerance to active substances， complement-mediated TMA)通用删除6(英):<u>[2-4]</u>.\n\n【21】ADAMTS13 is a protease responsible for the cleavage of von Willebrand factor multimers and for their adhesion to the vascular endothelium. In cases of ADAMTS13 deficiency， von Willebrand factor multimers accumulate (through clearance deficiency) causing platelet adhesion with microthrombosis in small vessels 通用删除6(英):<u>[5-7]</u>.\n\n【22】TTP due to ADAMTS13 deficiency can be acquired (mediated by antibodies directed against ADAMTS13 activity) or hereditary(Upshaw-Schulman syndrome - homozygous and heterozygous mutation of the gene encoding ADAMTS13 on chromosome 9q34)通用删除6(英):<u>[8，9]</u>. The classic manifestations are the presence of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia， severe consumption thrombocytopenia， and kidney damage- presence of nitrogen retention， proteinuria and/or hematuria， various neurological manifestations， and fever 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>.\n\n【23】The diagnosis is made based on clinical data (skin pallor with scleral subicterus，fever，rash， neurological manifestations-headache， convulsions， obnubilation， coma) and laboratory data (presence of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia， severe thrombocytopenia， nitrogen retention， proteinuria， determination of ADAMTS13activity can range between <5% and 10%11，12.\n\n【24】TTP by ADAMTS13 deficiency is a severe form of thrombotic microangiopathy with increased mortality that requires prompt， effective and rapid therapeutic intervention 通用删除6(英):<u>[8，9]</u>.\n\n【25】The treatment of choice is plasmapheresis and high-dose corticosteroid therapy (pulse therapy) 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>.

Immunosuppressant's such as cyclophosphamide， cyclosporine， vincristine， mycophenolate mofetil have been used with inconsistent results 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>.

TMA may be a rare form of lupus in the hematopoietic system 通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u>. The difference between a lupus-related hematological disorder and pure TTP is difficult in some situations (especially when it precedes the diagnosis of SLE).\n\n【29】In SLEpatients，TMA is causedbythepresence ofantiphospholipid syndrome or a mechanism of lupus vasculitis， while the mechanism of pure TTP is different. The association of SLE with pure TTP is extremely rare and inconsistently reported in the literature.\n\n【30】The two clinical entities need to be diagnosed and differentiated rapidly because any delay in initiating the treatment of choice(plasmapheresis) can have a major impact on mortality 通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u>. ADAMTS13 determination is required in cases of suspected TTP in a patient previously diagnosed with SLE， but not mandatory. Demonstration of ADAMTS13 deficiency in the presence of classica TTP phenomena confirms the diagnosis， but isSIOT essential. The reasoning behind this is that other microangiopathic hemolytic anemia accompanied by thrombocytopenia may have low ADAMTS13 activity but are not diagnosed as TTP (bacterial endocarditis， malignancies， and systemic inflammatory diseases). The sensitivity and specificity of the ADAMTS13 determination is 95%25.\n\n【31】In a 2015 study of a group of 50 lupus patients who experienced various thrombotic events， low ADAMTS13 activity and increased circulating levels of VW factor monomers (66%±27% vs.101%±8%， P<0.01， and 325%±151%vs. 81%±14%，P<0.001) were recorded. Low ADAMTS13 activity and the presence of a PL were recorded in patients with active disease. The authors concluded that ADAMTS13activity could be a useful predictive biomarker for screening patients with active disease and risk ofthrombosis 通用删除6(英):<u>[26]</u>.\n\n【32】In our patient， lupus renal involvement， WHO class IV nephritis was confirmed by Renal Puncture Biopsy (RPB).\n\n【33】Conclusion\n\n【34】The peculiarity ofthis case is represented by the repeated episodes of thrombotic microangiopathy accompanied by moderate nephritic-type relapses identified during SLE activity.\n\n【35】The therapeutic response to immunosuppressant's after various treatment regimens (cyclophosphamide/corticosteroids according to2 protocols-NIH and EURO-LUPUS， administration of fresh frozen plasma without plasmapheresis) but with frequent TMA relapses，led us to investigate other causes of TMA. Thus，low ADAMTS13 activity corroborated with clinical and laboratory findings， confirmed the diagnosis of TTP.\n\n【36】Another peculiarity of this case was the absence of neurological phenomena during TMA relapses (except for headache)， thus raising the suspicion of TTP being delayed.\n\nAfter a definitive diagnosis was made and the therapeutic regimen was changed (introduction of mycophenolate mofetil) the patient had not experienced any TTP episode (follow-up period 2 years). In the literature there are few reported cases in which patients diagnosed with TTP associated with ADAMTS13 deficiency have benefited from treatment with MMF/steroids/plasmapheresis， with complete remission of TTP and no relapses.

Especially during the COVID-19 pandemic， a dedicated team of anesthesiologists to undertake the work of establishing artificial airways for severely infected people who require mechanical ventilation. This phenomenon is mainly due to the anesthesiologists havingthe most experienceintracheal intubation. It is undeniable that the anesthesiologist is necessary in the emergency airway management team in the hospital. However， many doctors have a misunderstanding and believe that the endotracheal intubation in-hospital onlyneeds to be completed by the anesthesiologist. In this text， we emphasize the task and role of the anesthesiologist in in-hospital airway management.\n\n【12】The point repeatedly mentioned in other departments is that tracheal intubation is a complicated and risky operation， and only doctors with rich experience can properly predict and deal with potentially difficult airways. As one sentence says，professional han dles professional affairs. Especially during the COVID-19 pandemic， the effect of a dedicated tracheal intubation team is significant on infection control. Skilled doctors can complete the intubation in the shortest time， and reasonable induction ofanesthesia can reduce the release of droplets and aerosols during operation. In addition， excellent anesthesia management can ensure that the critically ill patients with fragile lungs of survive from the hypoxic period before the artificial airway is established. The efforts of anesthesiologists have provided patients with safe and reliable in-hospital airway management， but it has also led to the dependence of other departments on anesthesiologists. People often don't realize that tracheal intubation is a technique that must be mastered in the training of residents. The lack of training and practical opportunities for tracheal intubation in many departments has led to young physicians being unskilled in this skill.\n\n【13】Anesthesiologists have practiced countless difficult airway cases in operating rooms for centuries. They have summarized the procedures and strategies for dealing with various special situations. These procedures have direct significance for the practice of endotracheal intubation， and most fatal risks can be avoided. At present， domestic experts， including Professor Wu-Hua Ma， spare no effort to promote and train the latest guidelines for airway management to general practitioners，but these courses are often unable to be used by them in practice. It is difficult to change the status quo of intubation in the hospital only from the education aspect， and their inherent concepts must be changed from the hospital management aspect.\n\n【14】In addition to physicians in other departments， some anesthesiologists also misunderstand their identities. Their role in airway management is not only as a tracheal intubation operator， but also as a manager for the patient’s entire period of airway management. For example， their job includes assessing the patient’s airway and cardiopulmonary function， choosing sedation and tracheal intubation methods， even include determining whether the patient really needs tracheal intubation. This kind of identity change anesthesiologists will have more initiative to avoid unnecessary intubation. Some decision to intubation only comes from specialist considerations. Anesthesiologists can provide more risk-avoidance options including supraglottic ventilation or tracheotomy.\n\n【15】As anesthesiologists’ work move to the operating room， except providing patients with operating techniques， they must also contribute more of their experience and wisdom in physiology and pathology. As an expert in airway management， anesthesiologists play a leading role in the in-hospital emergency airway management team， not just intubation. The team role requires experts from various disciplines to perfect its rationality， including otolaryngologists and emergency删除1换行doctors. Moreover， hospital managers should strengthen the training of basic skills for specialist physicians. Because in a hospital with a shortage of manpower， a dedicated emergency airway team is删除1换行extravagant. This requires specialists to have the ability to deal with the critical moment of the disease， rather than waiting for the help of the same busy anesthesiologist.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

Herein， we report a G6PD deficient patient with PJP treated successfully with 21 days of TMP/SMZ without any signs and symptoms of hemolysis.\n\n【2】Conclusion： It might be safe for the Southeast Asia population with a history of G6PD deficiency to administer TMP/SMZ under expert surveillance.\n\n【3】Keywords： Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency； HIV； Pneumocystis pneumonia； Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole\n\n【4】Abbreviations\n\n【5】ALT： Alanine Amino Transferase； AST： Aspartate Transaminase； BUN： Blood Urea Nitrogen； CXR： Chest X-Ray； Cr： Creatinine； G6PD： Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase； GGO： Ground-Glass Opacities； Hb： Hemoglobin； HRCT： High-Resolution Computed Tomography； IDSA：Infectious Diseases Society of America； OPD： Out-Patient Department； PJP： Pneumocystis Jirovecii Pneumonia； PCP： Pneumocystis Pneumonia TMP/SMZ： Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole； RBC：Red Blood Cell； WBC： White Blood Cell； WHO： World Health Organization\n\n【6】Introduction\n\n【7】Pneumocystis Pneumonia (PCP) is an opportunistic and fatal infection caused by the fungus Pneumocystis jirovecii. As per guideline， Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMZ) is the recommended regimen for managing Pneumocystis Jirovecii Pneumonia (PJP)通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. However，TMP/SMZ is associated with the serious side effect of drug induced hemolytic anemia associated with Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. Although substitute regiment does exist， the success rate of using those alternative regimens is below 80% except for the combination use of TMP and dapsone， which is also a medication contraindicated in patients with G6PD deficiency. Jennifer et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u> therefore suggested avoiding using TMP/SMZ in patient with the deficiency of G6PD. On the other hand， a literature reviews done by Youngster et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u> Suggested that TMP/SMZ is probably safe when given in usual therapeutic dose. Together with the inconclusive recommendations， there was also no real-world experience on the use of TMP/SMZ in G6PD deficiency patients in Taiwan. In this article， we reported a G6PD deficient patient whom recovered from PJP by administration of TMP/SMZ.\n\n【8】Case Presentation\n\n【9】A 31-year-old Han Taiwanese man with a history of G6PD deficiency was admitted due to fever， cough， fatigue， muscle soreness and occasional dyspnoea for 20 days. After admission， Chest X-Ray (CXR) revealed bilateral infiltration. The White Blood Cell (WBC) count was 5200 cells/mL， N-Seg 72.3%， lymph 19.2%， Hemoglobin (Hb) 13.2 g/dL， platelet 231，000/mL， Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) 16 mg/dL， Creatinine (Cr) 0.8 mg/dL， Sodium (Na) 136 mmol/L， Potassium (K)3.6 mmol/L， Aspartate Transaminase (AST) 30 U/L， Alanine Amino Transferase (ALT) 21 U/L删除1换行and total bilirubin 0.7 mg/dL. Blood and sputum acid fast satin， TB culture， pneumococcal and legionella urinary antigen test， Mycoplasma IgM， Chlamydophila IgM， Toxoplasma IgG all showed negative. High-Resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT) was arranged and showed diffuse Ground-Glass Opacities (GGO) and thickening of interlobular septum. PJP was then considered. HIV EIA and HIV western blot both showed positive result. CD4 counts were 50 cells/mm’. HIV RNA (Ribonucleic Acid) load was 45588copies/ml. Oxygen supplement was delivered and TMP/SMZ 240mg/1200 mg intravenously was given every eight hours. At Day-13 of TMP/SMZ treatment， a review of medication was preformed and the issue of G6PD deficiency history was raised. The blood test was done immediately and Hb was 11.6 g/dL， total bilirubin was 0.7 mg/dL， direct bilirubin was 0.3 mg/dL. With no obvious sign and symptoms as well as episode of acute hemolytic， the TMP/ SMZ treatment was continued. At Day-16， under stable condition， the patient was discharged with oral TMP/SMZ240 mg/1200 mg three times a day for five more days and an Out-Patient Department (OPD) appointment was arranged. After 21 days ofPJP treatment completed， aprophylaxis dose of TMP/ SMZ 160 mg/800 mg once daily was given until CD4reach 200 cells/mm. The G6PD enzyme activities were measured by quantitative fluorescence assay and showed a level of 0.6 U/g Hb(reference range： 6.4 U/g Hb to 12.9 U/g Hb) which was classified as severe enzyme activity deficiency by the definition defined by World Health Organization (WHO) 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>.\n\n【10】Discussion\n\n【11】G6PD deficiency is the most commonly inherited Red Blood Cell (RBC) enzymatic defect， affecting around 400 million people worldwide 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. About 7.5% of the world population carries one or two genes for G6PD deficiency. It is an X-linked genetic disorder with 187 known allelic mutations 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. In Taiwan， G6PD deficiency prevalence between male and female were approximately 2.81% and0.7% respectively通用删除6(英):<u>7]</u>.\n\n【12】TMP/SMZ is used in a variety of infectious diseases and is the recommended treatment option in current practice for managing PJP 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>； however， it is associated with hemolysis when administered to G6PD deficient patients. Chisholm-Burns et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u> demonstrated a case with of African ethnicity with G6PD deficiency that experienced hemolysis after administration of double strength of TMP/SMZ orally for eight days. Reinke et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u> also reported a black woman with HIV infection who received only one dose of TMP/SMZ intravenously for managing PJP which then resulted in acute hemolysis. On the contrary literature had reported challenging G6PD subjects with genetic variant alleles. A commonly observed in the African population， with TMP/SMZ at the dose of 320/1600mg every 12 h. The level ofhemoglobin did not decrease significantly nor did any hemolysis occur throughout the trial 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>. The possible explanation was that the regeneration rate of hemoglobin was faster than destruction of hemoglobin in G6PD A-variant population. However， the severity of hemolytic anemia varies among individuals with G6PD deficiency. Specific G6PD alleles are associated with G6PD variants with different enzyme activity and， therefore， result in different levels of disease severity 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>. In Southeast Asia， the most common variant alleles appear to be G6PD Kaiping and Canton， which are different from the western or African ethnicity 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>. To date， there is still insufficient evidence for the population in Taiwan to suggest a robust relationship between our G6PD variant alleles and the degree of disease severity with regards to the safety in the use of TMP/SMZ in G6PD deficiency 通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u>.\n\n【13】Conclusion\n\n【14】The experience and evidence regarding safety in the use of TMP/SMZ in G6PD deficient HIV infected patients is not vet clear. Herein， we documented a case of a G6PD deficient HIV infected man successfully treated the PJP with high dose of TMP/SMZ without any signs and symptoms of hemolysis.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

Previous literatures reported that sporotrichosis usually seen as isolated cutaneous form or at a non-pulmonary site such as osteoarticular， neurological or ocular 通用删除6(英):<u>[1-4]</u>. Systemic presentation typically occurs in individuals with impaired immunity such as in diabetes mellitus， immunosuppressant use， HIV infection， malignancy and connective tissue disease 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. Sporotrichosis is caused by the fungal Sporothrix， in which the pathogenic taxons in human are S. brasiliensis， S. schenckii， S. globose and S. luriei 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. It is usually found in contaminated plants or in the mouth， nasal cavity， nails and feces of infected cats 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. Systemic sporotrichosis is believed to be transmitted either via inhalation of Sporothrix propagules or via hematogenous spread 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. Cutaneous lesion presents as ulcerated papules or nodules while pulmonary sporotrichosis presents with cough， hemoptysis， anorexia and fever. Clinically， cutaneous sporotrichosis can mimic other diseases such as tuberculosis and non-tuberculous Mycobacterium， nocardiasis， chromomycosis， leishmaniasis， pyoderma gangrenosum and cutaneous tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. Skin biopsy is warranted in order to rule out these differentials. Typical histopathological findings are diffuse chronic granulomatous dermatitis with a central abscess 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. Pulmonary involvement can display two different patterns on radiology which are diffuse or bibasal reticulonodular infiltrate pattern， or cavities in the upper lobe 通用删除6(英):<u>[5-7]</u>. Recommended treatment is amphotericin B， given until a favorable response has been achieved. Thereafter， therapy is changed to oral itraconazole 200 mg BD for at least 1 year 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 50-year-old man with underlying non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and ischemic heart disease presented with fever and multiple painful nodules on trunk and upper limbs for 1-month duration. He denied loss of appetite， loss of weight， prolonged cough or history of contact with ill animals or tuberculosis patients. Occasionally， he did some gardening and cleaned feces from stray cats in housing compound. On examination， there were hyperpigmented fluctuant subcutaneous nodules with hemorrhagic crusts on the face， trunk， upper and lower extremities . Otherwise， examination of other organ systems and lymph nodes were unremarkable.\n\n【7】Blood investigations revealed raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate at 111 mm/h and C reactive protein at 5.79 mg/ml. Full blood count， renal profile， liver function test and hemoglobin A1C were within normal range. Autoimmune disease and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) screening were also negative. He was initially treated with intravenous piperacillin-tazobactam for multiple skin abscesses. However， he remained febrile with formation of more skin nodules. Thus， a skin biopsy was performed to rule out differential diagnoses of infectious panniculitis such as subcutaneous fungal infection， tuberculous and non-tuberculous mycobacterium infection. Histopathology revealed acute suppurative granulomatous inflammation with panniculitis. Periodic Acid-Schiff (PAS) and Grocott's Methenamine Silver (GMS) stains exhibited budding yeasts of approximately 8 um in size， suggestive of sporotrichosis . Fungal culture of the skin identified Sporothrix schenckii . Culture of bacteria and mycobacterium， as well as Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) of mycobacterium was negative.\n\n【8】Chest X-ray demonstrated multiple centrilobularlung nodules at right upper lung zone . CT scan of thoracic， abdomen and pelvis showed consolidations over peribronchovascular right upper lobe， irregularity of the apical branch of right upper lobe bronchus and right hilar lymphadenopathy . Otherwise， there was no intra-abdominal collection. Bronchoscopy revealed swollen， irregular and inflamed mucosa over segmental bronchus of right upper lobe. Fungal culture from bronchoalveolar lavage also grew Sporothrix schenckii. Hence， diagnosis of systemic sporotrichosis with cutaneous and pulmonary involvement was made.\n\n【9】He was started on intravenous amphotericin B deoxycholate0.7 mg/kg/day. Unfortunately， he developed acute renal failure and transaminitis， which resolved upon cessation of amphotericin B. Thereafter， he was prescribed with oral itraconazole 200 mg twice daily. He responded well to the treatment with regression of cutaneous nodules after a month of treatment and was planned for one year course of oral itrconazole. Unfortunately， he was lost to follow-up.\n\n【10】Discussion\n\n【11】Sporotrichosis can be classified clinically into five forms， namely skin， mucous membrane， and systemic， immunoreactive and spontaneous regression. Systemic sporotrichosis is further classified intopulmonary， cutaneousdisseminated， osteoarticular， and neurological 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. Systemic sporotrichosis in an immunocompetent individual is rare. It has been reported in literatures， however these cases involved cutaneous disseminated alone， or involved non-pulmonary sites such as osteoarticular， neurological and ocular\n\n【12】通用删除6(英):<u>[1-4]</u>. To our knowledge， this is the first case reported of systemic sporotrichosis with cutaneous and pulmonary involvement in immunocompetent individual. Such systemic presentation more commonly occurs in the setting of immunosuppressive state such as uncontrolled diabetes mellitus， immunosuppressant use， HIV infection， malignancy and connective tissue disease 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>.\n\n【13】Sporotrichosis is caused by thermodimorphic fungi of the genus Sporothrix. Sporothrix comprises of 51 taxons， in which only four taxons are known to be pathogenic in human， namely S. brasiliensis， S. schenckii， S. globose and S. luriei通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. S. schenckii， which is the organism identified in our patient， is the most common causative agent for sporotrichosis in Malaysia 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. It is usually found in contaminated plants or in the mouth， nasal cavity， nails and feces of infected cats通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. Cutaneous sporotrichosis is usually caused by direct inoculation of organism into the skin by trauma. Unfortunately， only 10% to62% of patients were able to recall this information 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. Systemic sporotrichosis is believed to be transmitted either via inhalation of Sporothrix propagules or via hematogenous spread and the latter mode of spread typically occurs in immunosuppressed patients 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. We postulated that our patient may have contracted the infection through a missed trauma during gardening or via inhalation of the fungal propagules during contact with cats’feces.\n\n【14】Cutaneous lesions typically present as papules or nodules which may ulcerate or fistulize draining a purulent discharge. 80%of cutaneous cases present as lymphocutaneous form， in which the lesions were distributed along the lymphatic drainage 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. However， in disseminated cutaneous sporotrichosis， the lesions may be generalized with no specific distribution as seen in our patient. Pulmonary sporotrichosis typically presents with cough， hemoptysis， anorexia and fever 通用删除6(英):<u>[5-7]</u>. Nevertheless， 14.1% may not have any respiratory symptoms as demonstrated in our case 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>.\n\n【15】Cutaneous manifestation of sporotrichosis can mimic other infectious diseases namely tuberculosis and non-tuberculous mycobacterium， nocardiasis， chromomycosis and leishmaniasis. It may also imitate non-infectious diseases such as pyoderma gangrenosum， primary cutaneous tumors and even cutaneous metastases 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. Skin biopsy is warranted to rule out these differential diagnoses. Typical histopathological findings are diffuse chronic granulomatous inflammation with a central abscess. The fungal structures， which are highlighted by PAS and GMS， is seen in 18%to 35.3% of cases 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. Pulmonary involvement can display two different patterns on radiology， depending on the transmission删除1换行route. Hematogenous route leads to predominantly diffuse or bibasal reticulonodular infiltrate pattern. On the contrary， inhalation route frequently results in upper lobe involvement. Chronic inflammatory response is then ensued，leading to breakdown of necrotic lung tissue and upper lobe cavity formation. These groups of patients may be asymptomatic initially until large cavities are formed 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. These findings further supported the hypothesis that our patient might have contracted the fungal agent through inhalation based on the upper lobe radiological findings and relatively free of pulmonary symptoms. Culture and isolation of S. schenckii from biopsy samples remains the gold standard to diagnose sporotrichosis 通用删除6(英):<u>[5-7]</u>. Depending on the species of Sporothrix， it usually takes 4 to 6 days to isolate Sporothrix spp. for samples collected from skin lesions， and 10 days to 19 days from extracutaneous lesions 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>.\n\n【16】Treatment of sporotrichosis depends on the clinical presentation. Inlymphocutaneous or osteoarticular manifestation，oral itraconazole200 mg per day is the preferred treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>[6，8]</u>. However， for systemic sporotrichosis， recommended treatment is amphotericin B， given as a lipid formulation at 3 mg/kg to 5 mg/kg daily or amphotericin B deoxycholate， administered at 0.7 mg/kg to 1.0 mg/kg daily. Treatment is continued until a favorable response has been achieved， after which the therapy is changed to oral itraconazole 200 mg BD for at least 1 year 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>. Other than the commonly reported side effects such as nephrotoxicity，amphotericin B can also cause hepatotoxicity. The incidence of increased transaminases and bilirubin due to amphotericin B had been reported at approximately 20% 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>. We hypothesize that our patient's underlying hepatic disease might have predisposed him to develop raised transaminases upon exposure to amphotericin B.\n\n【17】The response of patients to treatment varies. Uncomplicated skin or mucosal manifestation in immunocompetent patients， usually heal with fibrous scar. However， untreated sporotrichosis can disseminate to other organ systems and may be fatal 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>.\n\n【18】Conclusion\n\n【19】This case report highlights the rare presentation of systemic sporotrichosis with disseminated cutaneous andpulmonary involvement. It emphasizes the importance to have a high index of suspicion of the possibility of subcutaneous fungal infection in a patient who presents with suppurative skin nodules unresponsive to antibiotic therapy despite of their immune status.

It has a wide range of symptoms as well as complications from fatigue to loss of consciousness. Although a lot of factors can cause low sodium levels， combining specific medications can lead severe hyponatremia in a rapid onset which can cause high mortality and morbidity. The objective of this case report was to underline that prescribing specific medications disregarding their side effects can cause this common electrolyte imbalance but in a more severe manner. In this case report， we present a 46-year-old male patient with serum sodium level of 104 mEq/L who consumed hydrochlorothiazide for hypertension and was under treatment with Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) for major depression. Patient had tonic-clonic seizures at the second hour of the treatment and intubation was needed due to loss of consciousness and hypoxia. After proper replacement ofsodium with hypertonic solutions in intensive care unit for nine days， extubation was indicated. Even in healthy young males， hyponatremia due to two separately prescribed medications can lead life threatening hyponatremia. Physicians should be aware of the side effects of diuretics， especially hydrochlorothiazides and SSRIs and their combinations.\n\n【2】Keywords： Diuretics； Hydrochlorotiazide； Hyponatremia，SSRI\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Hyponatremia is defined when sodium levels are decreased less than 135 mEq/L 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>.

Most of the time the severity of hyponatremia is mostly mild or moderate and the patients are generally asymptomatic. Main symptoms include nausea， vomiting， headache， lethargy， fatigue， apathy， disorientation， drowsiness， agitation， muscle cramps and convulsions. Physical examination shows findings of dehydration， decreased level of consciousness， ataxia， decreased deep tendon reflexes， presence of pathological reflexes， pseudobulbar paralysis， increased intracranial pressure syndrome，hypothermia， Cheyne Stokes respiration 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. Severe hyponatremia primarily presents with central nervous system symptoms and findings 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. Renal or cerebral water wasting， loss of sodium via gastrointestinal system or skin， specific medications and many more factors can cause hyponatremia.

Medication for hypertension he used for a week included spironolactone 25 mg per oral (po)， once a day (qd)；hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg po， qd； perindopril indapamide 5 mg/1.25 mg po， qd. He had taken 100 mg captopril right before he applied to the emergency room.\n\n【7】Physical examination findings were confusion， limited cooperation and coordination. Blood pressure was 158/70 mmHg， pulse was 76 beats per minute with normal sinus rhythm，saturation was 99%， and temperature was 36.6°C at the time of admission. No specific findings were noted on the respiratory and gastrointestinal system examination. He had not had nausea， vomiting and diarrhea at the onset of symptoms. Laboratory results were as serum sodium of 104 mEq/L， glucose删除1换行level of 122 mg/dl， potassium level of 3.5 mEq/L， chloride was 67mEq/L， blood urine nitrogen was 19 mg/dl， creatinine was 0.96 mg/dl. Blood gas levels showed that pH： 7.5， HCO3： 25 mEq/L. Blood count was WBC： 15.000， Hb 13 g/dl and PLT 330000/ul. According to clinical examination， patient was assessed as euvolemic. Since his serum osmolality was 221 mosm/kg it was decided that patient had been having euvolemic hyponatremia and internalized to the internal medicine clinic. Sodium gap was calculated， and 3% hypertonic serum infusion had been started. When the hypertonic infusion was at the second hour， patient had a generalized tonic-clonic seizure. The patient had gotten unconscious and became hypoxic due to aspiration. Consequently， he was intubated and transferred to intensive care unit of internal medicine clinic. Phenytoin infusion had been started as the first line intervention. Cranial imagings of the patient showed no pathological findings while thoracic imaging indicated air bronchograms and diffuse consolidations. Patient diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia and treatment of 4，5 gr piperacillin -tazobactam four times a day had been started.\n\n【8】Intubated patient was followed up for nine days. Sodium depletion was replaced carefully during this period with 3% hypertonic sodium chloride solution. When sodium levels reached to 139 mEq/L，patient had become conscious again and ventilation requirement was no longer needed； patient was extubated. After 3 more days of follow up in intensive care unit with sodium replacement therapy with hypertonic sodium infusion and antibiotic regimen for aspiration pneumonia， satisfying results were obtained from laboratory tests indicating pneumonia regression and acceptable serum sodium levels. Patient's sodium levels by day were demonstrated on Figure 1. Patient had gotten clinically better， was no longer in need for intensive care unit admission and discharged to internal medicine clinic.\n\n【9】Investigations for etiology of the hyponatremic case had been started ultimately. Spot urine sodium was <20 mEq/L. Thyroid function was normal as the results were as follows： TSH was1.18uIU/ml， free T3 level was 3.05 pg/ml and free T4 was 0.97 ng/dl. No pathologic results of urine sampling were noted other than ketone bodies which were 2+. Patient’s morning cortisol level was 10.2 mcg/dl and ACTH level was 51 pg/ml. Therefore， intravenous ACTH stimulation test was performed. Adrenal insufficiency was ruled out due to the satisfactory results of cortisol response. Patient's lab results for functions of hypophysial hormones were within normal ranges. As a result of all laboratory testing， patient's evaluation for etiology of the normovolemic hypotonic hyponatremia was ended up with drug related hyponatremia as known as drug induced hyponatremia. Patient's all prescribed medications were stopped，and hypertension management was done with 30 mg nifedipine two times a day per oral. Following blood pressure levels were within normal ranges. Serum sodium levels were noted in normal ranges during the inpatient followed up. No additional seizures were observed. After completion of the antibiotic regimen for aspiration pneumonia which was confirmed with laboratory results and clinical recovery， patient was discharged with satisfying outcomes.\n\n【10】Discussion\n\n【11】Hyponatremia as one of the most common electrolyte imbalances is caused by numerous factors disturbing the balance between water and sodium. The diagnosis and the treatment are essentially based on the etiologic factors. First and the foremost， main etiological factors causing hyponatremia should be assessed properly. In some cases， various factors， especially multiple drug usage， can删除1换行cause hyponatremia at once. Careful history taking and physical examination can make a physician distinguish whether the patient ishypovolemic， normovolemic or hypervolemic. Additionally， history of the patient can reveal that if the condition is acute or chronic， and the patient is symptomatic or asymptomatic 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. In patients diagnosed with hyponatremia， serum osmolality should be calculated， and etiology of the imbalance should be investigated. In our case， patient had become symptomatic in a short period of time which was obtained by a detailed patient history pointing out that the patient's condition was acute. Additionally， patient had severe symptoms which also occurred acutely and had high mortality rates.\n\n【12】The symptoms of hyponatremia mostly depend on the onset and the severity of the imbalance. Mortality is caused by cerebral edema， which is precipitated by acute decrease in serum sodium levels， or by osmotic demyelination syndrome due to the aggressive replacement of sodium in chronic hyponatremia patients. Hence it is crucial to get aproperhistoryofthe patient to determine whether the hyponatremia developed in a short or long period of time. Our patient’s serum sodium levels were very low as he applied for an emergency care with very low sodium levels (104 mEq/L).\n\n【13】The variety of the drugs causing hyponatremia is increasing constantly. Underlying mechanism ofthe drugsleadinghyponatremia mainly can be divided into three categories which are drugs physiologically acting as Antidiuretic Hormone (ADH)， stimulating the secretion of ADH and creating a synergistic effect of ADH on renal response 4.\n\n【14】In a study conducted by Fenoglio et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>， which focused on the most reported drugs causing iatrogenic hyponatremia， they revealed that 75.5% of the patients had syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion.Selectiveserotoninreuptake inhibitors(n=15)，antiepileptics(n=7)， proton pump inhibitors (n=7) or hormones， antipsychotics， antineoplastics were taken by those patients. Additionally， 12.2% of the participants who were diagnosed with hypoosmolar hypovolemic hyponatremia，thiazide diuretics were submitted as the main etiology. Our patient was newly diagnosed with hypertension and was taking his medications which were spironolactone， hydrocholorthiazide， perindopril， indapamide. Moreover， he was taking hydroxyzine and sertraline for his major depression which was prescribed by his physician.\n\n【15】In another study， Movig et al. compared the risk of hyponatremia caused by SSRIs and other antidepressants. Also， they compared combined use of diuretics with SSRI's or with other antidepressant：The results indicated that SSRI's were 4 times more potential to cause hyponatremia than other antidepressants. Additionally， the use of diuretics combined with SSRI's in elderly population had the highest risk ratio among others 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. Although our patient was relatively删除1换行younger than the patients in the study； severe hyponatremia was caused by combined medications he was using for his hypertension and his depression which all were prescribed by physicians.\n\n【16】Time onset of hyponatremia has a wide range from the first day of the consumption up to few months. In one study conducted by Liu BA and his friends， the mean time interval was estimated at 13days 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. The time interval was also short in our study which was about seven days； as the patient developed prominent symptoms after starting his antihypertensive treatment with hydrochlorothiazide.\n\n【17】In hospitalized patients with hyponatremia secondary to SSRI usage，10% ofthose needed intensive care and mortality rates are up to7%通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>. Thus， exclusion ofother etiologic factors causinghyponatremia and early diagnosis and treatment are crucial. As mentioned above， our patient was in severe depletion of sodium which led him had tonic-clonic seizures， become hypoxic and unconsciousness which all are signaling high rate of mortality， separately.\n\n【18】Checking the serum sodium levels both before and after the treatment is recommended in patients who have multiple chronic diseases and under the treatment with multiple medications since they have higher risk for drug related hyponatremia. 通用删除6(英):<u>[9，10]</u>. First treatment approach is discontinuation of the possible drug and providing supportive therapy. In patients under SSRI medication， diuretic prescription should be avoided to minimize the risk of hyponatremia 通用删除6(英):<u>[5，6]</u>.\n\n【19】Conclusion\n\n【20】Physicians should keep this in mind that commonly used drugs such as SSRIs or diuretics are causing severe hyponatremia with acute onset which leads mortality and morbidity. In a patient with acute hyponatremia symptoms careful questioning about medication history should be done. We strongly recommend that combination of SSRI with diuretics， especially with hydrochlorothiazide shouldnt be prescribed to any patient since they have severe complications by decreasing the serum sodium levels rapidly.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

The clinical manifestations include chronic headache， cranial nerves affected and epilepsy， a few patients present with bilateral or unilateral moderate visual loss. We describe the case of a patient who presented with bilateral visual loss without any other positive manifestations； the patient was initially diagnosed with Ischemic Optic Neuropathy (ION)， but further investigation revealed IHCP. This study was approved by the ethics committee of the 6h Medical Centre of Chinese People's Liberation Army General Hospital. Written informed consent forms were obtained from the patient， who gave his consent that findings and images about himself were published in the journal and associated publications.\n\n【7】Case Presentation\n\n【8】A 59-year-old male patient presented with 4-day acute painless bilateral visual loss， with no headache， eye distension， photophobia， lacrimation or diplopia. The patient denied a history of diabetes，hypertension， coronary heart disease or auto-immune disease.Ofnote，ION diagnosis was considered， and medical cared such as intramuscular injection of mouse nerve growth factor prior to hospitalization did not result in visual recovery.\n\n【9】Upon examination， the Best-Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) of the right eye was Hand Movement (HM)， and the left eye demonstrated nothing in Light (NIL).

The results ofother tests including routine blood， urine routine， blood biochemistry， antinuclear antibody， tuberculosis antibody， Mycobacterium tuberculosis y interferon， syphilis serum antibody， tumor screening， TORCH antibody， IgG4 antibody， and thyroid function tests were normal. The results of routine cerebrospinal fluid， biochemistry， cytology， anti-ganglioside anti-antibody， and aquaporin 4 tests were also normal.

HP is divided into two types， Idiopathic Hypertrophic Pachymeningitis (IHP)， for which no identifiable cause has been found， and secondary HP， for which is described inassociation with trauma，infections， tumors， autoimmune/inflaarmrmatory disease and cerebrospinal fluidhypotension syndrome. IHCP， the most common features of which is chronic intermittent headache， can also be expressed as cephalagra， local or whole brain blunt pain， or progressive palsy of cranial nerves 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. One important reason for the ease of cranial nerve damage is the narrowing of the skull gap， in which cranial nerves pass， due to endocranial hypertrophy. The thickened dura might invade the oculomotor nerve， abductor nerve， trochlear nerve， trigeminal nerve and optic nerve 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. Severe injury of the optic nerve alone occurs infrequently but can lead to painless rapid bilateral visual loss.

Our case presented as rapid bilateral visual loss as the initial clinical manifestation， and we have not found similar previous reports.\n\n【14】The diagnosis of IHCP can be made by combining clinical manifestations， imaging examination results， laboratory test results and pathological features. The pathological characteristics are diffuse fibrous hypertrophy of the dura matter and lymphocytes as well as plasma cell infiltration； IHCP can also present with glass-like changes or caseous necrosis. It can also be observed on MRI and defined pathologically on biopsy； the performance of MRI was correlated with the clinical state in 80% of cases 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. Imaging demonstrated the diffuse thickening of the dura； the lesions appeared hypointense or isointense on T1-weighted sequences and hypointense 厂T2-weighted sequences.

Female patient age 40， who suffered from hyperthyroidism and was on Propylthiouracil (PTU) therapy， was treated for secondary infertility and had undergone IVF and Embryonic Transfer (ET). In the 13h week of pregnancy cell free DNA test was performed due to nuchal translucency measurement of 2.9 mm， which showed no abnormalities.

Two of them-vascular steal theory and possible dysfunction of caudal mesoderm - have gained most attention. However，pathogenesis of CRS remains incompletely understood. Possible connection between IVF or PTU therapy and CRS development should be taken into account until proven otherwise.\n\n【4】Keywords： Caudal regression syndrome； Structural malformation； In vitro fertilization； Propylthiouracil\n\n【5】Introduction\n\n【6】Caudal Regression Syndrome (CRS) or Caudal Dysgenesis (CD) is a syndrome characterized by multiple anomalies involving genitourinary system， anorectal anomalies， defects in caudal part of vertebral column and various anomalies of lower extremities. More benign cases of CRS can present in the adulthood with minor abnormalities， such as chronic constipation and congenital anal stenosis 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Incidence of CRS varies between 1：20 000 and 1：100 000 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. Both sexes are equally affected 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. First description of the syndrome was given by Duhamel in to 1961 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. More than half a century later both CRS remains incompletely understood clinical entity.\n\n【7】Case Presentation\n\n【8】Here we present the case of CRS which could be additional contribution in deepening our understanding of this serious set of anomalies. To the best of our knowledge this is the first case of CRS which developed after IVF.\n\nFemale patient age 40， who has previously undergone uterine septum resection， was treated for secondary infertility. She suffered from hyperthyroidism and was taking Propylthiouracil (PTU). According to family history there were no previous fetal malformations. Infertility was treated with in vitro Fertilization (IVF) and Embryonic Transfer (ET) into our patient's uterus. At 134h week of pregnancy， cell free DNA test was performed in order to clarify nuchal translucency measurement of 2.9 mm which was detected. The test result was completely normal. At 18h week of pregnancy sonographic examination revealed multiple fetal anomalies affecting mainly caudal body part. Decrease in fetal movement was detected， with preserved upper extremity movements. Continuity of vertebral bodies was interrupted at lower thoracic/upper lumbar level. Lumbar vertebrae were dysplastic and sacral vertebrae were not observed. There was clear asymmetry of pelvic bones. Lower extremities were immobile and close to Buddha or frog position. Clubfoot was|删除段之间换行|Altogether theseanomalies were consistent with caudalregression syndrome. Finally， parents chose to terminate the pregnancy at 18h week\n\n【10】Discussion/Conclusion\n\n【11】Number of authors have reported cases of CRS without any remarkable family history or parental consanguinity 通用删除6(英):<u>[3，5]</u>. Only maternal diabetes has been proposed as risk factor 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. Some of the well-known consequences of the Assisted Reproductive Technology(ART) are multiple gestations， preterm labor，lower birth weight and chromosomal anomalies. However， it is still debatable if ART causes higher incidence of structural congenital anomalies when compared to general population 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. Our finding could point into direction of potential relationship between IVF and congenital anomalies.\n\n【12】Two main theories regarding pathogenesis have been developed一vascular steal theory 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u> and caudal mesoderm dysfunction. Kozlowski et al. assume possibility CRS could be part of general bone dysplasia 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. It remains debatable if sirenomelia and caudal dysgenesis have two different pathogenic pathways or do they represent different stages of the same disorder. Additional theory suggesting malfunctioning of notochord inductive pathways has been proposed 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. Moreover， case of Junctional Neural Tube Defect(JNTD) has been described in which patient presented with stigmata closely related to those seen in CRS， such as sacral agenesis，hypertonic anal sphincter， bilateral clubfeet， urinary incontinence and atrophy of lower extremities muscles. Consequently，authors suggested impaired secondary neurulation， which is proposed basis for JNTD， could be pathogenic origin of the caudal regression syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>. We believe that further research of secondary neurulation defects could shed new light on pathogenesis of CRS.\n\nFurthermore， Retinoic Acid (RA) signaling appears to play significant role in the CRS pathogenesis. Retinoic acid， vitamin A derivative， is a signaling molecule that regulates gene transcription， cell cycle and proliferation， differentiation and organogenesis through the interaction with the nuclear receptors， Retinoic Acid Receptor|删除段之间换行|(RAR) and Retinoid X Receptor (RAX) in autocrine， cell autonomous manner and also in non-cell autonomous， paracrine manner by diffusing across cell membranes establishing retinoic acid gradients within and across tissues 通用删除6(英):<u>[10，11]</u>. In placental species， lipophilic RA is manufactured from maternal diet-derived retinol (vitamin A) during embryogenesis. After entering the cell， retinol is reversibly oxidized to retinal by alcohol dehydrogenase and Retinol Dehydrogenase(RDH)， particularly RDH10. Retinal is then irreversibly converted to RA， particularly all-trans Retinoic Acid (atRA)， which is catalyzed by Retinaldehyde Dehydrogenase (RALDH) enzymes， especially RALDH2 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>. It has a great impact on both axis formation (anterior and caudal truncations) and neural differentiation. Under normal conditions of embryonic development， embryo is protected against fluctuations of maternal dietary RA concentration. This highlights the importance of CYP26 genes， which when mutated aren't able to degrade dietary RA and as a result abnormal phenotype occurs. Null mutations for CYP26a1 in mouse resulted in missing posterior vertebrae (lumbar， sacral and caudal)， thoracic vertebrae were often deformed， 20% of embryos expressed sirenomelia due to hindlimb fusion， while some exhibited malpositioning of hindlimbs 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>.PTU， as a known hepatotoxic drug， could also interfere with ability of CYP enzymes in the liver to degrade RA and hence expose fetus to higher levels of maternal RA\n\n【14】As far as we know this is the first case of CRS associated with maternal hyperthyroidism and PTU therapy. Question remains whether hyperthyroidism， PTU therapyor iatrogenic hypothyroidism could exert teratogenic effect and lead to CRS development. PTU was shown 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u> to decrease RAR and RXR levels in the mice. If the same mechanism is applicable to humans， then it can be assumed that higher concentrations of unbound retinoic acid in the mother's serum could cross the placenta and cause teratogenic effects in the embryo/fetus.\n\nSo far， no serum marker for CRS has been proven as useful， unless it is complicated with open Neural Tube Defect (NTD) in which case higher AFP serum levels can be measured 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>. Ultrasound is a mainstay of antenatal diagnosis. Alongside ultrasound， MRI has proven useful in diagnosing CRS 通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u>. In the case of CRS associated with NTD， which was described previously 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>， it is of uttermost importance to diagnose the condition as early as possible. In utero myelomeningocele surgery before 26 week of pregnancy was shown to result in better neurologic outcome when compared to standard postnatal procedure 通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>. Same could be true for myelomeningocele associated with CRS. Sonographic evidence of hydrocephalus or specific sonographic signs such as “lemon sign\" and “banana sign”suggest NTD or Chiari malformation is present 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>. CRS without NTD does not usually involve hydrocephalus as was shown in our case|删除段之间换行|Associations of CRS with different kinds of anomalies has been described， such as annular pancreas 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>， diastematomyelia 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>， cleft lip 通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u> and extrahepatic biliary atresia 通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u>. It remains to be elucidated if there is pathogenic common ground for all of these malformations. Hence， we propose every patient diagnosed with CRS should be carefully evaluated in order to define full extent of malformation.\n\n【16】It seems likely that still unknown noxious factor affects caudal region of embryo/fetus. Namely， from our case report and all other cases described so far it is evident that tissues from all three germinative layers are affected. Our case adds additional evidence that删除1换行hypoperfusion theory could be true as fetus was shown to have SUA. Findings in our case disprove previously proposed thesis according to which SUA is abnormality commonly associated with sirenomelia instead of CRS 通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u>.\n\n【17】Nomenclature in the literature regarding CRS is confusing. Different authors describe syndrome using different names. Some authors discard name “caudal regression syndrome\"， as they do not believe something that has normally developed regresses but development itself is dysfunctional. Terms “sacrococcygeal agenesis”and“sacral agenesis” have also emerged as possible for naming the syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>[19，20]</u>. Clear sonographic parameters for diagnosis of CRS would definitely clarify situation.

We present the case of a Swedish-Iranian medical doctor who has become the victim of severe human rights abuses after arrest， being the guest of an Iranian University. We discuss the implications as to medical ethics and possible interventions by the international medical community in a situation where medical doctors and health care professionals become increasingly the target of politically motivated human rights abuses.\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】As physicians， we’re often confronted with serious issues of medical ethics and human rights at different levels especially but not only in the rapidly deteriorating situation in the near east. Medical doctors and other health care personnel can be affected by human rights violations and can become“case examples” and victims of crime in their specific function as health care professionals and academics. International solidarity， as demonstrated by the World Medical Association and NGOs such as \"Scholars at risk” are important in such cases 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>.\n\n【4】Case Presentation and Ethical Im plications\n\n【5】In the following case report we want to discuss the ethical implications in the situation of a physician， Ahmadreza Djalali， who has been imprisoned and sentenced to death in Iran because of allegations of spying for other countries 通用删除6(英):<u>[2，3]</u>. Up to now none of the international protests and activities for his unconditional release has proven to lead to any significant positive development.\n\n【6】Ahmadreza Djalali is a Swedish-Iranian academic and researcher who was convicted to death penalty for allegedly spying in Iran in a legal process seen as seriously flawed by international independent bodies and organizations such as Amnesty International and WMA通用删除6(英):<u>[4，5]</u>. Djalali is an internationally respected and well established academic and is a lecturer at the prestigious Karolinska Institute in Stockholm， and also a visiting professor at Belgium's Free University of Brussels 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，2]</u>. According to information the authors has received from his relatives， he denied to cooperate in delivering sensible information from Europe to Iran. He was arrested while visiting Iran in April2016 for academic reasons as guest at the University of Teheran 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u> and then convicted for allegedly spying for Israel. He had earlier confessed on Iranian State Television for spying on behalf of Israel通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u> in a process remindful of Stalin area show processes. Amnesty International stated however that the confession was taken under duress 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>， and asked later on for his transfer to a hospital because of deterioration of his health situation 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u> described in the next paragraph. Iran confirmed the death penalty against Ahmadreza Djalali in early February 2018通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>.\n\n【7】In the following months he was reportedly exposed to acts that would be in direct violation of accepted standards of international standards such as the Mandela Rules for treatment of prisoners and the UN Convention against Torture 通用删除6(英):<u>[10，11]</u> as discussed below. He was reportedly kept in solitary confinement for several months， without access to a lawyer and authorities reportedly threatened to harm his children living in Europe (report from family member to author SM). Further several restrictions were applied to him， such as against going to outside walks and fresh air or against using the prison library (report from family member to author SM).\n\n【8】In February 2018， United Nations human rights experts urgently called on Iran to lift the death删除1换行sentence against Dr. Djalali， following up on a letter of Nobel Prize winners made public on 21 November， according to “Nature”通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. In particular， as he was earlier this year unexpectedly transferred to an undisclosed location， where he was held in solitary confinement， there was a fear of his immanent execution and many other medical organizations such as Austrian Medical Society and Scholars at Risk asked his immediate release from prison 通用删除6(英):<u>[12，13]</u>. Djalali is according to our information furthermore denied any urgently required specialized medical care as reported earlier this year 通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u>. A doctor who examined him in prison in early 2019 said that Djalali should be seen by doctors specialized in hematology and oncology in a hospital outside of prison. Since his arrest on 26 April 2016， he has reportedly lost more than 20 kg and now weighs about 50kg (report from family member to author SM).\n\n【9】In February 2019 he was scheduled to be transferred to a hospital outside of prison to see a specialist， but， on the day of the transfer， he was told that the transfer was conditional on him being shackled and wearing a prison uniform. He protested against these degrading conditions and the transfer was cancelled 通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u>.\n\n【10】The case presented demonstrates the need for global action and professional solidarity and to establish strategies and mechanisms to support medical doctors that are in increasing danger of being targeted to become hostages or in a most general sense， victims. The case presented documents also that Universities and medical conferences might not be any more a safe and impartial meeting ground for scientific exchange， but can be abused for political reasons， if no immediate action is taken to stop this development.

In this case study we discussed about a 65 years old male patient received prolonged immunosuppression therapy emphasized on risk factors and the mechanisms which induces the reactivation of HBV and helps to understand and quantify the risk ofHBV reactivation and its consequences.\n\n【2】We report an observation of an immunodeficient patient in whom viral B reactivation occurred one year after renal transplantation.\n\n【3】Keywords： Reactivation of viral hepatitis B； Renal transplant patients； Immunosuppression\n\n【4】Introduction\n\n【5】Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) reactivation is defined as the increase in viremia (>1 log10 IU/ml) in a known patient with chronic or HBV-resolved infection. Since Covalently Closed Circular Deoxyribonucleic Acid (cccDNA) is not removed from the hepatocytes， any event affecting the immune status promotes viral reactivation， sometimes severe or even fatal.\n\n【6】Serological profiles combining significant titles of anti-HBs and anti-HBc antibodies have long been considered as serological scars indicating a former HBC viral hepatitis. However， the development of PCR techniques has revealed the persistence of the Hepatitis B genome (HBV)， which is a potential source of viral reactivation.\n\n【7】Case Presentation\n\n【8】Male patient aged 65， followed since 2005 for renal failure in the Nephrology department. In2010； the patient had received a kidney transplant. A pre-transplant assessment revealed a level of anti-HBs Antibody at 50 IU/ml associated with HBc Ab’s defining post-contact immunization against HBV.\n\n【9】One year after the kidney transplant， during which the patient has received immunosuppressive treatment， the evolution was marked by the appearance of hepatic cytolysis (ALAT： 230UI/ml). The markers of acute hepatitis A (anti-HAV IgM)， hepatitis E (anti-HEV IgM) and hepatitis C were negatives. Acute infection or reactivation of Herpesviridae (cytomegalovirus， Epstein-Barr virus， varicella-zoster virus， and Herpes simplex virus) has been eliminated. In contrast， the serology confirmed the diagnosis of active viral hepatitis B (positive HBs antigen and anti-HBc antibodies) with high viral replication confirmed by quantification of viral DNA using real-time PCR COBAS AmpliPrep/COBAS TaqMan HBV (8.45 log IU/ml； 284，000，000 IU/ml). The antigen and anti-hepatitis Delta antibody were negative. The diagnosis of reactivation of the hepatitis B virus in relation to immunosuppression was retained； the patient was put under Entecavir. The evolution was marked by a rapid biological response with un detectable viral DNA.\n\n【10】Discussion\n\n【11】HBV reactivation can be classified into two broad categories based on the initial serologic profile： reactivation of HBV in patients who are positive for Hepatitis B Surface Antigen (HBsAg) in serum with or without the presence of HBV DNA. The reverse seroconversion is defined as the reappearance of viral DNA and HBsAg in an individual's serum， which was initially negative for删除1换行both before immunosuppression.\n\n【12】The HBV reactivation maybe variable depending on the status of the host， the underlying disease， and the type of immunosuppressive therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. This can occur either early in the first two weeks after the beginning of chemotherapy or more than one year after the end of immunosuppressive therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. Understanding the risk factors and the mechanisms that may induce the reactivation of HBV helps certainly to understand and quantify the risk of HBV reactivation and its consequences通用删除6(英):<u> 3]</u>.\n\n【13】The grafted patient has multiple risk factors favoring the development of active hepatitis B： transfusion contamination， transmission by a chronic carrier donor of HBV， or reactivation of a latent B virus in an asymptomatic carrier or in a patient who is nevertheless immunized as in our observation通用删除6(英):<u> 4]</u>.\n\n【14】It is， therefore， necessary to evaluate the infectious risk due to ciclosporin and corticosteroids that these patients receive after the transplant， which may decrease the immune reaction of the body. As in our observation， it is only at the time of the immune rebound at the end of the intense and prolonged immunosuppressive treatment， that hepatitis has manifest itself， sometimes dramatically considering a large number of infected hepatocytes 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>.\n\n【15】This immune revival can sometimes lead to the elimination of the virus， but in other cases， such as in our case， the selection pressure may favor the appearance of a mutated B virus in the pre-C region通用删除6(英):<u>[1，5]</u>.\n\n【16】These reactivations are potentially serious： risk of fulminant hepatitis， cirrhosis or even death， increased risk of veno-occlusive disease or graft vs. host disease， but the evolution is most often favorable with even cases of spontaneous elimination of the virus despite the immunosuppression context通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>.\n\n【17】The management of HBV reactivation is centered on the likelihood of the risk of reactivation based on the risk factor profile of an individual patient 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. All patients who are either at high or moderate risk of HBV reactivation should be considered candidates for prophylactic anti-HBV therapy. Usually， we recommend starting anti-HBV therapy before starting immune-suppressive therapy and a baseline complete metabolic profile， complete blood count， prothrombin time， and serum HBV-DNA levels are recommended通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>. It is important to evaluate if the patient has chronic hepatitis B and should be a candidate for the treatment of CHB based on serum ALT level， AST level， albumin level， platelet count， and other laboratory parameters and physical examination 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>. In endemic areas， if a patient presents with increased ALT level in the setting of immunosuppressive therapies， it is prudent to consider checking for serum HBV DNA. We also recommend routine monitoring with the earlier-described tests every three months while on anti-HBV删除1换行therapy. Consideration of referral to either hepatology or infectious disease specialist before cancer chemotherapy in those at risk of hepatitis B reactivation is recommended 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>.\n\n【18】Conclusion\n\n【19】Prevention after transplantation in a patient with positive anti-HBs and anti-HBc antibodies requires regular monitoring of the anti-HBs Ab title. In case of a significant decrease of this one， several approaches can be discussed： active immunization by vaccination 通用删除6(英):<u>[2-10]</u>， passive immunization by regular injection of specific anti-HBs immunoglobulins， or daily oral administration of antivirals capable of inhibiting the replication viral 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

Signs and symptoms of hyperandrogenism and virilization subsided almost entirely， with decreased total testosterone and DHEA-Slevels. The diagnosis is upon clinical suspicion with signs of hyperandrogenism and virilization， elevated serum androgen levels， and imaging evidence of adrenal tissue injury. However， all these are not enough for an accurate diagnosis， being the pathology report of foremost importance for the definitive diagnosis.\n\n【2】Keywords： Adrenal tumor， Adrenalectomy， Hirsutism， Hyperandrogenism， Virilization\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Pure Androgen-Secreting Adrenal Tumors (PASATs) are sporadic and are often confused in clinical practice with adrenocortical carcinomas. Eighty percent occur in females and present with hirsutism， menstrual disorders， and virilization 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. The following is a clinical case of PASAT in a47-year-old woman，and a bibliographic search was carried out to update the evidence.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 47-year-old female patient with no relevant background presents with a history of 5 years of hirsutism and amenorrhea， intensified in the previous year， adding alopecia， increased muscle mass， and voice deepening . The physical examination reports an average weight， normal blood pressure， moderate hirsutism (18 on the Ferriman-Gallwey scoring system)， and clitoromegaly without elements of Cushing's syndrome nor acanthosis Nigricans syndrome.\n\n【7】Laboratory tests highlight the value of Total Testosterone of 937 ng/dl (reference value 8.4 to48.1)； serum Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) 331 pg/dl (reference value 56.2 to 282.9)； normal serum Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH)， Luteinizing Hormone (LH)， and Prolactin(PRL)； finally， a serum cortisol level of 1.6 ug/dl was obtained after a dexamethasone suppression test.\n\n【8】Imaging\n\n【9】An abdominal Computed Tomography (CT) shows a solid nodular right adrenal mass with hypodense areas inside， 40x34x32 mm， washout of 16.3%， deemed uncharacterizable.

A Positron Emission Tomography (PET-CT) with 18F-FDG (fluorine-18 fluorode oxyglucose) shows low and diffuse metabolism in the right lesion and confirms the left adenoma .\n\n【10】Pathology\n\n【11】Given the described findings， right-side adrenalectomy by the laparoscopic approach was decided and performed without complications.

The total testosterone and DHEAS levels dropped to a normal range for age and sex regarding laboratory findings.\n\n【16】Discussion\n\n【17】Epidemiology\n\n【18】Virilizing adrenocortical tumors are rare in adults. About 50%appear before puberty， 39% correspond to adenomas， and 80%are seen in women. They have a high chance of malignancy (70%) if virilization appears in adult women， with rapidly progressive symptoms and Cushing syndrome. This association was ruled out in our patient 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>.\n\n【19】According to Moreno et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>， PASATs make up for 2.4% of all adrenalectomies and cause 49% of women’s virilizing syndromes. In their review of 34 patients with PASAT， Gabrilove et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u> report a slight predominance ofthe right adrenal compared to the left 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>.\n\n【20】PASATs secrete DHEA and DHEA-S rather than testosterone. On the other hand， the predominance of testosterone tends the diagnosis towards an ovarian pathology 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. It should be noted that there are no alterations found in the patient's ovaries. Exceptionally， there are adrenal tumors that secrete only testosterone in the absence of other androgens 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>.\n\n【21】Clinical findings\n\n【22】The androgen excess in women clinically shows with hirsutism and progress to virilization with clitoromegaly， voice deepening， alopecia， increase of muscle mass， changes in body fat distribution， and decrease in breast volume， among others. However， other entities present similar clinical manifestations， such as Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)， ovarian tumors， and congenital adrenal hyperplasia 通用删除6(英):<u>[5，6]</u>. The literature has described cases of malignant PASAT patients without hirsutism. These cases could be explained by abrupt tumoral appearance， without leaving time for androgens to act on hair receptors and manifest this sign 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>.\n\n【23】Diagnosis\n\n【24】A biochemical confirmation， using DHEAS and increased total testosterone (12-fold above the upper limit of normal range orients to malignancy) 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u> will confirm the clinical suspicion. Some authors suggest that dynamic tests should be performed， such as dexamethasone androgen suppression test for establishing a differential diagnosis between an adrenal tumor and other causes of hyperandrogenism. A decrease in post-dose androgens of at least 40%allows the identification of non-tumor pathology with a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 88%， given that adrenal tumors secrete androgens autonomously without ACTH regulation 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>.\n\n【25】Diagnosing PASATs in males represents a challenge for the clinician since they are only evident when the peripheral androgen-to-estrogen conversion is present通用删除6(英):<u> 8]</u>.\n\n【26】Imaging diagnostic tools include abdominal CT as the initial approach，followed by MRI or 18F-FDG PET-CT. This last technique reveals its usefulness in evaluating intratumoral metabolic rate通用删除6(英):<u>[9，10]</u>. In our case， due to the CT characteristics and the equipment's availability， an 18F-FDG PET-CT was requested， and it revealed low删除1换行intratumoral metabolism.\n\n【27】PASATs are almost always large-sized， which is not surprising since the adrenal glands secrete few androgens compared to virilizing ovarian tumors， which are often small and may even be hidden通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>. The maximum diameter of the adrenal mass typically predicts malignancy； however， in PASATs， the size does not always correlate with malignancy probability. A series of 9 cases presented by Tong et al. described two adenomas exceeding 9 cm 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Unlike adrenal carcinomas， which generally have a larger size， the literature usually reports that most adrenal adenomas are less than 4 cm to 6 cm in diameter， confusing the diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>.\n\n【28】In addition to the size， the classic imaging features that guide us to tumor benignity， such as the lipid-rich nature (Hounsfield units <10) or a contrast wash-out >60% of the 10-min protocol， also generate confusion， since the PASATs do not always comply with them 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>.\n\n【29】Treatment\n\n【30】The surgical approach is recommended in all functioning adrenal tumors. Some authors recommend the open approach in tumors larger than 10 cm with or without suspected malignancy.Otherwise， the laparoscopic approach may be considered. Complete surgical removal is the key to a good prognosis 通用删除6(英):<u>[3，14]</u>. Finally， the definitive diagnosis will be established through the pathologic report of the surgical specimen， using the Weiss criteria  通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>.\n\n【31】Regarding the follow-up， Moreno et al. did not show an increase in androgen levels or post-surgical tumor relapse in their series of11 benign PASAT patients， who were followed for an average of 17years通用删除6(英):<u> 3]</u>.\n\n【32】In summary， our case presents a 47-year-old female， without previousillness，who had a progressiveclinicalcourse OI hyperandrogenism and virilization and was diagnosed as a PASAT with no evidence of malignancy in the right adrenal gland， and an adenoma in the left adrenal gland. She had an excellent post-surgical evolution and no clinical， biochemical，or structural recurrence than the different case series findings. Provided a contralateral adenoma， a clinical follow-up is proposed， requesting a new image in case of recurrence of symptoms.\n\n【33】Conclusion\n\n【34】PASATs are rare tumors that predominate in the female sex. The diagnosis is achieved by clinical suspicion with signs of hyperandrogenism andvirilization， elevatedserum androgen levels， and imaging evidence of adrenal tissue lesion. Nevertheless， these elements are not enough to make an accurate diagnosis，being the pathological report of foremost importance for the definitive diagnosis. The 18F-FDG PET-CT is a new diagnostic tool to take into account to assess tumor characteristics. Surgical treatment is the gold standard， and the approach will depend on the size and tumor characteristics. The pathological report will determine the medium and long-term prognosis.\n\n【35】Recommendations\n\n【36】PASATs must be considered when a differential diagnosis for female patients with hyperandrogenism and virilization is made It should be emphasized that a significant increase in serum total testosterone is not always associated with ovarian pathology. After surgical treatment and in search of new manifestations of hyperandrogenism， it is suggested to carry out clinical and laboratory follow-up every six months in the first year， and further on， a clinical follow-up.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

There are two types of reactive Perforan Collagenosis (RPC)， Acquired RPC (ARPC) and Inherited RPC (IRPC). IRPC is more common in infants and children； while ARPC usually develops in adulthood in association with variety of systemic disorders， such as Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM)， Chronic Kidney Disease(CKD)， hypertension， even malignant neoplasms 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. Here， we reported a rare case of 57-year-old man who presented ARPC associated with three different systemic diseases including diabetes mellitus， chronic kidney disease and congestive heart failure.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 57-year-old male patient applied to emergency unit with shortness of breath， edema and generalized pruritus. He had a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus for 10 years， congestive heart failure and hypertension. His blood glucose was regulated with insulin at home. At the time of hospital admission her blood glucose was： 160 mg/dL， creatinine： 7.68 mg/dL， CRP： 73.69 mg/L， albumin： 2.84 mg/dL. His calcium and phosphorus results were detected 7.2 mg/dL and 6.6 mg/dL respectively. His ProBNP was>35000 pg/mL. The patient was admitted to nephrology clinic with pre-diagnoses of chronic kidney disease and diabetic nephropathy. The patient’s proteinuria was2.5 g/day and bilateral diabetic retinopathy was detected in fundus examination. The patient had multiple moderately itchy lesions for six years. Dermatologic examination showed disseminated red or brown umbilicated papules， plaques or nodules between 2 mm to 3 cm diameters on extremities and trunk. There were hemorrhagic and necrotic crusts or keratin plug on the centre of these lesions . A punch biopsy was performed by dermatologist from one of the lesions. Histopathologically； neutrophils， basophilic material consisting of keratin material and necrotic debris， and epidermal ulceration were seen. Masson trichromestaining showed transepidermal elimination of collagen fibers .

Diabetic microangiopathy may contribute to collagen damage and to the microdeposition of substances that are not removed by dialysis， causing local inflammatory reactions 通用删除6(英):<u>[9-11]</u>.\n\n【11】Extremities were the most commonly involved site， followed by the back. The lesions were distributed mostly on trauma-prone areas， with some unusual sites like the scalp and the nape of the neck 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>.

We excluded patients who were found to have perforated appendicitis intra operatively， as well as those who had other intra-abdominal infections that may have required treatment.\n\n【3】Patients were divided into two groups： those who received 24 h or less of antibiotics (intravenous and oral)， and those who received more than this. Outcomes were then compared between the two groups. The primary outcome was rate of intra-abdominal collection， while secondary outcomes were rates of surgical site infection， re-admission to hospital for infectious issues and antibiotic complications.\n\n【4】Results and Conclusion： We found no statistically significant difference in the rate of intra-abdominal collection， or of any of the secondary outcomes between the two groups. Our data suggests that patients who have undergone appendicectomy for uncomplicated antibiotics should not receive a prolonged course of antibiotics as a routine unless other indications are present.\n\n【5】Introduction\n\n【6】Acute appendicitis is one of the most common diseases faced by general surgeons today， with an estimated annual incidence of 10 per 100，000 populations . The gold standard treatment of appendicitis has traditionally been surgery， although recent studies have called this into question通用删除6(英):<u>[1，2]</u>. The laparoscopic approach has become widely accepted in many parts of the world 通用删除6(英):<u>[3，4]</u>， which has led to significant changes in the rate and complications encountered after surgery.\n\n【7】通用间距删除-1:<u>Citation：</u>\n\nIt is well known that laparoscopic surgery results in alower wound infection rate than open， at the expense of an increased risk ofintra-abdominal collections. The WSES Jerusalem guidelines 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u> advise against prolonging the duration of postoperative antibiotics beyond three to five days even in cases of complicated appendicitis once adequate source control is achieved. Given that most (75%to 87%) patients have non-perforated appendicitis， we hypothesized that most patients who have undergone surgery do not need a prolonged course of antibiotics|删除段之间换行|Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) is a busy urban hospital in Singapore with one of the highest numbers of emergency admissions daily. We perform over 450 appendicectomies for adults yearly， and there has been a switch from the open to the laparoscopic approach over the past 15 years. The absence of an acute care team means this surgical load is evenly distributed throughout the department，and hence some differences in clinical practice (such as antibiotic choice and duration) were present. We therefore set out to compare the outcomes of patients receiving a shorter couSe(24 h or less) of antibiotics against those who received a longer course.\n\n【9】Methodology\n\n【10】This is a retrospective study using available medical records for patients undergoing appendicectomy (both laparoscopic and open) for non-perforated appendicitis. This study was reviewed and approved by our institution’s ethics board (the Domain Specific Review Board).\n\n|  | ≤24 h antibiotics (n=673)  | >24 h antibiotics (n=267)  | p-value  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Median Age in years (IQR)  | 33通用删除7(英):<u>(26-47)</u>  | 37(28-51.5)  | 0.004  |\n| Gender  |  |  |  |\n| Female  | 327  | 122  | 0.423  |\n| Male  | 346  | 145  | 0.423  |\n| ASA classification  |  |  |  |\n| 1 or 2  | 632  | 247  | 0.432  |\n| 3 or 4  | 41  | 20  | 0.432  |\n| Histology  |  |  |  |\n| With perforation  | 24  | 18  | 0.034  |\n| Without perforation  | 649  | 249  | 0.034  |\n\n【12】Wesearched our electronic medicalrecordsfor allpatientswhohad undergone appendicectomybetween January 15，2014 and December315，2018. These records were reviewed，and patients who were found to have perforated appendicitis or abscess formation intraoperatively were excluded. Out of a total of 2，247 appendicectomies performed，1，228 patients' records were screened and a further 288 patients who had defaulted their follow-up appointments were excluded as data on outcomes was not available.\n\n【13】Variables and Outcomes\n\n【14】The remaining patients were then divided into two groups， one which received 24 h or less of antibiotics (n=673 patients) and those who received a longer course (n=267 patients). This cut off was based on the WSES Jerusalem guidelines 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. For the purposes of this study， both intravenous and oral antibiotics were considered to be equivalent.\n\n【15】The primary outcome was the rate of development of intra-abdominal abscess， while secondary outcomes were superficial删除1换行surgical site infections， side effects from antibiotic usage and hospital re-admission rates for any related issues. Rates of intra-abdominal abscess， readmission rate and antibiotic complication rates were compared between the two groups using Fisher’s Exact Test while superficial surgical site infection rate was compared using the Chi-Squared Test. All statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS Statistics v26.\n\n【16】Results\n\n【17】A total of 940 patients were analyzed， and they were divided into2 groups those who received 24 h or less of antibiotics while the other group received a longer course than 24 h. The demographics of the patient cohort are shown in Table 1. As expected， the majority of the patients were young with a median age of 33 and 37 years in both groups. While a difference in age was observed between the groups， we feel this is unlikely to have any clinical significance particularlyon patient outcomes.\n\n【18】While patients found to have perforation intra operatively were excluded from our study， a small number of patients were thought to have non perforated appendicitis whose histology returned as perforation. As Table 1 shows， a higher proportion of patients in the>24 hantibiotic group were foundtohave perforation comparedto the<24 h group (7.2% vs. 3.7%). These patients were therefore excluded from the subsequent statistical analysis to avoid contamination of the results.\n\n【19】On comparing the outcomes， we found the rate of intra-abdominal abscess formation was higher in the longer antibiotic group， despite it not reaching statistical significance in our study. On univariate analysis， patients who received >24 h of antibiotics were found to be more likely to be readmitted (p=0.036) although this difference disappeared on multivariate analysis. There was no difference between the two groups in the other secondary outcomes studied .\n\n| Outcomes  | Patients who had received 24 hours or less ofpostoperative antibiotic therapy (n=673)  |  | Patients who received more than 24 hours ofpostoperative antibiotics (n=267)  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Intra-abdominal abscesS  | 6  | 0.89%  | 7  |  | 2.62%  |\n| Readmission for re-infection  | 4  | 0.59%  | 6  |  | 2.25%  |\n| Superficial Surgical Site Infection  | 12  | 1.78%  | 6  |  | 2.25%  |\n| Histology showing perforation  | 24  | 3.56%  | 18  |  | 6.74%  |\n| Side effects of antibiotics  | Total：1  | 0.14%  | Total：2  |  | 0.74%  |\n|  | -Diarrhoea： 1  |  | -Diarrhoea： 1  |  | 0.37%  |\n|  |  |  | -Oral thrush： 1  |  | 0.37%  |\n\n【21】-Oral thrush： 1 0.37%\n\n| Table 3： Primary outcomes.  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | ≤24 h antibiotics(n=673)  | >24 h antibiotics(n=267)  | p-value  | OR (95%CI)  |  |\n| Intra-abdominal Abscess  | 6  | 7  | 0.059  | 2.993(0.996-8.990)  |  |\n| Superficial surgical site infection  | 12  | 6  | 0.64  | 1.266(0.470-3.409)  |  |\n| Hospital re-admission  | 4  | 6  | 0.036  | 3.845(1.076-13.735)  |  |\n| Antibiotics complication  | 1  | 2  | 0.196  | 5.072 (0.458-56.167)  |  |\n\n【23】Our results therefore suggest that in patients without frank intraoperative evidence of perforation or gangrene， a longer course of post-operative antibiotics did not lead to a higher rate of complications and potentially could have contributed to additional morbidity.\n\n【24】Discussion\n\n【25】Our results， while counter intuitive to historical surgical pedagogy， do fit with the findings of several previous groups 通用删除6(英):<u>[6，7]</u>. This finding is significant because the World Health Organization 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u> recently released a report advocating for the restriction of antibiotic use to rein in antibiotic resistance. Given that appendicitis is one of the most common diseases treated by general surgeons， it is crucial to restrict antibiotics to the patients who require it. This would help slow the proliferation of microbial resistance to antibiotics while also avoiding unnecessary complications from antibiotic use.\n\n【26】Like previous authors 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>， we found a number of patients who had surgical notes indicating no perforation (hence included in our study) although their histological reports showed perforation. This could be from recording errors (the surgeon typing the note wrongly recorded or left out perforation) or from specimen handling during transfer to the pathologist. Regardless， clinical decision making on antibiotic duration would have been based on the recorded finding in most cases， and our initial data shows that these patients did not suffer from a higher rate of infective complications (though these patients were later excluded in the final analysis).\n\n【27】Interestingly， the results we had showed a trend towards a higher odds ratio of complications in patients given more than 24 h of antibiotics. None were statistically significant except for the rates of readmission i.e.， patients who were given more antibiotics having a higher rate of readmissions. Some possible reasons for this include these patients being more ill and/or having baseline poorer co-morbidities to begin with， which then predisposed them to a negative outcome (For example， patients on immunosuppression， history of diabetes etc)， and developing complications in spite of being given more antibiotics.\n\n【28】Our study was retrospective and from a single institution， so care should be taken when generalizing to other settings. It is also possible删除1换行that other factors played a role in the managing clinician deciding to give alonger course of antibiotics， and this might not have been picked up. Even so， the lack of a difference in patient outcomes between both groups is reassuring and will hopefully lead to a change in future practice patterns. Given current evidence， it is difficult to envision prospective studies in this setting as it would not be ethical to give patients antibiotics when they have been shown to be unnecessary.\n\n【29】In summary， we advocate stopping antibiotics within 24 h post-surgery for patients who have uncomplicated appendicitis.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

At the age of 25 months of age he hospitalized again with symptoms ofencephalitis and was treated for 15\n\n【17】Discussion\n\n【18】Here we report a case of a three year six month old boy presented with recurrent focal seizure， weakness of one side of body after 18months of normal development. Diagnosis of RE is based on clinical and neuro-radiological criteria based on European consensus criteria proposed on 2005 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. Progressive neuroimaging deterioration indicates the chronic inflammatory nature of the disease.\n\n【19】This disorder is rare and usually affects children with median age of onset 6 years， but our patient presents at early age. Delayed presentation may also reported by Klaa et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. There is no gender preference. RE almost in every patients involved one hemisphere of brain which progressively atrophied in the course of time， typical disease course usually follow the pattern of variable prodromal period which is usually contains minor sign and symptoms of viral fever then the patients enters in to the acute stage which is characterized by progressive deterioration of functions of the affected hemispheres like hemiparesis， hemianopia， cognitive deterioration， aphasia and predominantly intractable unilateral focal motor seizure with or without secondary generalization 通用删除6(英):<u>[6-8]</u>. Epilepsia Partialis Continua (EPC) in the form of focal myoclonic twitching of facial muscles or muscles of distal extremities persisted for more than one hour with seizure free interval less than ten seconds is one of the characteristics features of RE that may present among half of the patients. Some patients may present without any evidence of seizures. Acute stage of the disease usually persists around 8 to 10months thereafter a phase of residual stage came which have a stable neurological deficit but seizure activity remains high but low删除1换行compared to acute stage 通用删除6(英):<u>[8-10]</u>. Several studies has been carried out to search the etiology of RE，Rasmussen and their colleagues in their index paper suggested slow viral infection as a causative factors but still it is neither established nor excluded as a causal association 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>. Antibody mediated pathogenetic hypothesis originated in 1994， antibodies to subunit 3 of the AMPA receptor (Glu R3 antibodies) had been suggested to dominate pathogenesis. Other anti-neuronal antibodies such as Munc-18， and the alpha7-acetylcholine receptor were identified in some patients with RE 通用删除6(英):<u>[12-14]</u>. Function of cytotoxic T cells is now considered in the pathogenesis of RE， where affected hemispheres found to be infiltrated with cytotoxic CD8+T cell， astrocytic degeneration caused by cytotoxic T lymphocyte attack give rise to neuronal cell death and seizure induction 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>. Abnormal Electroencephalography (EEG) as slow background with slow focal and epileptic abnormalities in the lesion hemisphere present in the acute stage later on interictal abnormal discharge may appear on unaffected hemispheres 通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>. Brain MRI is one of the best tools for diagnostic evaluation and to assess the prognosis of the disease， at the early stage unilateral hyper intensity in T2， FLAIR image noticed in the cortical， subcortical region， then unihemispheric atrophy sets on， our case typically follow those changes. Most of the tissue loss happens from the 12 months onset of symptoms. Usually post contrast enhancement less commonly present in RE. Functional imaging like Flurodeoxyglucose-Positron Emission Tomography(FDG-PET) shows diffuse hypometabolism of affected segment通用删除6(英):<u>[17，18]</u>. Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) studies showed decreased N-Acetyl-Aspartate (NAA) levels and increased or normal choline peaks resulting in a decreased NAA/Cho-ratio suggestive of neuronal loss or dysfunction 通用删除6(英):<u>[7，19]</u>.\n\n【20】As the etiology is still clearly not known so the treatment is aimed to symptoms and inflammation， to control seizure and to prevent further deterioration of neurological deficit effective AEDs， immunotherapy and surgery are the main modalities of treatment. Immunosuppressive， immunomodulatory and antiviral treatment approaches have been tried in different studies， among them corticosteroid found to be effective on seizure control and neurological improvement. Forlong term steroid therapy started with bolus methylprednisolone 20 mg/kg to 30 mg/kg， followed by oral prednisolone 1 mg/kg to 2 mg/kg for months then slow tapering. Here in our patients we followed the regimen with significant improvement in seizure remission and also there is improvement observed in motor， speech and cognitive domain. IVIG and IVIG plus steroid other modalities of immunotherapy also found effective by some reports 通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u>. Tacrolimus also found as superior outcome regarding neurological function but not found as effective as seizure control 通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u>. Other immunotherapies targeting to T-cells like cyclophosphamide， natalizumab and alemtuzumab helps to reduce the inflammatory reaction of RE patients 通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u>. Epilepsy surgery may consider in case of refractory epilepsy for seizure control but neurological deficit could not be avoided. Functional hemispherectomy and hemispherotomy are associated with lower complications compared to anatomical hemispherectomies 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>.\n\n【21】As the etiology of the disease is still controversial so specific managementapproach detected at F pathogenic factors， most work is now directed to the activation of infiltration CD8+ T cells and microglia to ensure the alternative of surgical management. Early suspicion at early stage with proper management to halt the inflammatory process will help to prevent neurological deficits.\n\n【22】Conclusion\n\n【23】Rasmussenencephalitis is a rarechroni1cCprogressive unihemispheric inflammatory disease manifested with recurrent focal seizure， hemiparesis and neurocognitive deterioration. Neuroimage， EEG findings， early suspicion with exclusion of possible differential diagnosis may help to diagnose the patients earlier and will add better prognosis.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

This unique climate can form unique physiological and pathological characteristics 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>. However， so far there are no relevant researches on the distribution of TCM syndromes and related risk factors of patients with colorectal polyps in Shenzhen. Therefore， this paper discussed the distribution of TCM syndromes in patients with colorectal polyps in Shenzhen， and analyzed the correlation between related risk factors and TCM syndromes.\n\n【20】Methods Complicating diseases\n\n【21】Case data\n\n【22】This was a case retrospective study design. The patients who underwent electronic colonoscopy in the Department of Traditional Chinese Medicine (People's Hospital of Shenzhen Baoan District) were collected according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria from January 2016 to June 2021. The basic information including registration number， age， sex， admission diagnosis and TCM syndromes were recorded. A total of 296 eligible patients aged 27 to83 (52.62±9.85) were researched in this study， including 174 male patients (58.8%) and 122 female patients (41.2%).\n\n【23】We also collected the complicating diseases， that is， whether there Was hyperglycemia，hypertension， hyperlipidemia and Hyperuricemia (4H). The diagnostic criteria of the diseases were as follows： hyperglycemia (fasting blood glucose >6.1 mmol/L)， hypertension (systolic blood pressure >140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure >90 mmHg)， hyperlipidemia (total cholesterol>5.17mmol/L or triglyceride >1.43 mmol/L).\n\n【24】Statistical analysis\n\n【25】Diagnostic criteria\n\n【26】Diagnostic criteria of TCM： TCM syndrome types refer to “Diagnostic Criteria for Common TCM Syndrome”通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>， and“Internal Medicine of Traditional Chinese Medicine”published by Zhou Zhongying 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>. The syndromes are jointly determined by an attending physician and a senior doctor.\n\n【27】All the data in this study were performed by SPSS 23.0. The measurement data was presented by mean and standard deviation. One-Way ANOVA was used for comparison of age among multiple groups， and LSD method was used for multiple comparisons among groups， the correlation of age with TCM syndromes was analyzed by Pearson Correlation Coefficient. The qualitative data including sex and complicating diseases were presented by proportion， and the overall distribution among groups was analyzed by Chi-square test， and the correlation was evaluated by Spearman Coefficient. P<0.05was considered to be that the difference was statistically significant.\n\n【28】Diagnostic criteria of western medicine： Colon polyps or rectal polyps were diagnosed according to electronic colonoscopy.\n\n【29】Result\n\n【30】Inclusion criteria Basicinformation of patients with various TCM syndromes\n\n【31】These patients had no household registration and lived in Shenzhen for more than 5 years， and conformed to the diagnostic criteria of colorectal polyps. The age was over 18 years old. Allpatients had been examined by electronic colonoscopy.\n\n【32】Exclusion criteria\n\n【33】These patients had ahistory ofcolonic polyps in the past but could not provide a detailed examination report or did not find polyps after colonoscopy again. Patients had incomplete case data or familial adenomatous polyposis or colon cancer confirmed by pathological diagnosis.\n\n【34】A total of 296 eligible patients with colorectal polyps were collected in this study. Eighty patients were deficiency-syndrome，and the highest proportion of patients (33%) was deficiency of spleen and stomach energy， followed by deficiency-cold of spleen and stomach(cold-syndrome due to deficiency of spleen and stomach-yang) and deficiency of yin fluid， each accounting for 24% . There were 179 patients with sthenia-syndrome， among which the highest proportion was the stagnation of phlegm-wetness (55%)， followed by stagnation of vital energy and damp-heat or phlegm-heat， which were15% and 12% respectively . Among them， damp-heat/phlegm-heat was mainly wetness-heat in large intestine or phlegm-删除1换行heat stagnation in lung. There were 37 patients with Asthenia-Syndrome Accompanied with Sthenia-Syndrome (ASASS)， of which the highest proportion was deficiency of vital energy and blood stasis， accounting for 35%， followed by deficiency of spleen energy and phlegm dampness/dyspepsia syndrome， accounting for 32% .\n\n【35】Appearance of intestinal polyps of all patients under electronic colonoscope\n\n【36】As shown in Figure 2， appearance of intestinal polyps of all patients under electronic colonoscope was different. The polyps in the patients with asthenia-syndrome were light， pale and tender， especially in these with deficiency of spleen and stomach energy， deficiency-cold of spleen and stomach， and deficiency of both vital energy and blood. While the intestinal mucosa was thin and the blood vessels were obviously exposed . On the contrary， significant hyperemia and edema was be found in the colon mucosa of the patients with sthenia-syndrome ， especially in the patients with wetness-heat or phlegm-heat stagnation， and heat-evil of liver and stomach. The blood vessels in the mucosa were purple and visible in the patients with blood stasis. As for the patients with ASASS， the mucosa was obviously marked with edema， while the polyp in the colon with phlegm-wetness with deficiency of yin fluid was red and swollen， and the blood vessels were clearly visible (Figure\n\n【37】删除10:<u>2C).</u>\n\n【38】Comparison of age and sex distribution of all patients\n\n【39】The results revealed that there were more men {47 cases) than women (33 cases) in the deficiency-syndrome group ， but there is no statistical difference in the overall distribution of gender among various deficiency syndromes， and there is no statistical difference in the average age between each group. As shown in Table2， there were 102 male patients in the sthenia-syndrome group， which was higher than 77 female patients， but there is no significant difference in the overall distribution among the groups.

Most patients have no clinical manifestations， only found during physical examination or treatment of other diseases. Although most of colorectal polyps are benign lesions， some polyps also have canceration tendency 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>. Therefore， early resection and identification of colorectal polyps are of great significance.\n\n【49】Although there is no name for colorectal polyps in Chinese medicine， as early as in ancient China， there are records and descriptions about the etiology and pathogenesis of polyps. For example， primitive theories documented by “The Yellow Emperor’s Canon of Internal Medicine (722-221 B.C) (Huangdi neijinig)\"point out that the occurrence of polyps was related to invasion of exogenous evils. Stagnation of cold-wetness evil (a pathogenic factor blended by evils of cold and wetness) results in obstruction in the channels and stasis of vital energy and blood， leading to occurrence of polyps.(Huangdi neijinig) said， \"Healthy energy (referring to the resistance of the human body against diseases) existed inside， but evils could not be done\"， suggesting that deficiency of healthy energy is also an important factor in the occurrence of colorectal polyps in addition to exogenous evils.\n\n【50】Guangdong in China belongs to the Ling nan region. Some statistics studies on TCM syndromes of patients with colorectal polyps in Guangdong have performed， and found that deficiency of spleen-energy and evil wetness accounted for the highest proportion， followed by asthenia of the spleen and stomach and wetness-heat and blood stasis 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>. These researchers considered that deficiency of spleen-energy is the root of trouble and phlegm-evil and blood stasis are the causes of the disease. Our study found that the proportion of patients with asthenia of the spleen and stomach was the highest in all colorectal polyps'patients with asthenia-syndrome in Shenzhen， which is consistent with other research results 通用删除6(英):<u>[13，14]</u>. Our observation revealed that the proportion of patients with phlegm-evil was the highest， up to 55%， followed by stagnation of vital energy and phlegm-wetness or wetness-heat evil. Shenzhen is a southern city in Guangdong Province， and located in Ling'nan region which has a unique climate with heavy humidity and heat. These results have suggested that， tangible sthenia-evils including phlegm-wetness and blood stasis can be produced in the human body living in Shenzhen.\n\n【51】Table 4： Distribution and comparison results of \"4H\" diseases in patients with deficiency syndrome groups.\n\n| Groups (80 cases)  | Hyperglycemia (N/Y)  | Hypertension (N/Y)  | Hyperlipidemia (N/Y)  | Hyperuricemia (N/Y)  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Deficiency of spleen and stomach energy (27 cases)  | 22/5  | 20/7  | 14/13  | 17/10  |\n| Deficiency-cald of spleen and stomach (19 cases)  | 19/0  | 17/2  | 11/8  | 17/2  |\n| Deficiency of both vital energy and blaod (15 cases)  | 13/2  | 13/2  | 8/7  | 10/5  |\n| Deficiency of yin fluid (19 cases)  | 15/4  | 15/4  | 11/8  | 9/10  |\n| Pvalue  | 0.221  | 0.55  | 0.969  | 0.052  |\n\n【53】Note： “4H\" represented Hyperglycemia， Hypertension， Hyperlipidemia， and Hyperuricemia. \"N\" represented no \"4H\"， and \"Y\"mean existence of \"4H\" (The same below)\n\n| Groups (179 cases)  | Hyperglycemia (N/Y)  | Hypertension (N/Y)  | Hyperlipidemia (N/Y)  | Hyperuricemia (N/Y)  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Wetness-heat or phlegm-heat stagnation (22 cases)  | 18/4  | 17/5  | 22-Oct  | 17/5  |\n| Retention of cold-wetness (8 cases)  | 8/0  | 7/1  | 6/2  | 7/1  |\n| Stagnation of phlegm-wetness (99 cases)  | 88/11  | 76/23  | 43/56  | 66/33  |\n| Depression of vital energy (27 cases)  | 26/1  | 25/2  | 14/13  | 21/6  |\n| Blood stasis (17 cases)  | 14/3  | 15/2  | 7/10  | 8/9  |\n| Heat-evil of liver and stomach (6 cases)  | 5/1  | 6/0  | 2/4  | 4/2  |\n| Pvalue  | 0.478  | 0.305  | 0.565  | 0.22  |\n\n【55】Table 6： Distribution and comparison results of \"4H\" diseases in patients with ASASS groups.\n\n| Deficiency of vital energy and blood stasis (13 cases)  | Hyperglycemia (N/Y)  | Hypertension (NY)  | Hyperlipidemia (N/Y)  | Hyperuricemia (N/Y)  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Deficiency of vital energy and blaad stasis (13 cases)  | 12/1  | 11/2  | 7/6  | 8/5  |\n| Sthenia of liver yang (7cases)  | 6/0  | 1/6  | 2/5  | 4/2  |\n| Spleen deficiency with phlegm-wetness/ dyspepsia (12 cases)  | 9/3  | 9/3  | 4/8  | 10/2  |\n| Phlegm-wetness with deficiency of yin fluid (5 cases)  | 5/0  | 5/0  | 3/2  | 4/1  |\n| Pvalue  | 0.252  | 0.003  | 0.52  | 0.648  |\n\n【57】These tangible evils can block the functional activities of vital energy for a long time， leading to depression of vital energy and further heat-syndrome resulting from disorder of vital energy. In this case， phlegm-heat or wetness-heat evil is formed， further stagnating the functional activities of vital energy in turn. Depressed vital energy， phlegm-evil and blood stasis in conflict with each other within gut and leads to occurrence of polyps. Therefore， deficiency of spleen-energy， phlegm-wetness， blood stasis and depression of vital energy are the important pathological factors of colorectal polyps 通用删除6(英):<u>[15，16]</u>. Our study found that， in the patients with stagnation of wetness-heat， some patients suffered from stagnation of phlegm-heat in the lung， which may be due to the fact that the lung and large intestine share s paired relationship， phlegm-heat evil in the lung can enter the large intestine along the channel system and block the functional activities of vital energy in gut， further affecting the blood circulation. This consequence leads to the stagnation of phlegm， depressed vital energy and blood stasis in the local intestine， resulting in formation of polyps.\n\n【58】It is considered that the occurrence of colorectal polyps is the results of many risk factors. Although these factors are related to histological type of polyps and family history 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>， other risks have been paid more and more attention. Some studies have shown that age is considered as one of the risk factors related to the occurrence of colorectal polyps 通用删除6(英):<u>[18-20]</u>. The older the age， the higher the incidence of colorectalpolyps， especially after 40 years old 通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u>. This is consistent with the observation of our study. We found that the average age of polyp patients is over 50 years old. This may be related to the decrease of intestinal peristalsis， intestinal flora imbalance and weakened immunity with increasing age 通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u>. The age of patients with deficiency of spleen-energy and stagnation of wetness-evil， and deficiency of yin-fluid and phlegm-wetness syndrome (average age was lower than50 years old) was lower than that of other syndromes (average age was higher than 55 years old). This suggests that the patients younger than 50 years old should be paid more attention to invigorating the spleen and eliminating wetness-evil during determination of treatment based on the differentiation of symptoms and signs. While eliminating wetness， we should take care of nourishing yin fluid， and we should not use drugs that are too pungent and dry. The results of删除1换行this study also found that the proportion of male patients was more than that of female patients， which is consistent with the results of big data analysis 通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u>. It may be that men prefer smoking and drinking， and work and life are more stressful than women.\n\n【59】In this study， we found that some patients with colorectal polyps were complicated with Hyperglycemia， Hypertension， Hyperlipemia and Hyperuricemia (4H). Whether these complicating diseases are related to the formation of asthenia- and sthenia-syndrome of colorectal tumor? Although some studies have suggested that there was no direct correlation between the number of colonic polyps and hyperglycemia， hypertension and hyperlipidemia 通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u>， a research by Yunfeng Dong shown that the high risk factors of adenomatous rectal polyps are eating fat and having high triglyceride/cholesterol通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u>. Our research results also shown that， in the colorectal polyp patients with asthenia-syndrome， the asthenia of spleen and stomach， and deficiency of yin fluid in these with hyperuricemia accounted for a large proportion. Although the difference was not statistically significant， drugs for reducing uric acid can be complemented each other while invigorating vital energy and spleen and nourishing yin fluid for such patients in clinic.\n\n【60】In view of the recurrence of colorectal polyps， based on the theory of insidious toxin (a pathogenic factors) in Traditional Chinese Medicine， some studies suggest that the primary cause of colorectal polyps is that the insidious toxin deeply invaded the intestinal collaterals. Therefore， the insidious toxin and chronic consumption of essence and blood are the key mechanisms of occurrence and recurrence of colorectal polyps 通用删除6(英):<u>[25]</u>， which indicates that toxic evil is also a pathological factor in the occurrence of intestinal polyps. In our study， we found that the patients with wetness-heat or phlegm-heat evil also accounted for a large proportion， while the patients with cold-wetness only accounted for a small proportion， which may be related to the unique climate environment in Shenzhen. Therefore， invigorating spleen， clearing away heat and eliminating wetness has become a strategy to prevent and treat colorectal polyps 通用删除6(英):<u>[26-31]</u>. Consistent with previous studies， it is easy to appear the syndrome of vin fluid deficiency because toxic and heat evil can consume essence and blood. As shown in our study， the syndromes of deficiency of yin fluid including yin-deficiency of liver and kidney， deficiency of删除1换行stomach-yin， deficiency of lung-yin， and deficiency of both vital energy and yin also occupied a large proportion in the asthenia-syndrome. After statistical analysis， we found that there was no significant difference in the “4H” diseases between the patients with sthenia-syndrome， suggesting that there is no significant correlation between sthenia-syndromes and “4H”diseases.\n\n【61】Clinically， the occurrence of diseases is often presented by Asthenia-Syndrome Accompanied with Sthenia-Syndrome (ASASS)； therefore， there are quite a few patients with the ASASS in this study. Among them， deficiency of vital energy and blood stasis was the major ones， followed by deficiency of spleen-energy and phlegm-wetness syndrome. Ultimately， asthenia is still rooted as the occurrence of intestinal polyps， with phlegm-wetness， blood stasis and stagnation of vital energy as the symptomatic manifestation， which is consistent with the treatment thinking of supplementing vital energy and invigorating the spleen， and promoting blood circulation and removing blood stasis to treat colorectal polyps 通用删除6(英):<u>[32]</u>. A large number of studies have suggested that most patients with hypertension presented the syndrome of sthenia of liver-yang， and a significant correlation existed between the sthenia of liver-yang and hypertension 通用删除6(英):<u>[33-35]</u>. Therefore， in this study， we also found that the difference ofhypertension in the syndrome of ASASS was statistically significant. The proportion of patients with hypertension and sthenia of liver-yang was more than other syndromes， so it is necessary to pay attention to the prevention and treatment of hypertension in the therapy of colorectal polyp patients with sthenia ofliver-yang.\n\n【62】Conclusion\n\n【63】Deficiency of vital energy of spleen-stomach and stagnation of phlegm-wetness are the primary syndromes for the patients with colorectal polyps in Shenzhen， and the pathological factors involve phlegm-wetness， blood stasis and stagnation of vital energy. Yin-deficiency is mainly caused by liver， kidney，lung and stomach. There is no obvious correlation between sthenia-syndrome and age， Sex，“4H”. Age should be considered in the treatment of patients under 50years old with ASASS syndrome. The patients with sthenia of liver-yang syndrome often have hypertension， thus， hypertension should also be considered for such patients.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

The search for drugs against COVID-19 is continuing. This new viral infection characterized by dry cough， fever， dyspnea， fatigue， and lymphopenia， which can be complicated by interstitial pneumonia leading to severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome(ARDS) which results from an unmodulated inflammatory response and leads to death 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，2]</u>.\n\n【7】Because specific drugs to treat SARS-CoV-2 have not yet been revealed. Currently several potential drugs are used for COVID-19 patients； however， none of the therapies have been proven to be completely effective. Antiviral therapy for SARS-CoV-2 and immunosuppressive treatment have to continue concomitantly for preserve vital organ functions. Immunomodulating drugs such as hydroxychloroquine， chloroquine， tocilizumab (an anti-interleukin-6 receptor antibody)， are widely used in different stages of the disease since high uncontrolled inflammation is responsible for deaths 通用删除6(英):<u>[3-71</u>.\n\n【8】Colchicine is utilized for the treatment of gout， Behcet’s Disease， and also for prevention of pericarditis and Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF).

Therefore， it is reasonable that colchicine may be tested in the context of COVID-19 to detect its immunomodulatory effects which may prevent Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS).\n\n【9】At the present time， several randomized studies regarding colchicine in COVID-19 patients have been announced. Nevertheless there are opposite opinions claim that colchicine doesn't prevent ARDS moreover may be harmful for patients with COVID-19通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. In this case， we report a patient who has been under colchicine treatment for three years and diagnosed COVID-19pneumonia and recovered without any complications associated with COVID-19 infection.\n\n【10】Case Presentation\n\n【11】A 38 years， Caucasian， old female patient admitted to emergency unit complaining of cough and fever for 2 days. The patient is a nurse and she has been active working in hospital. She had been diagnosed rheumatoid arthritis and been using colchicine 1 mg/day for three years.\n\n【12】On admission， the patient had cough， and her vital signs were as follows： Arterial blood删除表格换行pressure， 100/70 mmHg， heart rate， 73 beats/min； body temperature，37.3°C； respiratory rate， 20 breaths/min and oxygen saturations of99% on room air. Physical examination was unremarkable. Chest CT(Computer Tomography) scan revealed ground-glass opacification at lower lobes oflungs. COVID-19 was confirmed by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). Laboratory findings revealed white blood cell count7.13×10/uL，lymphocyte 1.5×10°u/L，c-reactive protein (C-RP) 0.2mg/dL and procalcitonine<0.05 ng/mL. D-dimerlevel was 388.71 ng/mL， and ferritin was detected 39.29 ng/mL， Fibrinogen was 348 mg/dL， while lactate dehydrogenase level was 135 U/L on admission. The laboratory findings are given in Table 1 during the patients follow-up in the hospital. Hydroxychloroquine 400 mg/day， azithromycin 250mg/day， enoxaparin 4000 units per day were started for COVID-19pneumonia. Colchicine therapy was maintained unchanged. On the4 day of her hospitalization CT scan showed progression， although her vital parameters were stable. Favipiravir treatment 1200 mg per day was started. Hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin ended up in 5 days. Enoxaparin dosage was raised up to 8000 units per day. After completing five days of favipiravir therapy as her clinical and laboratory findings were stable， she was discharged from the hospital.\n\n【13】Table 1： Clinical laboratory results.\n\n| Parameters  | 1t day  | 3dday  | 6th day  | gth day  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| WBC (10/uL)  | 7.13  | 5  | 6.52  | 7.22  |\n| Lymphocyte (10/uL)  | 1.5  | 1.72  | 2.07  | 2.03  |\n| Neutrophil (10/uL)  | 5.12  | 2.97  | 3.84  | 4.4  |\n| Hemoglobine (g/dL)  | 12.5  | 10.6  | 11.1  | 10.9  |\n| Platelets (10/uL)  | 226  | 178  | 225  | 229  |\n| C-RP(mg/dL)  | 0.2  | 0.2  | 2.2  | 0.6  |\n| Procalcitonin (ng/mL)  | <0.05  | <0.05  | <0.05  | <0.05  |\n| D-Dimer (ng/mL)  | 388.71  | 778.9  | 571  | 455  |\n| Ferritin (ng/mL)  | 39.29  | 89.9  | 95  | 97  |\n| Fibrinogen (mg/dL)  | 334  | 336  | 405  | 473  |\n| LDH (U/L)  | 135  | 138  | 224  | 152  |\n| BUN (mg/dL)  | 19.26  | 12.8  | 10.7  | 19  |\n| sCr (mg/dL)  | 0.66  | 0.58  | 0.54  | 0.62  |\n| AST (u/L)  | 21  | 19  | 87  | 37  |\n| ALT(wL)  | 16  | 14  | 89  | 24  |\n| Albumin (g/L)  | 42  | 36  | 37  | 38  |\n| Troponinl (ng/mL)  | 0.001  | 0.003  | 0.001  | 删除8:<u>门 </u> |\n\n【15】Discussion\n\n【16】Colchicine has been approved for gout， Behcet’s Disease and familial Mediterranean fever. Colchicine is a lipid-soluble alkaloid which within 24 h to 72 h of oral administration accumulates in granulocytes and monocytes. Colchicine reaches much higher concentrations within leukocytes than in plasma and persists there for several days after ingestion. In recent years， colchicine has attracted attention in the management of cardiovascular diseases by suppressing their inflammatory component 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. Its mechanism of action is thought to be the potent inhibitor of tubulin polymerization and microtubule generation and，possibly， effects on cellular adhesion molecules， inflammatory chemokines， and the inflammasome. Colchicine may inhibit activation of NLRP3 inflammasome and additionally may inhibit directly the synthesis of TNF-a，IL-1B，and IL-6 通用删除6(英):<u>[5，7]</u>. Colchicine is an antimitotic substance that blocks cell删除1换行division during metaphase 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. Also， COVID-19 enters the cell using the Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme2(ACE2) as a host receptor and causes infection. Especially， in low cytosolic pH the virus increases its entry into the cell by penetrating to ACE2 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>. Although colchicine is known to play an important role in intracellular protein traffic and has poor binding to microtubules at alkaline pH， its effect on the penetration of the virus into the ACE2 receptor is controversial通用删除6(英):<u>[7，9]</u>. All these compounds enhance the inflammatory process and are responsible for alveolar damage， interstitial infiltration， and ARDS. Therefore some authors suggest that colchicine may decrease the tissue damage in COVID-19 pneumonia by these pathways and can be used in patients with increased risk of ARDS 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>.\n\n【17】However， it has been suggested that colchicine may be effective in COVID-19 infection and reduce cytokine storm seen during the COVID-19 infection. Cumhur et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u> disagree with this suggestion and claim that since colchicine does not decrease intracellular pH enough， there will be a high viral load leads to more severe cytokine storms 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. In addition toxic doses of colchicine affect alveolar type II pneumocytes， inhibiting the release of surfactants and causing ARDS and also toxic doses leads to DIC and multiorgan failure 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>. So that the colchicine treatment in COVID-19 pneumonia may increase the risk of ARDS and DIC 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>.\n\n【18】A trial has been done in Israel with patients under treatment of hydroxychloroquine or colchicine and COVID-19 test was performed. There was no significant difference between the groups found positive and negative 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>. Also there are several trials investigating the efficacy of conventional therapeutic doses of colchicine have been registered for the treatment of COVID-19 (NCT04322682，NCT04328480， NCT043267901.\n\n【19】In this case we report a patient under treatment of colchicine because of rheumatoid arthritis for three years and diagnosed COVID-19 pneumonia. In our case， severe complication of pneumonia like ARDS was not observed. We think that this result may be related to early detection of pneumonia and early antiviral therapy. It is interesting in that it has been shown that colchicine does not prevent the development of COVID-19 pneumonia， even if this specific case. Patient was a nurse and she was in the high-risk group for the infection so just by this case we cannot reach a definite conclusion for general population. More data's and results of the ongoing trials are awaited to decide whether colchicine will take place in therapeutic protocols for COVID-19 infection.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

Over 90% are Oral Squamous Cell Carcinomas (OSCC) in both males and females and is associated with invasion and destruction oflocal tissues and maxillofacial 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>.\n\n【6】Oral mucosal disorders with increased risk of cancer transformation are termed Potentially Malignant Disorders (PMDs) of the oral mucosa by the World Health Organization 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. Oral PMDs are categorized into leukoplakia， erythroplakia， actinic cheilosis， and oral submucous fibrosis， palatal keratosis associated with reverse smoking， oral lichen planus， discoid lupus erythematosus， and dyskeratosis congenita and epidermolysis bullosa 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. The etiology of the previously mentioned disorders varies from genetic aberrations predisposing for altered tissue regeneration， inherited diseases， disorders caused by exogenous factors such as tobacco， alcohol， HPV， cannabis use， chronic inflammation and immune-mediated disorders 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>.\n\n【7】Case Presentation\n\n【8】Case 1\n\n【9】Female patient， 90 years old， consul the dermatology department for a painful white lesion in the lateral border of the tongue， which persisted for over 6 months and measured 1.5 cm x0.5 cm in diameter . She had received fluconazole 150 mgs per week for 6 weeks and nystatine mouth wash without any response. Neither has she been a smoker nor a social alcohol drinker.No marihuana use or HPV diagnosed previously. In the ultrasound no adenopathy was observed. The histopathology report said moderate epithelial dysplasia . She refused to have surgery or any other treatment for now.\n\n【10】Case 2\n\nFemale patient of 74 years old， presented for an oral mucosal check up， reporting she was a smoker since 15 years of age of 1.800 cigarettes per year and alcohol drinker of 250 ml of gin three times a week. We observed an asymptomatic，4 mm×4 mm hard elastic lesion in the inferior left|删除段之间换行|The most common form of potentially malignant disease is leukoplakia with a worldwide estimated prevalence of 2.6%. Its overall malignant transformation rate is up to 5% 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. However， the extent and rate of progression of dysplasia in leukoplakia is not uniform and can vary from site to site and within the same lesion， so predicting malignant transformation is problematic 通用删除6(英):<u>[5-7]</u>.\n\n【12】There have been reports on oral mucosa vital stains used to help删除1换行select the specific area of a PMD for a biopsy， such as 1% Methylene Blue， Lugol solution or 1% Toluidine Blue. The latter， is said to have90% sensibility， 69% specificity and less toxicity 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>. Apart from the mentioned stains， there are also adjuvants for cancer detecting based on light and spectrophotometry， which show different absorption and reflection between healthy tissues and those with structural and metabolic disorders. Some other method is the oral cytology， obtaining epithelial cells from the mucosal surface through rubbing with a cytobrush and using light microscopy 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>. Sperandio et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u> published a retrospective study evaluating dysplasia and aneuploidy(the change in the chromosome number) in biopsies of lesions with clinical suspicion of malignancy. They showed that dysplasia and aneuploidy gave a higher predictive value than any other technique for malignancy.\n\n【13】The incidence of head and neck cancer subsets such as cancers of lip， oral cavity， larynx， hypo pharynx， and nasopharynx has declined significantly during the past 20 years in the United States and other developed countries，largely due to declines in the habit of tobacco smoking 通用删除6(英):<u>[11-12]</u>. In contrast to this pattern， the incidence of oropharyngeal and oral tongue cancers has significantly increased during the same period， attributed to increased acquisition of oral Human Papilloma Virus (HR-HPV) types 16 and 18 probably related to an increase of oral sex practice通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>.\n\n【14】The reason of most failures to treatment after oral cancer diagnoses is the late arrival to it. It is usually diagnosed in advance stages (IIIandIV)，larger than 4 cm or with metastasis， with a survival of 20% to 50%.On the other hand， if diagnosed in stage II， or I the survival is between 50% till 80%通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. The most important determinant factor in cancer survival is diagnostic delay 通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u>. Additionally， the morbidity associated with surgery is high； the probability of a second primary tumor is greater than any other type of cancer (3% to 7%annually) which is frequently the cause of death 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>.\n\n【15】Important risk factors in the development of the Potentially Malignant Disease (PMD) or in oral cancer are tobacco， alcohol， HPV， betel quid， age， male gender and sunlight 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. The known carcinogenetic compounds known today in tobacco smoking which can have primary role in oral cancer development are： Butadiene， Naphthylamine， Amino biphenyl， Benzene， Acetaldehyde， Ethylene oxide， Formaldehyde， Toluidine， Vinyl chloride， and metals such as Arsenic， Beryllium， Cadmium， Chromium (VI)， Lead and Nickel compounds 通用删除6(英):<u>[16，17]</u>. People especially in India and Sweden consume smokeless tobacco and areca nut (betel quid) which both contain psychoactive products nicotine in the case of tobacco and arecoline in the case of areca nut 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，18]</u>.\n\n【16】Heavy drinkers and smokers have 38 times the risk of developing oral cancer compared to abstainers 通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u>. This is thought to be due to acetaldehyde， the first metabolite of alcohol， which is classified as a Group 1 carcinogen and is also present in tobacco 通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u>.\n\n【17】Epidemiological evidence from USA populations indicates a strong association between HPV and oropharyngeal cancers 通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u>. Update information from the United States of America show a substantial increase of HPV-positive 16 and 18 in oropharyngeal cancers， rising by 225% in the period between 1984 and 2004 通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u>.\n\n【18】Recreational Cannabis smoking has importantly increased among individuals all around the world raising the hypothesis of a role as a risk factor for oropharyngeal and oral tongue cancer通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u>. Nevertheless， epidemiologic studies that have overlooked the删除1换行association of marijuana use with head and neck oral cancers have been inconsistent 通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u>. Marks in et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>2013 observed that cannabis use was inversely associated with oral tongue cancer， which is similar to what has been reported previously 通用删除6(英):<u>[23-26]</u>. The rationalization to this finding is related to the major bioactive cannabinoid compound found in marijuana smoke， D-Tetra Hydro Cannabinol [D-THC]， which has been shown to have anti carcinogenic potentialities through engagement of specific cell surface receptors CB1， expressed on a variety of cell types and CB2 present predominantly on a variety of immune cells， suppressing the release of inflammatory products with an antitumor effects as a consequence through strengthening of apoptosis， arrest of uncontrolled cell growth， and down regulation of angiogenesis and cellular migration 通用删除6(英):<u>[27，28]</u>. Conclusions to marijuana and cancer should be taken with caution as the pooled analysis of 9 case control studies from USA and Latin America in2014 showed heterogeneity through the measurement of marijuana use， study sample recruitment， demographic and other risk factors for HNSCC 通用删除6(英):<u>[25]</u>.\n\n【19】The immunohistochemistry markers are not usually used as a routine. They are still used for investigation protocol. The only one that is used in certain histopathology laboratories is the protein Ki-67 (also called MKI67). This protein is exclusively observed in those cells， which are in proliferation process in human tumors， in cell cycle G1， S， G2 and M. Its high expression is related to worse outcome according to a recent Meta analysis通用删除6(英):<u> 29]</u>.\n\n【20】Saliva is a valuable body fluid for disease diagnosis， due to its noninvasive nature， and has been increasingly used as a source for discovery of oral cancer biomarkers 通用删除6(英):<u>[30]</u>. The ability to detect molecules in saliva from patients with head and neck cancer and defining abnormal values is a critical step before the clinical implementation 通用删除6(英):<u>[31]</u>. Salivary molecules have already been proposed as potential oral cancer biomarkers. For example， salivary soluble CD44， salivary Cyfra 21-1， tissue polypeptide anti-gene， and CA125have been proposed as oral cancer markers 通用删除6(英):<u>[32]</u>. Nevertheless， no single bio molecule has been shown to meet the real-world requirement for high accuracy in identifying early disease onset， suggesting that multiple biomarker candidates are needed for high accuracy and sensitivity in detecting OSCCs 通用删除6(英):<u>[33]</u>. End products of free radical damage and nitrite levels are importantly increased in individuals with oral leukoplakia. Reciprocally， levels of glutathione S-transferase and uric acid are decreased. An elevated level of reactive species with a concomitant reduction in antioxidants in leukoplakia denotes its potential as an early diagnostic marker 通用删除6(英):<u>[34]</u>.\n\n【21】Evidence shows that a visual oral examination of high-risk individuals is a cost-effective screening strategy and the development and use of adjunctive aids together with biomarkers is becoming increasingly common 通用删除6(英):<u>[35]</u>. The gold standard method for diagnosis of oral cancer today， is still the traditional biopsy 通用删除6(英):<u>[33]</u>.\n\n【22】Conclusion\n\n【23】Oral cancer is a significant worldwide healthcare matter， its incidence is increasing and late-stage presentation is common with high mortality and morbidity. Oral examination of high-risk individuals is a cost-effective screening strategy. Screening programmes must be implemented for oral cancer and potentially malignant disease detection， especially leukoplakia.

These side-effects， probably immune-related， involved several organs， including the kidney 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. The spectrum of vaccination-related kidney injuries was widely distributed， including glomerulonephritis， interstitial nephritis， and vasculitis and may present as acute kidney injury 通用删除6(英):<u>[6，7]</u>. Herein， we report a case of acute kidney injury after 3 doses of mRNA-1273 vaccine (Moderna).\n\n【2】Case Presentation\n\n【3】A 58-year-old male visited our emergency room in March 2022， because of an abrupt onset of dizziness and general malaise. Physical examination revealed that he was afebrile with no cardiopulmonary distress， a blood pressure of 128/84 mmHg， heart rate； 74/min， normal heart sound and breathing sound， and normal abdominal examination. Neurological examinations were also unremarkable. Unexpectedly， a serum creatinine of 3.1 mg/dl (eGFR： 22.1 ml/min) was found. The other laboratory studies were unremarkable， including a normal urinalysis. The kidney sonography revealed normal size of both kidneys with normal echogenesity. His past history included hypertension and dyslipidemia； both were under satisfactory control at our cardiovascular clinic for more than 5 years. Notably， he received 3 doses of Covid-19m RNA-1273 vaccine(Moderna) in August 2021， November 2021 and February 2022， respectively. On December 74，2021， he received a routine check-up for a Pre-Scheduled Panendoscopy (PES)， which showed a normal serum creatinine of 1.1 mg/dl (eGFR： 73.08 ml/min)， but there was microscopic hematuria(urinalysis： RBC： 50-99/HPF， WBC： 0-2/HPF). He recalled that there was an episode of painless gross hematuria a few days ago， nearly one month after the second shot of vaccination. It subsided spontaneously. The PES disclosed gastric ulcers and a proton pump inhibitor (lansoprozole) were prescribed. Because there was no grosser hematuria， he did not pay attention to his kidney condition and was not followed up at our Nephrology Clinic until this visit to the emergency room. Under the impression of acute kidney injury 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u> with unknown etiology， he was admitted for a kidney biopsy. After admission， a series of immune studies were performed ， which showed an ANA titer of 1：160， normal Complement 3 (C3) and C4， negative for anti-ds-DNA， anti-glomerular basement antibody and anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody. The complete blood count was essentially normal except for a mild anemia (hemoglobin： 10.5)， and the liver function were also normal. A urinalysis again showed negative finding with no hematuria. The Urine Protein Creatinine Ratio(UPCR) was 93.6 mg/g Creatinine (Cr).\n\n【4】Pathologic finding\n\n【5】A kidney biopsy was done on the next day of admission. The sample was sent for Light Microscopy (LM)， Immunofluorescence study (IF) and Electron Microscopy (EM) examinations. There were 9 glomeruli in the specimen. Under LM ， the glomeruli appeared to be grossly normal with normal cellularity and capillary walls， except for mild focal thickening of Bowman capsule and enlarged Bowman’s space. The proximal tubules showed hyaline to foamy change with some tubules showing flattening of the lining epithelium and luminal dilatation. There were some calcifications in the tubular lumina and foci of tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis. The IF study was negative for all staining， including IgG， IgA， IgM， C3， kappa and lambda.

Anamnestically， she reported 4 miscarriages， 2 stillbirths， and previous cholecystectomy for stones. The EnS had started at the age of 20 years. At 22 years of age， the patient had performed an Electroencephalogram (EEG) following a generalized tonic-clonic seizure， which showed the presence of modest irritative signs with diffuse projection prevailing over the anterior regions； marked tendency to drowsiness was also reported on that occasion. These EEG changes persisted for about 20 days and then disappeared in subsequent control tracings. At the time she was placed on antiepileptic treatment with Carbamazepine (CBZ) 200 mg 3 times/day，continued for 7 years. During drug treatment the EnS disappeared to reappear upon discontinuation of CBZ.\n\n【16】The patient then performed neurologic re-evaluation and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ofthe brain，both of which were negative. A subsequent video-EEG was normal except documenting an episode of enuresis upon reaching stage 1 of non-REM sleep and failure to reach the deeper stages of sleep. Epileptic genesis of the enuresis was therefore ruled out. Various antimuscarinics and Amitriptyline were prescribed sequentially， all ofwhich were ineffective on enuresis.\n\n【17】When the patient came to our observation， she reported stably using nighttime diapers. The4-day bladder diaries documented constant enuresis (350 cc to 550 cc by wipe weighing) and 4 to5 daytime voiding’s with average bladder capacity about 250 cc and average micturition urgency of grade 1.5 (range 0-2) according to the \"Patient’s Perception of Intensity of Urgency Scale\"(PPIUS)， which describes the degree of micturition urgency on a scale from 0 (no urgency) to 4 (urge urinary incontinence)通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Post-void residual was not detected. On urodynamic study， reduced cytometric maximal bladder capacity was detected， and the micturition phase occurred with detrusor contraction . Normality of anemia， plasma and urinary osmolarity excluded possible endocrine causes of enuresis such as diabetes insipidus or syndrome of inappropriate secretion of anti-diuretic hormone. Thus， a picture of overactive bladder 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u> associated with sleep disturbance was diagnosed.\n\n【18】All proposed behavioral and pharmacological treatments (reduced evening water intake， desmopressin， night alarm， antimuscarinics such as oxybutynin and solifenacin， mirabegron) were ineffective even in combination. Therefore， the patient resumed low-dose CBZ intake (200 mg/day)， with significant reduction of enuresis episodes (1 wet night every 9-10)， with no changes in bladder diaries and in post-void residual. During treatment anemia， urinary osmolality and serum osmolality remained in the normal range. After 6 months， the patient preferred to discontinue therapy due to side effects such as sensory dulling and drowsiness.\n\n【19】Discussion\n\nPrimary nocturnal enuresis (EnP)， a common condition that affects 5% to 10% of children up to 7 years of age， appears to depend to varying degrees on 3 factors： bladder dysfunction， nocturnal polyuria， and failure to awaken to the sensation of bladder filling 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. In EnS， on the other hand， it is believed that the underlying causes of the disorder are predominantly overactive bladder-as reported by Madhu et al. in 201r analysis of 12，795 women undergoing comprehensive evaluation including urodynamic study 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u> -or bladder dysfunction associated with sedative drugs use 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u> or obesity 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. There is also believed to be a relationship between some types of focal epilepsy and|删除段之间换行|Few studies in the literature， most of them quite dated and with unambiguous conclusions， have investigated the possible involvement of sleep disturbances among the pathogenetic mechanisms of EnP. Through polysomnographic recording of 25 enuretic subjects aged 7 to 17 years， Neveeus et al. showed that enuresis occurred predominantly during non-REM sleep 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>， a finding confirmed by other authors 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>. In addition， a systematic review on the possible role of sleep and arousal activation mechanisms in the pathogenesis of enuresis found that enuretics have a higher arousal threshold with deeper sleep 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>.\n\n【21】Al-Waili et al. evaluated the use of CBZ in EnP： In a randomized trial of 26 subjects， he found that CBZ 200 mg was significantly effective compared to placebo in the treatment of EnP (mean number of dry nights/months 18.8±8.8vs.3.9±5.2 with placebo)通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>. In2006， the same author observed in 8 patients that CBZ produced a marked reduction in daytime and nighttime diuresis and an average increase in 24-h urinary osmolality of 43% 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>， suggesting an antidiuretic effect of CBZ.\n\n【22】Another interesting finding regarding CBZ comes from a couple of case-reports in which its prolonged intake had caused chronic urine retention that resolved with discontinuation 通用删除6(英):<u>[13，14]</u>. These cases suggest that CBZ can facilitate urine storage in susceptible people through 2 different mechanisms： The anticholinergic effect with reduction of bladder contractility and the increase of bladder outlet resistance due to hypertone of the internal urethral sphincter.\n\n【23】In the case we described， an epileptic genesis of EnS was ruled out， whereas thanks to Polysomnography， an episode of enuresis was detected during phase 1 of non-REM sleep-that is， the transitional phase from wakefulness to the onset of falling asleep， during which all muscular activity is lost. Therefore， we believe that the causes of EnS in the present case are due to the concomitance of a sleep disorder， with defective awakening mechanisms to the micturition stimulus， and overactive bladder syndrome with good adaptation to bladder symptoms during the waking state. Given that only CBZ has been able to control enuresis， which was refractory to all the treatments included antimuscarinics licensed for overactive bladder， its action on bladder overactivity as well as modulating effect in the central nervous system are conceivable.\n\n【24】Conclusion\n\n【25】In EnS refractoryto conventional treatments， CBZ may be a viable therapeutic option probably mainly due to its anticholinergic effect on bladder contraction. However， CBZ is not tolerated by all subiects and its use necessitates careful clinical and biohumoral monitoring(CBZ blood dosage， natremia and liver function).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

The remaining cases (less than10%) are mostly composed of uterine papillary serous carcinoma and clear cell carcinoma， which constitute almost half of all recurrences.

Here， we present a case of metastatic endometrial cancer to the bowel in a patient with a history of endometrial cancer. Patients rarely refuse any kind of cancer therapy allowing observation of the natural course of malignant disease.\n\n【12】Case Presentation\n\n【13】A 68-year-old female patient presented to the radiation oncology department at King Hussein Cancer Center (KHCC) in September 2006 with a diagnosis of endometrial endometrioid type of adenocarcinoma， status post total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy without pelvic lymph node dissection at a private hospital. FIGO stage IIA .\n\n【14】According to our policy， every pathology specimen outside KHCC should be reviewed； pathology review showed the followings：endometrial adenocarcinoma grade II， Invade invasion of half of the myometrium and upper cervix， and No Lympho Vascular Invasion(LVI). At KHCC， the metastatic work up was negative locally and distally.\n\n【15】We discussed the case at with the gynecology gynecology-oncology Multi Disciplinary Team (MDT) and the decision was to give post-operative radiotherapy. Moreover， after discussion with the patient about the effect and side effect of radiotherapy treatment she refused， so we referred her back to her primary gynecology physician for further follow up.\n\n【16】Four months later， she was again referred to us again from by her primary physician after she underwent Pelvic Lymph Nodes Dissection (PLND) and Omentectomy， (six months after primary surgery). We reviewed the specimen of pelvic lymph node specimen and it showed that all harvested 通用删除7(英):<u>(10)</u> lymph nodes dissected negative.\n\n【17】For that she came to us asking for adjuvant brachytherapy， but we did not recommend it because of the length of the period (duration between primary surgery and PLND is about six months)， which exceeds the permissible period for adjuvant treatment. The patient kept on follow up every three to four months for the first two years， then every six months for the next three years.\n\n【18】The patient did well till 2012 when she came to the emergency department at KHCC with abdominal pain and partial intestinal obstruction ， sigmoidoscopy was performed， with and a biopsy was ordered and showed A 6cm x4 cmx3cm ulcerating mass involving the sigmoid colon is identified.\n\n【19】A high-grade tumor with a dlear cytoplasm in most of the areas examined  is consistent with clear cell carcinoma isidentified.

Endometrial cancer has many histologic subtypes， with endometrioid adenocarcinoma being the most common. Staging of endometrial cancer is performed surgically and classified according to the FIGO staging classification.\n\nSeveral risk factors for recurrence in early stage endometrial endometrioid type cancer have been identified； including histologic grade 3， depth of myometrial invasion (>50%)， and age >60 years通用删除6(英):<u>[4，5]</u>， along with lympho vascular invasion， and lower uterine|删除段之间换行|A： There is proliferation of the glands lined by the tall columnar cells with cigar-shaped nuclei， which is consistent with endometrioid carcinoma. B：Another focus shows clearing of the cytoplasm but with preserved glandular architecture. C： Clear cells with hob nailing of nuclei， prominent nucleoli and clear cytoplasm， surrounding hyalinized papillary core consistent with a small focus of clear cell carcinoma， was seen in the original specimen (arrow).D：Clear cells with well-defined cytoplasmic membrane， and clear cytoplasm growing in glandular and solid patterns formed the major component in the metastatic carcinoma.

Adjuvant radiation can be considered if two of the above risk factors are present in addition to high histology type regardless the stage， Since our patient had two risk factors (stage IIA by old FIGO staging 1988 and tumor with >50% myometrial invasion)， So we recommended her adjuvant radiation therapy with vaginal brachy therapy.\n\n【26】Typical sites of recurrence are loco regional organs including the vagina and pelvic lymph nodes. A typical site includes lungs， bones， brain， and visceral organs 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. Our patient developed a distant disease recurrence at an atypical site； the sigmoid colon.\n\n【27】Endometrial cancer metastasis to the bowel has been described but is rare. While rare， it is important for gastroenterologists， along with pathologists and oncologists， to keep metastatic disease in the differential diagnosis of tumors in the intestine.\n\n【28】Our patient had a recurrence more than 6 years from diagnosis of endometrial cancer while most relapses occur within 3 vears after hysterectomy for endometrioid carcinoma. Her presentation was interesting since she presented with symptoms of bowel obstruction， and her colonoscopy showed evidence of an obstructing colonic mass， which was thought to be primary colon cancer versus metastatic endometrial cancer in the colon wall. Colonic obstruction secondary to recurrent gynecologic malignancies is commonly a consequence of external compression.\n\n【29】It seems that the cause of metastatic endometrial cancer to the sigmoid colon is the presence of foci of clear cell component foci in the first specimen after hysterectomy that was missed at the first review and had been found retrospectively when our pathologist found that the new pathology of metastasis is a high clear cell.

These editorial highlights the ongoing efforts to preserve and breed endangered species， focusing on captive breeding programs， artificial insemination， embryo transfer， and their role in conservation. Captive breeding programs have proven crucial in recovering declining populations and providing genetic reserves for future reintroduction into the wild. Additionally，advanced reproductive techniques such as artificial insemination and embryo transfer have enhanced reproduction rates and genetic diversity. However， it is important to acknowledge that these approaches should be complemented by in-situ conservation efforts aimed at protecting natural habitats and addressing underlying causes of population decline. Successful reintroduction of captive-bred animals requires ongoing research， careful monitoring， and collaboration among scientists， conservationists， and local communities. Public awareness and education play a pivotal role in promoting conservation and garnering support. Byadopting an integrated and collaborative approach， we can strive for a future where endangered species thrive in harmony with their natural environments，ensuring the preservation of biodiversity for generations to come.\n\n【13】Preserving biodiversity has become an increasingly urgent concern as the world faces a rising rate of species extinction. To protect and save endangered animals from disappearing forever， scientists and conservationists have been making significant efforts in the field of reproduction and conservation of endangered species. One of the most prominent approaches is the establishment of captive breeding programs， also known as ex-situ breeding programs. These programs have played a crucial role in attempting to recover declining populations and preserve endangered species from extinction. By maintaining animals in controlled environments such as zoos and specialized breeding centers， these programs can ensure the survival of species and provide a genetic reservoir for future reintroduction efforts into the wild. Furthermore， technological advancements have enabled the use of assisted reproductive techniques such as artificial insemination and embryo transfer to enhance reproduction rates and the reproductive success of endangered species. Artificial insemination allows for the collection of sperm from endangered males， which can be used to fertilize females that would otherwise be unable to reproduce naturally. Embryo transfer， on the other hand， enables the transportation of healthy embryos from endangered species to recipient females， thereby increasing the chances of successful reproduction. These advanced reproductive techniques not only help overcome reproductive challenges faced by endangered species but also contribute to genetic diversity and the long-term survival of these populations. By preserving genetic variability， these approaches assist in the adaptation and resilience of species in the face of environmental threats and climate change. However， it is important to emphasize that assisted reproduction and captive breeding programs should not be considered definitive solutions for biodiversity preservation. These strategies should complement in-situ conservation efforts， which aim to protect natural habitats and address the underlying causes of declining wild populations. The reintroduction of captive-bred animals to their natural habitats is a crucial step towards the long-term success of conservation. After all， the ultimate goal is to ensure that species can thrive and reproduce in their natural environments， contributing to the health of ecosystems as a whole. However，the challenges faced in reintroducing captive-bred animals should not be underestimated. Adaptation to new environments， competition with other species，and overcoming obstacles such as删除1换行illegal hunting and habitat destruction are just some of the challenges reintroduced species may encounter. It is crucial， therefore， that reproductive and conservation programs be supported by ongoing scientific research， careful monitoring， and collaboration among scientists， conservationists， and local communities. Understanding the ecological requirements of species and implementing adequate protection measures in their natural habitats are essential elements for successful reintroduction. Additionally， public awareness and education play a vital role in promoting conservation and adopting behaviors that support wildlife preservation. By sharing the efforts of reproduction and conservation， along with the ecological and cultural significance of endangered species， we can generate interest and support from society at large. The reproduction and conservation of endangered species require a collective and comprehensive effort that删除1换行includes not only actions directed at captive populations but also the protection of natural habitats， combating illegal hunting， controlling environmental degradation， and raising public awareness. Only through an integrated and collaborative approach can we effectively preserve endangered species and ensure the health and resilience of the ecosystems they inhabit. In summary， current efforts in the reproduction and conservation of endangered species， including captive breeding programs， assisted reproductive techniques， and careful reintroduction， play a vital role in biodiversity preservation. By combining scientific knowledge， active conservationism， and public engagement， we can work towards a future where threatened species can thrive and coexist harmoniously with their natural environments. It is our duty to protect and ensure the survival of species for future generations，ensuring a richer and more diverse world for all.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

South Dagon was one of the high dengue cases-reported townships in last 5 years (VBDC， Annual Report 2019). Meanwhile， Htantabin， a suburban area and located at outskirt of Yangon city， reported the highest dengue cases from January to June 2020. Thus， those two townships were selected purposively for the present study.\n\n【16】As precaution measures for COVID-19 transmission， the following measures were precisely performed during the activity：Applied minimum workforce (one entomologist， one epidemiologist， one Basic Health Staff (BHS) and one local ward authority)， applied personal protective measures (masks and face-shields)， routine temperature checking of survey team members and reduced the contact time with inhabitants.\n\n【17】Inspections of potential breeding habitats (presence or absence of Aedes mosquito immature stages) in and around household premises were inspected thoroughly by survey team following precaution measures as mentioned previously. Container type， size， place and type of water were noted down using checklist. Residents were requested to bring flower vases which were placed indoor to outside of the houses. In order to reduce communication time with residents， larvae and pupae were not counted and also water containers inside of the houses except flower vases were ignored in the present study.\n\n【18】Data analysis\n\n【19】Entomological data were analyzed by using R studio software and categorical data were shown in percentage.

In South Dagon Township， total of 1，065 potential mosquito breeding containers were inspected and Aedes immature stages were found in 246 containers. Meanwhile，309 Aedes infested containers out of 1，216 inspected containers were found in Htantabin Township. In terms ofthe number of containers， flower vase was the highest number of containers in both townships with 438 and 612， respectively， and followed by barrel and cement drums in South Dagon and ceramic jars in Htantabin Township. However， discarded container type was the highest Aedes infested proportion among all types of containers with the percentage of 81%in South Dagon and 80.6% in Htantabin Township .\n\n【24】Container Index (CI)， Household Index (HI) and Breteau Index(BI) were 23.1% and 25.4%， 65.6% and 71.4%， and 153.8 and 163.5， respectively， for South Dagon and Htantabin townships .\n\n【25】Discussion\n\n【26】Among those 8 common types of containers (barrel， bucket， cement drum， cement tank， ceramic jar， flower vase， spiritual bowl and discarded)， flower vase container type was the highest number in both townships as a part of the Myanmar culture. One study conducted in Yangon 通用删除7(英):<u>(2018)</u> reported the very low proportion of Aedes infestation in flower vase container type 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. However， two studies conducted in Yangon in 2010 and 2011 stated that flower vase was one of the key containers for mosquito breeding 通用删除6(英):<u>[6，10]</u>. In the present study， proportion of Aedes infestation in flower vase was noticeably high in Htantabin Township which was the highest dengue case-reported township in 2020.\n\n【27】Discarded container type was the highest proportion of Aedes infestation in both townships and the same situation was reported in previous studies conducted in Hlaing Thar Yar 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u> and South Dagon townships in Yangon. Majority ofthe health staff fromtownships were assigned to prevention and control of COVID-19 activities (MOH，2020) which led to the gradual decrease of dengue vector surveillance and control activities.

Three hospital sites were chosen， of which only one currently screens women for psychosocial risk factors. Thematic analysis was applied to interview transcripts. Three researchers then discussed reoccurring themes and a consensus in themes and subthemes was reached.\n\n【4】Results： Only one hospital was screening women and had midwives trained in psychosocial assessment including depression screening. There were mixed views on the process and barriers to screening were identified， e.g.， lack of support systems， cultural barriers， inaccurate answers， power barriers with obstetricians， husband interference， fear and powerlessness.

The style of Qualitative Analysis employed resembled that described by Burnard 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u> and more recently termed editing analyses by Polit and Beck 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. As the researchers conducted the interviews， they kept field notes that were used to contextualize the data and contributed to the commencement of data analysis.\n\n【11】Results\n\n【12】Group 1： Booking-in midwives\n\n【13】The midwife includes the psychosocial assessment as part of her usual antenatal clinical interview. Her role is to assess all women at booking-in for psychosocial risk factors and offer referral as needed. The booking-in visit is conducted in a private room with the woman， her partner and midwife present. The partner could be asked by the midwife to leave the room to ensure privacy.\n\n【14】Only those midwives who had attended the Perinatal Mental Health Assessment (Introductory Training) could participate in the study， enroll women to the study， gain their consent and conduct the screening using the Clinical Care Guideline package. During the booking-in visit， women who had consented to be part of the study were asked a series of psychological questions and also given an Edinburgh Perinatal Depression Scale to complete 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>.\n\n【15】It is generally accepted that， in an English-speaking population， an EPDS score of 10-12 suggests the respondent may meet criteria for minor depression； a score 13-18 suggests she would probably meet criteria for depressive illness： 19-30 indicates a higher degree of distress and complexity， possibly including depressive illness， but also including other factors， such as a positive score on question 10(self-harm). Women are offered follow-up according to established referral pathways.\n\n【16】Group 2： Obstetricians and other health professionals\n\n【17】Health professionals (obstetricians， midwives， general practitioners， social workers， psychologists， early childhood nurses) involved in delivering care to study participants as above were asked to contribute their views on the effectiveness/suitability of the clinical care guideline package following implementation， using semi-structured interviews.\n\n【18】Midwives and obstetricians were then interviewed in focus groups or individually to ascertain the appropriateness of the psychosocial screening questions， as well as any concerns， suggestions and other issiles.\n\n【19】Group 3： Private hospital midwives\n\n【20】Interviews were commenced with midwives working at other private hospitals (in addition to the primary study site) to ascertain their views on the effectiveness/suitability of antenatal psychosocial questioning. Early detection and appropriate referral are the main aims of data collection， with a view to establishing Commercial-in-Confidenceevidence for implementing routine， universalscreening in this setting. Midwives at each facility (as well as those at the study site) were invited to share their experiences of the antenatal psychosocial and depression screening of women through voluntary participation in semi-structured qualitative interviews .\n\n【21】Them es\n\n【22】Benefits of psychosocial screening\n\n【23】We need to know： A dominant theme among all midwives consenting to interview was related to the benefits of screening women for psychosocial issues. The midwives indicated that this type of information was not only helpful but necessary for them to give the best possible care to women.\n\n【24】Midwives spoke of the “need to know” to be able to provide a comprehensive service and holistic care to women. They felt the experience of questioning women offered the opportunity to ask删除1换行questions， to debrief and provide tailored care.\n\n【25】For example， midwives spoke of answers to the psychosocial questions giving them a “heads up”(M1) or\"flags going up\"(M2) or“opening things up”for further discussion.\n\n【26】Midwives comments； “We get the heads up that there are issues”“It is invaluable”. We can put supports in place for women， it opens things up\". It allows us to look for issues and explore them with the women\"(midwife 1).\n\n【27】Yes， apart from looking after the body， we are looking after the spirit and mind as well. These women are not stupid： mostly career women (midwife 2). Yes，\"If you don’t ask， you won’t know\"(midwife3).\n\n【28】Consistency： Another major sub-theme within the benefits of screening concerned the consistency of approach in asking the questions. For example， “We can display empathy for the women if we are aware of their issues\". The benefit of a consistent approach rather than self-selecting who to interview was evident， “Women are consistently asked the questions， all on the same page. It gives them the opportunity to disclose\"(midwife 5).\n\n【29】“It is less threatening if it is standardized\n\n【30】“It helps us tailor the care to meet their needs”\n\n【31】Risks of not screening： Midwives were asked directly about the benefits and risks of not screening. Midwives indicated that the benefits outweighed the risks. For example： Yes， “There are no risks， only benefits， if we don’t ask and they have a history of self harmits our duty\". (Midwife 1) and， “No benefits in NOT asking them. If we don’t we miss someone at risk\" (midwife 3). Although there was an expressed sensitivity around asking the screening questions，“However， they may be uncomfortable being asked these questions\".“If we don’t ask， we won’t know， for example-DV. We can plead ignorance if we don’t ask， as we are not aware\" (midwife 4) “I’m in two minds， as some women want to disclose and others dont. I think that they should given a choice/elect to answer the questions\".“The risk of not asking them is that they will get no help， may have prolonged PND or suicide\"(midwife 5).\n\n【32】Barriers to screening\n\n【33】No training/experience in how to screen： Midwives identified a lack of training and experience in how to screen women. Only one of the three sites had received any training in psychosocial screening. For example， “Staff feeling uncomfortable and being inexperienced. There is no antenatal clinic. No staff with mental health training. An antenatal clinic would allow rapport building. Also， the husbands are present”(Midwife 3). Some midwives noted that they needed to screen regardless of their lack of training and therefore relied on experience or a “gut feeling. “We have to rely on our experience to detect issues”.“But some of the midwives don't have the experience to do this”.\n\n【34】“I think that the postnatal midwives needtraining， they administer an EPDS but often don't know how to score it or what is considered high risk and when to refer\".\n\n【35】The husband： Some midwives highlighted the issue of the husband being present. Some husbands stayed in the room to interpret for the woman or were not asked to leave by the midwife.“The problem is that often the husbands come and we don't ask them to leave， that’s the way we have always done it； the booking in. “We删除表格换行have a lot of women from India who come with their husbands， often the husbands fill out the EPDS for their wives or with them， and we rely on them to interpret for the women\". There was a concern expressed by midwives that they often could not speak to the women on their own as the husbands refused to leave when the woman was being interviewed.\n\n| Table 1： Themes.  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Theme  | Subtheme  | Quotes  |\n| Benefits of psychosocial screening  | We need to know  | \"We would know where they are at， so that we can help them\".

For example， “The obstetricians， they are often defensive\"， “the obstetricians， they have a sense of ownership of the women\". There was also a concern that when the midwife did in fact high light a woman’s psychosocial issues to the obstetrician that it was not taken seriously.“Sometimes they fob vou off when you identify an issue and alert them- the obstetricians\"，“We are often left in the dark about a woman’s problems\"， “We rely on the obstetricians to document but they often write nothing.\n\n【38】Other themes\n\n【39】They lie/fear： There was a reported concern by midwives that women were not honest with the results of questioning. For example， However， some women lie， they will talk if they want help，“The women can lie and not admit that they have problems”(midwife1). Woman may also fear any potential consequences of disclosing issues，“Some women don’t want to know about community services as there is a fear attached，i.e.，DOCS (FACS)”，“They hide their issues， some come here to hide from DOCS， they come under a false name and don’t want to go to the public system because of DOCS”. This is referring to FACS-Family and community services who have to capacity to remove the baby from the mother).\n\n【40】They don’t want to disclose- the women， they are high powered38 to 40 year old women that often run big businesses/are high flyers and are used to being in control\".\n\n【41】Midwife barriers： Some midwives expressed concern about the psychosocial questions. “Some questions are a bit odd： that is删除1换行awkward'(Midwife 2). There was also concern about discomfort in asking the questions or receiving uncomfortable answers， difficult responses include： mother passed away； patient estranged from family； half a dozen said abused as a child； someone with trauma in first delivery so has come to private hospital this time； infertility； lack of support. Interestingly some midwives indicated that they could either determine which women warranted asking the psychosocial questions， or that women should indicate that they wanted to be screened. “I don’t think that we should screen all women， the odd one may say that they wanted to be asked the questions”.\n\n【42】A social worker expressed concerns with the booking-in process at a hospital.“Certain midwives are more receptive to assisting women than others. Most women here dont seem to disclose at booking in. I get the majority of referrals postnatally when they stay for 3-4 days and a more attuned midwife picks up that there might be a problem. Things need to change here”(SW). The answer-“Change the booking in midwife and educate the midwives.\n\n【43】Lack of awareness： Another sub-theme indicated a concern that women were neither attuned to the psychosocial questions nor understood their relevance， “They are often unaware of the connection between their past history and their present status/effect\".\n\n【44】Language can be a barrier， e.g.， some Asian women： a few women are very business-like (midwife 2).\n\n【45】Lack of time： Time was seen as an additional pressure in psychosocial screening. “It takes a long time to screen the women”(midwife 1). “They book in online” “The pressure on staff， time”(midwife 5).\n\n【46】Enough supports\n\n【47】A subtheme emerged around a lack of resources and supports for women once positively screened. “We don’t have a social worker； we don’t have enough supports for the women\". When asked删除1换行whether there was enough support for women one midwife replied，“Sometimes you need to call the obstetrician several times before something is done to help the women， but you just need to keep onto them， the obstetricians.\n\n【48】General comments\n\n【49】“The psychiatrist may retire soon and I don’t know if she will be replaced”(midwife 4).\n\n【50】We only have 1 useless psychiatrist and 1 social worker； they help a bit at least(midwife 3).\n\n【51】\"We need better follow-up”\n\n【52】“We can’t refer； we just let the obstetrician know”\n\n【53】“We do follow-up with the child and family health nurse and flag women if we are concerned”\n\n【54】Further suggestions about the psychosocial screening process/procedure?\n\n【55】As mentioned by the NUM， it would be good to talk to the women more postnatally， including debriefing (midwife 2).\n\n【56】“Ongoing support/training so that staff can repeat the EPDS\". We need an update(midwife 3).\n\n【57】“More access to public health services would be helpful”(midwife4).\n\n【58】“Sometimes the fathers look depressed； I suppose we could also give them an EPDS?”\n\n【59】“I think that we could re-administer the EPDS during antenatal classes at 32/40 approx， as often concerns come up in the classes. These concerns may not have been there at 12-20 weeks when we book them in”.\n\n【60】“Our midwives are older here and attuned to women's needs due to their life experience， they have been there， done that， had their families”However， the postnatal midwives would not know how to score； use or flag an EPDS score so need training”.\n\n【61】“If we are concerned postnatally we often ask the husband what the woman is normally like”\n\n【62】“We need a social worker， just for this unit\n\n【63】“We need a community link for the women”\n\n【64】“We need to be clear of the referral pathways to help a woman， instead of feeling lost\".\n\n【65】“The antenatal classes may be an opportunity to educate the women about psychosocial issues， however， we have such a poor删除1换行attendance at these classes， as women view them as only for a woman wanting/booking in for a natural birth， not a C/S. Midwives in the obstetricians’ rooms could screen/support the women also. The women need to book in earlier and if they are identified as at risk we could see them again\"(Midwife 3).\n\n【66】Discussion\n\n【67】At the time of the study， only one other private hospital in Sydney was screening women and their midwives were trained in psychosocial assessment. There were mixed views on psychosocial screening and barriers to screening were identified. Benefits were also identified：early identification of problems， standardization and patient-focused care. However， midwives also expressed concerns： suicide ideation， intrusiveness of questions， “some women lie\"， not wanting to screen all women， lack of support systems， cultural barriers， and inaccurate answers， power barriers with obstetricians， husband interference， fear and powerlessness. Relevant suggestions were made： appropriate and adequate education， training and support of midwives； flagging high risk women； more in-house resources and external resources community links， and employing a central midwife with interest and expertise in psychosocial assessment and screening. Midwives had various views on the program. Some felt that it was within their work role， others did not. Some were fearful of what could be revealed by the woman and how to deal with it. There was an identified concern that obstetricians did not take seriously any concerns highlighted by the midwife about a woman's psychosocial difficulties. There was a sense of a lack of ownership’of the women， therefore a feeling of helplessness in addressing their needs. Some midwives indicated an interest in a woman's perinatal mental health/psychosocial risk factors；however others expressed a concern that this was not part of their role. This highlights the need to educate and support midwives working in the private sector on their important role in enhancing the perinatal mental health of women in their care. Their role includes potential for prevention， early intervention and health promotion to benefit not only the woman but her child， partner and family.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

In our case， we examined a rare case of echinococcosis localized in the gluteal region in a 36-year-old Turkish male and its treatment process. The patient without a chronic disease was admitted to our clinic with right lower quadrant abdominal pain， indigestion， and rapid weight loss complaints. According to the results of hydatid cyst hemagglutination， the patient was diagnosed with Echinococcus. After the surgery and the treatment with omnipaque， the patient's complaints disappeared.\n\n【2】Keywords： Echinococcus； Parasites； Surgery； Medication； Abdominal pain\n\n【3】Background\n\n【4】Echinococcus species are distributed globally and can be observed on every continent except Antarctica. Infections with these parasite species are mostly considered extremely serious since they result in significant morbidity， mortality and substantial economic losses in the livestock industry. Echinococcus granulosus and Echinococcus multilocularis， cause cystic echinococcosis and alveolar echinococcosis respectively， and they are the two most prevalent species of interest from the human and veterinary perspective 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. When an infection leads to such diseases， the parasite is partially kept under control by the host's immune system： in a case of immunocompetence the normal alveolar echinococcosis or cystic echinococcosis situation， the metacestode grows gradualy which eventually leads to the first visible clinical signs on the host， mostly years after the infection. It has been observed that in a case of impaired immunity， uncontrolled proliferation of the metacestode causes the disease to progress rapidly 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>.\n\n【5】Adult cestodes are regarded apathogenic in hosts， while metacestode， the alveolar form， is high pathogenic for intermediate hosts. The alveolar cyst causes malign tumor-like lesions with infiltrative， proliferative， and destructive character. These lesions primarily originate in the liver， which then metastasize to other organs. If it is not treated in intermediate hosts， it can cause irreversible symptoms and death by targeting other vital organs such as lungs and brain 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>.\n\n【6】删除10:<u>6307：</u>\n\n【7】Case Presentation\n\n【8】A 36-year-old Turkish male without a chronic disease was admitted to our clinic with a two month history of rightlower quadrant abdominal pain， indigestion， and rapid weight loss. The pain increased in severity over 36 h. Upon arrival， he was febrile and tachycardia.\n\n【9】In the physical examination， no deviations from the normal state were found. In laboratory tests， deviations from the normal state were not observed： BUN： 9 IU/ml 通用删除7(英):<u>(8-23)</u>， AST (SGOT)：25 IU/ml 通用删除7(英):<u>(0-31)</u>， ALT (SPGT)： 57 IU/ml 通用删除7(英):<u>(0-65)</u>； HBsAg， Anti-HVC， and Anti-HIV results were negative. Abdominal cavity ultrasound results were also normal.\n\n【10】The CT scans showed that chest organs were normal. The scan ofthe chest， abdominal and pelvic regions was performed after intravenous contrast administration with a slice thickness of 5 mm. A well-circumscribed encapsulated mass lesion，approximately 100 mm x 55 mm in size， was detected in the adipose tissue in the gluteal region . The result of hydatid cyst hemagglutination was negative： 1/80 (<1/160). 45 ml daily dosage of omnipaque and surgery were prescribed.\n\n【11】Under sedoanalgesia， a 10 cmx10 cm mass in the upper gluteal region located in the left lumbar region was reached bypassing the skin under the skin at the prone position. The mass was cystic inconsistency. By opening the cyst， many millimeter-sized cystic lesions were observed .\n\n【12】The inside of the cyst was washed with 3% NaCl， the bladder wall was excised， and a Hemovac drain was placed. The skin was primarily repaired. On the 5h day after the surgery， the patient was discharged from the hospital without complications and in good condition.\n\n【13】Discussion\n\n【14】Cystic echinococcosis is a complex disease. Even though it is considered to be in principle， preventable and treatable， it continues to be a major public health problem in many countries. There are various unanswered questions and is a clear need for research regarding to the disease and its diagnostics as well as development of prevention and control programs.\n\n【15】Hydatid disease is mostly observed in the right lobe of the liver. Pancreatic localization is described in the literature with a frequency of only 0.2% to 2% 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. Among such cases， lesions are commonly located in the head of the pancreas (50% to 58%). Location in the body and tail of the pancreas is seen only in the 24% to 34% and 19%of such cases respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. Most patients (40% to 80% of cases) have a single cysticlesion located in a single organ. Theliver is affected in 70% of the cases， the right lobe more commonly than the left. The lungs are the second most frequently affected organ and are affected in about 20% of the cases. Cysts can localize virtually in any organ and structure， such as abdominal or pleural cavities， kidney， spleen， bone，brain， eye， ovary， testis， and pancreas. Rare immune-mediated reactions such as urticaria， asthma， membranous nephropathy， and anaphylaxis have also been described in the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. While the Echinococcus cases are more common to develop in the liver or lungs， in our case， it developed in the lumbar region.\n\n【16】In the postsurgical course， medication should be administered for at least 2 years， and in many recurrent or inoperable cases， the complications and intolerance of treatment with Alben dazole should be taken into consideration， which is， fortunately， not a frequent phenomenon.\n\n【17】Based on the exposure， clinical picture， imaging tests， and serological test results， Echinococcosis multilocularis can be diagnosed with the sensitivity of up to 90% to 100% and specificity of up to 95%to 100%. The most effective treatment is surgical treatment combined with Albendazole treatment.\n\n【18】Percutaneous drainage of a pancreatic echinococcal cyst is an alternative to surgical treatment for people with high intrasurgical risk. Surgical treatment can be radical or sparing. Radical procedures are associated with a lower risk of relapse but carry a greater risk of postsurgical complications. Postsurgical recurrence's frequency is around 2% to 5% and is most often caused by incomplete cyst excision， leaving undiagnosed cysts and the lack of protection from Albendazole.\n\n【19】Conclusion\n\n【20】The importance of early diagnosis in Echinococcosis cases in endemic regions such as Turkey is indisputable. It should be noted that with increasing awareness for early detection of echinococcal infestations in high endemic regions， the recovery rate of patients will be increased and complications will be significantly reduced.\n\n【21】Summary\n\n【22】Echinococcosis is considered to be potentially lethal zoonotic diseases that cause serious damage to hosts.

The most frequent mutation is p.Lys202del and compounds heterozygous forms have been reported. We report a50-year-old female with recurrent rhabdomyolysis，bilateralptosis， and girdle limb weakness.Muscle biopsy presented frequent， red-raged fibers and dystrophic changes. The most severely affected muscles in magnetic resonance imaging axial T1-weighted sequences were the gluteus maximus， sartorius and tensor fasciae latae muscles. We found a compound heterozygous mutation in the thymidine kinase 2 gene (pathogenic mutation in [c.323C>T p.(Thr108Met)] and novel mutation in[c.268C>T p.(Arg90Cys)]). Deoxynucleoside therapy was offered.\n\n【2】Keywords： Thymidine kinase 2； Myopathy； Rhabdomyolysis； Mitochondria\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Thymidine Kinase 2 (TK2) deficiency myopathy is an autosomal recessive disease， due to mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) depletion 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，2]</u>. The mtDNA encodes less than 0.1% of the proteins regulating mitochondrial activity， most encoding genes remain unknown 通用删除6(英):<u>[3，4]</u>. TK2-deficiency myopathy is specifically caused by defects in the replication， maintenance， and repair of mitochondrial DNA by TK2， which is the first and limiting step in the phosphorylation of deoxypyrimidine nucleosides 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Several mutations have been described in the TK2 gene that leads to the myopathic form 通用删除6(英):<u>[3-5]</u>.\n\n【5】TK2-related myopathy clinical picture is heterogeneous， and three forms have been described：infantile (<1 year)，childhood (1 to 12 years)， and late-onset myopathy (>12 years)， the latter being the most unusual (17.4%) and with a relatively better prognosis 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. In the late-onset group， the mean age of symptoms onset is between 17 and 31 years 通用删除6(英):<u>[6，7]</u>， with a similar prevalence among gender， and mean survival is 19.8 to 23.0 years 通用删除6(英):<u>[6，7]</u>.\n\n【6】Muscle clinical manifestations are characterized by proximal weakness， ptosis， facial diplegia， ophthalmoparesis and dysphagia 通用删除6(英):<u>[6，7]</u>. The natural progression of the disease evolves to respiratory failure at 10 years of presentation， requiring non-invasive mechanical ventilation 通用删除6(英):<u>[6，7]</u>. Creatine Kinase (CK) may be normal， although it usually is elevated between 190 U/L to 6500 U/L 通用删除6(英):<u>[6，7]</u>. Serum lactate is a nonsensible test and is elevated in only 25% of cases 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>.\n\n【7】The genetics profile of TK-2 patients shows that p.Lys202del is the most frequent mutation in the TK2 gene in late-onset patients 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. In recent years， compound heterozygosis has been described in TK-2 related children’s onset myopathy 通用删除6(英):<u>[8，9]</u>.\n\n【8】Herein， we report a novel compound heterozygosis mutation late onset TK2- deficiency\n\n【9】Case Presentation\n\n【10】We report a 50-year-old female， with no neuromuscular， cardiac， or diabetic family history. During her childhood， the patient had exercise intolerance without muscle weakness. At 36 years old， after a long flight， the patient presented an acute episode of limb girdle weakness， myalgias and a 25，000 U/L in serum CK. This episode lasted three days， then she returned to being asymptomatic， and CK returned to normal values.\n\n【11】The patient started a progressive girdle limb muscle weakness one year after the first rhabdomyolysis episode and slightly elevated CK(600 U/L to 900 U/L). At 47 and 50 years， she had new episodes of rhabdomyolysis (CK 15.000 and 17.000 U/L) episodes with no precise trigger. She was admitted to our hospital due to the last episode of rhabdomyolysis.\n\n【12】On examination， there was bilateral ptosis， orbicular oculi， and limb-girdle weakness. Venous blood lactate was elevated (18.9 mg/dl) and no other abnormalities were documented in the laboratory exams. No deafness and cardiopathy was found in audiometry and echocardiography， respectively.\n\n【13】Electromyography registereddmyopathiicc changesS.inn both orbicularis oculi and gluteus maximum. Muscle Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the lower limbs showed fatty infiltration predominantly in the gluteus maximus， sartorius and tensors fasciae latae. The other muscles of the pelvis， thighs， and legs had significantly less involvement . Deltoid muscle biopsy unveiled increased muscle fiber internal nuclei， several small rounded muscle fibers and scattered pale. There was a focus of endomysial inflammatory cells and necrotic fibers. Also， frequent cyclooxygenase negative and red raged fibers were found.\n\n【14】Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS)neuromuscularpanel revealed a pathogenic heterozygous mutation of the TK2 gen[c.323C>T p.(Thr108Met)] and [c.268C>T p.(Arg90Cys)] mutation，删除1换行both associated with mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome. Genetic counselling was done， and a NGS TK-2 gen was performed on her asymptomatic son， showing only one allele with c.268C>Tp.(Arg90Cys) mutation.\n\n【15】The patient responded satisfactorily to intravenous fluids therapy without renal or respiratory involvement. Deoxynucleoside therapy was offered， and the patient was discharged.\n\n【16】Discussion\n\n【17】Recessive mutations in the TK2 gene are responsible for diverse clinical presentations mainly characterized by progressive muscle weakness， dysphagia， and respiratory involvement with a broad spectrum of severity and onset 通用删除6(英):<u>[7-12]</u>. Recurrent rhabdomyolysis is a rare presentation form oflate-onset TK-2 myopathy，only one clinical case was reported in the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>.\n\n【18】The most frequent mutation is p.Lys202del. Moreover， there are multiple pathogenic mutations described in the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>[7，10，11]</u>. Compound mutations have been described 通用删除6(英):<u>[8，9]</u>， expanding the spectrum of possible mutated combinations. Generally， adult on-set TK-2 deficiency myopathy is less severe than pediatric forms. This may be due to better maintenance of the muscle mtDNA content， differing from late-onset pediatric forms， which have an increased mtDNA expression 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>. Compound mutations have been increasingly described in different forms of TK2 deficiency myopathies通用删除6(英):<u>[9，11，12</u>J.These combinationss can produce the symptomatic form while homozygous (NM004614.4：c.323C>T)，or compound (NM004614.4：c.268C>T)通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>.\n\n【19】Muscle fat infiltration on lower-limb muscle MRI is an important clinical clue to the diagnosis. Gluteus maximus is the most severely affected muscle， and sartorius， a muscle which is usually spared in many genetic muscle diseases (even in late stages)， was also affected. Interestingly， these MRI fits with a pattern previously described in late-onset TK2 patients 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>.\n\n【20】Muscle biopsies in late-onset TK-2 deficiency myopathy showed\n\n| Gene  | Coordinates  | Amino acid change  | SNP identifier  | Zygosity  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| TK2  | NM 004614.4：c.323C>T  | p.(Thr108Met)  | rs137854431  | Heterozygous  |\n| TK2  | NM004614.4：c.268C>T  | p.(Arg90Cys)  | rs281865489  | Heterozygous  |\n\n【22】Abbreviations： TK2： Thymidine Kinase 2；SNP： Single Nucleotide Polymorphism删除1换行the typical findings of mitochondrial dysfunction described in most mitochondrial myopathies.

A plain radiograph of the right hand showed an avulsion fracture at the base of the first proximal phalanx  . Also known as the skier’s thumb， this injury typically occurs after falling onto the outstretched thumb， such as falling when skiing while holding a ski pole. This is an injury associated with the ulnar collateral ligament of the metacarpophalangeal joint and may lead to a chronic instability of the thumb if not treated adequately. To restore the stability and the grip strength， the patient was treated with open reduction and internal fixation with suture anchor and ulnar collateralligament repair. The patient was able to sustain gripping after the surgery and participated in rehabilitation. At follow-up 6 months after surgery， he had regained full use of his right hand.\n\n【3】通用间距删除-1:<u>OPEN ACCESS</u>\n\n【4】通用间距删除-1:<u>Figure 1： Avulsion fracture at the base of the first proximal phalanx.</u>\n\n【5】通用间距删除-1:<u>Correspondence：</u>\n\n【6】通用间距删除-1:<u>Ting-Han Tai， Department of Orthopedics， Shuang Ho Hospital， Taiwan，</u>\n\n【7】删除7:<u>通用间距删除-1:<u>E-mail：b101101132@tmu.edu.tw</u></u>\n\n【8】删除7:<u>通用间距删除-1:<u>Received Date： 29 Jun 2022</u></u>\n\n【9】删除7:<u>通用间距删除-1:<u>Accepted Date： 11 Jul 2022</u></u>\n\n【10】删除7:<u>通用间距删除-1:<u>Published Date： 15 Jul 2022</u></u>\n\n【11】通用间距删除-1:<u>Citation：</u>\n\n【12】通用间距删除-1:<u>Tai T-H， Hsu T-S.

Effects of this condition on perinatal outcomes were inconclusive across a broad range of studies. We reviewed the literature on isolated oligohydramnios with perinatal outcomes. Electronic databases like PubMed，CINAHL， Web of Science，EMBASE，and Medline were searched from inception to 2022 using keywords and MeSH terms for perinatal outcomes and isolated oligohydramnios. Observational studies (Cohort， case-control) and systematic review & meta-analysis studies published in English were included. Whereas， letters of personal communications， case reports， and case series were excluded. Studies with singleton and low-risk pregnancy， cephalic presentation， and oligohydramnios (amniotic fluid index ≤5 cm) were included. Exclusion criteria were studies that include pregnancies with fetal malformation， chromosomal anomaly； growth restriction， and interventional drugs. We obtained 557 full texts from electronic databases but only35 articles met the inclusion criteria. The narrative review revealed that an association does not exist between isolated oligohydramnios and low Apgar score， non-reassuring fetal heartbeat pattern， fetal distress， and umbilical artery/vein pH less than 7.1/7.2. However， isolated oligohydramnios is significantly associated with higher rates of labor induction and cesarean sections. Nevertheless， the impact of isolated oligohydramnios on meconium-stained amniotic fluid and neonatal intensive care unit were inconclusive across the finding. Further large-scale follow-up studies are needed to better elucidate the available evidence.\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Adequate amniotic fluid volume is a sign of normal placental functioning and it is the most important component of biophysical profile for fetal well-being tests 通用删除6(英):<u>[1-3]</u>. Amniotic Fluid Index(AFI) is the preferred method of amniotic fluid measurement. To measure AFI， the uterus is divided into four equal quadrants. AFI is the sum of the deepest pocket from each quadrant. The normal range of AFI is 5 cm to 24 cm. Any value greater than 24 cm is considered as polyhydramnios and a value below 5 cm is oligohydramnios 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. Isolated Oligohydramnios (IO) refers to the presence of oligohydramnios without any fetal and maternal underlying conditions. Globally， IO incidence ranges from 0.5% to 5%通用删除6(英):<u>[5，6]</u>.\n\n【4】Oligohydramnios has been associated with a variety of adverse perinatal outcomes prospective study conducted among 180 pregnant women at 37 to 40 weeks of gestation with IO with an AFI ≤5h percentile associated with low Apgar score and cesarean delivery 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. Likewise， study conducted among 3，050 women showed oligohydramnios carries an increased risk of adverse perinatal outcome， even in low-risk pregnancies after 40 weeks 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>. Moreover， study conducted on oligohydramnios at or beyond 34 weeks gestation was showed antepartum oligohydramnios is associated with increased perinatal morbidity and mortality 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>. A meta-analysis of studies showed an antepartum or intrapartum amniotic fluid index of less than or equal 5.0 cm is significantly increased risk of cesarean delivery for fetal distress and a low Apgar score at 5 min 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>. Similarly， studies revealed， perinatal death， non-reassuring fetal status， meconium-stained fluid， need for resuscitation， admission to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU)， and risk of Operative Vaginal Deliveries (OVD)通用删除6(英):<u>[11，12]</u>.\n\n【5】However， recent studies showed IO is not associated with fetal growth restriction or an increased risk of adverse perinatal outcomes 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>. Adverse perinatal outcomes were associated with IO due to the higher rates of obstetrical interventions 通用删除6(英):<u>[14，15]</u>. Additionally， a five retrospective cohort study isolated oligohydramnios showed at term by itself is not associated with increased obstetrical morbidity 通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>.\n\n【6】In contemporary obstetrics， termination is a recommended intervention for term pregnancy complicated with oligohydramnios通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>. The time of intervention for IO complicated pregnancy remained controversial. However， clinicians are managing IO as they do for oligohydramnios at term 通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u>. This approach leads to unnecessary obstetric intervention without a benefit 通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u>. Besides， some studies suggested that AFI is not a good predictor of perinatal outcome alone in the case of IO 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>. Hence， routine intervention for oligohydramnios at term may not be justified 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>.\n\n【7】Findings about the effect of IO on obstetric and perinatal outcomes are inconclusive. Updated evidence on the effect of this condition on adverse outcomes will help health care providers to improve clinical interventions. This narrative review was designed to compare perinatal outcomes related to IO in low-risk singleton pregnancies and normal amniotic fluid volume.\n\n【8】Literature Search\n\n【9】Studies for this review were obtained from Pub Med， CINAHL， Web of Science， EMBASE， and Medline databases from inception to 2022 published the English language. The following keywords/MeSH terms were used for searching. Amniotic fluid， pregnancy， amniotic fluid index， perinatal outcome， obstetrics outcome， fetal outcome，neonatal outcome， isolated oligohydramnios， induction of labor， cesarean delivery， operative vaginal delivery， mode of delivery， instrumental delivery， Apgar score， non-reassuring fetal status， meconium stained amniotic fluid， meconium aspiration syndrome， perinatal morbidity， perinatal mortality， admission to neonatal intensive care unit， neonatal resuscitation， umbilical artery PH， and fetal weight. The bulian words (AND/OR) were used to combine the aforementioned keywords. Also， the search strategy has been complemented by checking the reference lists of the retrieved articles for additional articles.\n\n【10】Study Selection\n\n【11】We included observational studies (cohort and case-control) and meta-analysis. Inclusion criteria for this review were articles with a singleton pregnancy， cephalic presentation and define Amniotic Fluid Index (AFI) ≤ 5 cm， and outcomes compared with/without a control group (pregnancies with normal amniotic fluid volume). Exclusion criteria were studies that included pregnancies with fetal malformation， chromosomalanomaly or growth restriction and other obstetric complications. In addition， we excluded studies that did not clearly define the timeframe between measurements of the amniotic fluid index. Letters of personal communications， case reports， case series， and non-English language articles were also excluded.\n\n【12】The initial database search returned a total of 557 articles and 8meta-analysis review articles were retained for the narrative review. After the initial electronic database search， 7 additional relevant articles were identified through manual reference and Google searches. Though， this review is synthesized from 35 sources . A summary table is presented with study year， study design， sample size， key points， and limitation for the studies include in the review .\n\n【13】Findings\n\n【14】Isolated oligohydramnios and antepartum feta surveillance\n\n【15】Antepartum fetal surveillance is one of the indicators for fetal well-being in utero. IO was associated with an increased risk of删除1换行abnormal Doppler indices of the umbilical artery， non-reactive for Cardio Topography (CTG) and a non-stress test 通用删除6(英):<u>[7，20]</u>. Similarly， a prospective matched case-control study revealed deceleration of fetal heart rate was significantly associated with IO 通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u>. Furthermore， a review of meta-analysis indicated， when oligohydramnios cases were followed using fetal electronic monitoring during labor abnormal findings were detected. For this reason， obstetric interventions were high 通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u>.\n\n【16】Isolated oligohydramnios and maternal outcomes\n\n【17】Isolated oligohydramnios and induction of labor： According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG)， diagnosis of oligohydramnios after 37 weeks is an indication for labor induction 通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u>. Two prospective cohort studies aimed to evaluate perinatal outcomes in women with IO， depicted a risk of induction Wassignificantly highfor isolated1oligohydramnios通用删除6(英):<u>[23，24</u>. Correspondingly， a prospective case-control study over a period of 21 months from November 2014 to July 2016 was conducted on50 pregnant women complicated with complicated with IO. The result showed increased rate of induction of labor among women complicated with IO 通用删除6(英):<u>[25]</u>.\n\n【18】Furthermore， a retrospective cohort study (IO=987 & normal AFI=22，280) to analyzed the obstetric and perinatal outcome on IO showed higher labor induction among pregnancies complicated with IO 通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>. Also， IO was associated with significantly higher rates of labor induction as compared to pregnancies of normal amniotic fluid volume for fetal/maternal indications 通用删除6(英):<u>[21，26]</u>. These findings strengthen by a systemic review and meta-analysis study； in the twelve studies were included with 35，999 women： 2，414(6.7%) with isolated oligohydramnios and 33，585 (93.29%) with normal AFI. Women with isolated oligohydramnios had significantly higher rates of labor induction (OR=7.56， CI： 4.58，12.48)通用删除6(英):<u>[27]</u>.\n\n【19】Retrospective matched case-control study (IO=206， normal AFI=206) showed IO has no significant association with failure to the progress of labor or failed induction 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. A retrospective case-control study conducted on 138 women with uncomplicated oligohydramnios (IO) at term (AFI ≤ 5 cm) and a low Bishop score(≤ 6) compared with 67 women at 42 weeks’ gestation underwent induction oflabor showed insignificant difference between the group in induction progress 通用删除6(英):<u>[26]</u>. Similarly， Rainford and Manzanares et al. were reported there were no differences between the two groups in progress of induction of labor 通用删除6(英):<u>[15，28]</u>. In contrast to these findings， one study reported significantly higher rates of failed induction among preterm gestations presented with IO 通用删除6(英):<u>[29]</u>. The possible difference might arise from the study included only preterm pregnancy. Moreover， a single study conducted on women with IO required the use of drugs to manage tachysystole/hyperstimulation通用删除6(英):<u>[30]</u>. Further longitudinal study is needed to accept for the impact. However， study conducted on there was no difference in duration of labor， need for oxytocin， and augmentation between women with IO and normal amniotic fluid index 通用删除6(英):<u>[7，31]</u>.\n\n【20】Isolated oligohydramnios and mode of delivery： A meta-analysis showed a higher incidence of obstetric interventions in the IO group (89/657；13.5%) compared with the control group(165/3306；5.0%) 通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u>. Moreover， pregnancies complicated with IO showed a statistically significant association with operative vaginal delivery 通用删除6(英):<u>[15，16]</u>. However， a small Randomized Controlled Trial(RCT) showed there were no significant difference in assisted vaginal deliveries 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>. The difference might be due to the small sample size删除表格换行in the RCT. Additionally， IO has no significant effect on instrumental delivery for the indication of NRFHBP (Non-Reassuring Fetal Heartbeat Pattern)通用删除6(英):<u>[28，32]</u>.\n\n【21】Table 1： Summary of studies on adverse abstetric and perinatal outcomes.\n\n| Author and year  | Design and sample size  | Key points  | Limitation  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fatima Chaudhry etal.2020  | Randomized Control Trial O=72 lO (expectant management)=72  | IO is not associated with a low Apgar score or MSAF.  | Used Chai square test and smallsample size.  |\n| Musthaq et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u>  | Prospective cohort O=70 Normal AF=140  | IO didn't show any statically significant difference in perinataloutcome.  | Used Chai square test.  |\n| Nefise Nazli et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[31]</u>  | Prospective case-controlO=159 Normal AF=165  | Io is not associated with a higher rate of cesarean section.  | Used Chai square test and inclusion ofpost-term pregnancy for comparison.  |\n| Samata Gupta et al.2018  | Retrospective case controlO=51 Normal AF=176  | IO is not an indicator of adverse perinatal outcome.  | Used Chai square test (it showedweak association).  |\n| Neeta Sarma 通用删除6(英):<u>[38]</u>  | Prospective case-controlD=100 Normal AF=300  | IO adversely affects the perinatal outcome.

Similarly， a prospective cohort study was carried out in women with isolated oligohydramnios(n=70) and normal pregnancy (n=140))were included. The finding revealed significant number of IO women have undergone emergency caesarian section (X=12.98，p=0.003) 通用删除6(英):<u>[29]</u>. In addition， numerous findings of prospective， retrospective and case control studies depicted women with IO had a higher rate of cesarean delivery compared to women of normal amniotic fluid 通用删除6(英):<u>[15-17，21，24-26，33-39]</u>. These finding supported by pioneer meta-analysis study which includes eighteen reports (10，551 women) showed， women with IO were associated with a significantly increased risk of cesarean delivery 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>. Likewise， the recent meta-analysis which includes six studies (27，526 women)； women with isolated oligohydramnios were significantly higher rates of Cesarean delivery (RR： 2.16；95% CI； 1.64-2.85)通用删除6(英):<u>[40]</u>. However， study conducted on 87 women pregnant beyond40 completed weeks showed no significant effect of IO on the risks of CD 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>.Moreover， a prospective matched case-control (matched for gestational age and Bishop-score) study conducted on women with IO 120， and normal AFI=116， women with isolated oligohydramnios were not significantly different to the control group 通用删除6(英):<u>[30]</u>. Similarly， Convey and Ghosh et al. studies showed no difference between the groups in the rate of CD for fetal distress 通用删除6(英):<u>[14，41]</u>. The difference might be due to the inclusion of high-risk pregnancies in the control group 通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u> and inclusion of preeclamptic women in control group and analysis of small sample size (IO=49 Normal AFI=284) 通用删除6(英):<u>[41]</u>.\n\n【26】In addition to meta-analysis discussed above and multiple longitudinal studies indicated， cesarean deliveries specifically for the reason of NRFHRP/fetal distress were significantly lower in women with normal amniotic fluid than IO 通用删除6(英):<u>[7，15，16，19，23，25，27，31，38，40]</u>. A finding from a prospective cohort study conducted in Pakistan revealed that the risk of CD was increased by 3-folds among women with isolated oligohydramnios under the induction of labor 通用删除6(英):<u>[33]</u>. Nevertheless， statistically significant association was not reported in these studies 通用删除6(英):<u>[14，21，42]</u>. The difference might be inclusion of high-risk pregnancies， showing weak association and inclusion high blood pressure pregnant women in the studies respectively.\n\n【27】Additionally， a large retrospective cohort study conducted on 987pregnancies complicated by isolated oligohydramnios and to 22，280low-risk pregnancies with normal AFI. The showed intrapartum cesarean delivery due to NRFHRP and dystocia was significantly associated with IO. However， after controlling potential confounders like parity and induction of labor the risk of CD in IO was similar to their counterparts 通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>. This finding may be supported by a higher rate of CD in IO which might partially attributable to obstetricians’删除1换行practice choices 通用删除6(英):<u>[43]</u>.\n\n【28】A retrospective cohort study exclusively conducted on IO complicated pregnancies showed that rate of CD in early term and late-term pregnancies were high compared to full-term pregnancies. However， there is no significant difference between the early period(37.8%) and the late period (35.3%). Also， there was no significant difference in induction of labor in term pregnancy classifications通用删除6(英):<u>[44]</u>. Therefore， to conclude the cause for cesarean delivery directly related with IO or other possible risk factors， it needs further RCT studies with controlling potential confounders.\n\n【29】Neonatal and perinatal outcomes\n\n【30】Isolated oligohydramnios and Apgar score： Apgar score can be used for rapid assessment of newborn well-being and it has five components： appearance， pulse rate， respiration， reflex irritability， and muscle tone.

Although low fifth minute Apgar score is associated with long-term severe neurologic sequels 通用删除6(英):<u>[46-481， </u>many studies in the literature showed an absence of association between IO and fifth minute Apgar score 14，15，17，20，21，23-26，28，32-37，39，41-43，49，50.\n\n【31】Similarly， a prospective case control study conducted on 80women with isolated oligohydramnios and these were compared with 320 with normal AFI. The finding showed there is no difference between the cases and controls as regards of fifth minute Apgar score通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>. Matched case-control study conducted on IO=120， Normal AFI=116 also revealed the same finding 通用删除6(英):<u>[30]</u>. This evidence supported by with large retrospective cohort (IO=987 Normal AFI=22，280) study conducted by Ashwal et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>. In addition， meta-analysis of four articles which includes 3，943 pregnant women (IO=679(17.2%)， Normal AFI=3264(82.8%)has the same result 通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u>.\n\n【32】Correspondingly， a large retrospective cohort study conducted on after induction of labor women with normal AFI and induced labor because of IO had no significant effect on the first minute Apgar score less than four 通用删除6(英):<u>[32]</u>. Additionally， retrospective matched case-control study conducted on women with IO=206， and Normal AFI=206showed no significant difference in first minute Apgar score between the groups 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>. Those findings is also supported by a comparative study among women with IO and normal amniotic fluid after 41weeks of pregnancy 通用删除6(英):<u>[31]</u>. Similarly， findings from two studies were revealed isolated oligohydramnios is not associated with low first minute Apgar score 通用删除6(英):<u>[17，251</u>. Furthermore， a small RCT conducted among actively and expectantly managed women with IO revealed no significant difference on first， fifth-， and tenth-minute Apgar score通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>.\n\n【33】On the contrary， a meta-analysis indicated that IO was associated with low first and fifth minute Apgar scores. However， after they excluded studies with extreme values， IO had evidence of effect only删除1换行on the first minute Apgar score less than seven 通用删除6(英):<u>[27]</u>. Similar findings were reported from two meta-analyses 通用删除6(英):<u>[19，40]</u>. A meta-analysis on IO published by Chauhan et al. showed antepartum and intrapartum oligohydramnios were associated with low fifth minute Apgar score， which might be because of the inclusion of high-risk pregnancies in the analysis 通用删除6(英):<u>[26]</u>.\n\n【34】Isolated oligohydramnios and non-reassuring fetal heartbeat pattern/fetal distress & umbilical artery acidosis Case-control and retrospective cohort studies showed Io had an association with NRFHBP 通用删除6(英):<u>[15，23]</u>. NRFHBP and the first minute Apgar score have poor sensitivity for fetal status and outcome， cord pH is a direct measure of the fetal oxygenation status 通用删除6(英):<u>[51]</u>. Also， many published works including meta-analyses explicitly showed no relationship between IO and NRFHBP， fetal distress and umbilical artery/vein less than 7.1/7.213-16，21，26，27，32，35，41，42.\n\n【35】Isolated oligohydramnios and meconium-stained amniotic fluid： Meconium-stained amniotic fluid during the intrapartum period is an indicator of fetal distress. Most recent studies suggest that an association exists between IO and MSAF通用删除6(英):<u>[19，21，23，24，28，29，31，32，39，40，52-54]</u>. In contrast， other studies concluded IO had no effect on MSAF通用删除6(英):<u>[14-16，19，27，34，36，40，42，49，50]</u>. However， the association of MSAF and IO was gestational age-dependent 通用删除6(英):<u>[13，55]</u>. A meta-analysis 通用删除6(英):<u>[40]</u> showed no difference in the rate of meconium-stained amniotic fluid and IO. However， it increased the risk of meconium aspiration syndrome (RR： 2.83， CI1.41-5.70). Conclusive evidence is needed on the association of MSAF with meconium aspiration syndrome and poor neonatal outcomes， and status of meconium (thick or thin). Moreover， the inclusion of different indicators of fetal compromise along with MSAF is important通用删除6(英):<u> 56]</u>.\n\n【36】Isolated oligohydramnios and admission to neonatal intensive care unit： Many prospective/retrospective cohort， case-control and meta-analysis studies showed IO has no significant effect on NICU admissions通用删除6(英):<u>[13，15，16，19-21，23，24，26，31-33，35，36，54]</u>. However， a meta-analysis and some epidemiologic studies revealed IO has a significant effect on admission to NICU 通用删除6(英):<u>[7，27，37，38，40，57]</u>. The observed difference might be due to the inclusion of preterm and intrauterine growth restriction neonates in the studies 通用删除6(英):<u>[40，54]</u>. For conclusive results， a large RCT is important.\n\n【37】Isolated oligohydramnios and neonatal morbidity/mortality：IO has no association with the following outcomes： immediate cry， hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy， need for neonatal resuscitation and phototherapy， transit tachypnea of the newborn， hypoglycemia， sepsis， seizure， hypothermia， meconium aspiration syndrome， jaundice， intubation， and stillbirth 通用删除6(英):<u>[16，38]</u>. Similarly， IO showed an absence of significant association with composite adverse neonatal outcomes (cesarean/operative vaginal delivery due to NRFHRP， low Apgar score， umbilical artery pH<7.10， neonatal intensive care admission， meconium aspiration syndrome， and intubation or hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy) 通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>. Moreover， IO did not show differences in perinatal mortality or morbidity compared to normal amniotic fluid volume 通用删除6(英):<u>[17，19]</u>. However， a study conducted in Nepal evidenced an association between early neonatal death and IO 通用删除6(英):<u>[37]</u>.\n\n【38】Isolated oligohydramnios and birth weight： Neonatal/fetal weight indicates fetal wellbeing in the uterus. Comparison studies showed there was no difference in birth weight less than 2000/2500gramsbetween门pregnancies complicated bby IOand normal删除1换行amniotic fluid volume 通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u>. Neonates born to mothers with isolated oligohydramnios had a higher risk of low birth weight compared with normal amniotic fluid volume. However， their weight difference had no clinical significance通用删除6(英):<u>[16，25，26，29，31-33，35，37，42，49]</u>. Furthermore， a similar finding was observed from a meta-analysis study 通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u>.\n\n【39】Conclusion\n\n【40】Studies show that IO increases the rate of induction. Moreover， a lot of findings depicted woman with IO had a higher rate of cesarean delivery compared to a woman with normal amniotic fluid. More than 20 studies including meta-analyses reported low first， fifth， and tenth-minute agar score has no relation with IO. Similarly， this narrative review revealed that a relationship doesn’t exist between IO and NRFHBP， fetal distress and umbilical artery/vein less than7.1/7.2. Moreover，IO didn'tshow differences in perinatal mortality or morbidity compared to normal amniotic fluid volume. Even though the weight difference had no clinical significance， neonates born from mothers with isolated oligohydramnios had a higher risk of low birth weight compared with their counterparts. Furthermore， the impact of IO on MSAF and neonatal intensive care unit was inconclusive across the results. For decisive evidence large RCT and inclusion of different indicators of fetal compromise along with MSAF is important.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

The reduction oflearning load through instruction is accurate because it must revalue knowledge based on meaningful experience， where the student develops attitude and skill. Where multiple analyses can be generated with respect to what is presented in the clinical case. In other words， between the teacher and the student， educational action is developed through experience translated into the assimilation of knowledge. The exercise carried out by an undergraduate student through the clinical case brings them closer to reality and prepares them to deal with problems through their competences.\n\n【18】Case Presentation\n\n【19】Male patient aged 21 years， ASA II， with no personal history of morbidities， no surgical history， with a family history of morbid hypertension. A moderate smoker， he came for assessment due to spontaneous consultation， with the reason for consultation \"I have a tooth on the side of my teeth， at the bottom\". Data collected： The last visit to the dentist was in 2019 for extraction of a supernumerary tooth without complications. The patient had poor dental hygiene， with an unspecified brushing technique， no flossing， a diet high in carbohydrates， sugars and soft drinks.\n\n【20】With regard to the dental history， we can highlight the extraction of another supernumerary tooth at tooth level 4.4 on the lingual side， bleeding on brushing and bruxism.\n\n【21】Within the segmental examination， a variation in the trajectory of mandibular movement was observed， with corrected deviation to the right and a unilateral left click noise， without pain on palpation or movement. As for lymph node palpation， only the submandibular nodes were palpable， unilateraly， on the right side， less than 1 cm， with a soft， mobile consistency and the presence of discomfort to the touch. The rest of the nodes were not palpable.\n\n【22】With regard to the dental anomaly of the patient， who presented a rudimentary paramolar supernumerary tooth； of a smaller size， molariform and located in the mandibular region， on the lingual side in the area of the premolar teeth， we can highlight the importance and responsibility we have as dentists to recognize and detect pathologies in our patients. This is one of the many examples of how elementary training is， in order to achieve correct care and good dental practice.\n\n【23】Intraoral examination\n\n【24】Lips unaltered， mucosa of the alveolar ridge， the rudimentary supernumerary tooth is located between teeth 3.4 and 3.5. The gingiva删除1换行is reddish in color， rounded margino-papillary shape， smooth， shiny and dotted surface， orange peel in some areas. It is mostly positioned on the LAC， with an enlarged， thick biotype and gingival recession from canine to lower canine .\n\n【25】Radiographic interpretation： Coronal slices every 1 mm 100um thick and axial slices every 1 mm 100 um thick at 1：1 scale are observed .\n\n【26】P.21： Erupted， rotated， in a straight position， towards vestibular， with root bifurcation of the middle third of the root towards apical. Normal periapical.\n\n【27】On the lingual side， presence of a supernumerary， rudimentary， erupted tooth under the occlusal plane. With straight root， in intimate relation with the numerary piece without generating rhizolysis， presents a single straight， conoid root.\n\n【28】P.27 and28：Erupted，P.28 slightly rotated，rootstraight，periapical normal. Immediate tooth to vestibular table. Note the presence of a rudimentary supernumerary piece on the lingual side， in intraosseous development， with apical third in formation. Normal pericoronal sac. Note the slight lingual root exorizalisis of P28 associated with malposition of the supernumerary tooth (axial sections 8 and 9 and coronal section 10).\n\n【29】Diagnosis by levels\n\n【30】Systemic： Male patient， 21 years of age， ASA II， smoker of 5tobacco cigarettes and marijuana a week， presenting periodontal disease in the lower and upper arches.\n\n【31】Skeletal/Dentomaxillary anomalies： Class I， on the inner side of the mandible at the level of the left premolars there is a rudimentary supernumerary tooth.\n\nMusculo-articular TMJ： Corrected deviation to the right with|删除段之间换行|Lymph nodes： Mandibular lymph nodes： Palpable， right unilateral， less than 1 cm， soft， mobile and tender to the touch.

CT scan is the best diagnostic option： On tomography， myelipomas are well-defined and encapsulated lesions oflow-density tissue (less than 30 HU， as mature fat tissue)； on NRM the neoplasia has an high signal intensity on T1-weighted images 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，8]</u>. Extra-renal angiomyolipoma， retroperitoneal lipoma， liposarcoma or leiomyosarcoma must be considered for differential diagnoses 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>.

The virus can cause severe respiratory problems and affects the lungs. Timely precautions and accurate diagnosis is necessary to contain the spread of the virus. Diagnosis of COVID-19 was often misdiagnosed as Pneumonia and Tuberculosis(TB) in some cases. Accurate diagnosis is as important as timely diagnosis of this virus. For this purpose， multiple Machine Learning (ML) Deep Learning (DL)， and Transfer Learning (TL) based approaches have been used.

Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) which causes severe acute respiratory syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u> is to blame for the coronavirus pandemic. After initially starting in Wuhan， China， the virus later spread to every nation in the world 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>.\n\n【5】The person who has the coronavirus can distribute it to others by coughing or sneezing respiratory droplets. These droplets have the potential to contaminate the surfaces， even more， speeding up the spread. People with the coronavirus may experience respiratory conditions ranging from minor to serious that may call for ventilation support 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. When the COVID-19 pandemic hit the world， the first task which had to be tackled was the detection of the disease in its early stages so patients will be quarantined and the spread will be controlled.\n\n【6】At first， COVID was diagnosed using nasal swabs and Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR)， but these methods had high false positive rates and were slow 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>.\n\n【7】The researchers claimed that by using image processing and AI techniques， the process of detecting COVID-19 can be made faster and more accurate 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. As all these diseases i.e. pneumonia， TB， and COVID-19 damaged a similar part of the lungs 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. This became an issue as it caused misdiagnosis， which furtherlead to wrongtreatment. The researchers used ML and DL to accurately classify COVID-19 from other lung diseases. For this purpose， chest X-rays and CT scan images were used. After this Transfer Learning 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u> is used to get results more accurately and on time.\n\n【8】In this study， different Transfer learning models for classifying COVID-19 are discussed.\n\n【9】Transfer Learning\n\n【10】A transfer learning model takes parts of a trained machine learning model and applies them to a new， but similar， problem.

Transfer learning is employed in this study to identify some useful characteristics derived from a large amount of source data collected under one working condition， and then transfer these characteristics to a target task under a different working condition with only a limited amount of target data 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>.\n\n【12】Sum mary of Methodologies based on Image Type\n\n【13】Dataset description\n\n【14】The datasets were taken from public resources mostly from Kaggle and GitHub. Datasets taken contained CCOVID-19-positive Pneumonia，TB，and healthy images. In terms of radiological images， X-ray and chest CT scan images were used.\n\n【15】Models and methods\n\n【16】Authors in consideration have used transfer learning either as they were with increasing or decreasing layers， by an ensemble of two or more models， or in image preprocessing step by applying algorithms and filters.\n\n【17】Authors in 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u> focused on feature extraction， dimension reduction， and classification of diseases using X-ray images. For feature extraction， authors ensemble deep Convolutional Neural Network CNN using Xception and InceptionResnetV2. The extracted features were then passed from a custom-made sparse autoencoder for reducing dimensionality and then Feed Forward Neural Network(FFNN) was used for classification. But a huge range of parameter values of sparse autoencoder was not experimented with and was neglected during the creation ofthe model.\n\n【18】Authors in 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u> applied a modified lightweight CNN model for purpose of classification. The proposed CNN model contained four 2D convolutional layers and one fully connected layer with a MaxPooling 2D layer. The dropout regularization technique was also applied after each layer. A three-step process was proposed by 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>. The first step was segmentation which was done using C-GAN. The second step was feature extraction for which multiple deep transfer learning models and algorithms were used and the last step was classification which was done by machine learning classifiers. Final comparisons showed that VGG19 combined with Binary Robust Invariant Scalable Key-points (BRISK) algorithm 通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u> showed the highest accuracy.\n\n【19】Authors in 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u> have used cGAN to generate images and these images were fed to CNN models (ResNet-50 通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>， ResNet-101通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>， Xception， DenseNet-201 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>，DenseNet-169通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>). SoftMax classifier was used in these models to classify images. This model is used to overcome data imbalances and overfitting. CNN models when using images without cGAN produced average testing accuracy of 90.71%， and when the images were generated with the help of cGAN， the testing accuracy of 92.17%.ResNet-50 通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u> showed the best accuracy among these all. Though the dataset was still limited in this study the classes of COVID from different stages were taken which was a remarkable attempt in the said matter.\n\n【20】CNN-based model namely，CovFrameNet， is proposed by authors in 通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u>. SoftMax layer was used for classification purposes and deep learning regularization techniques were applied to avoid overfitting. In 通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u>， ResNet-101 通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u> is used as the backbone architecture. The weights of the image were extracted from the last layer of the architecture， and an average of these weights was calculated. That average weight was then used to generate a heatmap.\n\n【21】Authors have proposed an algorithm with a CNN model to increase the accuracy of COVID detection. A public dataset of CT images was used out of which 120 images were taken this study focuses on detecting Ground Glass Opacities from the CT images通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u>.\n\n【22】To increase the detection accuracy authors 通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u> have designed a lightweight CNN model，D2-CovidNet，by proposing feature-sensitive modules called Dual-Path Multiscale (DPM) feature fusion modules and Dense Depth-wise Separable (DDS) convolution modules as these have strong characterization capabilities and efficient computing abilities. In 通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u>，authors have proposed an algorithm was proposed to classify COVID-19 accurately. Different pre-trained CNN models(SeresNext50，SeresNext101) along with Sparrow Search Algorithms(SpaSA) were used. Out of these models， MobileNetV3Large showed the best results. Similarly， in 通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u>， the author has used Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)， Zeiler and Fergus Network (ZFNet) 通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u>， and Dense ConyolutionalNetwork-121 (DenseNet-121 1 17D architectures of deep convolutional neural network models to provide an accurate diagnosis of COVID-19 on binary classification. Out of these， customized CNN showed the best performance.\n\n【23】In 通用删除6(英):<u>[25]</u>， Ensemble learning was used to ensemble the transfer learning models i.e.， EfficientNet， GoogLeNet， and XceptionNet. Which performed classification among taken images. Whereas， authors ensembled DenseNet-121 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u> and Resnet-50 通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u> based on their orthogonal features and created and trained a deep learning network named DenResCov-19 in 通用删除6(英):<u>[26]</u>. DenResCov-19 network is a concatenation of four blocks from ResNet-50通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u> and DenseNet-121通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u> with width， height， and frames of 58×58×256， 28×28×512，14x14x1024， and 7x7×2048， respectively. A model was created in通用删除6(英):<u>[27]</u> created by the assembly of DenseNet， h5， and the Inception model. And results were demonstrated based on weights.\n\n【24】The authors have created a model named DeQueezeNet by ensemble DenseNet-121 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u> and SqueezeNet1.0 to increase the COVID-19 prediction efficiency by extracting various important features 通用删除6(英):<u>[28]</u>. In 通用删除6(英):<u>[29]</u>， ResNet-50 通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u> with 5 folds and 10 folds cross-validation to recognize COVID-19 is being used.\n\n【25】Three models i.e.， Inception V3， ResNet34，and DenseNet-201 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u> are being used in 通用删除6(英):<u>[30]</u> and they were ensemble to detect COVID-19more accurately using a bagging ensemble， called ET-NET.\n\n【26】Authors in 通用删除6(英):<u>[31]</u> have combined DenseNet and Optimization of Transfer Learning Setting (OTLS) strategy to make the diagnosis of COVID more accurate. A Composite Learning Factor (CLF) was put to work to assign learning factors t different layers. It was observed that “201-IV”achieved better performance by using the proposed OTLS strategy.\n\n【27】In 通用删除6(英):<u>[32]</u>， the authors used a pre-trained transfer learning-based framework on the CheXnet model， which is trained in DenseNet-121通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>. In 通用删除6(英):<u>[33]</u>， authors have ensemble three models named DCCNs， ResNet152V2，and VGG16 to tackle the sensitivity issue.\n\n【28】Authors in 通用删除6(英):<u>[34]</u> have fine-tuned existing pre-trained deep learning models such as VGG16，VGG19， Inception V3， ResNet-50通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>， ResNet50V2， InceptionResNetV2， Xception， and MobileNet on CT images and then these models were used to create a strong ensemble classifier that makes the further decision. Models were further divided into 5clf and 8clf. The results of 5clf showed better results than that of 8clf.\n\n【29】Authors in 通用删除6(英):<u>[35]</u> have focused on feature extraction from R， G，and B areas of CT images using Empirical Wavelet Transformation. Then DenseNet 121 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u> is used to classify these images based on COVID-19and non-COVID. A classifier fusion strategy is proposed in 通用删除6(英):<u>[36]</u> that fuses the predictions from the different classifiers via majority voting.\n\n【30】Apart from that authors have used pertained variants of the ResNet model to detect COVID with more accuracy. The results showed that ResNet-50 has outperformed other variants with a recall of 98.80%.\n\n【31】Limitations and Future Work\n\n【32】From this brief study following drawbacks have been found along删除1换行with suggestions to improve them：\n\n【33】Overfitting is the common one seen which can be avoided删除1换行by more regularization techniques.\n\n【34】Though models showed good accuracy there was no balance删除1换行between accuracy and speed.\n\n【35】Mostly the validation of the models is for only binary删除1换行classification and three-class classification tasks\n\n【36】Models should be validated in one specific coherent.\n\n【37】The major drawback of detecting COVID with ML techniques is the unavailability of public datasets.

The lung diseases in observation were Pneumonia and TB. Many models were used like CNN， Resnet， DenseNet， Xception， GoogleNet， VGG， and Alexnet. Lesser dataset caused overfitting and noisy images in the dataset resulted in lower accuracy. To remove noise and overcome overfitting image preprocessing techniques including data augmentation and cGAN were used. Ensemble learning and algorithms during different phases of the model are being used to boost classification accuracy. Models pretrained on ImageNet datasets were also considered to extract better results. In 2 class classification， MobileNet V3 showed better results， whereas， in 4 class classification with a larger dataset， ensemble learning has been proved to be better than other techniques with an average accuracy of more than 95%. It is concluded from the study that even though there is a lot of work done in this field. There still are drawbacks that can be improved by using different models and better approaches.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

Cultures of his prostatic and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid grew Coccidioides immitis， and serum Coccidioides serology by immunodiffusion were positive for IgM and IgG， confirming disseminated coccidioidomycosis.\n\n【3】Conclusion： Disseminated Coccidioidomycosis should be on the differentials on patients who presents with dysuria in endemic area.\n\n【4】Introduction\n\n【5】Coccidioidomycosis， a dimorphic fungal infection that presents classically as a pulmonary illness， is caused by either Coccidioides immitis or Coccidioides posadasii， and is endemic to areas particularly in the southwestern United States. The organism’s spores are typically transmitted via inhalation and have shown an increase in the annual rate of infection， from a rate of 5.3 per100，000 in 1998 to a rate of 42.6 per 100，000 in 2011， in endemic areas 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Approximately 1%of patients who are infected， develop disseminated coccidioidomycosis， with the most common extrapulmonary sites being skin， bones， central nervous system， and soft tissue 通用删除6(英):<u>[2-4]</u>. Even more rare is the presentation of symptomatic genital tract infections and prostatitis as a manifestation of disseminated coccidioidomycosis. In fact， there have only been 18 confirmed cases and 6 suspected cases， but only one known recorded case of prostate abscess due to disseminated coccidioidomycosis通用删除6(英):<u>[5，6]</u>. We present a rare case of disseminated coccidioidomycosis in a 60-year-old male with poorly controlled diabetes and Polycythemia Vera (PV) who presented with dysuria and suprapubic tenderness found to have a prostate abscess， splenic lesions and cavitary pneumonia.\n\n【6】Case Presentation\n\n【7】A 60-year-old man with a history of uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus (hemoglobin Alc12.5%) and myocardial ischemia， presented with a three-week history of suprapubic abdominal pain， dysuria， unintentional 25-lb weight loss， and left lower leg numbness and weakness. He is a truck driver in Southern California delivering goods to construction sites. On admission， he was tachycardic with heart rate of 108 beats per minute and physical exam was notable for suprapubic tenderness. Laboratory workup was significant for leukocytosis of 16.44 bil/L (normal range 4.80bil/L to 11.80 bil/L)， urinalysis positive for pyuria with moderate bacteriuria and glucose >500 mg/dL， and final cultures grew only mixed flora. Computed Tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis with and without contrast showed a complex multiloculated 7.9 cm×8.1 cm× 10.4\n\n【8】In addition， during the admission， our patient had persistent polycythemia with hemoglobin ranging from 17.0 g/dL to 20.2 g/dL(normal range 10.5 g/dL to 15 g/dL) and hematocrit 48.7% to 63.8%(normal range 32% to 46%). On review ofhis medical records， a JAK exon 12 mutation had been identified one year prior， but he was lost to follow up and was yet to initiate any medical therapy. At a one-month outpatient hematology follow-up visit， the patient was started on hydroxyurea and aspirin based on a newly established diagnosis of PV.\n\n【9】In regards to the response to therapy by his disseminated coccidioidomycosis infection， he underwent repeat imaging at a nine-month follow up visit， which revealed complete resolution of the prostatic abscess  and significant reduction in size删除1换行of the pulmonary lesions . Considering the clinical and radiographic improvement， his fluconazole dose was reduced to 400mg daily. In addition， around the same time his hemoglobin was noted to be 13.8 g/dL and hematocrit 39.1%.\n\n【10】Discussion\n\n【11】This case represents a rare clinical entity of disseminated Coccidioides involving the genitourinary tract. Fewer than forty cases of Coccidioides involving the genitourinary tract have been identified in men， of which less than twenty involved the prostate 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. A retrospective review of 3，676 prostate pathology reports (from biopsy and surgery)， from two hospitals in areas endemic to C. immitis， found four cases of previously unrecognized Coccidioidal infection of the prostate， suggesting that the condition， though rare， may be underdiagnosed 通用删除6(英):<u>[5，6]</u>.\n\n【12】Due to its non-specific presentation， the diagnostic workup of genitourinary Coccidioides infection is challenging. Coccidioidal prostatitis may present with symptoms similar to that of acute bacterial prostatitis， with urinary obstruction and prostatic ten derness on exam 通用删除6(英):<u>[7，8]</u>. Urine cultures may be helpful in diagnosing prostatic involvement especially when done after performing a prostate massage to express prostatic fluid， and the yield is improved when using a fungal culture growth medium 通用删除6(英):<u>[7，9]</u>. However， fungal cultures of urine specimens are not routinely performed if fungal prostatitis is not suspected. In cases where clinical improvement is not seen within 48 h of medical therapy， further investigation with trans-rectal ultrasound or CT scan may be warranted 通用删除6(英):<u>[10，11]</u>.\n\n【13】While guidelines are lacking regarding prostatic abscess from coccidiomycosis， Abdelmoteleb et al. suggest that in cases where prostatic abscesses are larger than 1 cm or do not quickly resolve with antimicrobial therapy， drainage of the infected site should be considered， in order to prevent formation of fistulas to surrounding structures 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>. These samples shouldbe sent for fungal， mycobacterial， and bacterial cultures， and may assist in confirming the overarching diagnosis ofdisseminated coccidioidomycosis，particularlyinendemic areas. Guidelines by the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) for management of disseminated Coccidioidomycosis recommend treatment with amphotericin B until clinical stabilization followed by itraconazole or fluconazole， with adjunct surgical intervention in select cases-those with large abscesses， bony sequestration， instability of spine， or nerve impingement 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>.\n\n【14】Whileprimarypulmonary coccidioidomycosismay be asymptomaticin as many as 60% ofpatients， concern for disseminated coccidioidomycosis should be high inpatients with certain epidemiologic factors and/or risk factors (e.g.， immunocompromised state) 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>. Interestingly， both， disseminated coccidioidomycosis(~1% of coccidioidomycosis cases) and prostatic abscess (0.5% of urologic cases) are exceedingly rare 通用删除6(英):<u>[3，12]</u>. Those with HIV/AIDS off of antiretroviral therapy are especially at risk for prostatic abscesses and disseminated coccidioidomycosis 通用删除6(英):<u>[12，14]</u>. One study also showed patients with poorly controlled diabetes (average blood glucose>200 mg/dL) were more likely to develop disseminated Coccidioides infections with reduced response to treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>.\n\n【15】Moreover， a case series performed by Blair et al. showed that patients with hematologic malignancies including leukemia (27%)， lymphoma (27%)， multiple myeloma (13%)， myelodysplastic (4%)， or myeloproliferative disorders， which included agnogenic myeloid metaplasia and PV (9%) were at higher risk of dissemination. Fatality删除1换行from coccidiomycosis， while being disposed to such co-morbidities， was also noted to be much higher (50% when disseminated and 27%when pulmonary alone). However， it is possible that malignancy-associated morbidity and mortality from coccidiomycosis could have been exacerbated by chemotherapy or corticosteroids with associated immunosuppression 通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>. While untreated PV may progress to immunocompromising conditions such as myelofibrosis and acute leukemia， PV does not necessitate fungal prophylaxis according the NCCN guidelines， as there has not been a direct relationship with increased rates of fungal infections 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>.\n\n【16】It is suggested that cellular immunity plays a significant role in fighting acute coccidioidal infections and therefore， patients with dampened cellular immunity are more susceptible to coccidioidal infection， particularly with risk for dissemination 通用删除6(英):<u>[15，18]</u>. A retrospective review by Santelli et al.， concluded that individuals with diabetes were more likely to have cavitary lung disease and of those with diabetes， individuals with uncontrolled serum glucose concentrations were likely to have disseminated infection 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>. Diabetes has been shown to significantly weaken cellular immunity(delayed type sensitivity) reactions 通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u>. Prior publications have also reported increased occurrence of relapsed infection and increased difficulty in controlling disseminated coccidioidomycosis infection， in those with uncontrolled diabetes 通用删除6(英):<u>[20，21]</u>. While it is difficult to provide a direct correlation between uncontrolled diabetes and severity of coccidioidomycosis infection， tighter serum glucose control and frequent monitoring has been recommended to perhaps prevent complications of disseminated cocci. As for the underlying history of Polycythemia Vera， some studies have shown some correlation between myeloproliferative diseases and occurrence of Coccidioides infection perhaps compoundedby chemotherapy， which was not yet used in our patient 通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>.\n\n【17】Conclusion\n\n【18】Rates of coccidiomycosis disseminating to prostate and spleen with abscess formation is extremely rare. Our patient with poorly controlled diabetes may have suffered from resultant cellular immune dysfunction， increasing propensity to disseminated coccidiomycosis. In patients with poorly controlled diabetes in an endemic area， patients (namely men) who present with signs of urinary tract infection should be evaluated for possible fungal prostatitis and prostatic abscess. Our patient responded well to source control with drainage of the prostate. He was treated with broad spectrum anti-fungal in the acute setting and transitioned to long-term fluconazole， with remission of infection at 9-month follow-up. In order to prevent relapse， however， aggressive management of diabetes may be imperative in prevention of relapse. Finally， while PV may not have contributed to the initial infection， chemotherapy that may be used for treatment could increase risk of morbidity from disseminated coccidiomycosis， highlighting the importance of sufficient therapy.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

It is known that the presence of these agents inside the organism conditions dysfunctions in the nutritional balance， growth and the children's physical development； and more recently difficulties related with the learning capacity are notified. For fortune， these effects can be reverted by means of treatments simple and not very expensive drugs， among those that anti-parasites of wide spectrum is had had proven effectiveness and security. Is the above-mentioned， necessary above all to wonder why if today we are so well preparations to face these infections， are they still morbidity cause in so many places? In fact， the evidences point out to the chemotherapy like a quick measure of control； however， it is known that among the parasites， the atmosphere and the Hosta balance state exists. When parallelly to the chemotherapy anthelmintic they don't modify the environmental conditions and of human behavior， the prevalence and intensity of these infections they spread to return at very similar levels to those opposing ones before the treatment. It is so it is recognized that for the integral control of these infections it is required of a social focus.\n\n【14】The intestinal parasitism offers new challenges and its control offers an opportunity more for the action from the health and for the health of the scholars， view this last one as part， objective and condition of the necessary development of the towns. These infections are intimately related with attitudes， beliefs， behaviors and habits， in occasions， difficult to eradicate and that they depend on the culture that they have. It will be then useful to observe the epidemic situation， the quantity of resources and available support， at the time that one works from a focus that it involves to the community in fundamental interventions able to interrupt the cycle of transmission of these infections， such as the construction of latrines and readiness of water， among others. For the workers of the health， the prevention has always been a fundamental part of the work， but it should be recognized that the preventive work is not only task of the members of the team of health， it is also patrimony of the community and of all the sectors.\n\n【15】It is indispensable to carry out democratic alliances among the health sector and other sectors implied with the community， so that it feels grateful the right of this last one and their responsibility to participate and that at the same time they receive the support and the attention that it demands. In places where the population is particularly exposed to the parasitosis， it can be easy to find appropriate and desirous people of being involved in the control and they can work as useful resource in the interventions to carry out. In the communities， most of people consent in altering the behaviors that put in risk the personal and family health， but all change begins when they raise the level of information consistently. This way， it is important that this it arrives to all the hands of those who can use it efficiently that it stimulates people to assume the personal responsibility in the adoption of healthier lifestyles and that they facilitate the taking of decisions as regards health， at the same time that it induces to give up noxious behaviors for the health.

Histopathological examination confirmed the ultrasound findings.\n\n【12】Discussion\n\nDandy-Walker malformation is a term that includes several anomalies of brain development. This anomaly is a congenital brain malformation usually involving the fourth ventricle and the cerebellum which was first described in 1914 by Dandy and Blackfan and was referred to as|删除段之间换行|Dandy-Walker syndrome in 1954 by Benda， who also reported a familial origin 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. The prevalence of Dandy-Walker malformation is approximately 1：30，000 live births with a slight female preponderance as is the case for our patient and is responsible for 4% to 12% of infantile hydrocephalus 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>.\n\n【14】A bibliographic search on the \"PubMed\" and \"ScienceDirect\"platforms concerning the antenatal diagnosis of Dandy-Walker syndrome was carried out； three articles were found during the period of 2011-2022. The studies involved 8 cases in total.\n\n【15】The Dandy-Walker malformation is frequently associated with other intracranial abnormalities such as agenesis of the corpus callosum found in our case. Also， to belooked for： Holoprosencephaly， occipital encephalocele and ocular anomalies 通用删除6(英):<u>[7-9]</u>. Extra-cranial anomalies are also to be sought and are in order of frequency：\n\n【16】Cardiac anomalies (38%)， facial dysmorphisms and cleft palate (26%)， dysgraphia， poly- and syndactyly (28%)， genital malformations-urinary (28%) and digestive (7%)通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>.\n\n【17】Other less common abnormalities include limb abnormalities， abdominal wall abnormalities and diaphragmatic hernia which are extremely rare and found in our clinical case. Sexual ambiguities have also been described 通用删除6(英):<u>[10，11]</u>.\n\n【18】Postnatal studies indicate that the incidence of associated malformations is between 50% and 70% 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>. The most common etiology is genetic.\n\n【19】Environmental factors， infections， including viral (rubella，CMV)， alcohol and diabetes also seem to play a role in the pathogenesis of Dandy-Walker malformation but the scientific evidence remains uncertain. In our patient， there does not seem to be any infectious， environmental or genetic factors， especially since the karyotype is normal. In the absence of an obvious cause， the risk of recurrence in subsequent pregnancies is 1% to 5%通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>.\n\n【20】Prenatal ultrasound diagnosis of Dandy-Walker malformation is quite simple. However， it is important to differentiate with other posterior fossa anomalies such as mega cistern magna and retrocerebellar arachnoid cyst. For this， a set of ultrasound signs must be sought：\n\n【21】At the level of the Posterior Cerebral Fossa (PCF)\n\n【22】In the cavo-thalamo-cerebellar section： A cystic dilation of the V4 leading to widening of the FCP， anechoic， triangular with an external base. the cerebellar hemispheres， hypoechogenic， are pushed back laterally and anteriorly， more or less hypotrophic， symmetrically or not. The vermis， echogenic， is hypotrophic or even absent (25%).\n\n【23】In the sagittal section： The tentorium of the cerebellum is elevated； the vermis presents a more or less significant amputation of its lower part going as far as the complete absence of individualization. The lower part of the vermis can be extended towards the torcular by a linear image \"in the tail of a comet corresponding embryologically to the upper wall of the Blake pouch. The brainstem is normal.\n\n【24】On the supratentorial level\n\n【25】Anomalies are found in 70% of cases： Hydrocephalus (60%)， agenesis ofthe corpus callosum (15%)， migration anomalies， lipomas and interhemispheric cysts， encephalocele， holoprosencephaly 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>.\n\n【26】As for the MRI， it finds its place especially in case of diagnostic doubt with the other cystic malformations of the posterior fossa or if there is strong presumption of a form close to the Dandy-Walker malformation with vermian hypoplasia formerly called \"Dandy-Walker variant\".\n\n【27】It not only helps to refine the diagnosis initially screened by ultrasound， but it can also represent a useful imaging technique for confirming and characterizing the various cerebellar malformations thanks to the median sagittal sections of the posterior fossa. At an early stage (19 to 24 weeks of gestation)， it makes it possible to make the differential diagnosis between vermian malrotation and Dandy-Walker malformation by studying the biometry and morphology of all the structures involved 通用删除6(英):<u>[81</u>.\n\n【28】Even in the second and third trimester， an inappropriate scan angle， can give the impression of excessive size of the cistern magna (great cistern) and even a vermian abnormality 通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u>. The retrocerebellar arachnoid cyst is a less frequent and more benign删除1换行anomaly than the Dandy-Walker malformation， because in this case， the overlying brain is normal. The cerebellar hemispheres are not separated by a cystic mass. Rather，they are moved en bloc 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>.\n\n【29】As the congenital anomalies of the posterior fossa are numerous with an important anatomical nuance， a new ultrasound prenatal screening method was mentioned by an Italian-Polish team： It is the measurement of the angle of the Brainstem-Vermis (B-V) from17 weeks of amenorrhea on the median sagittal slice. In this series， normal fetuses have an angle always less than 18°. For the Blake pouch cyst， this angle is less than 30°， unlike fetuses with a Dandy-Walker malformation which present an angle (B-V) always greater than 45°. An intermediate value is noted for vermian hypoplasia 通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>.\n\n【30】Early detection at 14 WA has been reported by measuring the angle (B-V) making it possible to perform a trophoblastic biopsy in search of chromosomal abnormalities 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>.\n\n【31】Based on the available evidence， it is believed that prenatal ultrasound allows definitive diagnosis only of severe anatomical varieties of Dandy-Walker syndrome. These are characterized byboth a large cystic mass in the posterior fossa and agenesis of the cerebellar vermis， which is called the classic Dandy-Walker malformation 通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u>.\n\n【32】It is difficult to dispel doubt before birth about the presence of a mega-cistern magna or a small lower vermis anomaly. This can only be resolved by postnatal imaging studies (magnetic resonance imaging) or findings by fetal pathology study.\n\n【33】Conclusion\n\n【34】Dandy-Walker malformation is a rareand]heterogeneous malformation involving the cerebellar vermis. The first ultrasound clue to the diagnosis is an enlargement ofthe cistern magna. Fetal MRI allows a better characterization of this malformation. This pathology is associated with CNS malformations and other genetic diseases， which is why a study of the karyotype and molecular analyzes are suggested. Prenatal diagnosis of DWM cannot predict the prognosis of the disease， on the basis of which the medical team and the parents must make a decision， especially since there is no consensus in the literature.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

Careful and meticulous examination is crucial before embarking on any surgical interventions. Numerous differential diagnoses is possible for any neck mass and it differs between adult and pediatric patient. The final diagnosis will depend on the patient’s age， the location of the mass， the detail characteristic of the mass as well as the associated symptoms exhibited by the patients. We describe a case of suspicious of branchial cyst which turn out to be a recurrent thyroid tumor.\n\n【2】Keywords： Neck mass； Thyroid tumor； Branchial cyst\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Neck masses are frequently encountered by surgeons. They are subdivided into midline and lateral neck masses. Cystic neck lesion in adults has to be carefully evaluated to obtain accurate diagnosis and to offer the correct treatment. The commonest midline neck mass in adults is of thyroid gland origin. Thyroid masses are under the subdivision of lower midline neck masses. Examples of thyroid masses are solitary thyroid nodules， multinodular goitre and diffuse thyroid masses. Ultrasound is an excellent technique for imaging the thyroid gland. Solid and cystic lumps can be distinguished and nodules can be characterized with a high degree of accuracy 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>.\n\n【5】Branchial Cyst (BC) is one of the commonest examples oflateral cystic neck lesion. It appears as a developmental failure of the branchial apparatus. They often manifest in young adults with an incidence peak in the third decade. Few theories have been suggested to explain the origin of BC， such as the inclusion theory and the branchial apparatus theory. Inclusion theory postulates that BC is epithelial inclusions within a lymph node. This theory is supported by the fact that most BC has lymphoid tissue in their wall. Branchial apparatus theory suggests that branchial cysts represent the remains of pharyngeal pouches or branchial cysts or both and that cysts should be present at birth with peak incidence at the second to third decades 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. BC mostly， about 60% located in the upper third of the neck at the anterior margin of the Sternocleidomastoid (SCM) muscle. It is usually persistent and 70% are clinically cystic. Ultrasonography is the modality of choice in cysts 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>.\n\n【6】We would like to share our experience of managing a patient presented with left sided neck mass， clinically appeared as branchial cyst but further investigations and final histopathological result was ofthyroid nodular hyperplasia.\n\n【7】Case Presentation\n\n【8】A 33-year old， Malay lady with history thyroid surgery 20 years ago for multinodular goitre， presented to Otorhinolaryngology clinic in September 2017 with complaints of a left anterolateral neck swelling. The swelling is painless and gradually creasing in size for more than 14 years of duration. The patient was asymptomatic. She had no obstructive symptoms， voice changes， hypo or hyperthyroid symptoms or any constitutional symptoms.\n\n【9】Examination of neck revealed a huge left anterolateral cystic lesion， measuring about 15.0cm x 10.0 cm， extending superiorly to the lower border of the left mandible， inferiorly to just above the clavicle . Laterally， the mass extends up to the posterior border of the left sternocleidomastoid muscle and medially， it encroaching the midline. There was also surgical scar which most probably could be due to previous thyroidectomy scar. Nasal， ear， laryngeal， cranial nerves and other systemic examinations were unremarkable.\n\nThe patient was treated as having branchial cysts until the Fine Needle Aspiration and Cytology(FNAC) findings were reported as colloid nodule with cystic degeneration.Ultrasonography of neck|删除段之间换行|Subsequently， she underwent completion thyroidectomy in January 2018 which revealed a cystic mass overlying the carotid sheath . The mass was excised leaving the carotid sheath content intact . Her histopathological report was nodular hyperplasia of thyroid. Eight months postoperative，the patient is well with no complication and she was pleased with the surgery as her aesthetic has significantly improved.\n\n【11】Discussion\n\nThe aim of presenting this case is to show the diversity of the differential diagnosis of the neck mass in our patient. Initially with the location and examination of neck mass， a provisional diagnosis of branchial cyst was speculated but after further investigation like FNAC， ultrasonography and CT scan of the neck， the provisional diagnosis was directed towards multinodular goitre. The location of neck mass and imaging appearances gives surgeon the gross|删除段之间换行|A differential diagnosis of midline neck masses are numerous and includes subcutaneous lesions (epidermoid cysts， dermoid cysts， teratoid cysts and lipoma)， thyroglossal ducts cysts， lymph nodes and thyroid masses. Differential diagnosis for lateral neck masses on the other hand， is divided into skin and subcutaneous lesions (epidermoid cysts， dermoid cysts， teratoid cysts and lipoma)， developmental masses (lymphangiomas and branchial cysts)， lymph nodes (infectious， inflammatory and neoplastic)， neurogenic tumors(neurofibromas and schwannomas)， vascular tumors (carotid body tumors) and salivary glands.\n\n【13】In view of wide differential diagnoses， meticulous examination and complete work up is necessary in managing any patients who presented with neck mass. This is crucial in order to come to a correct final diagnosis and proper treatment can be instituted. Sixty percent of BC is located in the upper third of the neck， anterior to the sternocleidomastoid muscle， but they may appear anywhere in neck or even in the parotid gland. Detection of a cystic mass in the lateral neck region should always raise a possibility of thyroid nodule通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. Seventy percent are cystic， although up to 30% may be solid. Regional lymph node metastasis from the Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC) of the upper aerodigestive tract might mimic BC in imaging if it undergoes cystic degeneration. Cystic degeneration in cervical metastasis from Waldeyer’s ring is estimated to be 33% to 62%通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>.\n\n【14】Imaging commonly used for neck masses are Ultrasound (US)， Computer Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging(MRI). US is the initial method of imaging， as it is relatively cheap，删除1换行well tolerated， absence of ionizing radiation and provides excellent resolution and contrast of the extra cranial head and neck 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. US is very useful in cases where Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology (FNAC) is needed and it displays the intracystic architecture and vascularity. In older patients with cystic lateral neck lesions， ultrasound with CT or MRI is the best investigation modality 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>.\n\n【15】In BC， US display various echogenicities without intrinsic vascularity on color Doppler. The typical snowstorm' appearance is seen on pressing the transducer against the tissue. This is due to the movement of the cholesterol crystals 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>. The role of US-guided FNAC is questionable when assessing cystic lesions because FNAC has a high false-negative rate (38% to 63%) 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>. However， BC is differentiated from HNSCC metastasis by evaluating the cell ploidy using flow cytometry DNA analysis of the FNAC samples 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>. The simple cyst depicts thin， smooth rim and mucoid content of low density in CT， whereas in MRI， uncomplicated BC has low T1-Weighted (T1W) and high T2W signal intensity. An infected cyst will possess thick， irregular， enhancing and maybe septated rim in CT. In MRI an infected cyst will show high signal intensity in both T1W and T2W images. Contrasted images will display an enhanced cystic wall通用删除6(英):<u>[71</u>.\n\n【16】The commonest midline neck lump in adult is of thyroid gland origin. Thyroid cysts commonly appear as a solitary thyroid nodule of variable size， are painless unless have a hemorrhagic component within. Thyroid cysts usually are fluctuant or tense and on the contrary， adenomas are usually solid. True epithelial thyroid cysts are rare. Cystic thyroid lesions are mostly due to haemorrhage or degeneration within a hyperplastic nodule (part of a multinodular goitre). Toxic and non-toxic multinodular goitres are painless too and have multiple nodules of variable size and shape. In cases of thyroid masses， ultrasound is an excellent choice ofimaging and they appear as well-defined，heterogeneous nodules with cystic component and internal septa. The comet tail sign is occasionally seen and it suggests the presence of colloid within 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>. Multinodular thyroid is diagnosed when multiple cystic nodules are present. Ultrasound with fine-needle aspiration cytology is the first-line investigation in cases with solitary thyroid nodule. The presence of punctuate calcifications and chaotic intranodular vascularity on Doppler will raise suspicion of malignancy， hence ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration is advocated 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>. CT scan is usually performed in thyroid mass to look for the retrosternal extension， to assess any compression on adjacent structures like the trachea and the major neck vessels (internal and external carotid artery and internal jugular vein) as well as suspicious features of malignancy such as presence of metastatic lymph nodes and area of central necrosis.\n\n【17】Conclusion\n\n【18】It is imperative to investigate for a correct diagnosis of any neck mass as the subsequent surgical plan will depends on the final pathology diagnosis. This will avoid unnecessary surgical morbidities and improve patient's post-operative outcomes.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

A well-known complication of nephrotic syndrome is increased risk of Venous Thromboembolism (VTE)， caused by various physiologic changes. Multiple treatment options are available for the treatment of VTE， including heparin， warfarin，and non-warfarin oral anticoagulants such as rivaroxaban. In this case report， we describe a 25-year-old male who presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with a Pulmonary Embolism (PE). He was deemed low-risk and eligible for discharge from the ED with rivaroxaban. The treatment is believed to have failed after he developed another VTE in a renal vein five months later while taking rivaroxaban daily. He was admitted to the hospital for thrombolysis and was subsequently diagnosed with nephrotic syndrome and hypoalbuminemia. There is no available data on the use of rivaroxaban in patients with nephrotic syndrome. Despite the fact that hypoalbuminemia could result in higher serum concentration of free drug for highly protein-bound agents such as rivaroxaban， the additional VTE risk inherent to NS appears to have led to re-thrombosis in this patient. Based on the pathophysiology of nephrotic syndrome， we caution the use of rivaroxaban in patients with this condition.\n\n【2】Keywords： Rivaroxaban； Venous thromboembolism； Nephrotic syndrome； Hypoalbuminemia； Pulmonary embolism；Anticoagulation\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Nephrotic Syndrome (NS) is a rare manifestation ofkidney disease with an annual incidence of three per 100，000 persons 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. NS is defined as proteinuria >3.5 grams per 1.73 m止body surface area per day in association with hypoalbuminemia， peripheral edema， and hypercholesterolemia 通用删除6(英):<u>[2，3]</u>. NS may be caused by systemic disease， medication， infection， or intrinsic renal disease 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>.\n\n【5】Development of VTE is a well-known risk of NS with incidence of up to 25% 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. However， not all causes of NS confer the same risk of VTE. Risk is higher in patients with membranous nephropathy compared to focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and IgA nephropathy 通用删除6(英):<u>[4-6]</u>. A number of physiologic changes occur in patients with NS that may explain the prothrombotic state， which can be generalized as increased platelet reactivity， increased activation of the coagulation system， and reduced activity of the fibrinolytic system 通用删除6(英):<u>[7-9]</u>.\n\n【6】VTE includes both Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) as well as Pulmonary Embolism (PE). PE may be present in 40% to 50% of patients with DVT and has an average mortality of 10% to 15% in the first one to three months after diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>[10-12]</u>.Other complications of DVT and PE include right ventricular dysfunction and post-thrombotic syndrome， which is characterized by pain， heaviness， and swelling of the leg secondary to venous valvular damage caused by the venous thrombus 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>.\n\n【7】Thereare a number oftreatments for patients with VTE，including heparin，low molecular weight heparins， vitamin K antagonists (i.e. warfarin)， and non-warfarin oral anticoagulants， including factor Xa inhibitors and direct thrombin inhibitors 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>. Of the non-warfarin oral anticoagulants， rivaroxaban， apixaban， edoxaban， and dabigatran are all FDA-approved for treatment of DVT and PE. Rivaroxaban was shown to be a non-inferior treatment option for DVTand PE when compared with the standard of care (i.e. enoxaparin and warfarin.) in the EINSTEIN and EINSTEIN PE trials通用删除6(英):<u>[14，15]</u>. Rivaroxaban treatment demonstrates unique advantages over traditional therapy with warfarin due to decreased need for laboratory monitoring， dosing adjustments， and decreased costs删除1换行when compared to the standard treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>[16-291</u>. Rivaroxaban is a highly protein-bound drug with 92% to 95% protein binding(primarily to albumin). It is hepatically metabolized with a terminal half-life of 5 h to 9 h. Approximately 66% of drug excretion occurs in the urine via active tubular secretion 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>. Patients with severely reduced kidney function were excluded from the EINSTEIN and EINSTEIN PE studies； therefore， rivaroxaban should be used with caution in patients with advanced kidney disease 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>. EINSTEIN does not report any demographic or outcomes data in patients with nephrotic syndrome. Clinical management of rivaroxaban in this unique subset of patients remains unclear. This case report describes a recurrence of VTE in a young， previously healthy， obese male receiving rivaroxaban treatment for an unprovoked PE who was later diagnosed with nephrotic syndrome.\n\n【8】Case Presentation\n\n【9】A 25-year-old Hispanic male presented to the emergency department with a chief complaint of chest pain after traveling for approximately 24 h via airplane and car. His past medical history was significant only for obesity， weighing 120 kg with a BMI of 36.8kg/m²at presentation. There was no known family history of VTE. A chest CT was obtained， which revealed a PE in the subsegmental arteries of the posterior basal right lung. Patient was deemed low-risk based on the absence of Hestia criteria， and discharged with outpatient management 通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u>. He was prescribed rivaroxaban 15 mg by mouth twice daily for 21 days， followed by rivaroxaban 20 mg by mouth daily for 12 months. Of note， a Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (CMP) upon presentation revealed hypoalbuminemia， with a serum albumin of 3.0 g/dL (normal 3.4 g/dL to 5.0 g/dL). Serum creatinine at that time was 1.06 mg/dL and BUN was 20 mg/dL， both within normal limits.\n\n【10】He followed up with his Primary Care Provider (PCP) two days later and was prescribed tramadol 50 mg and cyclobenzaprine 5 mg for persistent abdominal and chest pain， which was attributed to the recent PE. He also followed up with the outpatient Embolism Clinic， managed by clinical pharmacists，6 weeks after the PE diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>. At this visit， the patient reported no issues with rivaroxaban therapy， indicating no adverse effects or barriers to adherence. He had not missed any doses and the clinical pharmacist verified appropriate fill history with his outpatient pharmacy. Duration of therapy and additional education points were also discussed and documented at that time.\n\n【11】Two months later， the patient presented to the ED with severe abdominal pain and was found to have an extensive right renal vein thrombus that extended into the Inferior Vena Cava (IVC). Of note， the patient was still taking rivaroxaban， as prescribed， at this time. He was noted to have a serum albumin level of 1.8 g/dL.\n\n【12】He was admitted to the hospital， underwent catheter-directed thrombolysis with alteplase and systemic heparin， and a suprarenal IVC filter was placed. Serial imaging showed resolution of caval thrombus with residual non-occlusive renal vein thrombosis， at which point the IVC filter was removed.删除1换行ue to developing a new， large thrombus while being therapeutically anticoagulated， Hematology began an inpatient hypercoagulability work-up . A scrotal ultra品sound and germcell tumor markers were obtainedto rule out malignancy-related VTE； both were normal . Nephrology also began to work up and treat his NS empirically with methylprednisolone and prednisone.\n\n【13】Table 1： Hypercoagulability Screens (all negative).\n\n【14】Hypercoagulability Screens (all negative)\n\n| Anti-neutrophil antibody  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Dilute Russel viper venom (lupus anticoagulant)  |  |\n| Factor V Leiden mutation R506Q  |  |\n| Prothrombin Factor 2 G20210A  |  |\n| IgG and IgM beta 2 glycoproteins (antiphospholipid syndrome)  |  |\n| Anti cardiolipin IgG antibody  |  |\n| Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria panel (RBC and WBC)  |  |\n\n【16】Table 2： Other hypercoagulability-associated laboratory tests.\n\n| Other Hypercoagulability-Associated Laboratory Tests  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Test  | Result  | ReferenceRange  |\n| C3 Complement  | 102 mg/dL  | 90 to180 mg/dL  |\n| C4 Complement  | 9 mg/dLt  | 10 to 40 mg/dL  |\n| Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) IgG  | <1：20  | <1：20  |\n| Phospholipase A2 receptor antibody lgG  | <1：10  | <1：10  |\n| Antithrombin 3 level  | 72%删除8:<u>十 </u> | 82% to 136%  |\n| Double Stranded DNA antibody  | 32 units  | 0 to 99 units  |\n| Serum alpha-tetoprotein  | 3.9 ng/mL  | 0.7.9 ng/mL  |\n| Serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin  | <1U/L  | 0 to 3 IU/L  |\n| Glomerular basement membrane antibodyIgG  | 0AU/mL  | 0 to 19 AU/mL  |\n| IgM  | 40 mg/dL  | 40 to 230 mg/dL  |\n| IgG  | 616mg/dLt  | 700 to 1600mg/dL  |\n| IgA  | 272 mg/dL  | 70 to 400 mg/dL  |\n| Platelet aggregation  | Normal with allagonists  |  |\n| Immunofixation for monoclonal protein band  | Negative  |  |\n\n【18】tIndicates result value outside of the reference range\n\n【19】The decision was made to switch this patient from rivaroxaban to warfarin. He was discharged after 9 days of hospitalization with a5-day prescription for therapeutic enoxaparin as a bridge to warfarin therapy. The patient has remained on warfarin with no further episodes of VTE to date.\n\n【20】His NS was empirically treated with prednisone until biopsy Wasdone three months after discharge. Immunofluorescence stain for PLA2R and immunoperoxidase stain for TSHD7A， the most common antigens for membranous nephropathy， were both negative at that time 通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u>. Immunofluorescence stain showed anti-IgG predominant glomerular capillary loop deposits consistent with membranous nephropathy. Electron microscopy also showed numerous subepithelial electron dense deposits， consistent with membranous glomerulopathy. He was started on cyclosporine 100mg by mouth twice a day， and prednisone was decreased to 40 mg by mouth daily. Immunosuppressive therapy， such as cyclosporine Orcyclophosphamide， is indicated in patients with idiopathic membranous glomerulonephropathy who have experienced severe or life-threatening symptoms related to NS 通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u>. The prednisone dose was tapered and stopped slowly over the following 8 months due to the development of iatrogenic Cushing Syndrome.\n\n【21】Discussion\n\n【22】Thrombus recurrence while therapeuticallyanticoagulated with rivaroxaban is uncommon 通用删除6(英):<u>[14，15]</u>. The EINSTEINPE trial删除1换行demonstrated rivaroxaban treatment provided similar protection against recurrent VTE compared to the standard treatment of enoxaparin bridged to a vitamin K antagonist 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>. However， while patients with creatinine clearance <30 mL/min were excluded， there was no reporting of albumin levels or presence of proteinuria in the study. The clinical conundrum described above raises the question of Rivaroxaban's efficacy for treatment of PE in patients with NS. There is currently no published data on the efficacy of rivaroxaban in patients with NS or hypoalbuminemia.\n\n【23】Rivaroxaban is a direct factor Xa inhibitor that was approved for the treatment of DVT and PE in 2012. Dabigatran， apixaban， edoxaban， and enoxaparin bridged to a vitamin K antagonist are also approved for the treatment of venous thromboembolism 通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u>. Rivaroxaban is highly (92% to 95%) bound to plasma protein， the most significant of which is albumin， and has a volume of distribution of approximately 50 liters 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>. It reaches peak concentrations in 2 h to 4 h and has a half-life of 5 h to 9 h in adults and up to 11 h to 13h in the elderly 通用删除6(英):<u>[17，22]</u>. About 2/3 of each dose undergoes metabolic degradation and about 1/3 undergoes direct renal excretion 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>. Standard dosing for the treatment of DVT or PE is 15 mg by mouth twice a day for 21 days， followed by at least six months of 20 mg by mouth daily.\n\n【24】A number of physiologic changes in patients with NS increase the risk of thrombus formation. Platelets in patients with NS are hypercoagulable， and the degree of hypercoagulability correlates with the severity of NS 通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u>. This may be due to hypercholesterolemia or increased thromboxane generation 通用删除6(英):<u>[23-25]</u>. Other prothrombotic factors such as factor VIII and fibrinogen also have increased rates of synthesis and increased plasma concentrations in patients with NS 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. Plasminogen and antithrombin levels are also decreased in patients with NS 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. These changes all increase the risk of VTE in patients with NS. In addition to NS， the patient was at increased risk for development of VTE due to obesity 通用删除6(英):<u>[26]</u>. However， his hypercoagulability workup by Hematology did not reveal any other definitive causes for increased risk of VTE.\n\n【25】Other physiologic changes in patients with NS could also affect VTE treatment. Urinary protein loss， mostly of albumin but also of other proteins， is a defining feature of NS 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. Hypoalbuminemia was shown to be an independent risk factor for thrombus formation 通用删除6(英):<u>[27]</u>. Despite this risk， hypoalbuminemia theoretically should increase the serum concentration of free rivaroxaban due to its high degree of protein binding. This juxtaposition of competing factors results in an unclear overall risk profile for thrombus formation. To our knowledge，there are no other case reports or literature evaluating the use of rivaroxaban in patients with NS. Current literature provides the strongest support for the use of heparin or low molecular weight heparins followed by vitamin K antagonist for the treatment of VTE in patients with NS通用删除6(英):<u>[7，28]</u>.\n\n【26】Conclusion\n\nIn this case report， we describe a patient with previously undiagnosed NS who developed an extensive renal vein thrombus while being treated for a prior PE with rivaroxaban. Rivaroxaban is one of several drugs approved for the treatment of PE， although limited data exists regarding its use in patients with NS.

We report the PET/CT findings of a systemic lymphoma-like TB， which were initially misdiagnosed as lymphoma with lung infiltration. TB was confirmed by cervical lymph node biopsy. Through a study of this case to further improve our understanding of systemic TB.\n\n【2】Keywords： Tuberculosis；Positron emission tomography； Computed tomography\n\n【3】Key Clinical Message\n\n【4】It is difficult to distinguish systemic tuberculosis from lymphoma on PET/CT， which could involve nasal mucosa，lungs， and systemic lymph nodes， including the muscle space oflower limbs. Finding the characteristic manifestations oftuberculosis， such as pulmonary miliary nodules， would be helpful for diagnosis.\n\n【5】Introduction\n\n【6】Although coronavirus disease 2019 has caused millions of deaths worldwide， Tuberculosis (TB) remains the most common cause of death 通用删除6(英):<u>[1-3]</u>. TB treatment protocols have not changed for many years， ensuring a cure rate of >90% once diagnosed. However， due to its low detection rate， many patients with TB do not complete standardized treatment， thereby increasing the proportion of Multidrug-Resistant TB (MDR-TB) cases 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. As such， the early and accurate diagnosis of TB is important for management.\n\n【7】Typical TB can be diagnosed almost accurately via radiography and Computed Tomography(CT). In contrast， when imaging findings are atypical or the patient has multiple disease conditions， the differential diagnosis can be difficult 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. In this article， we describe the 'F-Fluorodeoxyglucose(F-FDG) Positron Emission Tomography and Computed Tomography (PET/CT) findings in a patient with TB， who showed thickened mucosa of the nasal cavity and ethmoid sinus， as well as systemic lymph node enlargement and pulmonary TB， which resembled lymphoma. A brief overview of the differential diagnosis and presentation ofrelevant literature is also provided.\n\n【8】Case Report\n\n【9】A 25-year-old male presented with a month-long history of swollen cervical and axillary lymph nodes. Chest and abdominal CT scan showed multiple small nodules with increased density in both lungs and multiple enlarged lymph nodes in the axilla， subclavian chain， mediastinum， and retroperitoneum. Lymphomatous lung infiltration was initially considered. PET/CT examination revealed mucosal thickening of the nasal cavity and ethmoid sinus， diffuse and unevenly distributed small nodules in both lungs， and multiregional lymphadenopathy in the whole body， with varying degrees of hypermetabolism (SUVmax=10.2-18.6).Lymph node lesions without obvious necrosis were the main manifestations in this case. Furthermore， the metabolism of the respiratory nodules was not as high as that of whole-body lymph nodes. Following cervical lymph node biopsy， our initial assessment of lymphoma with pulmonary involvement was revised to TB .\n\n【10】Discussion\n\n【11】Pulmonary TB and extrapulmonary TB of the brain， joints， urinary， liver， and gastrointestinal tract， among others， are known删除1换行manifestations of TB infection. Particularly， localized or systemic TB of the lungs and lymph nodes are the most common 通用删除6(英):<u>[6-14]</u>. For the early detection of such cases， IF-FDG-PET-CT has been known to be very sensitive， but its lack of specificity is a major limitation 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>.\n\nExtra Nodal NK/T-Cell Lymphoma，Nasal Type (ENKTCL-NT)， is another common condition that often manifests as nasal mucosal thickening and increased metabolism；locallymph node enlargement may be associated. PET/CT is the gold standard for the diagnosis and clinical staging of ENKTCL-NT and plays a role in prognostication通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>. In comparison， although Mycobacterium tuberculosis could删除1换行adhere to the extracellular matrix in areas of mucosal damage 通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>， primary TB of the head and neck mucosa is rare 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>. Moreover， the localized inflammation is often observed with inflammation in cervical lymph nodes 通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u>. The case we described was very similar to lymphoma； however， cervical lymph node biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of TB. In retrospect， nasal lymphoma generally does not|删除段之间换行|Most cases of primary pulmonary TB present as consolidations， miliarynnodulesS，小1lymphadenopathies，and pleuiral effusions. Meanwhile， miliary TB may present with acute or chronic lung nodules， and may involve multiple organs 通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u>. Although PET/CT has certain advantages in assessing TB activity and guiding biopsy localization 通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u>， malignant lymphoma may mimic miliary TB due to diffuse micronodular radiographic findings 通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u>. However， it should be noted that miliary nodules are still characteristic of pulmonary TB. In this case， bilateral pulmonary nodules were not typical of acute or chronic miliary nodules， systemic diffuse enlargedlymphadenopathy， thickened nasal mucosa， and hypermetabolism. As such， we mistook these findings as lymphoma with pulmonary infiltration. Thus， pulmonary miliary nodules should be the main diagnostic basis of this disease.\n\n【13】Systemic lymph node enlargement is typical of lymphoma and should be distinguished from TB lymphadenitis and necrotizing lymphadenitis 通用删除6(英):<u>[21，22]</u>. In addition， imaging findings in TB vary at different stages of the disease. For example， the images of granulomatous formation are mostly solid nodules or masses without obvious necrosis and calcification， which may involve multiple parts. Granulomas may appear hypermetabolic due to the presence of many active macrophages that take up F-FDG， making these lesions indistinguishable from tumors. In this case， lymph nodes showed increased FDG uptake without signs of significant necrosis， representing the acute active phase of TB. Because of these factors， we misdiagnosed the case as lymphoma with pulmonary involvement.\n\n【14】Given these ffindings， radiologists and nuclear medicine physicians should be familiar with the imaging findings of pulmonary TB 通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u>， especially since the differential diagnosis mainly relies on the morphological features of CT combined with metabolic character assessment and clinical data.\n\n【15】Conclusion\n\n【16】Imaging findings in TB are variable.ISF-FDG-PET/CT is sensitive for the early detection of TB but lacks specificity in distinguishing TB from lymphoma. However， BF-FDG PET/CT played an important删除1换行role in assessment of systemic lesions and guiding the treatment of this patient. For similar cases in the future， TB should be included in the differential diagnosis， and the final diagnosis should still be based on pathological examination. For this case， the patient was treated for TB and is now considered cured and TB-free.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

This number of pixels|删除段之间换行|It is difficult to take single photo during diagnosis using endoscope， because this diagnosis is huge burden on the cow. Therefore， we limited the diagnosis time within 1 min in total. Hence we shot a video and saved as MPEG4 file， and then， Adobe Premiere Pro  was used for taking single photo image (JPEG file).

It was clearly seen that the external uterine ostium illuminated by white light. Next， the images obtained by decomposing the white image into RGB are shown as Red， green， and blue images in Figure 1.

Green and blue images depicted the distribution of thick blood vessels in the folds of external uterine ostium.\n\n【22】The composed images of green and blue images of the external uterine ostium and the vaginal wall are shown in Figure 2. Thick blood vessels could be clearly observed. Image of the vaginal wall also showed blood vessels and it was different from white image.\n\n【23】In estrus cows， the blood flow increases due to the excitement， and the endometrium looks reddish as a whole.

The participants were selected purposively from different geographical regions across the country. The pre- and post-training scores of staff nurses were captured using Kahoot! platform and statistical significance were determined by paired t-test using STATA software.

This FOGSI initiative is a promising intervention to build the capacity of healthcare providers， however， continuous and concerted efforts are needed at their workplaces to make the learning process sustainable.\n\n【5】Keywords： FOGSI； Manyata skill transfer training； Frontline healthcare provider； Capacity building； Maternal care； Mixed-method； Kahoot\n\n【6】Introduction\n\n【7】Improving the quality of antenatal care will not only reduce the global burden of maternal complications and deaths but also provide all women with a positive pregnancy experience 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Since staff nurses are at the forefront of clinical care and have maximum interaction time with the women at a healthcare facility， it is imperative to strengthen their knowledge and skills to ensure the provision of quality， safe and respectful maternity care.\n\n【8】The Maternal Health Quality of Care(MHQoC) strategy-funded National Program Management Unit of FOGSI has trained the staff nurses and certified facilities on the Manyata safe delivery standards. Though Manyata clinical standards are meant for private facilities， they are aligned with the government's requirements for the delivery of optimum care. The 16 clinical standards targeted for implementation cover： Antenatal care (one standard)，intrapartum care (13 standards)， postpartum care (one standard)， and caesarean section (one standard)， including the standards on identification and management of Postpartum Hemorrhage (PPH) and Pre-Eclampsia/Eclampsia(PE/E)通用删除6(英):<u>[2-4]</u>.\n\n【9】Bengaluru-based ARTIST (Asian Research and Training Institute for skill Transfer) Skill Gurukool， which is a premier institute for learning， is gearing up to ensure the improvement in capabilities and competencies of Obstetricians & Gynecologists (ObGyn) and healthcare providers in India. Through FOGSI approved Manyata skill development training program， the institute aims to create a lasting impact on the quality of training and scale up of Manyata's reach，taking advantage of both the onsite teaching at Skill Gurukool and blended skill transfer programs through digital platforms and other innovative means.\n\n【10】In our previous study， we documented the impact of Manyata training on the effective management of pregnancy and childbirth-related complications， PPH， and PE/E. Since the staff nurses of private healthcare facilities are the key beneficiaries， their experiences and perceptions of the Manyata training program， along with their head consultants and assessors， were gathered and documented. All the beneficiaries strongly valued the Manyata training program for building their capacity for complications management 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>.However， this program is not just committed to reducing preventable maternal complications and mortality but also to improving the overall quality of maternal and child health care.\n\n【11】We believe that a comprehensive understanding of the overall development of the clinical skills and professional behaviors of staff nurses will provide a holistic impact of the Manyata training program. Therefore， this study demonstrates how the knowledge and skills of staff nurses have improved from pre- to post-training implementation and how well the beneficiaries have received the Manyata training program as evaluated through their pre- and post-training scores for some of the important standards covered， and their in-depth feedback data analysis.\n\n【12】Methods\n\n【13】Study design\n\n【14】This is a mixed-method study done to achieve greater insight into the impact of the Manyata training program on ensuring quality， safe and respectful maternity care in private healthcare facilities.\n\n【15】Study setting and duration\n\n【16】Bengaluru-based ARTIST institute， through its FOGSI-Manyata skill transfer training initiative， has covered over 200 private healthcare facilities from different states in India. The staff from these facilities was oriented on the 16 Manyata clinical standards through the presentation， practical demonstrations， and role plays on digital platforms . The facilities were then assessed by FOGSI lead assessors and received a quality-of-care seal by FOGSI-Manyata if they had compliance with more than 85% of clinical standards.\n\n【17】Study participants\n\n【18】A cluster of 10 private healthcare facilities from one state in each geographical region， North， West， South， and East (Punjab， Maharashtra，TamilNadu，Bihar)， who enrolled for Manyata training， were included. A group of 4 nurses from each hospital participated in the Kahoot! quiz.\n\n【19】For the qualitative part of the study， 22 to 24 staff nurses， and9 head consultants were selected from these private facilities for focus group discussions and in-depth interviews， respectively. Five assessors were also included for in-depth interviews. The participants were selected using a purposive sampling approach in steps that are described in detail in our previous study 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>.\n\n【20】Data collection and analysis\n\n【21】Kahoot! a game-based learning platform that was launched in2013， was used to assess the proportion of participants with correct answers for questions based on certain clinical care standards. The pre- and post-training responses for four important questions are focused upon in this study. These are Q1： Glucose test in pregnancy has to be done for all women in non-fasting； Q2： AMTSL for all cases； Q3： Diazepam is the choice for eclampsia management； Q4： Plotting of partograph should be started from 4 cm dilatation of the cervix The pre- and post-training responses of participants were recorded electronically. Data appeared as a report on an excel sheet with the collective percentage (%) of scores for that region. The data analysis was done using STATA/SE 15.1 software and Microsoft Excel. The results were analyzed for the mean difference in the percentage of the correct answer before and after training and statistical significance was calculated using paired t-test.\n\n【22】In addition， their overall professional behavior change was explored through Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) with them and In-Depth Interviews (IDIs) with their head consultants and assessors. The interview transcripts were analyzed manually using qualitative thematic analysis. The qualitative data collection and analysis are described in detail in our previous study 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>.\n\n【23】Ethical approval\n\n【24】Ethical approval for the study was taken from the Institutional Ethics Committee (IEC). All the necessary and relevant documents were submitted to the Ethics Committee. Verbal consent for participation was requested after explaining that participation in the study was entirely voluntary， and confidentiality and anonymity would be strictly maintained. Written consent from the study participants was also obtained through Google forms\n\n【25】Results Quantitative analysis\n\n【26】Improvement in knowledge as highlighted by Kahoot reports：The pre- and post-training scores represent the percentage of correct answers before and after the training， respectively.\n\n【27】As shown in Figures 2， the proportion of participants with correct answers for all questions (representing important clinical standards) has increased post-training in all four states. The pre-training scores of Bihar and Puniab were much lower as compared to the other two states (Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu)， particularly for question related to glucose testing for pregnant women. The proportion of participants with correct answers was as low as 16.7% before training which increased to 89.4% post-training for Q1 in Bihar . The maximum percentage increase was observed in Bihar which was437%， 99%， and 222%， for questions 1， 2 and 4 respectively. Of all the states， Tamil Nadu had reported the highest pre-training scores for most of the standards studied， which further improved to 100%post-training for the standards related to glucose testing and plotting ofpartograph for pregnant women .\n\n【28】As shown in Figure 3， the statistical hypotheses were tested to determine whether the results were statistically significant using paired t-tests.\n\nThe analysis of pre- and post-training results of all participants for all questions revealed a significant improvement in the mean percentage of correct answers from 42.5% before training to 82.9%after training with a mean difference of 40.4% with p<0.001 (Figure|删除段之间换行|3a). Similarly， the difference in the mean percentage of correct answers before and after training was found to be statistically significant with p value <0.05 for each state independently.\n\n【30】These results demonstrate a significant improvement in the knowledge and skills of the participants from all the states in different geographical regions for all standards covered in the Manyata training program.\n\n【31】Qualitative analysis\n\n【32】Positive impact on overall functioning as explored by qualitative data analysis： In alignment with the findings from the pre- and post-test scores of the participant， the qualitative analysis of FGDs with staff nurses， and IDIs with head consultants and assessors also highlighted a strong positive impact of the training program on the beneficiaries.\n\n【33】The themes that have emerged out of our qualitative data demonstrate the most significant effects of training on staff nurses and their clinical practice can be summed up as improved motivation to upgrade themselves and others， enhanced practical knowledge and skills， an increased sense of recognition and self-worth， respectful maternity care， overall improved maternal outcomes .\n\n【34】Motivated to upgrade themselves and other\n\n【35】As perone ofthe assessors， one big challenge influencing maternal outcomes is the motivation of the head of the facility who can， in turn， motivate the staff to learn and improve by taking up training and make the learning a continuous process. The perception of the relevance of training to overcome competency-related challenges is a key motivating factor that can make a difference.\n\n【36】“The motivation of the center head that is he or she has to be really motivated so that they allow these girls， the students to attend the training sessions correctly and then they have to have a recap in their own spare facility so that these girls actually understand the practical aspects of that. And it’s basically not a one-day teaching， it has to be like ongoing(Assessor 2).\n\n【37】Now， they realized the importance of plotting a partogram and were able to keep a check on the progress of labor through it. They felt more competent and alert than before in diagnosing and managing complicated stages at an early stage.\n\n【38】“Partogram has been very useful to us. By plotting partogram， we come to know about the complete situation of the patient and this has helped us a lot. (Nurse 1 FGD1).\n\n【39】Sense of recognition and self-worth\n\n【40】All the staff nurses stated that their sense of involvement and responsibility had increased manifold which helped them in carrying out their roles and duties effectively. They acknowledged the recognition they received as they applied their learnings from the course to their practice. They not only upskilled themselves but also trained their junior/new staff that offered a huge boost to their sense of self-worth.\n\n【41】“Post training， we do whatever we have learnt during the training and after that we inform the madam. We do all the preparations in advance.\"(N3，FGD 1).\n\n【42】Respectful maternity care\n\n【43】Respectful maternity care during pregnancy and childbirth is not only an important component of quality of care but also every woman has a right to receive it. Head consultants have noticed an improvement in the communication skills of their staff nurses and were elated about the fact that their staff now regularly practiced respectful maternity care and engaged in clinical counseling with the patients.\n\n【44】“Sometimes it happens， no， the patient attendant is not very patient， they try to impose “so there they used to get aggressive\". But after this training， most of the time I see that they try to make them understand. They do whatever the attendants are wanting， they dont just blast on them， and the behavior has become very different. When the mother (or a companion) wants to stay with the patient and all those things， they try to console them\". (HC 6).\n\n【45】Improved maternal outcomes\n\n【46】While most of the head consultants reported that the overall upgraded functioning of their health facilities has received more positive responses from the patients， two of them also highlighted a significant improvement in maternal morbidity and mortality， since the inception of Manyata training.\n\n【47】“The morbidity is reduced and undoubtedly you can see the result， the mortality in the whole country and also in our own region， has come down significantly since this Manyata (training) has been rolled in\". (HC 3).\n\n【48】Discussion\n\n【49】Every human has the right to the highest achievable standard of healthcare. In one of the previous studies， Tripathi et al. documented the poor quality of maternal care， particularly in complications management， in private healthcare facilities analyzed for baseline assessments conducted for the Manyata training in three states of India. Nearly half (47.1%) of all staff nurses in maternity care services at these private medical facilities were found to be underqualified in the baseline assessment 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. However， research conducted on the quality of maternal and child care in private medical facilities in India is limited. It becomes imperative to identify and address the quality gaps in maternity care in the private sector as well， in order to significantly improve maternal and perinatal survival and overall health.\n\n【50】Upskilling of healthcare staff， and improving their competence through training is essential for not only strengthening the quality of antenatal care but also improving maternal outcomes 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. Magnesium Sulphate (MgSO) is an anticonvulsant which is recommended for use to prevent and treat pre-eclampsia/eclampsia， but is being underutilized and not widely adopted in practice， mostly in Low-and Middle-Income Countries (LMIC). The provider competence and confidence in administering MgSO， is one of the major factors limiting its use for PE/E prevention as well as treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. Active Management of the Third Stage of Labor (AMTSL)， which includes administration ofuterotonics (preferred oxytocin) just after delivery， is of utmost importance for the prevention of complications 通用删除6(英):<u>[8，9]</u>. A recent study has reported low skills of healthcare providers as compared to their knowledge on Active Management of Third Stage of Labor (AMTSL) and has recommended continous in-service training for them 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>.\n\n【51】In our study， the knowledge and competency of staff nurses删除1换行around basic aspects of maternal clinical care such as appropriate blood pressure measurement， the glucose test， and plotting of partograph， which are known to be associated with better outcomes， was found to be poor as suggested by their pre-training knowledge assessment scores. Manyata training program has provided one such opportunity for these staff nurses to enhance their knowledge as well as skills on 16 clinical standards， ensuring the provision of quality and safe maternity care services. Based on the pre- and post-training scores captured for four standards from four different geographical areas， the knowledge and skills of staff nurses have improved significantly after the implementation of the Manyata training program. As shown in Figure 2， there is a significant increase in the proportion of participants with correct answers post-training in all four states， however， the impact varied from state to state. The maximum percentage increase was observed in Bihar for questions1， 2， and 4 which are focused on standards related to glucose testing， practicing AMTSL， and plotting partograph for all pregnant cases， respectively. It was observed that the proportion of participants with correct answers was as low as 16.7% before training which increased to 89.4% post-training for one of these standards， which explains the highest percentage increase in Bihar of all the states. On the other hand， Tamil Nadu had the highest proportion of participants giving the correct answers during both pre- and post-training assessments， leading to a 100% result post-training for some of the questions. Our data is aligned with the previous findings which suggest that there is a vast disparity in the key health indicators and the outcomes across the states in India， with Bihar among the worst and Tamil Nadu as one of the best-performing states in terms of maternal and child health indicators 通用删除6(英):<u>[11，12]</u>. However， our results demonstrate that the Manyata training program has been a game changer in terms of improving the knowledge and skills of all the participants， irrespective of the states and geographical regions they belong to .\n\n【52】Ourqualitative analysisSalso suggests their strengthened professionalism in overall functioning at the workplace. The impact of the Manyata training program was found to be positively associated with the motivation levels of head consultants and nurses， to upskill themselves and their team members. Their motivation， in turn， led to improved practical knowledge and skills which helped them with in performing their duties effectively. Their enhanced confidence helped them develop a sense of self-worth and belonging at the workplace which also developed a positive outlook and encouraged cooperative behavior with their patients， enabling the provision of respectful and quality maternity care to them，ultimatelyleading to overall improved maternal outcomes .\n\n【53】Conclusion\n\n【54】The practical knowledge and competency of staff nurses related to basic aspects of antenatal care such as appropriate blood pressure measurement， the glucose test， and plotting of partograph were found to be suboptimal before training. Our study demonstrates that the Manyata training program has led to a significant improvement in the knowledge and skills of all the participants， irrespective of the states and geographical regions they belong to. The collective learning through these interactive sessions on a digital platform that connected nurses from different facilities， not only made it an interesting process but also provided a competitive environment that motivated them further to outperform.

He was exposed to asbestos fibers emitted of an oven used forthepreparation ofbricks. The patient presented abdominal pains and decreased sense of general state. An abdominal scanning was realized showing a diffuse infiltration in peritoneal fat and an effusion of the vesical wall.

Thus， a statement of occupational disease in conformance with the legislation in force was made|删除段之间换行|Conclusion： In this case， the chronic and important asbestos exposures as well as the absence ofother risk factors are towards the incrimination of this fiber in the emergence of peritoneal mesothelioma.\n\n【4】Keywords： Peritoneum； Mesothelioma； Asbestos； Profession\n\n【5】Introduction\n\n【6】Mesothelioma is a rare tumor that affects the cells of the mesothelium， a protective membrane that covers most internal organs of the body including the pleura， peritoneum and pericardium 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>.\n\n【7】Several agents likely to induce this mesothelioma were reported such as exposure to erionitis， viral infections， vaccine products and/or genetic susceptibility 通用删除6(英):<u>[2，3]</u>. Although the causal link between pleural mesothelioma and asbestos exposure is well established， this relationship is still controversial for peritoneal mesothelioma. Thus， we report a case of peritoneal mesothelioma observed in a worker who has an occupational exposure to asbestos.\n\n【8】Case Presentation\n\n【9】The patient was a 48-year-old， active smoker at 45 packages/year， without significant pathological history. He had worked as a versatile worker in craft brickyard for 19 years. His duties included mixing raw materials intended to be placed in an oven containing friable asbestos used as a thermal insulator. This oven was old and worn， which could emit asbestos fibers under the effect of shock and air movements. Then， the patient was responsible for molding， drying and waiting for the cooling of these bricks to take them out of the oven. At the end of the shift， he was cleaning the oven with a brush that contained asbestos dust.\n\n【10】However， the patient reported bad industrial hygiene conditions， and lack of protective respiratory devices. Also， no medical supervision in the context of occupational medicine was provided to him. Besides smoking and asbestos， anamnesis did not disclose other significant exposures to occupational or environmental carcinogens.\n\n【11】The history of the disease was marked by a gradual onset of abdominal pain and distension associated with anorexia， asthenia and weight loss. Physical examination found an abdominal distension without a palpable mass. The patient was investigated with thoraco-abdominopelvic Computed Tomography (CT) which revealed a diffuse in filtration of peritoneal fat with an important intra-peritoneal effusion and focal effusion of the left and lateral wall of the bladder.\n\n【12】However， radiological investigations of the thorax did not reveal any signs of asbestos impregnation. Histopathological examination of bioptic samples performed on peritoneal and bladder lesions led to a diagnosis of malignant peritoneal mesothelioma of the epitheloid type associated with urothelial bladder carcinoma. The patient was treated with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy and six sessions of systemic chemotherapy and endoscopic treatment of his bladder tumor. The initial evolution was marked by a partial improvement of its general state. In the absence of medical coverage at work， the patient resumed his usual professional activity. Approximately three years later， the patient was hospitalized for continuous， slowly worsening abdominal pain. Total body Positron Emission Tomography (PET) showed diffuse epiploic mesenteric infiltration associated with peritoneal thickening and an important ascites evoking a recurrence of peritoneal mesothelioma. No signs of recurrence of the bladder tumor were objectified. The patient was referred to a department of occupational pathologies to study the accountability of this illness to his profession. The occupational origin of this peritoneal mesothelioma was found in front of the chronic asbestos exposure present in the ovens of the brick factory， objectified by a post office study carried out by the occupational doctor. Tunisian Judicial Authority recognized the occupational origin of mesothelioma.\n\n【13】Discussion\n\n【14】Malignant Peritoneal Mesothelioma (MPL) is a rare disease whose spontaneous evolution remains fatal 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. Its epidemiology is complicated because of the possible geographical and temporal variations. In all mesotheliomas， peritoneal mesothelioma occurs， in order of frequency， the second place after pleural localization.\n\n【15】In addition， peritoneal malignant mesothelioma accounts for10% to 30% of malignant mesotheliomas with an annual incidence estimated at 1 in 500000 in France and 1 in 200000 in certain regions of Europe (Italy) 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. It occurs preferentially in the elderly with an average age ranging from 47 years to 60.5 years 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. Three forms of mesothelioma are described with different physiopathology， morphology， anc prognosis： diffuse malignant mesothelioma， well-differentiated papillarymesothelioma， and multi-cystic mesothelioma. Among the malignant mesotheliomas， three types areindividualized： The diffuse epithelioidmesothelioma (the most common) and which was observed in our case， sarcomatoid mesothelioma and biphasic mesothelioma 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. Exposure to asbestos is the main risk factor for pleural mesothelioma. However， this causality is not clearly established for peritoneal mesothelioma and the debate concerning the mechanism of exposure of peritoneal cells to asbestos remains open. On the other hand， several studies have established a relationship between asbestos exposure and the occurrence of peritoneal mesothelioma 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>.\n\n【16】The latter appears， usually as a tumor secondary to a primary source of malignancy， which is pleural mesothelioma. Inhaled asbestos fibers in the lungs would be transported by the lymphatic system to the abdominal cavity， or enter directly into the digestive tract after ingestion. Cancer cells from the primary source could also become mobile and spread through the lymphatic system to other areas， causing metastases通用删除6(英):<u> 8]</u>.\n\n【17】In our patient， pleuropulmonary lesions were not observed in thoracic radiological investigations， which could be related to a direct mechanism of exposure to asbestos fibers. The link between peritoneal mesothelioma and asbestos exposure has been described删除1换行previously among workers in different jobs. In the literature， the age of patients ranged from 45 years to 75 years. Job tenure ranged from 7years 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u> to 40 years 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>. Our patient was working for 19 years before the onset of his illness. The main occupations were： A hairdresser using hair dryers emitting asbestos dust 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>， a mine worker 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>， a former soldier 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u> and a worker in buildings handling asbestos cement 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>. Besides asbestos exposure， these patients with peritoneal mesothelioma had no other risk factors.\n\n【18】Thedevelopment of bladdercarcinomaandperitoneal mesothelioma in the same patient is utterly exceptional. Another case was previously observed in a 75-year-old man with significant occupational exposure to asbestos 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>. Bladder cancer preceded five-year peritoneal mesothelioma. In our case， the diagnosis of urothelial carcinoma was concomitant with that of peritoneal mesothelioma. This association could signal a possible relationship between exposure to asbestos classified as a certain carcinogen for humans by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC)通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u> and bladder cancer. Nevertheless， the histological type， which is different from the two tumors， eliminates the hypothesis of peritoneal mesothelioma metastasized in the bladder. Similarly， the presence of active smoking in our patient would be the most implicated etiological factor in bladder cancer. Another association with renal carcinoma with clear cells has been described by Candura et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u> in 2016. The modalities of expression of the disease were abdominal pain as was the case for our patient， hemorrhagic ascites， 通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u> a cutaneous nodule通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u> or a fortuitous finding 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>. Chrysotile was the form of asbestos most implicated in the occurrence ofperitoneal mesothelioma. There was no documented exposure to products containing amphiboles通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>. About the histological type， diffuse malignant mesothelioma of the epitheloid type was the most common type and no case of pure Sarcomatoid mesothelioma was reported 通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>. Nevertheless， two cases of biphasic mesothelioma were reported by Candura et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u> and Cabibi et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u> respectively.\n\n【19】Finally， our observation is similar to the cases described in the literature from standpoint of exposure to asbestos， the time of onset of the disease， the absence of other risk factors and the histological type revealed. Regarding occupational origin， peritoneal mesothelioma is recognized in our country by our system of compensation as an occupational disease， once the criteria for recognition are established.\n\n【20】Conclusion\n\nPeritoneal malignant mesothelioma is a rare tumor， for which the etiological role of asbestos exposure is very likely|删除段之间换行|Thus， and given the rapidly evolving nature of this tumor making early detection difficult， setting up technical protection means with monitoring facilities containing asbestos proves essential.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

It presents with an unpredictable， chronic， and recurrent course， affecting 0.2% to 1% of the adult population between30 and 60 years. It is more common among females in a ratio of two women to one man， with no racial predisposition. Sporadic in character， rare are the reports of familial cases， which are of earlier onset and have a recurrent course. The disease can affect all skin types， with a predilection for the oral and genital mucosae 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，2]</u>.\n\n【9】The skin， appendages and mucosae play a role in protecting against aggression from external agents， such as invasion by microorganisms， exposure to allergens， and also mechanical protection against trauma， in order to ensure the integrity of the organism and its homeostasis. For this reason， the cutaneous-mucous epithelium acts like the first line of physical and immunological defense， which constitutes an essential part of the immune system. Biological processes affecting the skin's barrier function and interfering with its differentiation and repair process can lead to the development of LP 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. The disease starts off with cellular damage to the keratinocytes in the basal layer， secondary to autoimmune stimulation. This reaction is mediated by T lymphocytes that normally do not respond to the skin. However， when they are stimulated by exogenous agents that bind to the lymphocyte receptor by a mechanism of molecular mimicry， an aggression reaction to keratinocytes is triggered， which leads to their apoptosis 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>.\n\n【10】Its clinical forms can be divided into linear， hypertrophic， atrophic， and annular. It presents with an acute course and a predilection for the flexor surface of the wrists. A typical lesion is characterized by a purple-colored papule having a polygonal contour and flat surface surmounted删除1换行by thin， off-white lines， conferring on the lesion a lace-like pattern， also known as Wickham’s striae 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. Its clinical manifestation varies and is determined by the affected topography， epidermis' respective peculiarities， time of progression， which interferes in the thickness and color of the lesion， and by the severity of the condition， i.e. a more severe condition may progress with erosions and blisters， depending on how aggressively the basal layer has been affected. The condition may be associated with the Koebner phenomenon， as represented by the appearance of lesions following local trauma 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>.\n\n【11】Mucosal involvement is present in 45% of males and 53% of females， with the genital region being especially affected in males通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. LP lesions can adopt different clinical presentations according to the time of progression， location， and severity. The clinical forms of mucosal LP are classified into reticular， annular， erosive， bullous， and atrophic types， and may be the only manifestation of the disease 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. The oral mucosa is the most affected site， followed by the genital track. However， LP can affect any mucous site， such as the eyes， tympanum，esophagus， and trachea. The symptoms vary， with pruritus being the most common symptom，reported in cases of一either asymptomatic or painful lesions， or with a burning sensation. Genital Lichen Planus (GLP) is found in 25% of the male population with LP， and its morbidity is due to the possibility of it progressing with stenosis， genital synechia， and even carcinoma，in addition to the psychological impact of a sexual nature resulting from this chronic and recurrent genital dermatosis， whose diagnosis is often made late， thereby causing great anxiety in the patient 通用删除6(英):<u>[2，7]</u>.\n\n【12】LP has been observed in association with other comorbidities， especially those involving immune disorders. The correlation between LP and Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infection is well described， especially when erosive oral lesions are present 通用删除6(英):<u>[8，9]</u>. The relationship between this dermatosis and the presence of the Hepatitis B Virus(HBV)， active hepatitis A， and vaccination for hepatitis B has also been described 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>. There are reports on the relationship between the disease and ulcerative colitis， alopecia areata， dermatomyositis， morphea， lichen sclerosus， lupus erythematosus， pemphigus， and hematological neoplasms 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>， corroborating the hypothesis of autoimmune etiology. Medicines， ingestion of quinine in tonic water， and alergy to the metals used in dental restorations lead to clinically indistinguishable lesions of LP， which is characterized by lichenoid eruptions， the topography， histopathology， and progression of which have particular features 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>.\n\n【13】The diagnosis is based on clinical and histological aspects. Classic cases can be diagnosed clinically， yet an anatomopathological study is often necessary. The histological findings that are representative of LP involve keratinocyte damage (keratinocyte damage apoptosis at the dermoepidermal junction， which leads to hydropic degeneration of the basal layer with subsequent pigmentary incontinence) and lymphocytic infiltrate (superficial perivascular， and/or with a band-like arrangement， called lichenoid infiltrate)， giving rise to typical changes in the epidermis and the dermoepidermal junction， such as orthokeratotic hyperkeratosis，hypergranulosis (which represents the clinical finding of striations)， and acanthosis 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>.\n\n【14】We propose an iconographic presentation describing the clinical and histological characteristics of patients with GLP treated at a tertiary hospital in the city of Sao Paulo/Brazil， in order to assist urologists and dermatologists to improve the diagnosis ofskin lesions.\n\n【15】Methodology\n\n【16】This is a retrospective study with male patients who received删除1换行treatment at a dermatology clinic of a tertiary hospital in the city of Sao Paulo， Brazil， between January 2009 and December 2019. All patients having a clinical and histopathological diagnosis of genital lichen planus were included.\n\n【17】The following aspects were analyzed in these patients： Age and comorbidities， presence of extragenital involvement of the skin and/or mucosa， time of progression， location， clinical form， and lace-like pattern (Wickham's striae， or the lack thereof) of the genitallesion.\n\n【18】The findings were included on a Microsoft Excel  spreadsheet in order to compare the clinical and histological data with each other.\n\n【19】Results\n\n【20】Seven patients were included， with a median age of 30.5 years and a mean age of 39.42±16.53 years. The lesion's median time of progression was six months， and the lesion's mean time ofprogression was 27.71±48.72 months. Four patients (57%) presented with some comorbidity， and the locations on the genital were： Glans penis (57%)， prepuce (28%)， balanopreputial sulcus (42%)， penis shaft (71%)， and penis base (14%)， with only one patient having a lesion in only one single anatomical site of his genital. All patients had a lace-like pattern corresponding to Wickham's striae， and the clinical forms present on the genital were： Annular (71%)， hypertrophic (14%)， and erosive (14%). Two patients (14%)had concomitant extragenital involvement of the skin and one patient， of the oral mucosa. Patients clinical aspects are illustrated in Figure 1， and their clinical data are shown in Table 1.\n\n【21】In regard to histological aspects， all patients presented with keratinocyte apoptosis at the dermoepidermal junction (100%)， with six cases (85%) having been observed in isolation and， in one patient (14%)， in a confluent manner. In all cases (100%) hydropic degeneration of the basal layer， acanthosis， hypergranulosis， and orthokeratotic hyperkeratosis were present. Lichenoid superficial perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate and pigmentary incontinence were also observed in all patients (100%). Band-like lymphocytic infiltrate was found in six cases (71%) in varying degrees； and in two cases (14%)， only an outline of this finding was observed； whereas in three cases (42%) this finding was observed in a more robust manner. Histological aspects are shown in Table 2 and Figure 2 illustrates the findings described.\n\n【22】In relation to laboratory tests， HIV， hepatitis C， hepatitis B， Anti-Nucleus Factor (ANA) serologies and a non-treponemal test for screening syphilis (VDRL) were conducted. Three patients (42%)had undergone complete laboratory screening， two (28%) had incomplete laboratorytests； and another two (28%)had undergone no laboratory screening tests. Three patients (42%)， who were coincidentally those having all laboratory test results， tested negative for all aspects surveyed. One patient (14%) tested negative for HIV， hepatitis and VDRL， but his other parameters had not been tested.

Thus， the histological findings were compatible with the classic description， since the epidermis was represented in the sample sent to the laboratory.

Self-correction exercises and active exercises for both upper limb and neck were explained to the patient. After3 weeks of physiotherapy intervention， the patient was reassessed. The pain was reduced to a VAS score of 0. Exercises help to improve mobility and reduce the stiffness in the neck. Postural correction also helps to create self-awareness. Every day physiotherapy sessions helped the girl not only to develop the habit of regular exercise and well being but also boost the confidence level of the child.\n\n【53】Klippel-Feil syndrome remains asymptomatic many times and intervention is only given only when symptoms are present.

Five weeks later， her serum creatinine fell to nearly normal.\n\n【12】Patient 3 was a 37-vear-old woman. She was admitted to our hospital following a week history of abdominal distension， acid reflux and bilateral loin pain after receiving inactivated COVID-19 vaccine. On admission， she was found to have a serum creatinine of 195umol/L with hematuria 2+and proteinuria 2+. The same patient was also found to have a mild thyroiditis on biochemical and immun ology assay and an anti-nuclear antibody ANA of 1 in 320. A kidney biopsy showed ATIN  with negative IF staining. She was treated with prednisolone at 1 mg/kg (55 mg in total) which was tapered off gradually. At her follow-up visit 3 months later，her serum creatinine had returned to near normal. The main characteristics and laboratory test results of the 3 patients are shown in Table 1，2.\n\n【13】Discussion\n\n【14】As the worldwide hospitalization rate and mortality rate are reduced through intensive and extensive vaccination On an international scale， the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines have drawn more public attention. Recently， there have been some reports about the development of de novo/relapse/worsening kidney diseases after COVID-19 vaccination. However， this is not the first-time vaccine has been implicated in kidney diseases. Influenza vaccine通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u> and tetanus-diphtheria-poliomyelitis vaccine 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u> have been reported to induce Minimal Change Disease (MCD). One study found viral RNA in inactivated influenza vaccines that might have contributed to the development of Anti-Neutrophil Cytoplasmic Antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>. But the mechanism of these vaccine-associated diseases remains unclear.\n\nInactivated COVID-19 vaccines should be the safest 通用删除6(英):<u>[12，13]</u> among all different vaccine types. Inactivated vaccines generally destroy the nucleic acid component of the virus rendering the virus non-infectious through physical or chemical methods. Therefore， only complete or partial virus particles with or without adjuvant are present in the vaccine. The immunogenic mechanism of inactivated|删除段之间换行|None of the 3 patients reported here were known to have past history of kidney disease or autoimmune disease. There may be a causal relationship between the vaccine and patient 1’s MN， because of the temporal relationship between the onsets of the PLA2R associated membranous nephropathy. We hypothesize that certain component in the vaccine may trigger a loss of tolerance to the PLA2R antigen on the podocyte， which ultimately leads to de novo MN. Patient 2 and 3 appeared to have positive ANA which would suggest they might carry a predisposition to immune-mediated disease. The immune response caused by inactivated vaccine or adjuvant may induce the development of de novo ATIN in such highly sensitive patients. We speculate that some components of the inactivated COVID-19 vaccine might induce abnormal regulation of the immune system in susceptible individuals， and lead to these new-onset kidney diseases. However， further studies are needed to elucidate the exact mechanisms in these conditions.\n\n【16】After the initial therapies， all 3 patients developed symptomatic relief and a favorable outcome. We believe that the renal sequelas of the inactivated vaccines are limited， and our treatment may be used\n\n| Table 2： Laboratory finding on admission.  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Patient 1  | Patient 2  | Patient 3  | Reterence interval  |\n| Urinalysis  |  |  |  |  |\n| Gravity  | 1.024  | 1.01  | 1.008  | 1.003-1.030  |\n| Sugar (mmol/L)  | NG  | NG  | 28  | <2.8  |\n| Blood (ery/ul)  | 0.3  | 0.3  | 0.3  | <0.3  |\n| Protein(g/L)  | 3.5  | 0.3  | 0.3  | <0.1  |\n| TPU (g/d)  | 1.9  | 0.268  | 0.193  | <0.14  |\n| RBC-Sediment (/ul)  | 70  | 18  | 3  | 0-18  |\n| WBC-Sediment (/ul)  | 24  | 21  | 29  | 0-23  |\n| COND—Sediment (Ms/cm)  | 28  | 8  | 6  | 15.1-27  |\n| Cast- Sediment(/ul)  | 2.08  | 0.91  | 0.62  | 0-2.5  |\n| B-J protein  | NEG  | NEG  | NEG  | NEG  |\n| Blood chemistry tests  |  |  |  |  |\n| HGB(g/L)  | 141  | 96  | 105  | 115-148  |\n| WBC (10^9/L)  | 8.95  | 8.42  | 7.63  | 3.89-9.93  |\n| Eosinophils(%)  | 2.80%  | 3.20%  | 3.50%  | 6-Jan  |\n| Neutrophils(%)  | 60.10%  | 73%  | 65.60%  | 44-72  |\n| TP(g/L)  | 49.9  | 82.5  | 80.6  | 66-87  |\n| Alb (g/L)  | 28.6  | 40.5  | 40.8  | 35-52  |\n| UA (mmol/L)  | 212.4  | 314.1  | 199.1  | 142.8-339.2  |\n| Urea nitrogenfmmol/L)  | 3.6  | 13.6  | 5.4  | 2.76-8.07  |\n| Creatinine(mmol/L)  | 48  | 337  | 215  | 44-80  |\n| TC (mmol/L)  | 8.58  | 3.72  | 3.34  | <5.2  |\n| ALT(IU/L)  | 8.3  | 32  | 2.7  | 0-33  |\n| AST(IU/L)  | 14.6  | 25  | 13.9  | 0-32  |\n| CRP (mg/L)  | 0.35  | 27.3  | 25.58  | <5  |\n| ANA  | 1：100  | 1：320  | 1：320  | <1：100  |\n| Anti-GBM antibody  |  |  | 删除8:<u>一 </u> |  |\n| PR3-ANCA (RU/ml)  | 删除8:<u>一 </u> |  |  |  |\n| MPO-ANCA (RU/ml)  | 删除8:<u>一 </u> | 删除8:<u>一 </u> | 删除8:<u>一 </u> |  |\n| PLA2R antibody (RU/ml)  | 48.12  | 删除8:<u>一 </u> |  | <15  |\n| Total IgE (IU/mL)  | NA  | 2486  | NA  | 0-100  |\n| SARS-CoV-2-IgG (S-CO)  |  | 删除8:<u>一 </u> | ±  | 0-1  |\n| Kidney biopsy  | MN  | ATIN  | ATIN  |  |\n\n【18】TPU： Total Protein Urinary； WBC： White Blood Cell； HGB： Hemoglobin； B-J protein： Bence-Jones Protein；ANA： Anti-Nuclear Antibody； TC： Total Cholesterol； ALT Alanine Aminotransferase； AST： Aspartate Aminotransferase； CRP： C-Reactive Protein； TP： Total Protein； Alb： Albumin； GBM： Glomerular Basement Membrane PLA-2R： Anti-Phospholipase A2 Receptor Antibody； UA： Uric Acid； ANCA： Anti-Neutrophil Cytoplasmic Antibodies； MN： Membranous Nephropathy； ATIN： Acute\n\n【19】Tubulo-Interstitia", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

Prompt diagnosis of these free floating thrombi is of utmost importance as they can embolize at any moment and thus require emergency treatment. Rarely these thrombi can extend into left atrium across a patent foramen ovale 通用删除6(英):<u>[5，6]</u>. We report an unusual case of acute pulmonary embolism with presence of a floating thrombus in right atrium with extension into left atrium through a patent foramen ovale.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 54 years old male patient presented in emergency department of our institute with chief complaints of sudden onset shortness ofbreath (NYHA class IV) for lasteight hours. On examination patient had tachycardia (pulse rate of 120 beats per min) and tachypnea (respiratory rate of 28/min) with hypotension (blood pressure： 90/62 mmHg). Electrocardiography (ECG) showed sinus tachycardia with non-specific ST/T changes. Troponin-I and D-Dimer values were raised. Transthoracic echocardiographic examination showed dilated right atrium (RA)， right ventricle(RV) and main pulmonary artery. There was RV systolic dysfunction [Tricuspid Annular Plane Systolic Excursion (TAPSE) =通用删除6(英):<u>16]</u> and moderate tricuspid regurgitation (TR gradient =75 mmHg). A large right atrial thrombus was seen  which was oscillating into right ventricle in diastole via tricuspid valve . Another thrombus was seen in left atrium  with presence of a defect in interatrial septum likely suggestive of patent foramen ovale . However continuity of thrombus across patent foramen ovale could not be demonstrated on echocardiographic examination.\n\n【7】Followed by this， patient underwent non ECG gated CT pulmonary angiography， which demonstrated a large partially occlusive thrombus in main pulmonary artery extending into right and left pulmonary arteries . A linear hypodense filling defect was seen in right atrium and ventricle  suggestive of thrombus. In addition filling defect was also noted in left atrium . On coronal reformatted images， continuity of thrombus across right and left atrium was demonstrated through a defect in interatrial septum . Doppler ultrasound for bilateral lower limbs did not show any evidence of deep venous thrombosis.\n\n【8】Based upon echocardiography and CT findings， a diagnosis of floating right atrial thrombus with extension across a patent foramen ovale with acute PTE was made.

The main objective of this article is to describe a technique for fabricating a hollow ocular prosthesis with the help of a soap spacer.\n\n【2】Keywords： Hollow； Ocular prosthesis； Soap spacer\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Loss of an eye can be caused by cancer， trauma， or congenital defects 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Such a loss leads to severe emotional trauma which affects the social and professional aspects of the individuals'life. The term“anophthalmic socket”is defined as an orbit not containing an eyeball， but with orbital soft tissues and eye-lid structures 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. In cases of large anophthalmic sockets， the use of a solid ocular prosthesis may lead to lower lid laxity and deep superior sulcus due to the weight of the prosthesis. A hollow ocular prosthesis would be lighter and yet large enough to occupy the evident residual ocular space 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>.\n\n【5】Numeroustechniques have been recommended to achieve weight reduction ofocularprostheses. Edias et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u> proposed a technique for making ocular prostheses for large anophthalmic cavities by introducing expanded polystyrene (Styrofoam) to the acrylic resin at the time of making the prosthetic sclera， aiming at reducing the weight of the prosthesis. The Styrofoam would be a part of the prosthesis； thus， adding some weight to the definitive prosthesis. Aggarwal et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u> described a two-step technique for acrylic resin packing with a wax spacer in between， which was later removed by lost wax technique.

On examination， the eyelids were intact， the tissue bed was healthy and adequate depth was present between the upper and the lower eyelids sufficient enough for the retention of an ocular prosthesis.\n\n【9】Procedure\n\n【10】A stock eye was selected which matched the iris color of the patient’s eye.\n\n【11】2) A putty impression (Zhermack Elite HD+) of the stock eye was made to create a mold. A special tray was fabricated using clear auto polymerizing acrylic resin (DPI， India) in the putty mold . The borders of the tray were adjusted in the socket and vent holes were made. A mixing tip was attached to this tray which served as a handle and also allowed the flow of the light body addition silicone material (Aquasil Dentsply) to record the impression of the tissue bed .\n\n【12】3) A mold type III dental stone was obtained using a two pour technique.\n\n【13】4) Modeling wax (Modeling Wax， Deepti Dental Products of India Pvt.

The patient was happy with the esthetics and comfort of the prosthesis.\n\n【19】Discussion\n\n【20】The aim of any prosthetic treatment is to bring the patient back to the society with a normal appearance. Glass was the material of choice for fabrication of ocular prosthesis till 1940s. With the invention and development of polymers， Polymethyl Methacrylate (PMMA) became the material of choice 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>. Custom made ocular prosthesis using PMMA has various advantages such as- it is non brittle， better adaptation hence adding comfort to the patient， improved esthetics， longer serviceability， and easy to repair or polish.\n\n【21】Various impression techniques have been reported in literature such as direct impression/external impression technique， using stock ocular tray， impression with custom ocular tray， impression with stock ocular prosthesis， and wax scleral blank technique. Various impression materials like irreversible hydrocolloid， ophthalmic alginate，polyvinylsiloxane，tissueconditioners， and dentalimpression waxes can be used.

Ultimately， improved diagnostic capabilities of spina bifida aperta can lead to enhanced prenatal counseling and better outcomes for affected pregnancies.\n\n【20】Case Presentation\n\n【21】A 27-year-old primigravida woman presented for routine prenatal care at 13 weeks of gestation. The patient had no significant family history related to neural tube defects. Transabdominal ultrasound screening was performed using a high-resolution transducer and three-dimensional ultrasound.\n\n【22】The ultrasound examination revealed a midline defect in the lumbosacral region of the fetus’s spine. A detailed assessment of the defect showed a sac-like protrusion containing cerebrospinal fluid， indicating the presence of spina bifida aperta. The visualization of the defect and the associated findings were consistent with the diagnosis of this neural tube defect.\n\n【23】To further confirm the diagnosis and obtain additional anatomical details， Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) was conducted. The MRI findings were in concordance with the ultrasound results， confirming the presence ofthe spinal defect and providing precise delineation of the associated structural abnormalities.\n\n【24】Given the diagnostic findings and after thorough counseling， the patient opted for the termination of the pregnancy. Subsequently， a histopathological examination was performed on the fetus.\n\n【25】Gross examination of the fetus revealed an open defect in the spinal column ， confirming the presence of spina bifida aperta. The defect corresponded to the previously identified midline defect observed during the ultrasound and MRI examinations.\n\n【26】Microscopic analysis of the spinal cord tissue obtained from the affected area demonstrated dysplastic changes， indicative ofabnormal development. The examination also revealed the herniation of neural elements through the defect， further confirming the diagnosis of spina bifida aperta.\n\n【27】Histological staining techniques allowed for detailed evaluation of the cellular architecture and structural changes within the spinal cord tissue. The dysplastic features included disorganized cell layers， abnormal neuronal migration， and disrupted neural connectivity. These histopathological findings provided further insight into the underlying pathology associated with spina bifida aperta.\n\n【28】The combination of the prenatal ultrasound screening， MRI， and histopathological examination provided a better understanding of the diagnosis of spina bifida aperta in this case. The initial ultrasound findings were subsequently validated by the MRI， and the histopathological examination served as definitive confirmation， providing detailed insights into the structuraland cellular abnormalities originally causing the condition.\n\n【29】Discussion\n\n【30】Open spina bifida， also known as spina bifida aperta is a neural tube defect involving the lack of closure of vertebral arches and associated meninges and/or spinal cord abnormalities.

In addition， there was a rule that LD should be defined after 15mins'repetition， thus， it was clarified that LD is ominous not due to its late appearance after uterine contraction， but due to its frequent repetition， which was the same in the other FHR decelerations， thus， novel Hypoxia Index (HI) was the sum of all FHR deceleration durations (min). That showed the total duration of hypoxia as the heart rate was closely parallel to the PaO， lower than 50 mmHg in rabbit divided by the lowest FHR， which showed the hypoxic intensity， in fetal monitoring， and multiplied by 100 to make the index integer 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. The first target of the Hypoxia Index (HI) was the prevention of infantile cerebral palsy， where the HI was studied retrospectively in 22 infants who diagnosed by pediatric doctors， and intrapartum FHR record was preserved in obstetrics， of which HI was calculated.\n\n【18】Results： There was significant difference of cerebral palsy case numbers between 6 cases， whose HI was 25 or more， and 16 no cerebral palsy cases， whose HI was 24 or less 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>.\n\n【19】Discussion 1： The HI of all 6 cases of cerebral palsy was 25 or more， while the HI of all 16 cases of no cerebral palsy was 24 or less. Thus， infantile cerebral palsy caused by intrapartum damage is prevented when HI is 24 or less in fetal monitoring. The HI is adopted all FHR decelerations including early， late and variable decelerations， as no lag time is included in the HI calculation， as well as sudden continuous fetal bradycardia. HI was evaluated in intrapartum FHR records of6 cases of cerebral palsy and 16 infants of no cerebral palsy， who were diagnosed by Pediatricians.\n\n【20】Discussion 2： Cerebral palsy will be prevented， if the HI is 24 or less in intrapartum fetal monitoring. The 25 or more HI cases can receive very earlytherapy for the treatment of cerebral palsy in neonatal stage， which will improve the therapeutic results of cerebral palsy. As late deceleration disappeared by maternal lateral posture， lateral posture is recommended in all of decelerations 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. The pattern classification method will be replaced by the objective numeric indices， where neonatal Apgar score and umbilical cord blood pH will be predicted by FHR score and also from the HI using regression equations， and reported attendant doctor in computerized FHR diagnosis. As the fetal blood pH is predicted also by the deceleration area by Cahill et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>， fetal evaluation will be revolutionary changed to digital analysis.\n\n【21】Conclusion： All FHR decelerations are evaluated with HI. Cerebral palsy is prevented， if the HI is 24 or less in the birth. Early cerebral palsy treatment can be started in neonatal stage. Lateral posture is recommended in all decelerations.\n\n【22】Table 1： Hypoxia Index (HI) was 25 or more in all of 6 cerebral palsy cases， while HI was 24 or less in all of 16 no cerebral palsy cases.\n\n| Hypoxia Index  | Cerebral palsy cases  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Hypoxia Index  | Yes  | No  |\n| 25 or more  | 6  | 0  |\n| 24 orless  | 0  | 16  |\n\n【24】Cerebral palsy cases'y2test： P=0.0008<0.05， significant difference", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

A careful history，physical examination， radiology and endoscopy may reveal the exact pathology which may be in larynx， trachea or bronchus and so with a proper diagnosis， the management is successful with a faster recovery and a cure 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. This misdiagnosis as asthma mayproduce a psychological trauma to parents and repeated visits to clinics will result into loss of working days and a monetary loss to parents as well as to state treasuries too. Wheezing is very common in children (40%) and by six years ofage， almost one half of children will have had at least one episode of wheezing. In children younger than 5 years， asthma is the most likely cause of recurrent wheezing but other causes should be considered in the differential diagnosis. The diagnosis ofa vocal cord dysfunction can be made using direct laryngoscopy， only during symptomatic periods or after the exercise 通用删除6(英):<u>[2，3]</u>. A stridor may be produced by other glottis pathologies like glottis cysts， vocal cord granulations， polyps and papilloma. Aspirated foreign bodies， stuck up in larynx， can lead to persistent cough with dyspnea and a stridor and by going further down it may produce a generalized wheezing， necessitating an endoscopic retrieval 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. Commonly found aspirated foreign bodies are food particles and seeds (70% of all episodes)， metallic or plastic pieces of toys or house hold items. The sudden onset of wheezing and choking may indicate foreign body aspiration， which warrants immediate bronchoscopy. If the history or physical examination suggests asthma， clinical guidelines recommend pulmonary function testing 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. Stridor with drooling suggests the diagnosis of epiglottitis and there may be congenital anomalies involving the air passages.\n\n【5】In this study， six different etiologies irrespective ofage or sex and duration or site of lesion were taken up， to understand common antilogies which may be misinterpreted as bronchial asthma but can be diagnosed correctly by simple X-rays or CT scans and an endoscopy.\n\n【6】Case Series\n\n【7】Case 1\n\n【8】(Glottis pathology-Foreign body) One year old girl was having SOB and cough for 3 months， after swallowing pieces of a cloth pin (plastic). The mother removed it from child’s mouth but the cough continued with a hoarse week crying sound and occasionally with a mild to moderate stridor. The patient was diagnosed and being treated repeatedly for asthma. The chest X-ray was found non informative. An FFL was indicated but due to its unavailability a rigid direct laryngoscopy was done which revealed a piece ofplastic cloth pin lying in between the true vocal cords， hooked at anterior commissure . Immediate after the FB extraction， the stridor disappeared and in next 3days the crying became normal.\n\n【9】Case 2\n\n【10】(Glottic pathology-papilloma) A four years old girl was being treated off and on for dyspnoea， stridor and cyanosis with a diagnosis of asthma， for about a month. The chest X-ray was found normal. Again a FFL was indicated but due to its non-availability， a rigid direct laryngoscopy was done which revealed an obstructive papillomatous growth on superior surface of both true vocal cords .\n\n【11】An emergency tracheostomy had to be performed and then through RDL， an excisional biopsy of the glottic growth was done. The histology confirmed it to be a papilloma. After a check direct laryngoscopy (before the decannulation) and with a gradual decannulation， the tracheostomy tube was removed after a week.\n\n【12】Case 3\n\n【13】(Supra glottic pathology-cyst) A four months old child， mature at birth， had persistent cough， wheeze and stridor， for two months. The chest X-ray was normal. A provisional diagnosis of Laryngomalacia/Bronchial asthma was made and due to non availability of FFL， a RFL was performed which revealed a， 0.5 cm size， round cyst on superior surface of epiglottis with its left edge extending to vallecula pushing the left side of epiglottis downwards. The cyst wall was excised and a mucoid fluid was drained. Few granulations were also seen over left false vocal cord near the arytenoid. True vocal cords， sub glottis and trachea were found normal. Post operativelythe wheezing disappeared though the hoarseness persisted for 2 weeks. Histology report from the cyst in vallecula revealed it to be a retention cyst contents with inflammatory cells and the granulations tissues from the false vocal cord showed “Fibromyxoid spindle cell proliferation”.\n\n【14】Case 4\n\n【15】(Glottic inflammatory. pathology-Sub acute inflammation) A nine months old child had a hoarse and low volume crying sound with a persistent dry cough and respiratory distress， for 2 weeks. There was no history of respiratory tract infection. The child was known to be asthmatic. Clinically and radiologically the chest was clear. The CBC was found normal. A RFL (as FFL was not available) revealed congestion and edema on true vocal cords. The child was treated for subacute Laryngitis with steroids and antibiotics and in seven days the patient recovered fully.\n\n【16】Case 5\n\n(Subglottic Pathology- FB) A nine months old child had breathlessness， noisy breathings for about two weeks and fever for 1week. She was being treated for bronchial asthma without any relief. The patient had mild inspiratory stridor with bilateral conducted|删除段之间换行|sounds in lungs. Incidentally a chest X-ray was advised which revealed a radio-opaque， 5 mmx3 mm， rectangular FB in subglottic region .\n\n【18】The child was taken to operation theatre for a RFL but an emergency tracheostomy had to be performed first， because of the falling oxygen saturation. Through RFL the metallic FB was extracted， from the subglottic region.\n\n【19】Case 6\n\n【20】(Oesophageal Pathology- FB) A two years old child had cough， wheezing and choking with drooling of saliva for 2 weeks， more so during getting feeds， which was liquid only. The child was being treated for suspected bronchial asthma but without any benefit so a chest X-ray was advised which revealed a coin in upper third of oesophagus . Coin found partially eroded. A RFL was used to extract the coin. The surfaces of the coin were found partially eroded and rusted due to its long stay inside the oesophagus.\n\n【21】Discussion\n\nRegarding the age factor， the cases in our study group， were in between 4 months to 4 years， similar to studies in the United States(between 1988 and 1994) which showed that the prevalence for|删除段之间换行|| S.No.  | Site/age/sex  | Pathology  | Diag.by  | Remarks  | Managed by  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1  | Glottic/1 year/F  | F.B.(Plastic piece)  | RFL-  | Duration-3 Months (Cough， Hoarseness and Mild Stridor)  | RFL-Extraction  |\n| 2  | Glottic/4 years/F  | Papilloma  | RFL-  | Duration 1 Month， (off and on-SOB， Stridor andCyanosis)  | RFL-Excision  |\n| 3  | Supra-Glottic/4 months-/F  | Cyst and Granulations  | RFL-  | Duration 2 Months (Persistent Cough， Wheezes and Stridor)  | RFL-Excision  |\n| 4  | Glottic/9 months/-M  | Inflammation  | RFL  | Duration 2 Weeks， (Cough， Hoarseness and a WeakSound on Crying)  | RFL-Diagnostic  |\n\n【23】Limitations\n\n【24】The cases were selected as per different aetiologies so this study is only for discussion of different aetiologies and their clinical confusing presentation as bronchial asthma (not in relation to incidence/sex/age).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

Due to high toxicity，stability and diverse structures， aflatoxins in food chain is an increasing global food safety concern. This study sought to isolate and identify aflatoxigenic fungi， as well as detect the presence of Aflatoxin in food and feed samples. Grains and kernels from various agricultural produces were collected from regions in and around Mysore. Fungal cultures obtained from the samples were subjected to morphological， microscopical examinations； followed by chemical and chromatographic studies. The HPLC analysis indicated 129/220 fungal isolates produced aflatoxins and showed a population distribution of 43% of A. flavus， 29% of A. parasiticus，7% of A. furnigatus， 7% of A. oryzae，5% of A. ochraceus， 4% of A. versicolor and 3% of A. tamarii and 2% of A. niger.\n\n【2】Keywords： Aflatoxins； ITS sequencing； HPLC； TLC； Aspergillus\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Globalization of the food industry has led to the vast spread of food commodities and also illnesses related it， which are mostly caused by fungi with Aspergillus flavus being an important postharvest fungus in grain stores. Along with their secondary metabolites termed as “Mycotoxins， fungal infestation has raised concern on public health due to their toxic properties 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Among them， Aflatoxin (AF) contamination in food has gained importance worldwide due to their hazardous impact on both human and animal populations as carcinogens， mutagens and teratogens 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. Aflatoxins are a group of difuranocoumarin derivatives produced through the polyketide pathway by filamentous fungi of the genus Aspergillus. Mycotoxins produced by members of Aspergillus are commonly known as \"Aflatoxins\". The main producers include species of A. flavus， A. furnigates， A. parasiticus and A. nomius that are predominant in tropical and subtropical regions 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. There are about 20 different types of AFs identified as byproducts of Aspergillus contamination in food commodities such as cereals， nuts， fruits， oilseeds， and dried fruits both in field and storage 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. The most predominant AFs in food，agriculture， and dairy products that are designated as Aflatoxin B1， B2， G1， G2， M1， and M2 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. Among these， Aflatoxins B1 (AFB1) is classified as a group 1A carcinogen by International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) due to its substantial liver damage and hepatocellular carcinoma apart from plentiful of deleterious health conditions 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>.\n\n【5】Activities during crop cultivation (preharvest， harvest and postharvest)， and other factors such as temperature， humidity and pest damage affect the level of infection of grains by mycotoxigenic fungi. Aflatoxin contaminated food and feed incur huge losses to farming communities as the harvest is made unwholesome for consumption. Aflatoxin contamination of 88% with concentration of5 ug/kg and 14 g/kg (AFB1)， 58 g/kg (AFG1) was reported in stored maize in Benin respectively通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. Agbetiameh et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>， reported that 35% of 509 (326 maize and 183 groundnut) samples had detectable aflatoxin 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>. A study conducted in Doha， Qatar revealed aflatoxin contamination in spices and nut samples as 371.6 ng/g and 534.15 ng/g， respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>. Al-Jaal et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u> highlighted the limitations on studies of aflatoxin contamination of food and feed globally and in the Gulf Cooperation Council countries (GCC). In recent years， numerous studies have revealed high levels of aflatoxins and fungal contamination in rice in many countries 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>. However， mycotoxin-producing fungi are less commonly reported for rice than for many other cereal crops 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>.\n\n【6】In order to protect the consumers from the aflatoxin effects， many countries have set stringent删除1换行regulations in monitoring and surveillance of aflatoxin levels in for human food as well as animal feed. The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) limit AF concentration to 15 ppb to30 ppb (parts per billion). According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 通用删除7(英):<u>(2002)</u>， the concentration of AFs in the range of 4 ppb to 30 ppb is allowed in human food， depending on the importing countries. In the United States， the maximum limit of aflatoxin in the human food - except for milk is 20 ppb， while in the European Union it is 2 ppb to 4 ppb通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>.\n\n【7】According to Sowley 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>， the prevalence of mycotoxins， especially aflatoxins and its associated health problems is a silent threat in developing countries where most of the people are oblivious of the dangers associated with the consumption of contaminated produce. Therefore， monitoring and management of mycotoxins in food and feed is an important prerequisite in food industry. The objective of the study was to isolate and identify aflatoxigenic fungi and detect aflatoxin in various food samples from farms， stores and markets in and around Mysore， Karnataka，India.\n\n【8】Methods\n\n【9】Chemicals and reagents\n\n【10】Mycotoxins (Aflatoxin B1(AFB1)， Aflatoxin B2 (AFB2)，Aflatoxin G1 (AFG1)， Aflatoxin G2 (AFG2)， Ochratoxin A (OTA)， Fumonisin B1 (FB1)， Patulin， Citrinin， Zearalonone (ZEA)， Deoxynivalenol(DON) and T-2 toxin)， Potassium Chloride (KCl)， Sodium Chloride(NaCl)， hemin， TMB (3，3'，5，5'-Tetramethylbenzidine) substrate reagent set， Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA)， Potato Dextrose Broth(PDB)， Coconut Cream Agar (CCA)， chloroform， acetone， methanol acetonitrile and glacial acetic acid required for present study were procured from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis， USA) unless mentioned删除1换行otherwise. All the solutions were prepared with ultra-high purity water. All other solvents and reagents used in the experiments were of analytical grade. Ultrapure water (Mill-Q， Millipore， India) was used throughout this study. Standards of mycotoxins were prepared according to manufactures protocol and diluted from stock solutions to working concentration (1 mg/mL) in absolute methanol (HPLC grade).\n\n【11】Collection of samples suspected for fungal contamination\n\n【12】As it isknown， foodandfeedareconsidered as the major reservoirs of aflatoxin producers； grains and kernels from various agricultural produces namely， wheat， paddy， maize， groundnut， sorghum， and spices viz.，chili， and pepper were collected from regions in and around Mysore， India. All the samples were weighed to a sample size of 250gm， respectively and stored at 4℃ for the isolation， identification and molecular detection of Aspergillus species and further analysis of the extracted aflatoxins. The schematic representation adapted in the present work for isolation of aflatoxigenic fungi is depicted in the Figure 1.\n\n【13】Physical examination\n\n【14】Isolation of aflatoxin producers from the fungal isolates： The isolation of fungal strains from the collected samples was performed according to Abbas et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>. Initially， the grains and kernels were surface sterilized by rinsing 3 to 4 times with distilled water followed by thorough washing in 1% Sodium hypochlorite + 0.1% Tween 20for 10 min to 15 min by rapid shaking. This was followed by final washing of 3 to 5 times in sterile distilled water for 5 min each. Disinfected samples were allowed to air dry on blotting paper.Grains and kernels of 4 to 6 numbers were added to 1% Potato Dextrose Broth (PDB) and incubated at 25°C for 48 h to 72 h. After incubation，删除表格换行the grains suspected of fungal growth were transferred onto petri-dishes containing 1% Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA) and incubated at 25°C for 2 to 4 days. The resultant fungal colonies on PDA petri plates were further observed and purified. Obtained fungal isolates were subjected to screening and identification by morphology， microscopy， molecular and chromatographic methods as discussed in the following sections.\n\n【15】Table 1： List of standard fungal cultures utilized in the present work\n\n| S.No  | Name of the fungal strain  | Source  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1  | Aspergillus fiavus  | NCIM 152  |\n| 2  | Aspergillus parasiticus  | MTCC 2797  |\n| 3  | DFR11  | DFRL， Mysore， India  |\n| 4  | DFR12  | DFRL， Mysore， India  |\n| 5  | DFR13  | DFRL， Mysore， India  |\n\n【17】The single spore cultures of Aspergillus isolates were subcultured on PDA slants， overlayed with 5% glycerol and maintained in 4C. The reference strains and Aspergillus isolates available from the in-house repository were also utilized as positive controls in the present study and are listed in the Table 1.\n\n【18】Microscopical analysis of Aspergillus species： Obtained fungal colonies were examined for their phenotypic morphologies as per Diba et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u>. The fungal isolates with characteristic morphologies similar to Aspergillus species were selected and further studied by microscopy using lactophenol cotton blue stain. The slides were then viewed under the light microscope (NIS-Elements imaging software， Nikon， India) and examined for characteristic features of Aspergillus species.\n\n【19】Chemical analysis\n\n【20】Ammonium vapor test： Ammonium vapor test was performed on 3-day old fungal cultures as per Fani et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>. The cultures grown on Coconut Cream Agar medium (CCA) according to Degola et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>， containing fungal colonies were placed upside down， and a drop(approximately200ul)of 25% ammonia solution (v/v) wasaddedonto the lid of each fungal petri-dish and color development was carefully observed. Pink color pigmentation upon contact with ammonium vapors served as an indication for the aflatoxin production and these isolates were selected for further analysis.\n\n【21】Ultraviolet (UV) light test： For Ultraviolet (UV) light test， the fungal colonies were grown on CCA plates at 28°C for 5 to 7 days and tested for characteristic blue fluorescence on the reverse side of each petri-dish under long-wavelength (365 nm) UV light.\n\n【22】Molecular analysis\n\nFungal DNA extraction： Genomic DNA extraction from fungal samples was carried out using phenol： Chloroform： Isoamyl alcohol method. A loopful of mycelium or spore suspension from purified fungal isolates was inoculated into 50 ml of sterile Potato Dextrose Broth (PDB) (Himedia， Mumbai， India). The inoculated PDB flasks were incubated at room temperature for 48 h to 72 h with mild agitation of 100 rpm. The mycelium growth was harvested from the inoculated flasks by filtration through Whatman filter paper No. 3and snap-frozen with liquid nitrogen. The frozen mycelium was pulverized and ground to powdered form using a sterile mortar， pestle and stored at -20°C until further use. A small amount of mycelial powder was collected into a sterile 1.5 ml eppendorftube and crushed with micropestle and 500 ul of lysis buffer (pH 8) (100 mM Tris-HCl，|删除段之间换行|50 mM EDTA， 150 mM NaCl and 10% SDS) was added and kept in a water bath for 5 min at 60°C. After boil lysis， the suspension was allowed to cool and 10 ul of 100 ug/ml proteinase K was added and incubated at 56°C for 1 h. After protein lysis， equal volumes of phenol (approximately 500 pl) was added and centrifuged at 12000rpm for 5 min at 4C conditions. The supernatant was collected in a fresh eppendorf tube and 200 ul of chloroform： Isoamyl alcohol(24：1， v/v)， 200 pl of phenol was added and mixed thoroughly by inverting the tubes. Tubes were then centrifuged at 12000 rpm for 5min at 4°C. The supernatant was collected in a fresh tube and phenol， chloroform； isoamyl alcohol step was repeated 3 times. Collected supernatants were pooled together and equal volumes of chloroform were added and subjected to centrifugation at 12，000 rpm for 5 min at4C. Supernatants thus collected were treated with 500 ul of ice-cold ethanol or isopropanol and incubated at -80°C for 30 min. After DNA precipitation the tubes were subjected to centrifugation at 12，000 rpm for 10 min at 4C. The DNA pellets were washed two times with 70%ethanol (v/v) and dried in a vacuum chamber. Resultant DNA was resuspended in 50 ul of Tris-EDTA and stored at -20°C until further iise|删除段之间换行|Screening of aflatoxin positive fungal isolates by gene-specific PCR： Gene-specific PCR targeting two genes of the metabolic pathway encoding toxin chemotypes viz.，nor-1 and aflR for aflatoxin production in fungal isolates were conducted 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>. The primers for the targeted genes are mentioned in the Table 2. Each PCR reaction consisted of 20 ul of reaction volume with 1x PCR buffer， 1.5 mM of MgCl2， 80 uM of each dNTPs， 1.0 U of Taq polymerase， 10 ng to 00 ng of template DNA and 6 uM each of forward and reverse primers. The reaction was carried out for 35 cycles in Eppendorf master thermal cycler (Hamburg， Germany) with denaturation at 94℃ for 1 min， annealing of 56°C， 58°C for nor-1 gene and afiR gene， respectively for 1 min， extension at 72°C for 1 min. The DNA was initially denatured for 5 min at 94°C and finally extended for 8min at 72°C before termination of the amplification. PCR amplicons thus obtained were resolved on 1% agarose gel by electrophoresis technique and visualized under UV transilluminator.\n\n【24】Identification0ofafatoxinpositivefungalisolatesby Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) sequencing： The species-level identification of plausible aflatoxin positive fungal isolates was carried out by the Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) sequencing. The amplification of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS1-5.8S-ITS2) region in ribosomal DNA (rDNA) of fungal isolates by PCR was performed and sequencing of the amplicons for identification of the isolates was carried out.\n\n【25】PCR amplification of Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) region： Genomic DNA of the aflatoxin positive fungal isolates was used as a template for the PCR amplification of their IT'S regions.

Each PCR reaction of consisted of the 2.5 pl of 1x PCR buffer， 2.0 pl of 2.5 mM dNTPs， 1.5 ul of each primers ITS1 and ITS4 (10 pmol/ml)， 1.0 pl of50 mM MgCl2，0.2 ul Taq DNA polymerase (5U/ml)， 1.0 ul of 10 ng/ml DNA and 15.3 ul of distilled water. The PCR reaction was carried out in Eppendorf master thermal cycler (Hamburg， Germany) and the program was set with an initial denaturation of DNA for 4 min at95°C followed by 35 cvcles. Each amplification cvcle consisted of three steps： Denaturation for 60 sec at 95℃， annealing for 45 sec at 56℃and elongation for 2 min at 72℃. Final elongation of 72℃ for 8 min删除表格换行was used at the termination of the program. The resultant amplified products were analyzed by gel electrophoresis on 1% agarose gel in1x TBE buffer. The resolved gel was then visualized under UV light and the desired amplicons of 550 bps were excised and gel purified by GenElute Gel Extraction kit (Sigma， Bangalore， India).\n\n| Table 2： Primer sequences used in the present work  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Gene  | Primer  | Sequence 通用删除7(英):<u>(5-3)</u>  | Size (bp)  | References  |\n| nor-1  | nor1F  | TTGGCCGCCAGCTTCGACA  | 367  | In this study  |\n| nor-1  | nor1R  | TCGCTGAAGGCAGTCGGAT  | 367  | In this study  |\n| aniR  | afiR Fwd  | GCACCTGTCTTCCCTAACA  | 400  | Priyanka et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>.  |\n| aniR  | afiR Rev  | ACGAACATGCTCAGCAAGTA  | 400  | Priyanka et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>.  |\n| ITS  | ITS 1  | TCCGTAGGTGAACCTGCGG  | 550-600  | White et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u>.  |\n| ITS  | ITS4  | TCCTCCGCTTATTGATATG  | 550-600  | White et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u>.  |\n\n【27】Sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region：The gel purified PCR products encoding ITS regions were sequenced according to Sanger et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u>. The sequencing reaction was maintained at a volume of 10 ul， containing 2.0 ul of ITS4 primer， 4.0ul of a premix of Dynamic ET terminator (Amersham Biosciences) and 4.0 pl of the purified ITS -PCR product (100 ng/ml). The PCR tubes were then placed in the Mastercycler thermocydler gradient(Eppendorf) and set to perform 35 cycles with the conditions of initial denaturation for 2 min at 95°C， followed by denaturation for1 min at 95℃， annealing for 1 min at 55℃， elongation for 1 min at60℃ and final elongation for 5 min at 60C. Analysis of the resultant sequences was performed by ABI 3500 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems，USA). The obtained sequences were compared with those available in the GenBank of the National Center for Biotechnology and Information (NCBI)， using the BLAST search tool 通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u>.\n\n【28】Chromatographic analysis\n\n【29】Extraction and cleanup of mycotoxins： Depending on the matrices of the test samples， the toxin extraction procedure was performed with slight modifications. The samples size of 50 gm for solid samples (food) and 100 ml for samples in liquid state was used in the extraction procedure. Non fatty test samples such as wheat， maize， and sorghum were mixed with 100 ml of methanol： water(55：45， v/v) and for samples with fatty matrices and spices， like groundnuts， chili， pepper， and turmeric， 2 gm of NaCl and 50 ml of hexane were additionally added to the above mentioned solvent system. The samples were then blended in a blending jar at high speed for 5 min to 10 min and filtered through Whatman No.4 filter paper. The filtrate was mixed with equal volumes of chloroform and shaken vigorously for 1 min to 2 min and left undisturbed for separation. The lower phase was collected and evaporated to near dryness under a gentle stream of liquid nitrogen. The sample was then redissolved in 10 ml of methanol： Water (80：20， v/v). Further clean-up of the extracted toxin was preceded with specific immunoaffinity columns(LCTech， Germany) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Elutions were collected in 2 ml methanol and stored at- 20°C until further use. Standard aflatoxin B1 (AFB1)， B2 (AFB2)， G1 (AFG1)， G2 (AFG2)， Citrinin (CIT)， Deoxynivalenol (DON)， Fumonisin B1 (FB1)， Ochratoxin A (OTA)， Patulin (PAT)， T2 toxin (T2) and Zearalenone (ZEA) (Sigma-Aldrich， USA) were prepared according to the supplier’s instructions.\n\n【30】Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC)： Toxin extracts and aflatoxin standards (AFB1， B2， G1， and G2) of 10 ul each were spotted on thin-layer chromatography Silica gel 60 F254 plates (Merck， Darmstadt，\n\n【31】Germany) in dark conditions. The plates were developed in the mobile phase consisting of chloroform： acetone solution (85：15， v/v) for 60min and air-dried for 3 min to 5 min in dark conditions. The plates were then visualized under long wavelength Ultraviolet (UV) light(365 nm) for the presence of fluorescent spots viz.， blue color (AFB1and AFB2) and green color (AFG1 and AFG2). The Retardation Factor (Rf) values were calculated and compared to the Rf values of the aflatoxin standards. The solvent phase (chloroform： Acetone)and extracts from non-toxigenic isolates were used as the negative control in the experiment.\n\n【32】High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC)：Quantitative and qualitative analysis of the aflatoxin extracted from fungal isolates and suspected food samples was carried out using HPLC analysis as per Priyanka et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u>， with minor modifications Toxin extracts and aflatoxin standards of 10 ul each were injected onto the RP-C18 column (Jasco， UK) with dimensions of 3 umx250mmx 46 mm. The analysis was performed on a JASCO HPLC system(JASCO， UK) with a fluorescence detector at wavelength settings of emission at 365 nm and excitation at 455 nm with a flow rate of 0.8ml/min and mobile phase consisting of water： Acetonitrile： Glacial acetic acid (52：47：1，v/v/v). For other mycotoxins (OTA，DON， and ZEA) emission wavelengths were set at 365，336 and 262 nm at a flow rate of 1.2 ml/min. Fumonisin B1 (FB1) was analyzed using a UV detector with an excitation wavelength of 455 nm and a flow rate of0.8 ml/min. The solvent system consisted of methanol： Acetonitrile：Acetic acid (50：40：10 v/v)， methanol： Water (70：30 v/v)， methanol：Water (80：20 v/v)， acetonitrile： Water (40：60) for OTA， FB1，DON， and ZEA respectively.\n\n【33】Result and Discussion Isolation of Aspergillus species from diverse sources\n\n【34】A total of 220 fungal cultures were isolated from the collected food and agricultural samples suspected for fungal infestation. These isolates were screened for the presence of aflatoxin producers by phenotypic characters， chromatography and molecular methods. The Figure 2 depicts the morphological and biochemical tests performed on the fungal isolates in the present study. As a preliminary step in screening， macro and micro-morphological features were observed and 196 isolates were screened with characteristics morphologies of Aspergillus strains. The presumptive Aspergillus isolates were then screened for aflatoxin production by ammonium vapors test and UV light test . A total of 188 isolates developed pink color pigmentation upon contact with ammonium vapors and characteristic blue fluorescence under long wavelength (365 nm) of UV light. For further confirmation and identification； tests such as molecular methods (gene-specific PCR， ITS sequencing) and chromatography(TLC and HPLC) were performed for the fungal isolates.\n\n【35】Identification of aflatoxigenic Aspergillus species\n\n【36】The suspected fungal isolates were subjected to genomic DNA\n\n【37】Table 3： List of aflatoxin producing isolates obtained in the present study.\n\n【38】amplicon size against 100 bps DNA ladder.\n\n| Species name  | ITS  | TLC  | HPLC  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| A. iavus  | 80  |  |  |\n| A. fumigatus  | 13  | 1  | 删除8:<u>一 </u> |\n| A. niger  | 4  | 1  | 删除8:<u>一 </u> |\n| A. oryzae  | 4  | 删除8:<u>门 </u> |  |\n| A. ochraceus  | 10  | 删除8:<u>门 </u> | 删除8:<u>一 </u> |\n| A. parasiticus  | 55  | 52  | 52  |\n| A. tamarn  | 6  | 删除8:<u>门 </u> |  |\n| A. versicolor  | 5  | 0  | 删除8:<u>一 </u> |\n| Total  | 177  | 131  | 129  |\n\n【40】extraction by phenol， chloroform， isoamyl alcohol method. Obtained DNA  were utilized in the molecular methods for further screening and characterization of the aflatoxin producing isolates.\n\n【41】Putative fungal isolates screened from the morphological and biochemical tests were examined for the presence of aflatoxin encoding genes namely nor-1 and afiR-1. Gene-specific PCR amplification of nor-1 and aftR-1 was carried out with the respective primers mentioned in the Table 2. Amplicons of 367 bps and 400bps were considered positive for the presence of nor-1  and aflR-1  genes respectively. A total of 178 isolates from 188were found positive for the presence of one or both the genes (nor-1，170 isolates； aflR， 168 isolates).\n\n【42】Fungal isolates positive for aflatoxin encoding genes were删除1换行subjected to sequencing for the identification of Aspergillus species. Sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS1-5.8S-ITS2) of ribosomal DNA (rDNA) was performed by amplification of the region by IT'S1 and ITS4 primers  with standardized PCR program. An amplicon of 550 bps  was gel purified and utilized for sequencing procedure. The BLAST analysis of resultant nucleotide sequences and comparison with those available at Gen Bank， NCBI， 通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u> revealed a total of 177 out of 220 fungal isolates as members of Aspergillus family. The percentage distribution of members of Aspergillus family recovered in the present study is depicted in  accounting for 43% of A. flavus， 29% of A. parasiticus， 7% of A. fumnigatus， 7% of A. oryzae， 5% of A. ochraceus， 4% of A. versicolor and 3% of A. tamarii and 2% of A. niger.\n\n【43】Chromatographicanalysis 1 toxin extracts from Aspergillus species\n\n【44】Chromatographic analysis (TLC and HPLC) of the mycotoxin extracts from the Aspergillus isolates was performed as the confirmatory tests for the presence of aflatoxin. The toxin extracts from the isolates were spotted on silica gel plates and tested by TLC method. When visualized under UV light， the spots on the silica gel plates emitted blue and green fluorescence indicating the presence of Aflatoxin B1， B2， and Aflatoxin G1， G2 respectively . The Rf values of the test toxins were compared to that of the standard aflatoxin values and observations were drawn. A total of131 Aspergillus isolates were able to produce extracts emitting blue fluorescence suggesting AFB production 通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u>.\n\n【45】The toxin extracts found positive for the presence of blue fluorescence form TLC analysis were subjected to High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). A volume of 20 ul of the extracts was loaded into the HPLC system and analyzed. The Retention time(tR) and area of the peak were noted down and compared with values of the standard AFB1. The observations as depicted in Figure 9，删除1换行isolates.删除2换行showed similar Retention time (tR) intervals of 8.114 min as that of the standard AFB1 and the respective peak areas revealed the quantitative analysis of the aflatoxin present in the extracts. Among the tested 131Aspergillus isolates， 77 of A. flavus and 52 of A. prasiticus were found to produce AFB1 whereas the remaining TLC positive Aspergillus members did not produce aflatoxins .\n\n【46】Conclusion\n\n【47】A total of 220 fungal cultures were isolated from the collection and were screened morphologically and examined for microscopic features. Isolates were further screened by biochemical， molecular methods and identified by ITS sequencing. HPLC analysis revealed129 isolates for aflatoxin production (77 of A. flavus and 52 of A. prasiticus). From our observation， it is recommended to carryout routine analysis of grains， food and feed in order to limit aflatoxin contamination in food chain. Management strategies should therefore be oriented to avoid fungal colonization during the crops and storage areas to avoid production of mycotoxins.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

His best-corrected visual acuity was 1.2 and 0.7 in the right and left eye， respectively. A serous retinal detachment in the posterior fundus was observed in both eyes. He was diagnosed with VKH disease. Fundus fluorescein angiography revealed multiple pinpoint leaks suggestive of VKH disease. He received 1000 mg of daily methylprednisolone infusion， for 3 days， followed by oral prednisolone， at 40 mg daily. Serous retinal detachment and headache promptly recurred during the oral administration of 40 mg of prednisolone， 8 days after initial steroid pulse therapy. Sub-Tenon triamcinolone acetonide was injected in both eyes， and serous retinal detachment and headache immediately improved. No recurrence was observed for 8 months until the present， and his best-corrected visual acuity was 0.9 in both eyes.\n\n【3】Conclusion： Sub-Tenon triamcinolone acetonide injection may be effective for VKH disease recurrence when added to conventional steroid pulse therapy. This case suggests the possibility of ecurrence in the early stage of steroid pulse therapy.\n\n【4】Introduction\n\n【5】Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) disease is an autoimmune-driven inflammation of the ocular， auditory， and meningeal structures that all contain melanocytes， which is the elective target of the inflammatory reaction 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，2]</u>. VKH disease frequently recurs. Maruyama et al. reported that 20%of patients with VKH disease experience recurrence even with the best diagnostic and treatment strategies 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. Several reports have been presented about the recurrence of VKH disease from 10to 21 years after initial therapy according to a search of PubMed (keywords， VKH； search years，2000-2022) and CiNii Research (keywords， VKH； search years， 2000-2022) databases 通用删除6(英):<u>[4-6]</u>.\n\n【6】On the contrary， Masaki et al. reported that VKH disease recurred 3 days after initial prednisolone high-dose therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. No reports were presented about the early recurrence of VKH disease following steroid pulse therapy through PubMed and CiNii Research. Hence， evidence is insufficient and details are unclear about the recurrence of VKH disease following steroid pulse therapy.\n\n【7】Herein， we present a case of serous retinal detachment type of VKH disease that recurred after8 days of initial steroid pulse therapy. We report details in the current report as this case seems to be precious.\n\n【8】Case Presentation\n\n【9】A 56-year-old male patient presented at Dokkyo Medical University Saitama Medical Centre， Koshigaya， Japan in August 2022， with a headache and blurred vision for 6 days. He was suspected ofVKH disease at a previous eye clinic. The Best-Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) was 1.2 and 0.7 in the right and left eye. Both eyes have normal intraocular pressure. Slit-lamp biomicroscopy revealed mild iritis， and cells in the vitreous cavity in both eyes. Fundus examination revealed serous retinal detachments in both eyes . Fluorescein angiography revealed bilateral and multiple hyperfluorescence pinpoints at the posterior pole of the fundi .\n\nOptical coherence tomography demonstrated retinal pigment epithelium undulations and|删除段之间换行|Blood test results were within normal limits， except for the red blood cell levels (4.23 ×10 cells/l). The glycosylated hemoglobin(HbA1c)level was 5.3%.\n\n【11】The clinical diagnosis was VKH and the patient was immediately treated with 1000 mg of methylprednisolone (Solu-Medrol； Pfizer， New York， NY， USA) infusion daily for 3 days， followed by oral administration of 40 mg of prednisolone (Predonine； Shionogi， Osaka， Japan)， daily， which was gradually tapered off over the subsequent 6 months.\n\n【12】Headache， retinal pigment epithelium undulations， and serous retinal detachment improved at first， and the patient was discharged from 7 days after initial steroid pulse therapy. Headache and decreased vision recurred 8 days after initial therapy. Serous retinal detachment worsened  and choroidal thickness increased 11 days after initial therapy.\n\n【13】The BCVA was 0.2 and 0.5 in the right and left eyes， respectively. Sub-Tenon triamcinolone acetonide at 40 mg was injected in both eyes and serous retinal detachment and headache improved immediately. The BCVA improved by 0.6 in both eyes 21 days after initial therapy. Serous retinal detachment was almost resolved  and choroidal thickness improved by 484 and 421 um in the right and left eyes， respectively .\n\n【14】The therapeutic reaction was favorable， with no recurrence for 8months until the present.\n\n【15】Discussion\n\n【16】One of the features of VKH is recurrence. Recurrence that repeats several times will become a chronic type. The visual prognosis of chronic type is generally unfavorable. The PubMed (keywords， VKH； search years， 2000-2022) and CiNii Research (keywords， VKH； search years， 2000-2022) databases， revealed that VKH disease recurred after 8 days of initial steroid pulse therapy， which is quite short. Ishibazawa et al. reported that headache， tinnitus， and sensorineural hearing loss developed， with increased choroidal删除1换行thickness without other evidence of increased ocular inflammation after 6 months of initial steroid pulse therapy. Headache and ocular inflammation were observed in our case as recurrent symptoms. A few reports presented about the recurrence period from initial therapy， thus accumulation of cases is important.\n\n【17】Rubsamen et al. reported that VKH disease recurred in 9 (43%) of 21 patients in the first 3 months， usually in association with a rapid tapering of steroid dosage 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>. Iwahashi et al. reported that poor initial visual acuity and rapid tapering of the corticosteroid were associated with posterior recurrence 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>. Our patient recurred during an oral administration of 40 mg of prednisolone after 3 days of1000 mg of methylprednisolone infusion. This change of medication may correspond to rapid tapering.\n\n【18】Hosoda et al. reported that sub-Tenon triamcinolone acetonide injection alone may have VKH recurrence 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>. Our patient received40 mg of sub-Tenon triamcinolone acetonide injection added with oral administration of 40 mg prednisolone. Therefore， recurrence was not observed. Our treatment was effective not only in ocular findings but also in headache resolution.\n\n【19】T cell reactivation which recognizes melanocyte antigenicity， suppressor T cell hypofunction which restrains expression of antigenicity of melanocyte，and antigenicity decoration of melanocyte by virus infection seem to be the causes of the mechanism of VKH recurrence 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. Immune reactions may occur for the target of residual melanocytes 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. However， these assumptions are one of the speculations because the mechanism of VKH disease onset and recurrence remains unclear. Rapid elucidation is anticipated.\n\n【20】Conclusion\n\n【21】VKH disease may recur in an early stage of steroid pulse therapy from the current case. We have to pay attention to recurrence at any time. Sub-Tenon triamcinolone acetonide injection added to oral administration of prednisolone is quite useful for the recurrence of VKH disease.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

HLH was first reported by the Scottish pediatricians James Farquhar and Albert Clarieaux in 1952， where two infants presented with cytopenia's， unremitting fever and hepatosplenomegaly. However， both infants died after few weeks of initial presentation. There was evidence of widespread infiltration of benign appearing histiocytes with hemophagocytosis in the lymphoreticular system on autopsy. They defined this syndrome as familial hemophagocytic reticulosis， which is currently known as HLH. The estimated incidence is approximately 1.2 cases per 1，000，000 individuals per year 通用删除6(英):<u>[21</u>.\n\n【2】HLH is due to various pathophysiological pathways： 1) Hyperactivation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and macrophages；2) proliferation and infiltration of macrophages into various organs； and 3) elevated levels of various cytokines， resulting in progressive organ dysfunction 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. More researches have shown down regulation of proapoptotic signals and genes related to innate and adaptive immune responses as well as up regulation of genes coding for proinflammatory cytokines and antiapoptotic factors to be important pathological mechanism 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>.\n\n【3】HLH can beprimary (congenital) or secondary (acquired). Mostly， secondary HLH is arbitrarily divided into three groups depending on the diseases. A-HLH denotes autoimmune disease-associated HLH， whereas HLH triggered by malignancy and infection is denoted by M-HLH and I-HLH，respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. HLH associated with miliary tuberculosis is rare with higher mortality rates通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>.\n\n【4】Pathogenetic mechanism of primary HLH is associated with genetic mutations of perforin and vesicle trafficking genes. It is commonly found in children and adults with primary immunodeficiencies like Chediak-Higashi. The clinical outcome of primary HLH is fatal if immunosuppressive chemotherapy not initiated at an early stage 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. Acquired HLH in otherwise healthy persons is also associated with infections like Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV)， Herpes Simplex virus and tuberculosis bacterium 通用删除6(英):<u>[5，6]</u>.\n\n【5】Amongst infections， EBV is reported to be most common cause of HLH however； TB-HLH is less commonly reported. Incidence rate of TB is very high in Southeast Asian and developing countries like India 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. Since， diagnosis of HLH is commonly missed； high degree of suspicion is required for its diagnosis， particularly with conditions like TB which can have varied clinical manifestations 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>.\n\n【6】Thus， understanding the prognosis and characteristics of secondary TB-HLH in order to achieve early recognition and treatment is extremely necessary to prevent irreversible tissue damage. Thereby， in this manuscript we describe a patient of tuberculosis complicated with HLH.\n\n【7】Case Presentation\n\n【8】A 44 years old male was admitted with complaints ofhigh-grade fever， cough with expectoration， worsening breathlessness for one week and tachypnea for last 2 months. Patient also complained of low-grade febrile illness (not documented) with night sweats and weight loss.

Routine hematological laboratory evaluation revealed normocytic normochromic anemia[hemoglobin： 119 g/L (120-140 g/L)， Mean Corpuscular Volume(MCV)： 93.4 fL]， leukopenia [leukocyte count： 2.3×10/L， Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC)： 1740/cumm] and thrombocytopenia(platelet count： 15×10/L). Biochemical investigations revealed total bilirubin： 0.7 mg/dL (direct 0.2 mg/dL)， raised liver transaminases (3times the upper limit of normal)， reduced total protein levels (5.1 gm/dl) with albumin (2.2 gm/dl) and globulin (2.9gm/dl).\n\n【17】Coagulation profile depicted prolonged prothrombin time 通用删除6(英):<u>[27</u>sec， control 12 sec， activated partial thromboplastin time (35 sec， control 26 sec)， INR 1.2 and high levels of D-dimer >5250 ng/ml. Microbiological and serological work up were negative for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)， hepatitis B and C viruses， dengue， malaria； and microbial cultures of blood， urine， sputum were sterile.\n\n【18】Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy were sent for evaluation of miliary tuberculosis. Peripheral smear examined showed leucopenia删除1换行and thrombocytopenia. Bone marrow aspirate smears were partly diluted with peripheral blood and showed no particle.\n\n【19】Bone marrow imprint showed particle with highly cellular trails. Erythroid series showed normoblastic reaction， myeloid showed normal maturation with increased eosinophilic precursors. Megakaryocytes were adequate. There was slight increase in number of mature plasma cells and histiocytes with some showing hemophagocytosis. No atypical cells/parasite or granuloma was identified on imprint smear .\n\n【20】Bone marrow core measuring 1.3 cm in length was examined by Hematoxylin and Eosin staining showed bony trabeculae enclosing marrow spaces with normally maturing myeloid series cells. Erythroid series showed predominantly normoblastic reaction with adequate number of megakaryocytes. A non-caseating epithelioid cell granuloma was seen， however no Langhans type giant cells seen . Furthermore， there was increased number of histiocytes with some showing evidence of hemophagocytosis. However， Ziehl Neelson staining for acid fast bacilli was negative. Thereafter， further investigations and workup for tuberculosis associated HLH was done.\n\n【21】Plasma fibrinogen was within normal levels (233 mg/dl) whereas lipid profile showed raised serum triglyceride levels (193 mg/dl). Hyponatremia and hyperkalemia were present along with raised urea and creatinine. Hyperferritinemia (>1800 ng/mL)， raised lactate dehydrogenase (920IU/L)and elevated ESR (50 mm in 1h) was also present. The Mantoux test was negative. However，real time PCR test with sputum sample was reported to be positive for tuberculosis.\n\n【22】Thus， as per HLH-2004 Protocol  and after correlating with clinical details， radiological and real time PCR positivity on sputum sample， diagnosis of tuberculosiIsSwith secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis was made.\n\n【23】The patient was managed with supportive measures. Later on， he was started on Anti-Tubercular Therapy (ATT) along with steroids. He was discharged in a stable condition but patient did not come for follow up.\n\n【24】Discussion\n\n【25】TB-HLHilsSatype of severe tuberculosis， diagnostically challenging for clinicians as its most common clinical presentation is Pyrexia of Unknown Origin (PUO). This condition was first reported in the 1980s but since last few years there are many cases reported in literature on TB-HLH通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>.\n\n【26】Here， we report a rare case of TB associated HLH in an adult male diagnosed using PCR performed on sputum sample and bone marrow examination. The patient was successfully treated with ATT and corticosteroids. In this case， clinical suspicion of miliary TB was made with the help of history and physical examination. TB is widespread in Asian countries， including India， and is one of the important causes of but due to lack of precise diagnosis and non-specificity of clinical manifestations， early detection is quite difficult通用删除6(英):<u>7，9]</u>.\n\n【27】Mycobacterium TB is an obligate intracellular pathogen which exacerbate macrophage over activity as well as Thl cell mediated删除1换行cytotoxicity thereby resulting in HLH. It is evidenced by increased serum levels of IFN-y，M CSF， and TNF-a in patients with tuberculosis通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>. Therefore， high TNF-a and IFN-y results in hematopoiesis suppression along with apoptosis thus， resulting in cytopenia. Inhibition of lipoprotein lipase results in hypertriglyceridemia and macrophage over activity leading to excess release of ferritin (an acute phase reactant) in response to inflammatory cytokines； tissue infiltration causes organomegaly， and fever is secondary to release of cytokines like IL 1， IL 6 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>.\n\n【28】Literature shows that in patients diagnosed with TB complicated with HLH， there is 100% mortality if they did not receive ATT， whereas there is 40% to 60% reduction in mortality rate by combination of ATT and immunotherapy. Suppression of cytokine storm is of utmost importance in patients with HLH for long-term efficacy of ATT and needs to be done by induction of immunotherapy at an early stage of treatment. Thus， it was observed that patients who received immunotherapy alone also experienced significantly higher overall survival rates than patients who did not receive 通用删除6(英):<u>[7，10，11]</u>.\n\n【29】Highly elevated level of ferritin is an important prognostic marker and is strongly associated with HLH. Lin et al. concluded in a study that a rapid rate of fall in ferritin levels following therapy initiation was directly proportionate to overall survival and thereby associated with decreased mortality 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>. However， Park et al. in their23 patients of secondary HLH found that the rate of decline in ferritin was not associated with survival whereas high fibrinogen at the time of diagnosis was significantly associated with decreased mortality通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>. Similarly， Padhi et al. found that high serum ferritin (>1000 ng/mL) was an important indicator of disease severity and was associated with decreased survival， but the results were statistically insignificant on univariate analysis 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>.\n\n【30】Inour case， patient wwaass clinically suspectedaass miliary tuberculosis， having fever with organomegaly. Evidence of cytopenia and hemophagocytosis on bone marrow examination led to suspicion删除1换行of TB-HLH which was confirmed by further biochemical results including hyperferritinemia， hypertriglyceridemia and elevated liver enzymes.\n\n【31】In conclusion， this case illustrates early diagnostic challenges of both HLH and miliary tuberculosis. It provides the need for deep understanding of possible triggers of HLH， with more attention on TB-associated HLH since TB is most common infection in developing countries. In patients with tuberculosis who present with cytopenia(s)， coagulopathy， high triglyceride levels， HLH should be considered as a differential diagnosis. Till date literature highlights the fact that TB HLH have an unpredictable and/or poor outcome with or without ATT. Thus， early diagnosis and initiation of ATT， even in the presence of disseminated disease might alter the final outcome towards favorable in such cases.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

He had a history of thymoma with thymectomy (histology：minimally invasive thymoma) two years ago， and had been stable without recurrence. Upon arrival to the medical ward， he developed two episodes of generalized tonic clonic seizures. His urgent plain CT brain showed a 2.5 cm right parietal lobe round lesion with perilesional edema， which was rim enhancing on contrast scan. Urgent MRI brain favored cerebral abscess. Patient was started on phenytoin， intravenous ampicillin， metronidazole and ceftriaxone. Emergency craniotomy was performed. Brain biopsy confirmed herpes encephalitis. CSF was positive for herpes simplex virus2 PCR. He was given 5 weeks of intravenous acyclovir， guided by CSF viral PCR， white cell and protein level .\n\n【17】Why is Underlying Immunodeficiency Suspected?\n\n【18】As HSV2 is a rare cause of adult-onset herpes encephalitis (over 90% being HSV1 infection通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>)， it raised suspicion on the patient’s immunity. In addition， he was found to have multiple pathogens in current admission as well as a past history ofrecurrent infections .\n\n【19】Features of Good Syndrome\n\n【20】Based on the compatible immunological profile and history of thymoma， the diagnosis of Good Syndrome， i.e. thymoma with immunodeficiency， was established. It is a rare condition and is associated with poor prognosis (one study found mortality of 41% 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>). It is characterized by a combined B cell and T cell deficiency 通用删除6(英):<u>[3，4]</u>. The classical immunological features compose of hypogammaglobulinemia， reduced B cells， reduced CD4 T cell， abnormal CD4 to CD8 ratio 通用删除6(英):<u>[3，4]</u>. The most common cause of infection is sinopulmonary infection with encapsulated bacteria， e.g.， Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumonia 通用删除6(英):<u>[2-4]</u>.\n\n【21】Management and Outcome\n\n【22】Patient was started on monthly intravenous immunoglobulin； he was vaccinated against pneumococcus， haemophilus， meningococcus and influenzae. His repeated CT thorax did not show CUS recurrence ofthymoma. He enjoyed good neurological recovery and was discharged. Unfortunately， he returned two months later with bilateral eye blindness， his vitreous aspirate was positive for HSV2 PCR. He suffered from bilateral acute necrotizing retinitis from HSV2 infection and was permanently blind. He was put on lifelong oral acyclovir since then. Upon his follow up two years from the first admission， he had been well without significant infective episodes.\n\n【23】Neurology and Good Syndrome\n\n【24】Rare CNS infections can occur in immunodeficiency.

UK government told that it is highly contagious new variant of the virus. Scientist investigated the genetic materials of the coronavirus and found thousands oftiny modifications which proves it hopscotched across the world. UK is the first to detect the new strain and now it is found in Denmark， Belgium， the Netherland， Australia as per the record of WHO通用删除6(英):<u>[1-3]</u>. Coronavirus have genetic material called RNA. When virus infects us， it attaches to cells， get inside and make number of copies of their RNA. If there is a mistake in copying， the RNA becomes changed and called mutation. It happens accidently and by random and a normal process in virus by which they spread and multiply. The new variant B.1.1.7 variant is detected in the UK in the month of December 204 followed by the B.1.351 variant in South Africa， Los Angeles and Ohio. Research proves that B.1.1.7 variant is more deadly and contagious than the previous one. A new variant in the coronavirus is VUI-2020 12/01 or lineage B.1.1.7. 17 different changes have been found in new variant and most of them is due to the alteration in a protein made by the virus 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. The Centers for Disease Control and prevention (CDC) predict that by the March 21， B.1.1.7 will be the dominant strain in the United States 通用删除6(英):<u>[5，6]</u>. The genetic changes are seen in large number especially in the spike protein which governs how the virus interacts with a human cell. New variant is 70% more transmissible than the old variant and attack the immune system faster and more severe 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. The primary symptoms such as cough， fever， chest pains，loss of taste and smell， aches and chills is same as that ofolder. The major concern oftoday's scientist is that the mutation could affecttreatment and prevention. Bollinger said “We deal with mutations every year for flu virus and will keep an eye on this coronavirus and track it\". The new variant spread faster from person to person andleads to more deaths. This new variant infects more number of cases in children and more aggressive new strain needs attention. The biggest problem with the virus is that when it mutates it escape from drugs or the immune system by changing the proteins on its surface. Antibodies are generated by our bodies to fight off infection and it doesn't exist in isolation. In our body， several cells have to work together antibodies， specially neutralizing antibodies， enter the stage. One subset of T cells plays a crucial role in the production of antibodies and another type of T cell kills the viruses infected cells. T cells are a kind of WBC and lymphocytes produced in bone marrow and carry a protein on their cell surface， surveil our bodies for pathogen. Dr. Yewdele， chief of cellular Biological Section explains that there are two paths to alert the immune system of the foreign invader. Once a virus enter into the cell， it goes a series of compartments were enzyme chop and unpack into small peptides and these peptides take away by Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class II molecule. When a virus infects a cell， it makes viral protein by hijacking the cell's machinery. At the same time some peptides diverting to MHC class I molecules， which direct them to the cell surface and present them to other cell 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>. Dr. David Mulligan suggested that m-RNA vaccines activate B cells which can able to produce antibodies over 8 months after vaccination. Our immune system produces antibodies to a protein which sits on the surface of the virus called spike in the presence of vaccines. The spike protein opens a passage inside by latching onto the cells. Vaccine helps in the production of antibodies and stick to the tip ofthespike and virus can’t enter inside. Mutation creates the possibility to the change the shape of spike protein； in turn antibodies gain a tight grip on them. The variant B.1.1.7 includes 8 in the spike gene and the antibodies produce by our immune system may be less likely that virus can easily escape their attack. Currently the scientists think that the variant will be able to evade vaccine but at some point， someday，some where the current vaccine may be ineffective(Kristian Andersen， a virologist at Scripps research Institute). The US chief adviser Dr. Moncef Slaoui said that the possibility of new variant resistance towards vaccines is low but inexistence. The m-RNA vaccine is able to modify to target new variants produced by mutation but definitely new strains could decrease the effectiveness of the virus. The vaccines provide only 21.9% protection删除1换行against the mild or moderate COVID-19 development and 10.4%against the B.1.1.7 variant. Several scientists explain that vaccines produce wide range of response beyond the spike protein through the immune system so “VARIANTS ARE UNDER INVESTIGATION\". The new virus strain is potentially on a pathway for vaccine escape so Transmissibility and Virulence of the variant requires more research. Various scientist of South America working on a booster shot to guard against the new variant. At last it can be concluded that new variant with speedy spreader properties are a concern to everyone. Prof. Stoye said “Spread will almost inevitably occur because of short separation between different countries\". The above letter is not just for new variant but for the future global health security and to manage the threats with pandemic potential. The variant of concern is very much significant to public health and effectiveness of current vaccine. If there is a chance of vaccine failure or reinfection towards new variants then the case can be considered oh high priority. That why new variants is under radar by various health scientist.\n\n【11】1. Risk related to the spread of new SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern in the EU/EEA - first update.

Further to acute conjunctivitis， venous thrombotic events should be included in the list of possible ocular COVID-19 manifestations.

Ocular symptoms were assumed as due to acute conjunctivitis and self-managed at home (because in the pandemic peak) for five days with anti-inflammatory+anti-histamine eye wash medications (three times daily)， but without any significant improvement. These symptoms persisted unchanged after the pharmacological treatment. As a blurred vision complicated the original clinical picture， she underwent an ophthalmologic consultation on March 254： The conjunctivitis was confirmed by slit lamp examination， while the fundus oculi examination and the Spectral Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) were absolutely normal . Moreover， visus was 20/20， and the eye pressure 14 mmHg.\n\nTo note that her husband was admitted for severe COVID-19 pneumonia and ARDS on 284h March， and the lady was then quarantined (home isolation)， even if in the absence of any other|删除段之间换行|Due to the peak of the national pandemic context (actually， pauci-symptomatic conditions were absolutely disregarded)，her RT-PCR nasopharyngeal swab was delayed to twenty days later： When tested， the swab proved positive， although by a low viral load.

Two swabs repeated four weeks later were negative.\n\n【9】On May 284 (namely， as soon as possible after the strict lock-down)， a sub-acute Branch Retinal Venous Occlusion (BRVO) was found in the right eye by ophthalmoscopy， associated with a macular edema.

Histology of the tumor in the lower gastric body was adenocarcinoma with papillary or tubular structures in the mucosal area. However， in the submucosal area， majority of tumor cells was changed to clear cells resembling cytotrophoblasts as seen in trophoblastic neoplasms. Furthermore， solitary growth of the spindle cells resembling Syncytiotrophoblast cells was apparent in the layers of muscularis propria and subserosa. Immunohistochemically， syncytiotrophoblast type cells were positive for beta-subunit of Human Chorionic Gonadotropin(HCG). Three out of 28 regionallymph nodes had metastases of the neoplasm with adenocarcinoma as well as choriocarcinomatous components. The tumor on the posterior wall of pylorus was a tubular adenocarcinoma only recognized in the mucosal layer. The tumor did not contain any trophoblastic components.\n\n【2】Choriocarcinomatous differentiation of the gastric carcinoma was suggested to occur during the down growth of the neoplasm. Present gastric choriocarcinoma supports the concept that gastric choriocarcinoma arises from alternate differentiation pathway of adenocarcinoma. Such synchronous occurrence of double carcinomas in the stomach may also suggest a higher oncogenesis stage of the stomach of this woman.\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Stomach may be a common site oforigin of non-gonadal， non-gestational trophoblastic tumors， although gastric cancers with germ cell tumor components are uncommon. Choriocarcinoma， hepatoid adenocarcinoma， carcinoma with enteroblastic differentiation， and York sac tumor like carcinoma are known as special type of gastric cancer. Choriocarcinoma is a trophoblastic tumor as a rare primary miscellaneous tumor in the stomach. It is known that some of gastric cancers have choriocarcinomatous components 通用删除6(英):<u>[1-3]</u>. Regarding the pathogenesis of gastric choriocarcinoma， retro-differentiation or dedifferentiation theory has been accepted upon the observation that gastric choriocarcinoma are found with coexistent adenocarcinomas or adenocarcinoma components 通用删除6(英):<u>[4，5]</u>. In a few tumors， the primary gastric lesion was pure adenocarcinoma and the choriocarcinomatous differentiation only became manifest in the metastasis 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. Certainly， it is plausible that since all cells contain the entire genetic material for the whole organism， cancers may differentiate in unusual directions， including even the formation of malignant trophoblasts. However， precise mechanisms for the trophoblastic differentiation of gastric cancers are still unknown. Presently， we report a unique case with a carcinoma exerting choriocarcinomatous differentiation and another separated adenocarcinoma in the stomach. Significance of such synchronous gastric carcinomas particularly for the point ofassociation between tumor growth and differentiation is discussed.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\nA78-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital for evaluation of epigastralgia. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed existence of a type 3 tumor on the greater curvature of lower gastric body and a type 0-IIa+IIc lesion on the posterior wall in pylorus.

The neoplastic mass on the posterior wall in pylorus measured 18 mmx18 mm was a polypoid lesion with surface erosions； type 0-IIa+IIc . On the operation， the tumors looked to be localized in the stomach wall and metastases to lymph nodes and other organs were not confirmed. On microscopy， the surface area of the neoplasm on the greater curvature of lower gastric body exhibited common features of adenocarcinoma with papillary or tubular growth. However， the main neoplastic cells infiltrating laminapropria and occupying submucosal space were changed to those composed of single nucleus， vacuolated or clear cytoplasm. They were relatively uniform population and lacked typical glandular structures. Less number of bizarre cells resembling syncytiotrophoblast cells with more pleomorphic nuclei， deeply eosinophilic to basophilic cytoplasm and less distinct cell membranes was mixed with the clear cell population . The tumor infiltrated through the muscularis propria into the sub serous space. In the layers of muscularis propria and subserosal area， solitary growth of syncytiotrophoblast type cells which were\n\n【7】Histology ofthetumorlocated on theposterior wall of pylorus was a combined type of well differentiated and moderately differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma . The carcinoma was growing only in the mucosal layer. It is assumed that the tumor in the pylorus had multifocal origin， since the carcinoma was a combined type andsome normal epithelium was remained among the neoplastic epithelium. The tumor did not contain any trophoblastic components. HCG， CEA and AFP were not immunoreactive. CK 7 was partially positive in the tumor tissues， although CK 20 was negative.\n\n【8】Postoperatively， the patient has been stable， and no evidence showing possibility of malignancy in other organs including ovary and uterus was recognized. She had taken S-1 for six months as adjuvant chemotherapy 通用删除6(英):<u>[8，9]</u>. The recurrence and metastases of the gastric cancer have not been recognized for a year. However， the patient unfortunately died two years after the operation due to the删除1换行abdominal dissemination of the neoplasm.\n\n【9】Discussion\n\n【10】Presently， HCG positive syncytiotrophoblast type cells came into existence mainly in the layers of muscularis propria and subserosa， not in the mucosal area where was present only the cells with features of adenocarcinoma. Thus， choriocarcinomatous differentiation is suggested to occur during the down growth of the tumor. In this case， typical mix of cytotrophoblast and syncytiotrophoblastic elements as seen in representative choriocarcinomas was not apparent. However， clear cells lacking HCG activity often coexisted with syncytiotrophoblast type cells in the submucosal area. Furthermore， morphology ofthese cells resembles cytotrophoblasts of trophoblastic neoplasms. Accordingly。appearance of such cell population was suggested to be an evidence for the choriocarcinomatous differentiation of the adenocarcinoma.\n\n【11】Cytogenetic study on the gastric choriocarcinoma also supports the theory that gastric choriocarcinoma arises from alternate differentiation pathway of adenocarcinoma 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>. Although， HCG-producing cells were not confirmed in the normal antrum mucosa in this study， some authors reported presence of immunoreactive cells against beta subunit of HCG in the neck region of normal antral mucosa 通用删除6(英):<u>[11，12]</u>. Such specific feature of the stomach might be related to the choriocarcinomatous differentiation.\n\n【12】In this case， synchronous development of two separated carcinomas was present in the stomach of the woman. Furthermore， the intramucosal carcinoma in the pre-pylorus was suggested to be multifocal. There is evidence that some of larger early gastric carcinomas may result from collision of smaller neoplasms 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>. Thus， existence of multiple cancers in the stomach of this woman implies a higher oncogenesis stage of this organ. The concept of field cancerization is recognized in different human organs. Regarding the mechanism of field cancerization of human stomach， genetic instability in the mucosal cells is suggested to relate 通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u>. Meanwhile， McDonald et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u> reported from the analysis using mitochondrial DNA mutations that human gastric body units are clonal and contain multiple multipotential stem cells， thereby mutated gastric stem cells spread widely within the stomach. In the present case， the patient developed two separated gastric carcinomas， one of which accompanied choriocarcinomatous differentiation. Similar case with double carcinomas of the stomach is reported by Eom et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>. Recently， collision tumor of choriocarcinoma and small cell carcinoma of the stomach was reported by Fukuda et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>. In the present case， the carcinoma with choriocarcinomatous differentiation showed the staining pattern of CK 7 positive and CK 20 negative. Similar staining pattern of cytokeratin is also confirmed in a gastric carcinoma with choriocarcinomatous differentiation 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. CK 7 is evaluated as an accurate intracellular marker to assess the purity of human placental villous trophoblast 通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u>. Choriocarcinomatous differentiation may be concerned with function of some cytokeratin， although evidence is uncertain.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

She fulfilled the following criteria of the American College of Rheumatology for SLE diagnosis： positive anti-dsDNA and ANA，leukopenia and cutaneous maculea. She reported three weeks history of edema of lower extremities that progressedanasarca， dyspnea and cough，nighturination and decrease ofurinaryvolume. Thepatient had no chronic illness， no drug or substance use. At the initial physical examination， blood pressure was 100/80 mmHg， body temperature 36.8°C， and heart rate 92 beats/min and rhythmic. It was observed edema of evelid and 3+ edema of pretibial.

Ultrasonographic evaluation revealed normal kidney size， increased to grade 1 echogenicity. In the following days， urine output fell below 400 cc. Serum creatinine varied from 1.6 mg/dl to 5.7 mg/dl and patient was hipervolemic. Immediately started treatment with|删除段之间换行|Discussion and Conclusion\n\n【7】Our patient presented at least four American College of Rheumatology criteria for diagnosis of SLE (leukopenia， cutaneous maculae， positive ANA， positive anti-dsDNA) and other clinical findings consistent with this diagnosis (hypocomplementemia and arthralgia). It is generally believed that renal abnormalities are caused by LN in well-documented SLE patients. Thus， renal biopsy in SLE is usually recommended not for diagnostic purposes， but rather to determine the type and extent of renal involvement 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>， as well as to evaluate the activity and chronicity indices. Interestingly， in rare cases， clinically significant renal diseases not associated with LN have been described in patients with SLE. There are only a few reports that this association is often isolated.\n\n【8】In SLE patients， a wide variety of renallesions not associated with LN may be seen. Renal biopsy plays an important role in determining glomerular disease associated with SLE. SLE patients clinically presenting with nephrotic syndrome indicating Minimal Change Disease (MCD)， Mesangial Proliferation (MsP) or FSGS， while on electronic microscopy， diffuse podocyte foot process removal in absence of sub-epithelial or sub-endothelial deposition is the only删除1换行morphological feature and now diagnosed as lupus podocytopathy. There are 17 previous reports of FSGS in SLE 通用删除6(英):<u>[3-10]</u>. All reported patients presented with NS， normal or more frequently decreased renal function and hypertension. FSGS was preceded 3 to 18 years by renal abnormalities， which were related mostly to a previous LN. How the non-LN develops in patients with SLE is still poorly understood. The association between SLE and some diseases， such asthin-membrane disease， hypertensive nephrosclerosis，1IgA nephropathy and infection-related GN is probably coincident. On the other hand， the more frequentassociation with FSGS and amyloidosis may be pathogenetically concerned to SLE 通用删除6(英):<u>[3，4]</u>. Our patient had the histological diagnosis of FSGS.\n\n【9】Lupus podocytopia is susceptible to glucocorticoid therapy. SLs However， the relapse rate can reach up to 90% in treatment with glucocorticoid alone. Glucocorticoid plus other immunosuppressive agents can significantly reduce the relapse rate. Lupus podocytopathy with FSGS offers higher sensitivity to acute renal damage and less sensitivity to glucocorticoid treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>[3，11，12]</u>. We treated for FSGS after the biopsy； the patient experienced a full remission during the course of the disease. When non-LN was diagnosed， it was treated with myclofenate mofetil in addition to corticosteroids for FSGS.\n\n【10】Finaly， non-LN may be seen in SLE patients regardless of clinical or serological disease activity. Renal biopsy is an important tool in the identification of these lesions. These kidney lesions have a broad morphological spectrum； one of the most common is FSGS. The combination of corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive agents in SLE patients with acute renal damage and FSGS has increased the success oftreatment.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

Historically this term was used to describe those with microangiopathic hemolytic anemia， thrombocytopenia and renal failure not associated with diarrhea. But now it is used to describe the complement mediated Thrombotic Microangiopathy (TMA) which does not have ADAMTS13 deficiency or documented shiga toxin as an etiological agent. aHUS is generally associated with genetic or acquired defect of regulation of complement on host cells. In aHUS， infections are usually considered as trigger and not the causes of disease 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Secondary HUS is associated with Streptococcus pneumonia and influenza virus， apart from transplantation， cancer， cytotoxic drugs， autoimmune diseases and pregnancy 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. These infections are considered as causes of HUS and not just triggers.\n\n【2】In normal homeostasis， factor H and factor I are the regulatory molecules interacting with activated complement factors like C3b， thereby protecting red cells， platelets and endothelial cells fromlysis 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. If this fails， then the disbalance between activation and regulation may cause formation of membrane attack complexes on platelets and endothelial cells leading to platelet activation and endothelial damage respectively. This may trigger activation of coagulation system along with platelet aggregation leading to microthrombi formation within the vasculature. Thus aHUS can be perceived as severe complement dysregulation attacking red cells， platelets and endothelial cells in contact with plasma 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. The typical clinical trial of Microangiopathic Hemolytic Anemia (MAHA)， thrombocytopenia and organ damage in aHUS is a complement mediated process； hence it is logical that therapeutic complement inhibition may be effective in aHUS.\n\n【3】In Mumbai， malaria is rampant and endemic. We have a severe and rare not previously reported case of P. vivax induced aHUS.\n\n【4】An 18-year-old Indian male， presented to local facility for fever with chills and was treated as uncomplicated malarial fever. He was given chloroquine， amoxicillin clavulanate， and subsequently primaquine after confirming normal Glucose 6 Phosphate Dehydrogenase (G6PD) test. The patient was transferred to LTMGH hospital a week later for generalized weakness， persistent fever and oliguria. Physical examination showed blood pressure of 112/70 mmHg， subconjunctival hemorrhage， facial puffiness and mild icterus. His rapid malarial antigen test was positive， complete blood count revealed hemoglobin of 9.4 g/dl， WBC count 11500/pl， platelets of 47000/p1l. Peripheral smear showed schistocytes， helmet cells， spherocytes， reticulocytosis， and low platelets . The laboratory investigation revealed Total bilirubin 5.2 mg/dL， indirect bilirubin 2.6 mg/dL，serum Aspartate Transaminase (AST) and serum Alanine Transaminase (ALT) were 93 units/L and 92units/L respectively. Blood urea nitrogen was 48 mg/dL and creatinine 6.1 mg/dL. Serum Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH) 1278 U/L (ref： 140-250 U/L). Investigation for iron deficiency anemia showed normal serum iron-78 mcg/dL (ref： 50-150)， total iron binding capacity (TIBC)-345 mcg/dL (ref： 300-350). Prothrombin time was 11.2 sec (control <13) and International Normalized Ratio (INR) 1.0 (control<1.25)， Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (APTT) 28.6 sec 通用删除7(英):<u>(29-31)</u>， fibrinogen 337 mg/dL. Other serological tests for common coexistent infections like dengue and leptospirosis were negative. Urine routine microscopy showed Red blood cells 10-15/hpf， Epithelial cells 1-2/hpf， Pus cells 4-5/hpf. Ultrasonography showed normal sized kidneys. ADAMTS 13 levels were 114.21% normal (50% to 160%).\n\nOn day four of his admission， creatinine increased to 7.9 mg/dl and blood urea nitrogen to|删除段之间换行|120 mg/dL， and he developed oligoanuria with respiratory distress. Patient was intubated and put on ventilatory support. Hemodialysis was initiated and patient was given alternate day hemodialysis and received packed red cells transfusion in view of persistent hemolysis and resultant low hemoglobin. He was given Inj. artesunate 2.4 mg/kg loading dose， followed by 1.2 mg/kg for 7 days， inj. ceftriaxone 1g antiemetics， antipyretics， and supportive care in ICU. Initially there was no response to hemodialysis with persistent oliguria. He required mechanical ventilation for seven days. After nine days of initiation of hemodialysis， urine output began to improve and creatinine reduced to 3.5 mg/dl and urinary output increased to 2500 ml/24 h on day 13of admission. He was discharged on day 20 with Hemoglobin of 9.9g/dl， creatinine 1.1 mg/dl and absent schistocytes in peripheral smear.\n\n【6】Discussion\n\n【7】Microangiopathy is now seen not only in hematology but also in rheumatology and infectious diseases. Malaria which is well known for hemolysis has not yet been described to cause AHUS.\n\n【8】According to world malaria report of 2017， number of malaria cases reported from India is 1.3 million and deaths at 23，990 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. The incidence of acute renal failure due to malaria in India is around4% to 17.2%通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. Renal manifestations range from mild proteinuria aniddurinary ssediment abnormalities， acutee1tubularr necrosis， glomerulonephritis and acute interstitial nephritis， all leading to acutekidney injury. The mechanisms for renal involvement are many including microcirculation blockade by parasitized RBC leading to acute renal insufficiency， immune system activation leading to complement activation causing immune complex deposition and glomerulonephritis as well as a secondary hemolytic uremic syndrome. Cortical necrosis has also been described in malaria 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>.\n\n【9】Complement activation is central in aHUS； release of C5 a along with increased activity of tissue factor produces a procoagulant state of endothelium. ADAMTS13 is zinc containing metalloproteinase enzyme acting as von Wille Brand (vWF) factor cleaving protease. This helps to keep in checkvWF polymers in plasma. Low ADAMTS13levels would be seen in congenital or acquired Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP) which would be close differential. This patient had classical microangiopathy， severe renal failure and a normal ADAMTS13 fulfilling the criteria for aHUS. This hospital is a 1500 bedded Municipal General Hospital in Mumbai in the state of Maharashtra. There is frequently an inability to procure a medication， because sometimes it's not licensed or unavailable for this institution. The use of eculizumab to reverse the complement mediated disease has been well described for aHUS， paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria， and generalized myasthenia gravis and even in other disorders like Guillain Barre Syndrome where complement mediated demyelination is implicated 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. The occurrence of TMA in this case of complicated malaria attributed to aHUS brings the important role of complement system in picture. Eculizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks terminal complement by binding to C5. Early use of eculizumab in such patient can help in recovery from renal failure， prevent the need of hemodialysis and also reduce the mortality inherently associated with such illness. If eculizumab was available we would have used it even without our ability to be secure that this was a complement mediated aHUS (by demonstration of reduced factor H and I activity). Therefore， dialysis was the only option along with supportive therapy as eculizumab was not available for a therapeutic intervention. Fortunately this patient recovered from his renal failure. As malaria is a common entity in India，onehas to be aware of AHUS as a rare and dreaded complication of malaria. Eculizumab， if and when available would be the drug of choice.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

The true incidence is unknown. The available estimates in literature report the range from 1/1800 to 1/2500of all caesarean delivery performed 通用删除6(英):<u>[3，4]</u>. The only risk factor is one or more previous caesarean sections. Vaginal bleeding of different degrees may be the first sign of a caesarean scar pregnancy， while pain is usually not a typical presenting symptom. Often the patient is asymptomatic and it is diagnosed when detected by the US. First-line imaging modality to diagnose caesarean pregnancy is transvaginal US especially in early pregnancy 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. The initial and early US (between 5 and 7weeks) are critical to avoid misdiagnosis. The differential diagnoses are： cervical pregnancy and a miscarriage in progress. US diagnosis criteria are： empty uterine cavity and emptyendocervical canal with detection of an early gestational sac and/or placenta in close proximity of the hysterotomy scar/niche， an absent or thin myometrial layer between the gestational sac and the anterior uterine wall and an abundant peri-trophoblastic blood flow at Doppler examination 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>.

She was sent to Pisa Hospital because it was finding a heterotopic pregnancy and one of the two gestational chambers was on the hysterotomy site of the previous caesarean. The woman did a caesarean section an year before in Sri Lanka. The pregnancy was studied with transvaginal and abdominal ultrasound exam that described：“Anteverted uterus， inside which is displayed a 21 mm gestational sac on the bottom with a single embryo with BCE， 7 mm CRL and biometry corresponding to 6+2 weeks. Area of organized hematoma of 42 mm x 37 mm. Another gestational sac of 18 mm at isthmic level that reaches the hysterotomy scar， with a single embryo with BCE， 5 mm CRL. The thickness of the myometrium above the scar is regular and not invaded by the trophoblast.\" Pregnancy arising on删除1换行the hysterotomy site was very dangerous for the mother and for the pregnancy itself. As pregnancy progressed， it could cause uterus rupture with consequent loss of the second gestational chamber and risk of death for the mother. Furthermore， between the two gestational chambers there was a large hematoma of unclear origin (detachment area?) which was probably the cause of the woman’s blood loss. The patient was hemodynamically stable. At first we waited three days to monitor the conditions of the woman and the twin pregnancy. The maternal blood loss progressively stopped， the two embryos grew regularly， both had a heartbeat and the hematoma between them remained stable compared to previous checks. The woman wished to continue with the intrauterine pregnancy， so we proposed her to perform selective voluntary abortion of the embryo located on the previous hysterotomy site. This attitude was intended to preserve the other pregnancy and to avoid bad consequences for the mother but it was not without risk. The abortion of the first embryo would have eliminated the risk of a future uterus rupture but could also lead to the abortion the second fetus. To carry out the abortion we decided to use aspiration of part of the sac contents and the injection of 2% KCl inside the gestational chamber because it minimizes the risks posed to the coexisting intrauterine pregnancy. We decided to abort the pregnancy on the caesarean scar but to leave the residual gestational sac in place to let it reabsorb on its own because removing it could cause the loss of the other pregnancy.\n\n【6】The operation was performed with local anesthesia and sedation. After a thorough disinfection of the vagina and external genitalia， the Criyagen transvaginal ultrasound probe was inserted and highlighted the two gestational chambers， one of which on the hysterotomy site and the hematoma organized between them. An oocyte retrieval needle was inserted through the posterior vaginal fornix with which5 cc of intracavitary fluid were aspirated and 1 cc of intracardiac KCl2 mEq/mL solution was injected into the embryo in the isthmus. We saw the arrest of the ECB of the embryo. At the end of the procedure， in the US exam the heartbeat of the embryo on the bottom was present .\n\n【7】After the procedure we carefully monitored the woman with serial clinical， blood chemistry and transvaginal ultrasound checks. The days after there was minimal blood loss that stopped after a few days. At the US exams was described on the bottom of the uterus a single embryo with BCE， increasing CRL corresponding to the weeks.\n\n【8】On the previous hysterotomy site there was a residual gestational sac in resorption. The thickness of the myometrium above the scar was regular and not invaded by the trophoblast. Upon discharge， the mother was sent back to normal pregnancy management by Pontedera Hospital. The pregnancy continued regularly， the growth of the remaining fetus was regular. The patient underwent an elective caesarean section at Lucca Hospital at 39 weeks and the fetal outcome was excellent.\n\n【9】Result and Discussion\n\n【10】The optimal management of CSP has not been completely clarified yet 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>.

Pharmacological treatment options include systemic or local administration of Methotrexate (MTX)， local administration of hyperosmolar glucose solution， chloride potassium， prostaglandin or combination of the medications. These substances can be used in laparoscopic assistance or directly injected into the gestational sac. Some authors reported local or systemic methotrexate administration as a most effective treatment but systemic methotrexate treatment can’t be used on the routine due to relatively low efficacy (fibrous tissue is poorly vascularized and drug penetration is insufficient) and high risk of various adverse effects 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>. It is believed that MTX treatment is effective when serum bHCG levels are lower than 5000mIU/ml 通用删除6(英):<u>[12-14]</u>. Ultrasound imaging is not only used to diagnose but it is also used as a part of a combined approach. In fact， under ultrasound guidance， we can inject local methotrexate therapy in fetal sac (or both in fetal sac and in fetal pole) to end the pregnancyand to offer fertility preservation in asymptomatic pregnant patients without concomitant hemodynamic disorders 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>. Ifthe CSP exceeding 3 cm， local methotrexate administration can be followed by laparoscopic or laparotomy surgical correction of the caesarean section scar通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>. Promising results have also been obtained with the innovative HIFU technique that utilizes high intensity focused ultrasound通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>. The most effective way to manage caesarean scar pregnancy is synchronous use of different treatment methods. The combination of local methotrexate with simultaneous aspiration of gestational tissues under ultrasound guidance seems one of the better and minimally invasive attitudes 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>. It is the technique that we choose：Intracavitary fluid was aspirated and 1 cc of intracardiac KCl 2 mEq/mL solution was injected into the embryo. We have been very careful to inject methotrexate only in CSP and we have tried to be minimally invasive： Not to break the gestation sac and not to stimulate uterine contraction or spontaneous expulsion to protect the other pregnancy. We couldn't use systemic methotrexate because there were two pregnancies. After this stage， the remaining gestational tissues could be removed hysteroscopically with later vascular coagulation of the implantation site. In our case the remaining gestational tissues couldn’t be removed without damaging the pregnancy on the bottom， so we decided to leave it in place and to have it reabsorbed over time. As time passed the gestational material gradually reabsorbed while the bottom pregnancy continued to grow steadily. With this combined minimally invasive approach we have therefore saved the woman's life and preserved her fertility.\n\n【11】Conclusion\n\n【12】A definitive consensus of CSP treatment hasn't established yet and the type of treatment method depends on many factors. It is necessary to adapt the treatment to each individual patient taking into account size of pregnancy， bHCG level， presence or absence of uterine continuity， patient’s hemodynamic state， other contemporary pregnancies and fertility preservation 通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

Hypergammaglobulinemia is the most common cause of HVS， especially monoclonal conditions involving IgM and rarely by IgG. HVS classically presents with the triad of neurological deficits， visual changes， and mucosal bleeding. Diagnosis is based on history and physical exam findings， in the setting of a potential causative disease. Eye examination is of particular importance， since it can prompt diagnosis and therefore treatment. HVS requires emergent treatment that consists of supportive therapy， plasmapheresis and control of the underlying cause. Plasmapheresis allows symptom relieve and must be initiated promptly.\n\n【2】We report a patient who presented with low back pain， fatigue， weight loss and that was found to have anemia， hypercalcemia， acute kidney injury， hyperproteinemia and multiple osteolytic lesions， that led to the diagnosis of multiple myeloma， later discovered to be of IgG type. On presentation， she also showed signs of gum bleeding and confusion， leading to diagnosis of HVS， after evidence of retinal hemorrhage on eye examination.Plasmapheresis was initiated， with improvement of HVS， but the patient died due to febrile neutropenia， after beginning of chemotherapy.\n\n【3】This case report describes a rare condition of HVS associated with IgG Myeloma. It highlights the importance of clinical suspicion to the diagnosis and the need for urgent treatment to control symptoms and prevent complications， since HVS represents an oncologic emergency that can lead to a multitude of organ failures if left undiagnosed and untreated， potentially compromising the patients'life.\n\n【4】Keywords： Hyperviscosity syndrome； Multiple myeloma； Plasmapheresis； Case report\n\n【5】Introduction\n\n【6】HVS is an oncologic emergency that results from elevated blood viscosity 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，2]</u>. It can be caused either by a deformity of the shape of red blood cells or by any pathological elevation of cellular or acellular components of blood， particularly， immunoglobulins 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，3]</u>. Hypergammaglobulinemia is the most common cause of HVS， especially the monoclonal condition of Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia (WM)， followed by myelomas， with the IgG type accounting for less than 5% of the cases 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，4]</u>. We report the case of a patient with HVS in the setting of an IgG Multiple Myeloma， and the clinical challenges associated with the diagnosis and treatment of this medical entity.\n\n【7】Case Presentation\n\n【8】A 64-year-old woman presented to the emergency room with a history of low back pain， fatigue and weightloss with 6 months duration. Her husband also reported episodes of apathy and confused speech lasting 2 weeks. On presentation， her physical examination was unremarkable， except for the presence of palor and gum bleeding . Her laboratory findings revealed a hemoglobin of5.7g/dL (with normal MCV)， hypercalcemia (Ca2+3.34 mmol/L)， a creatinine of 1.21 mg/dL and a total protein value of 153 g/L with hypoalbuminemia of 21 g/L. The diagnosis of multiple myeloma was considered and a skull X-ray and lumbar CT were performed， showing a raindrop skull and numerous osteolytic lesions， respectively， which confirmed our suspicion. Given the clinical picture， the diagnosis of HVS was also considered and assumed after the observation of retinal hemorrhage by an ophthalmologist. Plasmapheresis was immediately initiated and further laboratory， imaging and histologic studies were performed by Hematology， confirming the presence of： a monoclonal protein  of IgG type， multiple osteolytic lesions (on PET-CT) and a diffuse bone marrow infiltration of IgG kappa producing plasmocytes (on myelogram and bone biopsy).\n\n【9】After 3 days of plasmapheresis， the patient showed signs of improvement of the HVS， with resolution of gum bleeding， retinal hemorrhage and neurologic deficits. She also started chemotherapy with Bortezomib， which also prevented further episodes of HVS， but eventually died of sepsis due to febrile neutropenia， after 2 months of treatment.\n\n【10】Discussion\n\n【11】HVS is an oncologic emergency that results from elevated blood viscosity 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. The term viscosity refers to the internal resistance of a fluid to flow. HVS is the pathological condition in which blood flow is reduced due to an increase in its “thickness”通用删除6(英):<u>[1，5]</u>. It can be caused by a deformity of the shape of red blood cells (that occurs in diseases such as sickle cell disease and spherocytosis) or by any pathological elevation of the components of blood， either cellular(red blood cells， white blood cells， platelets) or acellular (serum proteins) 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Polycythemia vera， leukemia， and thrombocytosis are classic examples of diseases that can lead to an increase in blood viscosity due to an increase in the cellular components of blood，删除1换行whereas conditions that result in hypergammaglobulinemia (either monoclonal or polyclonal) are examples of diseases that increase blood viscosity due to an increase in acellular components of blood通用删除6(英):<u>[1，3]</u>. Polyclonal causes ofHVS include rheumatoid arthritis， systemic lupus erythematosus， Siogren syndrome compromise， Castleman disease and HIV infection. Monoclonal causes include myeloma， WM and cryoglobulinemia 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，2]</u>.\n\n【12】Hypergammaglobulinemia is the most common cause of HVS， particularly WM， because of the large star-shaped IgM pentamers that are highly viscous. Myelomas are the second leading cause， with IgA myelomas accounting for 25% of all HVS cases secondary to myelomas. IgG myelomas account for less than 5% of cases 通用删除6(英):<u>[4，6，7]</u>.\n\n【13】In terms of pathophysiology， an increase in blood viscosity decreases its flow， compromising the microvascular circulation， resulting inhypoperfusion oftissues. Whenhypergammaglobulinemia is involved， it can also impair platelet function， causing prolonged bleeding time 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>.\n\n【14】Clinically， HVS cassically presents with the triad of mucosal bleeding， visual changes， and neurological deficits. Bleeding， that results from affected platelet aggregation， is the most typical sign， being epistaxis， bleeding gums and gastrointestinal bleeding the most common sites of hemorrhage 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，3]</u>. Visual changes and retinopathy can include blurred and/or double vision and arise from microvascular complications such as thrombosis or hemorrhage. Eye examination is paramount when HVS is suspected since it can lead to a timely diagnosis and allow a judicious treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，2]</u>. A reduced blood flow to the central nervous system and deposition of paraproteins within the myelin sheath of peripheral nerves result in neurological deficits， including headache， confusion， neuropathic syndromes， generalized stupor， coma， dizziness， ataxia， hearing impairment， seizures， and stroke syndromes 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，3，6]</u>.\n\n【15】Less commonly， a variety of end-organ damages can also be observed as the initial presenting symptom such as heart failure and myocardial infarction 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>.\n\n【16】A high degree of clinical suspicion is required to diagnose HVS. Although laboratory evidence of high serum viscosity establishes the diagnosis， not all laboratories perform this test and， therefore， diagnosis of this medical entity is usually made based upon the clinical picture， when a potential cause is present or highly suspected通用删除6(英):<u>[2，3]</u>. Further testing should include a complete blood count， full serum chemistries， coagulation profile， and urinalysis 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，6]</u>\n\n【17】Being an oncologic emergency， HVS requires prompt treatment in order to prevent catastrophic ischemia and multiple organ failure， and to reverse the signs， symptoms and complications associated with this condition 通用删除6(英):<u>[4，6]</u>. Therapy should be based on the severity of signs and symptoms rather than the calculated degree of viscosity 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，4，6]</u>. Initialtreatmentaims to controland ideally resolve the manifestations of HVS， while management of the underlying condition is planned and posteriorly initiated. Therefore， initial treatment of HVS consists of supportive therapy (particularly， hydration， since this condition results in high levels of dehydration) and plasmapheresis 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. Plasmapheresis can promptly reverse most clinical manifestations of HVS， by decreasing serum viscosity by 20% to 30%. It is usually well tolerated and safe and can be done on a daily basis until clinical resolution of symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，5，6]</u>.\n\n【18】The definitive treatment of HVS involves chemotherapy for the underlying hematologic condition， and is commonly started删除1换行concomitantly， after observation and discussion of the case with Hematology/Oncology 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>.\n\n【19】Conclusion\n\n【20】This case report describes a very rare condition of HVS associated with IgG Myeloma. It highlights the importance of clinical suspicion to the diagnosis and the need for urgent treatment to control symptoms and prevent complications.\n\n【21】The presence of HVS was highly suspected since our patient presented with gum bleeding and neurologic symptoms (history of confusion)， and was later confirmed after the identification of retinal hemorrhage， that completed the classical triad of this condition， in the appropriate clinical setting of a newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. This effectively shows the importance of eye examination， when HVS is suspected， since it prompted the diagnosis and， therefore， the immediate initiation of plasmapheresis. This report also demonstrates the importance of rapid beginning of plasmapheresis to avoid further complications， particularly multiple organ failure due to ischemia， and to improve signs and symptoms. After multiple sessions of plasmapheresis， our patient’s gum and retinal bleeding and confusion progressively resolved， and no other problems developed， which allowed the beginning of Bortezomib to treat the myeloma. Unfortunately， our patient presented with a severe and advanced form of multiple myeloma that resulted in her death due to complications associated with the disease and its treatment.\n\n【22】Our case is also interesting since there are few reports of HVS associated with IgG myeloma. This report alerts to the fact that this type of myeloma is also a potential underlying cause of HVS and this condition， if suspected， should not be ignored when an IgG related disease is present.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

A review of cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19 especially among Health Care Workers(HCW) is thus required.\n\n【2】Aims： The aim of our current study was to provide a comprehensive review of cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19 among HCW through six case reports and a literature review.\n\n【3】Methods： We conducted a literature search for cases reports， original and review articles using PubMed and the Google search engines.\n\n【4】We included the written in English studies that mentioned cutaneous symptoms during COVID-19infection. In addition to the review， 6 cases were collected among the HCW working at the Charles Nicolle Hospital of Tunis from September 2020 to January 2021.\n\n【5】Results： In our review， we included 17 articles in addition to our six cases. The type of papers was case series and case report in respectively 8 and 9 studies. Skin manifestations were reported in two studies including two HCW， in addition to our series of six HCW. Skin manifestations were：Chilblain like lesions (44.5%)， a generalized macular or maculopapular exanthem (32.1%)， a papulovesicular rash and chicken pox-like vesicles (11.5%)， painful acral red-purple papules (4.6%)， urticaria (2.8%)， purpuric or petechial lesions (2.3%) and livedo reticularis lesions (0.45%). Of the218 cases， 203 cases have reported the location of lesions. The very great majority of lesions were found on the trunk， hands and feet. Fifty-one patient (23.4%) experienced lesions on the trunk. The time of onset of cutaneous lesions was variable. At the diagnosis or the onset of COVID-19symptoms，8.3%(18/218) ofpatients presented with cutaneous lesions.

As of July 7uh， 2021， COVID-19 has been diagnosed in more than 184 million people worldwide通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. Its rapid spread across geographical borders leading to a pandemic can be explained by several factors such as the high rate of infectivity and transmission from asymptomatic persons 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the COVID-19 outbreak as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. COVID-19 pandemic still represents a great challenge for Healthcare Workers (HCW) around the world 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>.\n\n【10】Healthcare workers are first-line fighters against COVID-19. They may experience symptoms ranging from influenza-like illness to life-threatening respiratory distress 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. Apart from pulmonary involvement， it is interesting to note that multiple extra pulmonary manifestations have been reported in patients with COVID-19 including skin manifestations. Common clinical features删除1换行of COVID-19 are increasingly known but cutaneous manifestations associated with this infection are rarely described. A review of cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19 especially among Health Care Workers (HCW) is thus required.\n\n【11】The aim of our current study was to provide a comprehensive review of cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19 among HCW through six case reports and a literature review.\n\n【12】Methods\n\n【13】We conducted a literature search for cases reports， original and review articles published from the beginning of the COVID-19pandemic until January 2021 using PubMed and the Google search engines. In our study， we used these key search words \"cutaneous\"“skin\"， and1 \"dermatology\" in combination with \"coronavirus\"，\"COVID-19\"and\"SARS-CoV-2\". A manual search of reference lists of some relevant articles was performed. We excluded the studies that did not mention skin lesions.\n\n【14】We extracted the socio-demographic and clinical data from the included studies. Socio-demographic data were mainly the number of cases， age， gender and status for COVID-19. The clinical data were mainly the description of the cutaneous lesions， its location， onset and healing time and associated signs. The occupation was extracted from these studies when mentioned. In addition to the review， 6 cases were collected among the HCW working at the Charles Nicolle Hospital of Tunis from September 2020 to January 2021.\n\n【15】Results\n\n【16】Case presentation\n\nCase 1： A 45-year-old nurse with a history of spontaneous pneumothorax， with no previous medication， or previous adverse drug reactions， presented to the occupational medicine department with a fever， a productive cough， asthenia， and body ache with no suspicious contact of COVID-19.

ofbreath， cough and grippal syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u>. In our study， we summarized the characteristics of cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19 cases published in scientific literature in addition to our case series . We wished to characterize these manifestations， particularly among HCW for further diagnostic and prognostic value because cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19 have been increasingly reported worldwide. Skin manifestations were reported in 8 case reports and 9 case series.\n\n【30】In this review， 44.5% (97/218) of patients presented with chilblain-like lesions. In a previous review by Tan et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[25]</u>， the most common COVID-19 skin manifestations in the USA and Europe were the chilblain-like lesions. There was only 1 case reported in Asia. Rash containing macules and papules was the second cutaneous manifestation of COVID-19. However， rashes containing macules and papules were not specific to COVID-19， and there were reports of misdiagnosed cases of COVID-19 in patients with rash containing macules and papules 通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u>.\n\n【31】In the study by Recalcati et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>， 20.4%(18/88) of COVID-19patients had developed skin manifestations. These manifestations were： erythematous rash (77.8%)， urticaria (16.7%) and vesicle formation (5.6%). These findings are nearly similar to our results.\n\n【32】Skin manifestations may aid in timely diagnosis of the COVID-19infection even in the asymptomatic cases with no respiratory or common symptoms. We found that at the onset of the infection， 8.3%(18/218) of patients presented with cutaneous lesions.\n\n【33】In order to prevent the misdiagnosis of the COVID-19 signs， doctors'awareness of the skin lesions related to COVID-19删除1换行infection must be raised 通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u>. Furthermore， skin lesions may have several outcomes on the professional quality of life of HCW. Having new manifestations of the COVID-19 infection can lead to frequent consultations seeking care and treatment so that frequent absenteeism. Also， HCW may wonder if they could be assisted with compensation of their skin lesions as sequella of the COVID-19occupational disease.\n\n【34】Visible skin lesions present on exposed body parts may induce fear， disgust， aversion， or even intolerance 通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u>. Furthermore， some people with limited awareness of skin lesions after COVID-19infection believe that the disease still contagious， which mayeventually contribute to the social isolation of persons with skin lesions. HCW with skin lesions may be subject to segregation and stigmatization， especially if the lesions are visible on the face and exposed bodyareas.\n\n【35】Polymorphous cutaneous manifestations could reflect diverse interactions with the skin such as direct viral action in infected cells， hypercoagulability and immune system hyperactivity 通用删除6(英):<u>[25]</u>. The mechanisms of COVID-19 cutaneous lesions are not yet well known. Some studies have linked the cutaneous symptoms to a primary infection of the skin itself. In other theories， skin disturbances are seen as a secondary consequence after the respiratory infection. Suchonwanit et al. reported that the late-onset of lesions may be related mainly to thrombotic vasculopathy and vasculitis 通用删除6(英):<u>[26]</u>. Moreover， Litaiem et al. reported a case in Tunisia of a 39 year-old female patient diagnosed with COVID-19 infection， and 18 days after hydroxychloroquine (600 mg daily) initiation she developed a cephalocaudal spread of erythematous and pustular plaques. The Acute Generalized Exanthematous Pustulosis (AGEP) was diagnosed. Skin lesions were significantly improving after hydroxychloroquine withdrawal. They hypothesize that pustular eruptions occurring in COVID-19 patients are more likely to support drug-related origin\n\n【36】通用删除6(英):<u>[27]</u>. Gianotti et al. described the histopathology of skin COVID-19lesions with a spectrum of findings that ranged from mild spongiosis of the epithelial layer to the important situation of vasculitis and extravasation of red blood cells 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. The scientific understanding of cutaneous manifestations in patients with COVID-19 is still evolving.\n\n【37】We believe that this work is the first study describing cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19 among HCW. However， several limitations must be considered. Due to evolving literature and language-related exclusion criteria， this paper only examines 218cases. The inclusion of our cases was limited because of the low declaration by the patients and the quarantine restrictions. Moreover， publication bias was encountered. Drug side effects not mentioned in most of the studies must be taken into account. Also， occupation was not mentioned in several cases.\n\n【38】Further studies are still required to understand the mechanism and the link between skin lesions and COVID-19.So that prospective studies based on clinical and histological confrontations are needed通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>.\n\n【39】Conclusion\n\n【40】In summary， COVID-19 has been associated with different cutaneous manifestations， likely of varying pathophysiology and severity， some preceding COVID-19 symptomatology and others occurring during active disease or later in the course. Given the evolving state of evidence， occupationalphysicians should be aware of the variety of skin manifestations related to COVID-19among Health care workers. Thus， heightened awareness and timely recognition of dermatologic findings in COVID-19 are important for occupational physicians treating HCW with COVID-19. Further studies are still required to understand the mechanism and the link between skin lesions and COVID-19.

Tuberculosis is the responsible ofa respiratory chronic disease that spreads through the respiratory tract and has the lungs as primary target. The increase of new cases， mainly due to migratory flows， has led to the reappearance of aspects of the disease that are now forgotten. The aim of this paper8.3is focusing on a typical radiological sign indicative of progressive post-primary disease， actually no more considered in recent scientific literature， but well known to radiologists at the beginning of the 20\" century： The infiltrate of Assmann-Redeker. The recognition of this sign makes it possible the recognition of cases of early post-primary disease and the immediate implementation of the correct therapeutic procedure. Our paper consists of a series of four cases admitted to the Policlinico Umberto I in Rome， in which these findings were not initially recognized. Retrospectively this radiological sign was found on the chest X-ray. All Patients underwent chest CT to compare this finding. Diagnostic confirmation was finally obtained through laboratory investigations and one case histology proven， after surgery.\n\n【2】Abbreviations\n\n【3】CT： Computer Tomography； WHO： World Health Organization； TB： Tuberculosis； SARS-CoV-2： Severe Acquired Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2；PA： Posterior Anterior； LL： Latero-Lateral\n\n【4】Introduction\n\n【5】Tuberculosis (TB) is a chronic infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis， a Bacillus that spreads through the respiratory tract and most commonly has the lungs as target organs (80%).\n\n【6】According to data released in the World Report on Tuberculosis of 2018 by the World Health Organization (WHO)通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>，this is one of the top ten deadly diseases worldwide and is the leading cause of death from a single pathogen. In 2014， the WHO proposed a global strategy to end tuberculosis epidemics around the world， estimating a 75% reduction in the death rate from tuberculosis in 2025and 95% in通用删除6(英):<u> 20352]</u>.\n\n【7】However， one of the main obstacles to achieving this objective is represented by the migratory phenomenon， with great difficulty in visualizing an epidemic outbreak， making its management more complex and demanding. The epidemic is influenced by several factors， such as high mobility， low socioeconomic status， poor hygiene， and poor accessibility to the health service， which involves a prolonged time for the diagnosis and treatment oftuberculosis， favoring the spread of the disease.\n\n【8】The migrant population is， therefore， subject to a higher risk of tuberculosis， constituting high challenges for the prevention and control of the disease.\n\n【9】Although TB is not a rare disease， the reduced knowledge of some indications， that was once well known and then forgotten， can lead to a delayed diagnosis. While the Gohn's complex， the characteristic tuberculous caverns， or the Miliary dissemination belong to common knowledge， there are less known but still characteristic findings of tuberculous disease that must return to a distant part of the cultural background of the radiologist specialist.\n\n【10】We intend to highlight in particular， a radiological sign of progressive post-primary disease， the infiltrate of Assmann-Redeker， now almost totally disappeared from modern literature despite the frequency， in the course of tuberculous disease， have not decreased at all.\n\n【11】Materials and Methods\n\n【12】We considered four cases which underwent diagnostic evaluation in our Institute in a period ranging from 2017 to 2020. All the radiological investigations suggesting tuberculous diseases were re-evaluated and integrated with the anamnestic and clinical data-laboratories.\n\n【13】The specific X-ray findings were：\n\n【14】Hazy infiltrative areas with mainly apical localization (SO-called Assman-Redeker infiltrate)\n\n【15】Focal areas oftranslucency referable to cavitation\n\n【16】Pleural effusion\n\n【17】The specific CT findings were\n\n【18】Consolidation and cavitation\n\n【19】Lymphadenopathy\n\n【20】Involvement of the airways\n\n【21】Pleural effusion 通用删除6(英):<u>[3，4]</u>\n\n【22】Finally， diagnostic confirmation with culture was obtained.\n\n【23】Case Series\n\n【24】Case 1\n\n【25】Man with recurrent syncopal episodes and marked weight loss： A 59 years old man was admitted in the emergency room complaining about some recurrent syncopal episodes preceded by dizziness. Smoking habit and marked weight loss of about 30 kg in the last six months have also reported.\n\n【26】The preliminary chest X-ray examination showed an area of consolidation at the left mid-upper field， adhering to the lateralpleura and extending to the perihilar area .\n\n【27】Based onto the medical history， the case was suspected for lung cancer. Following investigations were performed：\n\n【28】- Brain CT： No significant findings.\n\n【29】-Chest CT： Extensive area of consolidation at the left upper lobe compatible with cancer .\n\n【30】The patient underwent biopsy； the pathologist report was \"Diffuse lymphomonocytic infiltrate with extensive perivascular fibrous transformation\".\n\n【31】A chest X-ray a month later showed： An increase of the consolidation area was evident， extensively involving all the upper left lobe ：\n\n【32】The following CT shows a complete parenchymal subversion of the left upper lobe with lingular sparing .\n\n【33】During hospitalization， the serological investigations performed revealed an HIV infection. The previous diagnosis has been then reconsidered as a tubercular disease and the therapy changed to a specific antibiotic therapy with isoniazid， ethambutol， rifampicin and Pvrazinamide for six months.\n\n【34】A CT examination，7 months later， clearly showed the resolution of the pulmonary consolidation therefore to be attributed to\n\n【35】Case 2\n\n【36】Young man with suspected SARS-CoV-2pneumonia： A22-years-old man from Asia come to the Emergency Room for suspected Severe Acquired Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2infection (SARS-CoV-2)，with hyperpyrexia (T：39°℃) and respiratory symptoms (cough， cold， and sneezing). The medical history： was negative for major disease.\n\nOn CT scan， a consolidation with almost complete hepatization of the entire right upper lobe in the residual aerated parenchyma is observed and the presence of \"bronchiectasis cystic areas\" with a maximum size of 7 mm is described. Further consolidations are|删除段之间换行|In absence of clinical improvement， three weeks later ， chest CT scan was performed. The radiological findings showed a severe worsening， with the aerated part at the level of the right upper lobe replaced by some small cavitations. The overall picture described is indicative of Assmann-Redeker infiltrate. The diagnosis has been confirmed by sputum test. The patient has undergone specific therapy with the combination of four antibiotics： Isoniazid， ethambutol， rifampicin and pyrazinamide for the first six months.\n\n【38】Case 3\n\n【39】Woman with productive cough and hemoptysis： A 46-year-old woman was admitted to emergency room for productive cough and hemoptysis. The patient reported Kaposi's sarcoma from 2007， diabetes， and a previous right upper lobar infection not well defined.\n\nThe chest X-ray showed a big opacity in the right apical area and shift of the ipsilateral hemidiaphragm|删除段之间换行|CT confirmed the complete atelectasis of the right upper lobe with cavitation in the context . Diagnosis of tuberculosis has been confirmed by sputum test.\n\n【41】The patient worsened with an increase of cavitation and necrosis phenomena； then an infection due to Aspergillus spp. arises .\n\n【42】X-ray shows an area of subversion of the lung parenchyma in the right apical area.\n\n【43】Axial thin-section collimated unenhanced CT image shows a complete atelectasis of right upper lobe and the presence of cavitation areas in the context.\n\n【44】In this case the only way to limit the expansive infective process was deemed to be to a superior lobectomy according to the advice of the thoracic surgeon. The histology confirmed Tuberculosis and Aspergillus co-infection.\n\n【45】Case 4\n\n【46】Young man with cough and dyspnea with unknown medical history： The last case is a 19-years-old man of Somali origin， admitted in our hospital after a humanitarian flight. He presented cough and dyspnea but most of his medical history remained unknown due to the language barrier.\n\n【47】Axial thin-section collimated unenhanced CTimage shows apical删除1换行consolidation with small cavitation phenomena with a \"breadcrumb\"删除1换行appearance.\n\n【48】The area of opacity at the level of the left upper lobe， corresponding to an Assmann-Redeker infiltrate， was initially considered a heteroplastic process.\n\n【49】Worsening is evident. On the X-ray， the appearance of a coarse opacity with paarly defined margins is abserved， due to the presence of cavitative phenomena which are confirmed by CT examination.\n\n【50】Due to the poor documentation available the patient had been initially treated with a nonspecific antibiotic therapy.\n\n【51】The chest X-ray described an irregular opacity in the left apical area， with diffused hypodiaphania of the remaining parenchyma， probably due to pleural effusion .\n\n【52】The CT scan， performed four days later， confirmed apical consolidation with small cavitations (the so called \"breadcrumb appearance). This typical finding， in this case， is immediately identified as post-primary TB with apicodorsal reactivation of the left upper lobe (Assmann-Redeker infiltrate) .\n\n【53】Results and Discussion\n\n【54】Chest X-ray is commonly the first radiological examination in patients with a suspected tuberculous disease. It is the first level of investigation with the highest degree of appropriateness. In all cases of consolidation involving the upper lobes or the upper segments of the lower lobes， associated with mediastinal lymphadenopathy or cavitation， the diagnosis of TB must be considered 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>.\n\n【55】Primary tuberculosis is mainly common in the pediatric population， although in low prevalence areas the adult population may represent more than a quarter of cases. This is because in many cases， primary tuberculosis has few or no symptoms； more often， only HIV patients can show clear signs of disease at this stage 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>.\n\n【56】The radiographic features described in the literature are：\n\n【57】Lymphadenopathy which is the most common sign of primary TB， present in about one-third of cases.\n\n【58】Pulmonary consolidation， often not so different from other bacterial forms.\n\n【59】Pleural effusion， typically unilateral， present in about 25%of adult cases 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>.\n\n【60】The Literature shows that chest X-ray has a high sensitivity but low specificity 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>.\n\n【61】Post-primary tuberculosis， on the other hand， represents the evolution of the disease after a variable long latent period. This is mainly due to a partially competent immune system which leads to the reactivation of the Bacillus， with consequent dissemination.\n\n【62】At this stage， a typical sign well known to radiologists， especially in the pre-antibiotic era but less considered in recent literature， is the so-called early Assmann-Redeker infiltrate. This sign (also called\"precocious subclavicular thysiogenic infiltrate\") was described during the 1930s by Assmann and was considered one of the earliest signs of post-primary disease in adults until the 1950s， even before manifesting symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>. The importance of early diagnosis of this aspect of post-primary TB lies in the finding， widely documented since the time of the first description， of an evolution of the infiltrate towards the much more extensive and severe caseous phlebitis， in case of delay in the introduction of therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>.\n\n【63】The infiltrate is described as a rounded opacity， mainly located at the infraclavicular level in correspondence with the upper lobes. The size may be variable and are not related to symptoms， while the density is similar to the hilar shadows but it never reaches the density of the mediastinum 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>. The description given by Assmann concerned plan chest radiography. The evolution in caseous pneumonia was expressed with an extension of opacity to the whole lobe and the appearance of numerous small areas of cavitation， which provide the typical aspect defined as \"breadcrumb\".\n\n【64】In the CT era， as evident from literature， this infiltrate has never been distinguished by the severe post-primary TB， although this particular aspect may differentiate the advanced disease in which more extensive cavitations， present in about 50% of cases， represent the most characteristic sign 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>\n\n【65】The Assmann-Redeker infiltrate can be observed in CT as an area of parenchymal consolidation with blurred edges， mainly localized at the level of the posterior segments of the upper lobes and with a multiloculated appearance like a \"crumb of bread\".\n\n【66】Our first case is emblematic of the incorrect clinical/therapeutic management. In fact， the patient was initiallyconsidered oncological， thus conditioning the evolution of his disease. If a differential diagnosis with TB were immediately considered， prompt action would have been taken； avoiding the patient's worsening .\n\n【67】In the second case， the small cavitations due to caseous necrosis have been erroneously referred as cystic bronchiectasis. To rejoin the studies conducted by Assman at the beginning of the 204 century， in this case， the evolution of the disease was， precisely， what he described with the use of traditional radiology alone： Cavitation phenomena， typical of uncontrolled post-primary TB 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u> .\n\n【68】Learning Points\n\nThe Assmann-Redeker infiltrate at chest X-ray presents as a rounded opacity， mainly located at the infra-clavicular level in the upper lobes with variable size and a density similar to the hilum， observed in patients in an early stage of post-primary tuberculosis|删除段之间换行|CT scan， the second level exam， often reveals a typicallobar pneumonia with many areas of cavitation. This specific aspect is generally described as breadcrumb appearance.\n\n【70】When all these findings are presents， related to typical TB symptoms，radiologists should consider this infectious disease at first.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

The Pre-operative CT scan showed no evidence of distant metastasis. He underwent a subtotal gastrectomy with a D1， five lymph node dissection. Histologically， the tumor was a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with signet ring cells invading the subserosa without lymph node metastasis. Additional histologic findings were venous and lymphatic vessel invasion. After the surgery， a concomitant chemo-radiotherapy was indicated. The treatment was well tolerated. Two years and three months after， the patient developed a locoregional recurrence. He underwent surgery and post-operative chemotherapy by 12 courses of flox regimen including 5FU， folinic acid， and oxaliplatin. Grade 2 neuropathy was reported.\n\n【8】During the follow-up period， one year and nine months after the recurrence， the patient presented pharyngeal discomfort. A mass of 4 cm was observed in the palatine tonsil with multiple cutaneous mass of the head. The CT scan showed a left adrenal metastasis. The biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma， a metastasis from gastric cancer. The cutaneous nodules were also a metastasis of gastric cancer.

This can be explained by the presence in addition to the cutaneous metastasis which are darkened the prognosis in the gastric adenocarcinomas.\n\n【13】Although for the patients receiving BSC，the mean survival was 3.8months. These data indicate that surgical treatment， chemotherapy， and radiotherapy were effective in tonsillar metastasis from gastric cancer.\n\n【14】Conclusion\n\n【15】The occurrence of tonsillar metastasis， although rare， must be considered in the differential diagnosis of tonsillar lesions.

Up to now， inclusive education was considered as “children with special needs and ordinary children study and live together in the same physical space， and enjoy equal， non-discriminatory and high-quality education”通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. In the 1990s， China carried out the work of learning in regular class for children with disabilities 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. With the vigorous implementation of learning in regular class， its quality had attracted more attention. Two periods of special education promotion plans had been issued successively， aiming to put forward requirements for running special education well in the new era and caring for special children. On December 31，2021，the General Office of the State Council forwarded“14h Five-Year Plan\"Special Education Development and Upgrading Action Plan， which clearly pointed out that it was necessary to explore an inclusive education model that could adapt to the common growth of children with disabilities and ordinary children， and promote the integration of children with disabilities and ordinary children 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. The importance of inclusive education could be clearlyseen. However， in the implementation ofinclusive education， “along with the class but just sitting “mixed study with class and students reflux frequently occurred 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u> and the teaching effect of inclusive education had always been questioned. Therefore， how to improve the quality of inclusive education is more and more important.\n\n【12】删除1:<u>Copyright @ 2022 Fu W.删除13:<u> This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License， which permits unrestricted use， distribution， and reproduction in any medium， provided the original work is properly cited.</u></u>\n\n【13】Relevant studies had found that inclusive physical education could promote the active communication behavior of special children， stabilize emotions， reduce problem behaviors， improve social communication and social adaptation ability 通用删除6(英):<u>[6-8]</u>， realize life care for students weak in sports， promote students' all-round development， and promote education equity 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>. Therefore，删除1换行improving the quality of inclusive physical education could not only promote the physical and mental healthy growth of special and ordinary children 通用删除6(英):<u>[10，11]</u>， but also promote the overall development of inclusive education in China. The direct implementers of inclusive physical education were physical education teachers， who determined the quality of inclusive physical education. Among them， the inclusive education competency of physical education teachers played an important role 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. Teachers’ competency referred to the basic conditions and abilities that teachers had to engage in educational and teaching activities 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. Relevant studies had found that， compared with physical factors such as class size， environment and students'personal factors， teachers competencyplayeda moreimportantrolein students learning performance 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>. Inclusive education put forward new requirements for teachers’ qualities， including the concept， knowledge and skills of inclusive education， so as to meet the needs of special children and ordinary children receiving education under the same roof 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. On the basis ofprevious studies， this study defined the inclusive education competency of physical education teachers as the basic conditions and abilities that physical education teachers needed to have when carrying out inclusive physical education teaching activities， including professional attitude， professional knowledge， professional skills and the capacity ofacquiring supports.\n\n【14】To sum up， the development of inclusive physical education in China was still in its initial stage. A large number of studies remained in the exploration of inclusive physical education theories， and the relevant research on improving the quality of inclusive physical education was few. High-quality inclusive physical education could not only promote the physical and mental development of special children， but also realize the care for the life of special children， so that special children could enjoy life. While there are few studies pay attention on the inclusive education competency of physical education teachers. In order to provide practical implication for improving the quality of our inclusive physical education， this study analyzed the factors influencing the inclusive educational quality of physical education teachers in primary and secondary schools based on the analysis of the inclusive education quality of P.E. teachers in primary and secondary schools.\n\n【15】Method\n\n【16】Participants\n\n【17】P.E. teachers in primary and secondary schools were selected as the subjects by convenient sampling throughout the country. It covered 20 provinces， including the northeast， east， central and west， with a total of 317 people. After screening， 286 valid questionnaires were obtained， with an effective rate of 90.2%. Sample information was shown in Table 1.\n\n【18】Measures\n\n【19】On the basis of the “Questionnaire on Professional Quality of Teachers in Compulsory Education”compiled by Wang Yan et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>， a preliminary questionnaire was prepared. In order to investigate the structure of the questionnaire and the expression of the items， five primary and middle school P.E. teachers and one special education expert were consulted for their opinions. After adjusting the items and expression， the questionnaire on Inclusive Educational Competency of Primary and Middle School P.E. Teachers was formed. The questionnaire consisted of the basic information of the subjects and the status quo of inclusive education competency. The first part was the basic information of the subiects. The contents include gender，删除1换行province， school district， education background， teaching age， study section， taught special children or not and the length of training related to inclusive education. The second part was the core content of the questionnaire， which was the current situation of the inclusive education competency. It was divided into four parts with a total of28 questions. Part one， professional attitude， 9 questions； Part two， professional knowledge， 6 questions； part three， professional skills， 7questions； part four， capacity of acquiring supports， 6 questions. The questionnaire used a five-level scoring method. According to whether the respondents agreed with the item description， the options were divided into \"strongly agree\"， “relatively agree\"， “not sure\"， “not quite agree” and “strongly disagree\"， which were respectively scored 5，4， 3， 2 and 1 points. The higher the score， the higher the inclusive education competency of the teacher. The reliability analysis of the questionnaire showed that the internal consistency coefficients of the four factors of professional attitude， professional knowledge， professional skills and capacity of acquiring supports were 0.931，0.951， 0.958 and 0.952， respectivelyy.The internal consistency coefficient of the total questionnaire was 0.968， indicating that the reliability of the questionnaire was good. The construct validity of the questionnaire was tested， and the KMO value was 0.937， and the significance level of chi-square value of Bartlett sphericity test was P=0.000<0.001， so this questionnaire was suitable for exploratory factor analysis. The principal component analysis method was used to extract the common factors， and the maximum variance method was used to rotate the factors. Finally， four common factors were extracted，and the cumulative variance contribution rate was 78.58%. Confirmatory factor analysis of the questionnaire was performed， the result found 区/df=1.416， p<0.001， GFI=0.968， AGFI=0.922， RMSEA=0.051， showed that the questionnaire structure validity is good.\n\n【20】Data analysis\n\n【21】In this study， the data wereobtainedbydistributing questionnaires， carefully screening questionnaires and eliminating extreme values and outliers. SPSS 26.0 software was used to test the reliability and validity of the data and analyze the differences.\n\n【22】Results\n\n【23】P.E. Teachers inclusive education competency\n\n【24】In order to investigate the scores of each dimension of the inclusive education competency of the subjects， Table 2 showed the mean and standard deviation of the scores of each dimension.Among them， the score of professional attitude dimension of P.E. teachers was significantly higher than that of professional knowledge (t=8.639， p<0.001)， professional skills (t=4.903， p<0.001) and capacity of acquiring supports (t=6.296，p<0.001)， and the score of professional knowledge dimension was significantly lower than that ofprofessional skills (t= -5.664， p<0.001). and the capacity of acquiring supports (t=-3.873， p<0.001). The score of professional skills was higher than that of the capacity of acquiring supports (t=1.980，P<0.05).\n\n【25】Difference analysis of P.E. teachers inclusive education competency\n\n【26】Under different background variables， the differences of inclusive education competency of P.E. teachers were analyzed， and it was found that there were no significant differences in gender， school district and study section， while the statistical test results of four background variables， teaching age， taught special children or not， and the cumulative duration of training related to inclusive education，删除表格换行reached the significant level. Furthermore， one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was conducted on the length of training related to inclusive education， and independent sample t-test was conducted on whether the children with special needs had been taught up .\n\n【27】Table 1： Demographic information of the participants (N=286).\n\n| Teacher's information  | h  | 100%  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Gender  |  |  |\n| Male  | 228  | 79.7  |\n| Female  | 58  | 20.3  |\n| The school district  |  |  |\n| City  | 204  | 71.3  |\n| Town  | 58  | 20.3  |\n| Village  | 24  | 8.4  |\n| Education background  |  |  |\n| Master degree or above  | 40  | 14  |\n| Undergraduate  | 242  | 84.6  |\n| Junior College and below  | 4  | 1.4  |\n| Teaching age  |  |  |\n| Novice (0~5 years)  | 142  | 49.7  |\n| Skilled (6-15 years)  | 80  | 28  |\n| Expert (over 16 years)  | 64  | 22.4  |\n| Study section  |  |  |\n| Primary school  | 82  | 28.7  |\n| Junior high school  | 90  | 31.5  |\n| High school  | 114  | 39.9  |\n\n【29】Table 2： The general situation of inclusive education accomplishment of P.E. teachers in primary and secondary schools.\n\n| Dimensions  | M±SD  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Protessional attitude  | 4.08±0.79  |  |\n| Protessional knowledge  | 3.41±0.97  |  |\n| Professional skills  | 3.73±0.89  |  |\n| Capacity of acquiring supports  | 3.64±0.90  |  |\n| Inclusive education competency  | 3.76±0.74  |  |\n\n【31】We found on the teaching age background variables， novice and expert P.E. teachers in professional knowledge dimension and the capacity of acquiring supports dimension of dab at significantly higher scores of P.E. teachers， in general， the novice and expert P.E. teachers' education quality is significantly higher than for a master type fusion of P.E. teachers’ education quality. In terms of the background variable of whether brought special children or not， P.E. teachers who have brought special children have significantly higher scores in all dimensions of inclusive education competency than those who have not brought special children. P.E. teachers who have brought special children have higher inclusive education competency. In terms of the background variables of cumulative duration of inclusive education-related training， the scores of P.E. teachers who have received inclusive education-related training in the three dimensions of professional knowledge， professional skills and capacity of acquiring supports were significantly higher than those who have not received inclusive education-related training. However， the length of time receiving inclusive education-related training had删除1换行no significant effect on the inclusive education competency of P.E. teachers. In general， the inclusive education competency of P.E. teachers who had received inclusive education-related training was higher than that of P.E. teachers who had not received inclusive education-related training.\n\n【32】Discussion\n\n【33】P.E. Teachers’ inclusive education competency\n\n【34】The study found the inclusive education competency of physical education teachers in Chinese primary and middle schools needed to be further improved. Among the four dimensions， professional attitude scored the highest， followed by professional skills， capacity of acquiring supports， and professional knowledge scored the lowest.\n\n【35】In the professional attitude dimension， most P.E. teachers held a positive attitude towards inclusive physical education. They generaly believed that special students should receive physical education on an equal basis with ordinary students. They also believed that special students and ordinary students attending classes together was conducive to the social development of special children and the alleviation of social discrimination against special groups， which could also have a certain positive impact on the physical and mental development of ordinary students.\n\n【36】In the professional knowledge dimension， most P.E. teachers believed that their theoretical knowledge of inclusive education was not enough. On the one hand， they did not know much about the relevant policies， laws and regulations of inclusive education， on the other hand， they did not master the specific teaching methods of inclusive physical education and did not have the knowledge of how to analyze and adjust the psychology of special children. The reason for this problem was that most physical education teachers usually graduated from the major of physical education， while students majoring in physical education in China had not received the study of inclusive physical education related knowledge 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>. In addition， 72percent of teachers had no post-service training related to inclusive education. Therefore， there was a lack of inclusive education and other relevant training in both pre-service training and post-service training systems， which hindered the accumulation of teachers professional knowledge and further affected the improvement of teachers'inclusive education quality.\n\n【37】In the professional skills dimension， the score of professional skills was significantly lower than the score of professional attitudes， but higher than the score of professional knowledge and capacity of acquiring supports. Some P.E. teachers believed that they lacked the ability to adjust the teaching objectives and teaching strategies according to special students in P.E. teaching， and they had low self-efficacy in implementing group cooperative learning and effective management for special students. The lack of training related to inclusive education would have a negative impact on theaccumulation of professional knowledge， as well as the promotion of professional skills. However， the score of the dimension of professional skills was higher than that of the dimension of professional knowledge and capacity of acquiring supports. The reason was that， on the one hand， professional skills could accumulate practical experience in physical education and improve by imitating other teachers or professional teachers. On the other hand， most physical education teachers had not participated in the inclusive physical education teaching or the training of relevant professional knowledge and skills， which led to their lack of understanding of the actual classroom teaching situation，删除表格换行and their cognition of professional skills stayed in the general physical education classroom teaching， which could result in a high score of the dimension of professional skills.\n\n【38】Table 3： Summary of descriptive statistics of different teaching years， special children and training duration in each dimension.

On the one hand， the lack of professional knowledge of physical education teachers could affect their capacity of acquiring supports. Lack of understanding of relevant policies， laws and regulations could affect teachers'understanding of the channels through which they can obtain relevant support. On the other hand， due to the traditional examination evaluation system for pursuing higher education， physical education teachers paid more attention to the physical education examination of all students， but ignored the children with special needs， which limited the initiative ofteachers to\n\n【44】Influencing factors of P.E. Teachers' inclusive education competency\n\n【45】Difference of inclusive education competency of P.E. Teachers with different teachingage： First， we analyzed the inclusiveeducation competency of P.E. teachers with different teaching age. It was found that different teachingages werethe main factors affecting the inclusive education quality of primary and secondary school teachers. On the whole， the inclusive education competencyof novice P.E. teachers was significantly higher than that of skilled P.E. teachers， and the inclusive education competency of expert P.E. teachers was significantly higher than that of skilled P.E. teachers. Generally speaking， the longer they had been teaching， the longer they had received training related to inclusive education， and the more likely they were to improve their删除1换行inclusive education competency. Therefore， the longer they had been teaching， the higher their integrated education competency was. However， the data of this study showed that the longer the teaching time， the higher the inclusive education competency was not necessarily. The score of inclusive education competency of skilled teachers was the lowest， while the score of novice teachers (0 to 5 years of teaching) and expert teachers (more than 16 years of teaching) had no significant difference. Relevant studies had found that skilled teachers (who have been teaching for 6 to 15 years) were in the most serious stage of job burnout 通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u>. Teachers in this stage had negative emotions towards work and low sense of self-efficacy， resulting in the lowest inclusive education competency. Novice teachers were relatively rich and skilled in theoretical knowledge and skills， and had a high sense of self-efficacy. Moreover， they might not have been exposed to inclusive education-related work， leading to high scores. Constrained by their original thoughts and limited training， expert teachers held a negative attitude towards such a form of education and were unwilling to adjust their teaching strategies to promote the development of inclusive physical education 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>， resulting in a low score of their inclusive education competency.\n\n【46】In terms of experience of teaching children with disables， we found that “taught special children or not\"had a significant impact on the inclusive education competency of P.E. teachers. The scores of physical education teachers who had taught special children in all dimensions of inclusive education competency were significantly higher than those who had not taught special children. Through interviews of physical education teachers who had taught special children， it was found that physical education teachers who had taught special children had certain teaching experience， had certain understanding of the characteristics of physical and psychological development of special children， and could adjust teaching strategies and teaching methods so that all students could adapt to physical education， so as to show high inclusive education competency. Relevant studies also showed that teachers' experience in inclusive education was an important factor affecting teachers' attitude toward inclusive education， and experienced teachers had more positive attitudes 通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>. The quality of education experience had a significant impact on teachers'attitudes towards inclusive education. Teachers with successful inclusive education experience had a more positive attitude than teachers without successful inclusive education experience 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>. Continuous contact with special children could also improve teachers’ professional knowledge and skills related to inclusive education， to a certain extent， so as to improve their inclusive education competency.\n\n【47】Influence of training on inclusive education competency for P.E. Teachers： It was found that whether they had received training related to inclusive education had a predictive effect on the inclusive education competency of physical education teachers， and the inclusive education competency of physical education teachers who had received relevant training was significantly higher than that of physical education teachers who had not received relevant training. Generally speaking， the longer the relevant training time， the higher the inclusive education competency of teachers would be. However， the results ofthis study showed that there was no significant difference in the inclusive education competency of teachers who received training within one month and more than one month， which was consistent with the research results of Wang 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. Through interviews with teachers who have participated in relevant training， this study found that the reasons for this situation could lie in the following删除1换行two points. First， the training content was too shallow. The training related to inclusive education mostly stayed on the concept， without real and systematic teaching. Second， teachers lacked practical exercise. The training content was completely lecture-style without practical training， which hindered the improvement of inclusive education competency.\n\n【48】Practical Im plications\n\n【49】Firstly， enhance support for P.E. teachers implement inclusive education. Relevant studies showed that external adequate support could improve teachers' attitude towards inclusive education 通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u>， and thus improve their inclusive education competency. Therefore， this study suggested that physical education teachers should be equipped with sufficient external support to carry out inclusive physical education， so as to promote the improvement of inclusive education competency of physical education teachers. First， improve the construction of resource classrooms to ensure that every school had at least one resource classroom. Resource classroom was the most important part of inclusive education. The resource classroom was also equipped with special resource teachers who had rich experience in special education. Under such a condition， improving the construction of resource classrooms could not only provide individualized education for students with special needs， but also promote the mastery of knowledge and skills of ordinary physical education teachers and improve their inclusive education competency.Second，bring in a variety of sports equipment. Various kinds of equipment could be customized to meet the needs of different special children， to promote the steady progress of the teaching plan.\n\n【50】Secondly， increase the pre-service and post-service training on inclusive education for P.E. teachers. It was found in the survey that teachers who had received training related to inclusive education had significantly higher inclusive education competency than those who had not received training， and inclusive education courses for pre-service physical education teachers could improve their self-efficacy when teaching special children 通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u>. Therefore， carrying out training related to inclusive education was the key to improve the inclusive education competency of physical education teachers， mainly in the following two points. First， improve the pre-service training. Relevant content such as inclusive education and special education should be embedded into the compulsory curriculum system of physical education major. Relevant teaching content could be learned from western countries to improve the pre-service training system. Second， improve post-job training. Experts and scholars related to inclusive education and special education were invited to compile training programs. In terms of content， due to the strong practical characteristics of physical education， it was necessary not only to have reasonable teaching content with increasing difficulty， but also to have practical operation content， so that physical education teachers could fully explore and understand relevant theories in practice， but also to ensure frequent training and promote the specialization of post-service training.\n\n【51】Thirdly， incorporate the inclusive education competency into teacher assessment of P.E.

We repot six cases of rhino-orbital mucormycosis in COVID-19 patients who presented to the medical emergency of our academic hospital in north India from May 17h through May 24h， 2021. All the patients in this series were COVID-19 positive with nasopharyngeal swab testing. Five out of six cases had severe COVID-19 pneumonia， for which they were receiving steroid treatment， interleukin-6 inhibitors or other immunomodulatory therapy not used in any patient. The typical predisposing comorbid illness was type-2 DM in all patients， with poor glycemic control indicated by high plasma glucose levels and elevated glycated hemoglobin. Further， diabetic ketoacidosis is seen in two patients at admission and diabetic ketosis in one patient.\n\n【2】The first symptoms of the rhino-orbital syndrome were unilateral facial pain or swelling， periorbital swelling， orbital pain， and blurred vision. Two patients had cerebral involvement at presentation. The interval between the onset of symptoms of COVID-19 and the first symptoms of rhino-orbital mucormycosis ranged from 1 to 14 days. Computed tomography of paranasal sinuses and orbit was obtained in four cases. Severe unilateral thickening of the sinonasal mucosa with or without underlying bone erosions had been the most consistent finding . The intraorbital disease was evident in three patients， two patients had bilateral sinus involvement， and intracerebral invasion was presentin two patients. For a prompt diagnosis， microscopic examination of the specimens (scrapings from the nasal cavity or destructive palatal lesion) using the potassium hydroxide-calcofluor white method was performed， which yielded aseptate broad-branched hypha suggestive of mucor in three patients， and in the rest three， remained inconclusive. All the patients treated with intravenous amphotericin， and one patient underwent surgical debridement. Hyperglycemia managed with insulin infusion to achieve a glycemic target of 140 mg/dL to 180mg/dL. Of the six patients， only two patients improved clinically and discharged successfully.

We report a case of a large pleomorphic adenoma in the upper lip in a 42-year-old man with a 6-month evolution， which due to its size could be mistaken for a malignant lesion. Biopsy is essential to close the diagnosis in these cases and to exclude the hypothesis of a malignant lesion； the treatment was performed with surgical excision.\n\n【2】Keywords： Pleomorphic adenoma； Salivary gland tumor； Benign neoplasm\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Pleomorphic adenoma is the most common benign mixed tumor of the salivary glands. May occur in both major and minor salivary glands 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，2]</u>. This tumor usually presents as a solitary， painless， slow-growing nodular mass， with prevalence in females and with a higher occurrence between the third and sixth decade of life. Histologically， the lesion may present variable epithelial， myoepithelial and mesenchymal elements， usually presenting a well-circumscribed capsule. Epithelial cells can form ducts， islands， or cords of cells 通用删除6(英):<u>[3，4]</u>. Differential diagnoses include mucoepidermoid carcinoma， salivary gland tumors， mucocele， neurofibroma， schwannoma and secondary infections. Treatment consists of surgical excision of the lesion with a safety margin. Incomplete removal cases can cause recurrences. Post-surgical follow-up is essential to assess the possibility of malignant transformation 通用删除6(英):<u>[3，5，6]</u>.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】Male patient， 42 years old， sailor， was referred to our department for presenting a painless swelling in the upper lip region. The patient reported evolution of the lesion of six months. During the anamnesis， the patient had a good general condition and reported being hypertensive controlled by medication. In the intra-oral clinical examination， the patient presented a large， solitary， painless， hardened， normocolored， pedunculated， smooth-surfaced tumor lesion in the region of the upper left labial mucosa， with an evolution of six months . Patient had a urine test result， performed six days before our appointment， without the presence of abnormalities.\n\n【7】Given the different diagnostic hypotheses， an excisional biopsy of the lesion was requested to clarify the diagnosis. The macroscopic material sent for analysis consisted of a soft tissue fragment， with a smooth surface， irregular shape， firm consistency， brown in color， measuring 20 mm x10 mm ×10 mm . Histological sections revealed a fragment of glandular neoplasia. Neoplastic cells form ducts with two or seven layers of cells containing hyaline material in their interior. In some fields， neoplastic cells displayed eccentric plasmacytoid-like nuclei. In other fields， the presence of deposition of hyaline material and myxoid material was observed. The neoplasm was delimited by dense fibrous connective tissue and showed， in some fields， neoplastic cells with a polyhedral shape that， sometimes，presented eccentric nuclei with a plasmacytoid shape. Completing the histopathological picture， a discrete mononuclear inflammatory infiltrate， extravasation of red blood cells and ectatic blood vessels of varying sizes were present in the specimen . The final diagnosis was compatible with pleomorphic adenoma.\n\n【8】The treatment was performed by surgical excision of the lesion and was uneventful . Antibiotic， anti-inflammatory， and analgesic were prescribed to control postoperative symptoms. The patient had a satisfactory recovery and within the expected parameters.\n\n【9】Discussion\n\n【10】Salivary gland tumors are complex lesions that are differentiated by the clinical-histological pattern. These lesions are rare and represent about 3% to 10% of all head and neck neoplasms 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. Most represent benign tumors， about 75% to 85%； females are the gender most affected by these tumors， the parotid gland represents the most affected location， it can occur in any age group， however， the highest reports occur between the third and sixth decade of life 通用删除6(英):<u>[7-9]</u>.\n\n【11】The AP represents the most common neoplasm of the salivary gland. Most of these tumors arise in the parotid gland. Intraorally， the most common sites are the palate， upper lip and buccal mucosa， areas that have many minor salivary glands. The name of this lesion refers to its varied histology， composed of epithelial， myoepithelial andmesenchymal structures 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，2，9]</u>. Clinically， the lesion is usually present as a unilateral， asymptomatic， slow-growing， well-circumscribed and most often encapsulated tumor， the overlying mucosa most often does not present ulceration 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，8]</u>.\n\n【12】Minor salivary gland tumors are uncommon and among them the pleomorphic adenoma is the most frequent. In a study of 82 cases of tumors in minor salivary glands carried out by Toida et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>， pleomorphic adenoma was the most common tumor intraorally， with the palate being the most common site (44 cases) and females the most affected， with a male/female ratio of 1：3.2通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>. The occurrence of pleomorphic adenoma in the lip represents about 20% to 40% of删除1换行all intraoral pleomorphic adenomas 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>. In the study by Toida et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>， of the 54 cases of intraoral pleomorphic adenoma， only 3 were in the upper lip 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>. The upper lip is more affected than the lower lip in a ratio of 6：1， the exact cause of this discrepancy is not known， but it is believed that it is due to differences in the embryonic development of the upper and lower lips， another theory is that the cells tumors would be destroyed by the continuous presence of inflammatory cells in the lower lip induced by frequent traumatic events 通用删除6(英):<u>[11-13]</u>. Adenomas that occur on the lips appear to occur at a younger age than those that occur elsewhere， with a peak incidence between the third and fourth decade of life， with a mean of 33.2 years 通用删除6(英):<u>[2，6]</u>. According to a bibliographic survey of 38 cases of AP in the lip performed by Suka，2021，the upper lip was the most affected， with a predominance of the left side， males (21 cases) were more affected than females (17 cases)， the mean age was 43.3 years and the mean diameter of the tumors was2.6 cm 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>. This information corroborates our case， as it is a 42-year old male patient with a lesion in the upper lip on the left side.\n\n【13】Due to its nonspecific clinical features， the differential diagnosis of AP in the upper lip includes a wide variety of pathologies： benign and malignant neoplasms of the salivary glands， sialolithiasis， leiomyoma， hemangioma， neurofibroma， schwannoma or infection with a foreign body 通用删除6(英):<u>[2，6]</u>. The diagnosis of pleomorphic adenoma is made by histopathological analysis： It usually presents as a proliferation of encapsulated epithelial and myoepithelial cells with the presence of stroma， which can be myxoid， chondroid or hyalinized. The epithelium may form ducts and cystic structures or may appear as islands or nests of cells 通用删除6(英):<u>[2，4]</u>. Imaging tests， such as magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography， can aid in the diagnosis， as they allow a better visualization of the location and size of the lesion， in addition to being useful for differentiating between a benign or malignant lesion 通用删除6(英):<u>[3，12]</u>.\n\n【14】The treatment of choice for AP in the lip is tumor excision with a safety margin， but some authors suggest performing aspiration biopsy before definitive removal of the tumor，the prognosis is good. Recurrence cases may be associated with incomplete tumor excision or capsule rupture. Malignant transformation presents about 2% to7% of cases 通用删除6(英):<u>[5，14]</u>. Some authors report that the occurrence of AP in the upper lip is more related to benign tumors， while the lower lip is more related to malignant lesions 通用删除6(英):<u>[2，11，15]</u>.\n\n【15】Conclusion\n\n【16】Finally， AP should be investigated and considered as a differential diagnosis in cases of painless tumor masses of the lips. Due to its non-specific clinical characteristics， diagnosis may be difficult， and for this， biopsy is indispensable，imaging tests can also be useful. Surgical excision is the treatment of choice for this lesion and periodic follow-up should be performed to reduce the chances of recurrence and malignant transformation.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

Hypercalcemia develops in approximately 10% of the sarcoidosis patients while it has also been described in patients with other granulomatous diseases such as tuberculosis. This abnormality of calcium metabolism is caused by the dysregulated production of calcitriol by activated macrophages in the granulomatous foci of sarcoidosis. Undetected hypercalcemia may have deleterious sequela in sarcoidosis patients， especially without a previous diagnosis， such as nephrocalcinosis and renal failure. This metabolic defect may be exacerbated by sun exposure，phosphorus or vitamin D intake.\n\n【2】We present seven cases of sarcoidosis to define the clinical features of such patients who are prone to develop hypercalcemia induced by vitamin D treatment. While only two of our patients had a previously diagnosed sarcoidosis， it was detected in the others while investigating the cause of hypercalcemia. Given the rarity of hypercalcemia due to sarcoidosis and its crucial consequences， it is an imperative that the clinicians should definitely consider the possibility of sarcoidosis before commencing vitamin D treatment to their patients. The sarcoidosis features of our case series reveal the criteria required for clinicians to suspect a possible sarcoidosis disease antecedently and to determine the diagnosis before iatrogenic hypercalcemia develops.\n\n【3】Keywords： Sarcoidosis； Hypercalcemia； Vitamin D； Iatrogenic hypercalcemia\n\n【4】Introduction\n\n【5】Hypercalcemia is a relatively common clinical problem that results when the entry of calcium into the circulation exceeds the excretion of calcium into the urine or deposition in bone.

In this case series， the clinical manifestations of sarcoidosis patients with iatrogenic hypercalcemia are investigated.

It has also been described in granulomatous disorders such as sarcoidosis， tuberculosis， berylliosis and leprosy 通用删除6(英):<u>[1-4]</u>. Sarcoidosis is a chronic disease characterized by granulomatous inflammation and the presence of non-classified granulomas in the involved organs， mainly the lungs， lymph nodes and skin 通用删除6(英):<u>[16-18]</u>. Hypercalcemia is detected in approximately 10% of the sarcoidosis patients due to the abnormal calcium metabolism secondary to increased synthesis of calcitriol by macrophages 通用删除6(英):<u>[4-7]</u>. We present seven cases ofiatrogenic hypercalcemia due to vitamin D treatment in patients with or without a previously known sarcoidosis diagnosis.\n\n【23】The most crucial feature of these patients was the presence of sarcoidosis associated hypercalcemia that was exacerbated due to the prior vitamin D treatment commenced for osteoporosis or vitamin D deficiency. The second point was the presence of advanced sarcoidosis designated as stage III in all patients. The third hallmark was the existence of three organ sarcoidosis in these cases. Following steroid treatment， the clinical course of sarcoidosis became stable while the calcium levels returning to normal in each patient. The triangulation point of these cases was the necessityto undergoa thorough evaluation in terms sarcoidosis， that may lead to iatrogenichypercalcemia， for all patients who are be treated with vitamin D since it is well-known that unnoticed or in discriminable hypercalcemia may lead to deleterious effects. As the results of our study indicate， some clinical features of sarcoidosis appear to be useful in predetermining the probability of iatrogenic hypercalcemia that may develop following vitamin D treatment in sarcoidosis patients with or without a previous known diagnosis.删除1换行hypercalcemia in sarcoidosis 通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u>. Albright et al. have shown that hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria in sarcoidosis was due to the elevated levels of vitamin D 通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u>. Bell et al. have revealed that levels of 1，25-dihyroxy vitamin D was the cause for abnormal calcium metabolism in sarcoidosis patients 通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u>. Since vitamin D production is substrate-dependent， the development of hypercalcemia due to vitamin Dtreatment in patients with sarcoidosis is a great possibility. It is well-known that special care is required in sarcoidosis patients who are to be supplemented with vitamin D or calcium 通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u> and thereby close monitoring of serum calcium levels is required to prevent the occurrence ofhypercalcemia in these patients. Seven cases developed hypercalcemia due to the vitamin D treatment while only one of these had a previously diagnosed sarcoidosis in our case series. Presence of unidentified sarcoidosis in patients to be treated with vitamin D appears to be a crucial risk for iatrogenic hypercalcemia. Such a possibility should always be considered by clinicians.\n\n【24】In patients with a medical history of sarcoidosis in their background， the effects of vitamin D treatment can be easily monitored. The problem arises inpatients with a previously undiagnosed sarcoidosis when exogenous vitamin D supplementation is commenced. The deleterious outcome of high serum calcium may occur through organs such as the heart. Drawback becomes extremely crucial especially if patients are in an asymptomatic clinical profile for sarcoidosis that may lead to severe consequences if unnoticed or if a delay occurs for diagnosis. In our case series of seven patients， the greatest problem was that only two of the patients had a previously identified sarcoidosis while all of the patients were completely asymptomatic and did not even show the slightest clue relevant to sarcoidosis. The hallmark of these cases is that it may be necessary to evaluate patients for sarcoidosis before starting vitamin D treatment to avoid the serious clinical side effects of iatrogenic hypercalcemia.\n\n【25】There are some points associated with the weakness of our case series size. The first is the small sample size consisting of only seven patients. This is probably related tothelow incidence ofhypercalcemia in sarcoidosis patients. The other point is that all patients in our series were of Caucasian origin. It is well-known that sarcoidosis may exhibit many different manifestations according to race or genetic differences in terms of the clinical profile， involved organs，treatment response and disease course. Consequently， studies including a large number of patients from different races with distinct genetic characteristics are required to achieve more precise and explicit results. Whether the patients had a previous diagnosis of sarcoidosis or not， it would be extremely useful to define the clinical criteria to predict the probability of iatrogenic hypercalcemia in such cases， as only two ofthe patients had a previously identified sarcoidosis.\n\n【26】The important hallmark of our case series is the common features and the mutual clinical profle shared by all ofour sarcoidosis patients who developed hypercalcemia due to vitamin Dtreatment. The first is that they had advanced sarcoidosis compatible with stage III disease. Second， each subject had a chronic and persistent sarcoidosis profile that required steroid treatment. The third point was that the patients had three organ involvement including lung， eye， skin or lymph node. The fourth and perhaps the most interesting aspect of our cases was that the patients presented with atypical symptoms or with a bizarre clinical profile that were not easily to be attributed to sarcoidosis although they had stage III disease. Hypercalcemia in sarcoidosis is caused by the abnormality of the calcium metabolism induced by the increased synthesis of calcitriol or vitamin D by macrophages删除1换行of the granulomatous lesions. High levels of active vitamin D due to hydroxylase activity in macrophages is the most probable cause of hypercalcemia but overproduction of bone resorbing cytokines and parathyroid-related peptide may also play a role 通用删除6(英):<u>[23-25]</u>. As hypercalcemia is due to the abnormal calcium metabolism secondary to increased synthesis of calcitriol by macrophages that are abundant in granulomas， patients with multiple organ involvement appear to carry a more significant risk of hypercalcemia due to the high load of granulomatous tissue. As clearly seen from our cases， the risk of hypercalcemia in sarcoidosis may have arisen due to the high granuloma load due to three organ involvement. The hazard of may also be associated advanced sarcoidosis stage. The presence of these two aforementioned criteria appears to be extremely helpful to anticipate hypercalcemia in such patients. Sarcoidosis associated hypercalcemia can present with an insidious clinical picture that may cause a diagnostic challenge for the clinician and thereby requires a great suspicion for its identification. Existence of previously undiagnosed sarcoidosis should always be considered for patients for whom vitamin D treatment is to be commenced.Common clinical features of sarcoidosis patients in our case series appear to be useful in predicting or identifying the patients who carry a risk of iatrogenic hypercalcemia.\n\n【27】Conclusion\n\n【28】Sarcoidosis may occur unnoticed due to its asymptomatic and insidious clinical nature. In patients with a previously diagnosed or undiagnosed sarcoidosis， clinicians should bear in mind the possibility for the existence of this disorder because vitamin D treatment may lead to significantly high serum calcium levels that may cause deleterious effects. Hypercalcemia of sarcoidosis is due to the abnormal calcium metabolism secondary to increased synthesis of calcitriol by macrophages that are abundant in granulomatous lesions or tissues. Consequently， advanced disease and triple organ involvement in sarcoidosis patients appears to carry a significant hazard for vitamin D induced hypercalcemia due to the higher burden of granulomas comprising numerous macrophages that lead to increased synthesis of calcitriol. Clinical features of sarcoidosis identified among our sarcoidosis case series can be useful to identify patients that carry a high risk of developing iatrogenic hypercalcemia who are to be treated with calcitriol whether or not they present with a prior diagnosis of sarcoidosis.

The temporary cardiac pacing may be required in acute myocardial infarction setting for the occurrence of Atrioventricular (AV) block during Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) 通用删除6(英):<u>[2，3]</u>. Inferior ST- Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI) is especially prone for AV blocks， because of the blood supplyto AV nodal tissues and the inferoposterior surface of the heart share the same arterial territory. Apical septum in Right Ventricle (RV) is usual site for pacing lead and we could check it by using by not only the characteristics of pacing rhythm but also fluoroscopic cardiac anatomy. However， there have been some case reports about inadvertent malposition of transvenous pacing lead in the Left Ventricle (LV)通用删除6(英):<u>[4-15]</u>. In this report， we describe the malpositioning oftemporary pacemaker lead on LV septum， passed through Patent Foramen Ovale (PFO)， detected by Trans Thoracic Echocardiography (TTE) after PCI.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 72-year-old man with hypertension and diabetes mellitus had a sudden onset of substernal chest pain a day before he came to the hospital. Findings on the physical examination were unremarkable. Vital signs were as follows： Temperature 36.6'C， heart rate 76 beats/min， respiratory rate 22 breaths/min， blood pressure 95/52 mmHg，and oxygen saturation 100% on room air.\n\n【7】His electrocardiogram showed ST-segment elevation and T wave inversion in leads II， III， and a VF. Laboratory evaluation revealed following： CK-MB 113.1 ng/ml； TnI above 22.78； BNP 558.4pg/ml. A heparin bolus (60 U/kg)， aspirin 300 mg and ticagrelor 180 mg were given.\n\n【8】Emergent coronary angiography was immediately performed and revealed a total occlusion in the middle of Right Coronary Artery (RCA). Before RCA intervention， prophylactic temporary pacemaker was inserted via right femoral vein approach for the AV block during the procedure. With the help of fluoroscopic images， a pacing lead was advanced until it reached RA. Then， the pacing catheter was passed smoothly to the ventricle without any resistance . PCI was performed for the RCA， and coronary blood flow recovered completely. The patient was moved to Coronary Care Unit (CCU) immediately after PCI. The patient was stable without any symptom. Surface ECG at CCU showed normal sinus rhythm with coincidental two pacing beats with Right Bundle-Branch Block (RBBB) morphology and early pre cordial transition \n\n【9】TTE performed 4-h later after PCI. The TTE showed preserved systolic function (Ejection\n\n【10】Fraction (EF)=50%) with infero-posterior a kinesis on LV.\n\n【11】On the two-chamber/four-chamber views， the pacemaker lead tip was located apical inferior septum in LV ， passed though the incidental PFO . Finally， the temporary pacemaker lead was removed with the guidance ofTTE.\n\n【12】Discussion\n\n【13】In this case， the physician didn’t have focus on the adequate pacemakerlead site during the coronary intervention procedure. This is a unique case that temporary pacemaker lead tip was crossed the PFO and located on LV septum and suggests that pacing rhythm on surface ECG and fluoroscopic images are important to guide proper lead position. Fortunately， we found RBBB morphology on surface ECG by chance at CCU. Follow-up TTE confirmed the pacemaker lead was on the LV septum and we removed it.\n\n【14】We usually establish temporary pacemaker before emergency PCI for acute inferior MI against AV block 通用删除6(英):<u>[2，3]</u>. Mostly， the pacing wire\n\n【15】PFO： Patent Foramen Ovale\n\n【16】tip locates on RV apex only with catheter manipulation without any difficulty. In rare cases， the lead cross interatrial septum and locate on LV pass through mitral valve. If there is a PFO or ASD， the lead tip can pass through the interatrial septum easily like this case. As a standpoint of interventional cardiologists， coronary intervention is the most important procedure. So they didn’t care about the adequate site of adequate pacemaker lead site during the procedure.\n\n【17】There have been several complications related with the pacemaker leads unintentionally located on LV， such as， thromboembolic stroke and ventricular perforation 通用删除6(英):<u>[4-14]</u>. Lead malposition in the LV should be prevented by a high index of suspicion at implant. Consequently， we should at least check the pacemaker catheter tip site during procedure with the guidance of pacing ECG and fluoroscopic images. First of all， if the pacing site is RV， the pacing QRS on V is usually LBBB pattern， the other way， if it is LV， the pacing QRS on V is usualy RBBB pattern. Fluoroscopic image is another important method to check the lead site. If we could find the ostium of RCA， we could differentiate inter ventricular septum with LAO view.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

The finding revealed the workstation of sewing machine operator andemphasized the need for ergonomic interventions to minimize the MSDs among them.\n\n【5】Keywords： MSDs (Work-Related Musculoskeletal Disorders)； Strain index； Nordic MSDs Questionnaire\n\n【6】Introduction\n\n【7】More than half of all countries in the world do not keep official statistics on work-related occupational sickness. Particularly in underdeveloped nations， there is a lack of data reporting in the domain of work-related sickness and musculoskeletal disorders. In nowadays， Garment is a rapidly growing sector in Ethiopia. Reports show that until the end of 2007 E.C. There were 102 garment industries in Ethiopia. Among these garments， 79 of them were found in Addis Ababa and 22 of them were found Oromia special zone near Addis. Approximately more than 10，000 workers (70%female) were working in this sector which became a great source of employment.\n\n【8】In the report of the Ethiopian Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs (MOLSA)， from 279establishments in the year 2014/2015， a total of 5，135 work-related accidents were reported and among which 5，092 (99.16%) were non-fatal. This resulted in a cost of 2，195，960.74 ETB for a medical case and an absence of 12，612 workdays by injured employees. According to MOLSA report of 2014/15 in manufacturing industries 2856 (56.62%)， victims were registered as work-related accidents and diseases， in which garment industry is one of the most hazardous sectors because mostly garment factory works are repetitive and requiring strong visual demands， improper postural requirements and involving long hours sitting or standing in one position.\n\n【9】In the sewing section， the risks for sewing machine operators have been linked to conditions such as poor workstation design， and actions should be taken to eliminate the causes of this disorder and make the workplace safe and healthy for the operators.\n\n【10】So， this paper mainly focuses on assessing the prevalence and associated risk factors of work-\n\n【11】As we see in Figure 1， in Desta garment， the sewing section workstation is not scientifically looking suitable.\n\n【12】Finally， this paper conducted to fill this gap by ergonomically evaluating the prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders in different bodysegments andassociated risk factors for sewing section operators， and then using logistics regression analysis to identify which factors are significantly associated with musculoskeletal disorders.\n\n【13】Literature Review\n\n【14】Ergonomics is the process of designing or arranging workplaces， products， and systems so that they fit the people who use them， and the profession that applies theoretical principles， data， and methods to design to optimize well-being and overall performance.\n\n【15】Maintain neutral posture and ergonomics workstation\n\n【16】The neutral posture is the ergonomic standard for sitting in a chair and using the computer or standing. A posture is considered“awkward”when it moves away from the neutral posture towards the extremes in the range of motions 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>.\n\n【17】According to Goggins et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>， reported that Ergonomics lowers JOg costs and reduces MSD risk factors since MSDs account for 30% of all worker's comp claims and reduce indirect costs which can be up to20 times the direct costs and improves productivity by 25% through designing a job to allow for good posture，less exertion， fewer motions， and better heights and reaches， the workstation becomes more efficient and also improves employee engagement， if an employee does not experience fatigue and discomfort during their workday， it can reduce turnover， decrease absenteeism， improve morale and worker efficiency. There are three major categories of the workplace：Sitting， standing， and sit/stand.\n\n【18】Ergonomics in sewing room\n\n【19】The workingposture at sewing machines should allowthe mobility of the limbs， ergonomically favorable arrangement of working and visible zones， and a stable balanced state when performing the work process. The study stated that 70% of sewing machine operators using foot controls report back pain， 35% report persistent low back pain， 25% have suffered a work-related disorder and 49% of workers experience pain in the neck 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. Setting up your sewing room properly is of paramount importance regarding operators physical删除1换行well-being， in sewing， cutting， and ironing operators positions that tax your posture leads to fatigue， muscle pain， and chronic or serious conditions ofthe spine 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>.\n\n【20】Musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs)\n\nAt present， MSDs are one of the most important problems ergonomists encounter in the workplace all over the world and in many countries' prevention of WMSDs has become a national priority. Sitting posture mainly having pain on the low-back and it is one of the most common Musculoskeletal Disorders (MSDs) in sitting position and has been reported to occur in 50% to 90% of all adults with recurrence rates of up to 90%. Approximately 15% to20% of adults suffer from back pain each year. The operation usually requires the operator to lean forward， with a forward inclined posture of both head and trunk， to focus their attention and have better visual control of the task|删除段之间换行|Generally， some studies conclude that the majority ofthe garment workers had been suffering from some kind of musculoskeletal disorder depending upon the nature of work and their posture 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>.\n\n【22】Factors associated with work-related musculoskeletal disorders\n\n【23】Factors associated with the development of WRMSDs in garment workers are categorized in the form of demographic factors (age， sex， marital status， educational level， year of experience， and monthly salary)， personal factors (height and weight， smoking habit， habit doing exercise， and medical history of MSDs)， job-related factors(payment method， working hour， health and safety training， job satisfaction， comfort of the working environment， and fitness of sitting chair with the working machine)通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>.\n\n【24】Logistic regression analysis\n\nIn this paper both bivariant and multivariant logistic regression analysis has been used to determine the prevalence of WRMSDs and the significant association between the dependent and independent variables had been examined by both regression analyses|删除段之间换行|Logistic regression will model the chance of an outcome based on individual characteristics.

All of the tests were evaluated using logistic regression analysis.\n\n【42】1. H1： There is a relation between demographic factors and the severity of MSDs in different operators body segments. So， in this case， the study formulates a hypothes is to determine the demographic factors， such as age， gender， marital status， educational level， year of experience， and monthly salary， need to check whether demographic variables have strong significance or not with the severity of MSDs， using logistics regression analysis.\n\n【43】2. H2： There is a relationship between personal factors and the severity of MSDs in different operators body segments. So， in this case， the study formulates a hypothesis to determine the personal factor (Body mass index， smoking habit， habit doing exercise，medical history of systematic illness， and medical history of MSDs) need to check whether personal variables have strong significance or not with the severity of MSDs.\n\n【44】3. H3： There is a relationship between job-related factors and the severity of MSDs in different operators body segments. So， in this case， the study formulates a hypothesis to determine the job-related factor need to check whether job-related variables have strong significance or not with the severity of MSDs.\n\n【45】4 H4： There is a relation between 4 strain index scores and the severity of MSDs in upper body segments. So， in this case， the study formulates a hypothesis to determine these 4 strain index scores need to check whether 4 strain index score has strong significance or not with the severity of upper body of MSDs.\n\n【46】Data collection\n\n【47】This paper employed both primary and secondary data collection methods to obtain relevant data throughout the last 12 months， which focuses on the ergonomic evaluation of workstations for operators in the sewing workstation.\n\n【48】Completing the strain index survey： According to Steven Moore and Garg， in the strain index， six variables need to be collected for each task； each variable is assigned a rating and a multiplier.\n\n【49】A. The intensity of exertion， an estimate of the strength required to perform the task one time. This is a function of the force required， and upper extremity posture Guidelines for assigning a rating criterion are presented table in the appendix part.\n\n【50】B. Duration of exertion is calculated by measuring the duration of all exertions during an observation period， then dividing the measured duration of exertion by the total observation time and multiplying by 100.\n\n【51】According to Drinkaus et al. tasks that attribute were recorded with a stopwatch and considering as time busy. It is defined as the time during which the operator was occupied performing a task and would be unable to perform another task at that time with that hand删除1换行and it's assumed as the duration of exertions.\n\n【52】The ratio of busy time to cycle time provides insight into how much non-busy time is available to the worker. This non-busy time may be used for rest， or it may provide time to correct if an error or disruption occurs，busy time was used to determine the allocated time for each task. Allocated time for a task is the amount oftime a person is busy plus the amount of rest associated with that task. So allocated time was determined the total observation time in seconds using a stopwatch.\n\n【53】C. Efforts per minute are measured by counting the number of exertions that occur during an observation period， then dividing the number of exertions by the duration of the observation period， measured in minutes. synonymous with the frequency of exertions per minute. The number of exertions is calculated as busy time without rest in required time in minutes删除1换行number of exertions Efforts per Minute =total observation time (min)\n\n【54】Hand/Wrist posture is an estimation of the position of the hand or wrist relative to the neutral position or it is the anatomical posture of the hand\n\n【55】E. Speed of work is an estimation of how fast the worker is working.\n\n【56】F. Duration of task per day is a measure of how much of the workday is allocated to performing that task.\n\n【57】Then total strain index is calculated by multiplying all the above steps，\n\n【58】Strain Index=IExDExEMxHWPxSWxDD.\n\n【59】Based on Steven Moore and Garg， the result that getting from the strain index help to identify the level of job risk，\n\n【60】SI Scores less than or equal to 3 are probably safe.\n\n【61】SI Scores between 3 to 5 are uncertain， Job may place an individual at increased risk for distal upper extremity disorders.\n\n【62】SI Scores between 5 to 7 indicates there is some risk\n\n【63】SI Scores greater than or equal to 7 are probably hazardous.\n\n【64】According to Nagaraj et al.， a separate strain index scoring sheet was used for each operator. And these four scores of strain index considering as independent variables and logistic regression analysis has been conducted because to determine the relationship between musculoskeletal symptoms and these four-strain index score for each upper body parts during the last 12 months.\n\n【65】Questionnaire design： During the last 12 months， Standardized Nordic MSDs questionnaires employed to examine associated factors for the work-related musculoskeletal condition and its severity in various body segments.\n\n【66】The Standard Nordic Musculoskeletal Disorder Questionnaire has two parts：\n\nIn the first part， the questionnaires helped to collect information about independent variables or factors such as demographic factors， according to Aghili et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>，(age)， Gender 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>，Nagarajet al. (marital status). According to Jahan et al.， (education level)， Abraha et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u> (year of experience)， and Girma， (monthly salary). Information associated personal factors such as， according to Nagaraj et al， (Body|删除段之间换行|Mass Index (BMI))， Silva et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u> (smoking habit)， Abraha et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u> (habit doing exercise)， and Biadgo et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>， (medical history of MSDs). And information associated with job-related factors such as， according to Kebede and Tafese 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>， (payment method)， Biadgo et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u> (working hour)， Tamene et al. (health and safety training). Mekonnen et al.(comfortable of the working environment). According to Nazerian et al， (fitness of sitting chairs with the working machine)， and according to Girma， job satisfaction was assessed using the liker scale to identify the level of satisfaction on the work， the option was 5 Likert scales (very unsatisfied， dissatisfied，neutral， satisfied， and very satisfied)， and the researcher was converted into one independent variable. These had been computed according to Macdonald's workplace job satisfaction scale.\n\n【68】In the second part， a questionnaire helped to collect information about the severity of musculoskeletal disorders in different body segments that are present while performing a task during the last 12months. According to Kuorinka et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>， the Standardized Nordic musculoskeletal tool was not only developed for clinical diagnosis. According to Biadgo et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>， based on the severity of MSDs report from participants and taken as the dependent variables in nine body parts (neck， shoulder， upper back， elbows， wrist/hands， lower back， hip/thighs， knees， and ankle/feet). The results from these surveys determine the amount of severity of musculoskeletal disorders in operators body segments， and using the analysis tool， determine the associated risk factors and the prevalence of MSDs that are present in the selected company.\n\n【69】Reliability test： The reliability of the Standard Nordic MSDs questionnaire and strain index was pre-tested among 20 (11%)， selected operators from participants were tested using Cronbach's alpha =0.710 and 0.762， respectively， and the reliability of this instrument was supposed to be tolerable. The 9th item job satisfaction scale questionnaire was also checked for reliability and a Cronbach's Alpha of 0.796 was found. The goodness of the model fitness has been checked using the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness oftest which showed x²=6.394 with df=8 and significant of =0.603. the Hosmer-Lemeshow test should be insignificant as the p-value at 0.05 indicates that the variable entered fits the model.\n\n【70】Data analysis\n\n【71】The demographic features， personal factors， job-related factors， and SI score linked with MSDs of the study population were reported as a number， percentages， and frequency using the IBM SPSS version26 software program for descriptive analysis.\n\n【72】Theconnection betweenmusculoskeletal symptomsand independent variables for each body part was investigated using bivariate and multivariant logistic regression analysis. To assess the effective variables of MSDs disorders， nine distinct regression models were created for nine different body areas. The association between the dependent and independent variables was examined by bivariant logistic regression analysis. The Odds Ratios (ORs)， p-value， and 95%Confidence Intervals (CIs) were calculated from bivariant logistic regression models. The statistically significant level， p<0.05 was considered for all statistical tests.\n\n【73】A Chi-square test was used for testing the hypothesis to identify the significant factors for the MSDs among the operators 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>. The data was then displayed in a variety of statistical tools. As a result， all of the data contribute to the completion of the study and the precise determination of the workstation's evaluation.\n\n【74】Table 1： Demographic and personal factors of participants in Desta garment Addis Ababa， Ethiopia， April 2021.\n\n| Categories of variables  | Frequency(n=179)  | Percent (%)  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Age  |  |  |\n| Valid 19-60  | 179  | 100  |\n| Gender  |  |  |\n| Male  | 11  | 6.1  |\n| Female  | 168  | 93.9  |\n| Marital status?

Workers who had not satisfied with their job had more chances to develop WRMSDs in the neck than operators who satisfy with their work. And the operators， when performing their job， the score of SI was in hazardous were a chance to develop WRMSD in the neck than others with an odds ratio =0.004 (95% CI， 0.003-0.257).\n\n【92】The survey comprised a total of 193 garment workers， with a complete response rate of 176 (92.74%) among all respondents. All participants were over the age of 18， with 168 (93.9%) of them being female and 122 (68.2%) being single. Only 4% of the workforce were unable to read or write， with the majority (65.9%) having completed high school. According to the respondents'job experience， 96(53.6%) had served for less than or equal to 5 years， while 74 (41.3%) had worked for 6 to 10 years. In terms of monthly compensation， 88(49.2%) of the workers earned up to 1500 ETB per month， while 50.8percent earned more than 1500 ETB per month. According to WHO categorization， 111 (62%) workers have a normal Body Mass Index(BMI) (18.5 kg/m² to 24.9 kg/m)， whereas 2 (1.1%) have an obese BMI (18.5 kg/m’ to 24.9 kg/m). Almost all of the employees (100percent) do not smoke. Only 53 (29.6%) of workers engage in regular physical activity.

Workers who did not engage in regular physical activity were more than 2.5 times as likely to develop MSDs in one or both ankles/feet than those who did. (OR=0.037， 95% CI： (0.002-0.312.Operators who worked in an unpleasant environment were 2.2times more likely than those who worked in a pleasant environment to develop MSDs in one or both ankles/feet (OR=0.022， 95% CI：(0.002-0.312). According to Nagaraj et al.， the high frequency of repetitive action， less porosity， and uncomfortable hand posture of sitting sewing operations put roughly 60% of operators at risk删除1换行of upper extremity musculoskeletal disorders. In this study， the researchers observed the level of risk in the upper extremity body and found that roughly 57% of those were in danger and 29% were at risk， indicating that more ergonomics development is needed to lower the risk of upper extremity disorders.\n\n【115】Strain index scores were found to be strongly linked with the prevalence of WRMSDs in the elbow and hand by Nagaraj et al. operators with a strain index score of 3-5 (uncertain)， 5-7 (some risk)， and greater than 7 (hazardous) were more likely to develop WRMSDs in their wrist or hand in this study， with odds of 1.032 95%CI： (0.021-2.092)， 2.012 95% CI： (0.321-4.762)， and 2.321 95% CI：(0.311-4.092)， respectively. And operators who score SI greater than7 had more than 31% times more likely to develop WRMSDs in the neck than others {OR=0.319， 95% CI： (0.926-7.280)}. Age， monthly salary， smoking habits， payment methods， and working hours were删除1换行not found to be significant factors for the prevalence of MSDs in any of the operator's body parts in this study.\n\n【116】Generally， in this paper， the highest occurrence rate for the prevalence of WRMSDs was found in the lower back (93.9%)，upper back (93.3%)， neck (76%)， and hip/thigh/ buttocks (65.4%). The compatibility of a sitting chair with a sewing workstation， as well as the comfort of the working environment， were found to be the most significant factors in the prevalence of work-related MSDs.\n\n【117】Conclusion\n\n【118】From nine body regions lower back (93.9%)， upper back(93.3%)， neck (76%)， and hip/thigh/buttocks (65.4%) were the body parts that developed work-related MSDs among workers in the sewing section. The occurrence of musculoskeletal disorders was significantly associated with the suitability of the sitting chair within the sewing workstation， comfortable of the working environment， job satisfaction， gender， strain index score， a habit of doing physical exercise， working experience， and medical history in the last 12. With a high odds ratio， the suitability of a sitting chair within a sewing workstation and a comfortable working environment was a significantly linked factor to the occurrence of work-related MSDs in the low back (93.9%) and upper back (93.3%) body parts.\n\n【119】Recommendation\n\n【120】Based on the findings in this paper， there is recommendations to the garment sector and the Bureau of Labor and Social Affairs(BOLSA) to focus on maintaining workers safety and health for increasing productivity ofthe product and becoming profitable.\n\n【121】To improve productivityandprofitability in the garment in dustry， top management should examine ergonomics issues and correctly apply ergonomics in workstations on a large scale. In the garment sector， the workstation should be assessed regularly to improve the working environment， and firm owners should also provide a good working environment for their employees by addressing their demands， such as honoring a top performer.\n\n【122】Future Work\n\n【123】It may be necessary to improve ergonomically the sewing section workstation， as well as to broaden the scope of the study in order to obtain a result that reflects the rest of the Ethiopian garment companies.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

Multiple Myeloma (MM) represents a malignant proliferation of plasma cells derived from a single clone. The co-occurrence of two rare malignancies CML and MM in the same patient is an extremely rare incident. We report a case of a 54 vear old female who was simultaneously detected with MM and CML. At the outset， only chemotherapy for multiple myeloma was started as bone marrow and peripheral smear were not suggestive of CML. Subsequently Dasatinib was started in view of left shift seen in peripheral smear. It was both a diagnostic dilemma due to the rarity of synchronicity of these two malignancies and a therapeutic dilemma of whether to start with Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (TKI) as both peripheral smear and bone marrow was normal.\n\n【2】Case Presentation\n\n【3】A 54-year-old female with no comorbidities， a known case of solitary plasmacytoma (with kappa restriction， CD 138 positive)，previouslytreated in July 2020 with definitive radiation therapy to the left pubic ramus. She received a dose of 50 Gy in 25 fractions from 3.6.2020 to 6.7.2020. She was on three monthly follow up since then. At the time of diagnosis， a baseline PET scan revealednoevidence of disease elsewhere， with bone marrow aspiration and biopsy were normal. Also， cytogenetic analysis by conventional karyotype was normal. In the month of June， 2021， she presented with pain in the left pubic region of three months duration. PET CT was done to evaluate disease status. It revealed a 2.8 cm x 5.6 cm lesion involving left pubic ramus and anterior acetabulum (SUV 26.1) which was 12.1 at baseline before radiation therapy. There was a cortical discontinuity with a small extra Osseous soft tissue. There was also a mention of interval development of additional small metabolically active osteolytic lesions in anterior L1 and L4 vertebra which raised the suspicion of progression to multiple myeloma. Work up for multiple myeloma was done that included bone marrow aspiration and biopsy， Serum myeloma panel [Serum Protein Electrophoresis (SPEP)， Serum Immunofixation (SIF) studies， Free Light Chain Assay (FLC)， beta 2 microglobulin] and cytogenetics. Bone marrow showed 10% plasma cells with no immature cells in myeloid lineage. SPEP showed presence of M spike in gamma region (band value： 0.52 g/dl). SIF studies showed IgG band with kappaband. Total proteins were in the range of 8.6 (normal range 6.4 g/dL to 8.2 g/dL). Ig Glevel in serum was 17.4g. Ratio of involved and uninvolved free light chains was 150 with involved kappalight chain being 465. Hence a diagnosis of Multiple myeloma was established. Routine cancer cytogenetic studies at our institute (i.e.，culture ofunstimulated bone marrow aspirate at 24h and 48h of incubation at room temperature) revealed two clones of cells- one with normal karyotype and one with t(9；22) i.e.， 46，XX，t(9；22)(q34；q11.2)通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>/46，XX通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>.\n\n【4】A complete blood count with peripheral smear was normal with no leukocytosis with left shift or thrombocytosis or any abnormal cells. She was started on a three drug regimen (proteasome inhibitor bortezomib， lenalidomide and Dexamethasone with bisphosphonates) as per our institutional protocol for a standard risk stage III Standard risk multiple myeloma after a thorough discussion about the treatment options including transplant. However， the family refused for transplant. At this point of time， BCR ABL mutation was being considered as a part of normal删除1换行variant as marrow and peripheral smear were normal. Hence， we decided to serially monitor the peripheral smear of the patient and took a decision to not expose the patient to TKI then. She completed4 cycles of VRD (bortezomib/lenalidomide/dexona) till 20.10.21following which reassessment was done by serum myeloma panel which was suggestive of Very Good Partial Response (VGPR) as per International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria with an absent M spike， normalization of serum FLC ratio. It was decided to continue with the same chemotherapy regimen. Her peripheral smear was being serially monitored at each visit. At her visit during cycle 5-D22， her PS was suggestive of left shift with 1% blasts， 6%myelocytes， 7% metamyelocytes， 12% band forms. Now we started her on TKI (Dasatinib 100 mg once a day) after reviewing the drug interactions with other drugs being used for multiple myeloma.\n\n【5】Discussion\n\n【6】We report a case of synchronous hematological malignancies， multiple myeloma coexistent with CML. Though bone marrow was not suggestive of CML， the characteristic translocation t通用删除7(英):<u>(9，22)</u> was present in the cells. We further did cytogenetic analysis to rule out Philadelphia positivity as a constitutional abnormality by the PHA(Phytohemagglutinin) induced peripheral blood cell culture with 72h incubation at room temperature， which showed all cells as normal karyotype， thereby proving the existence of the t(9；22) translocation in our reference case as clonal. Following the conventional karyotype report，hybridtranscript for BCR/ABL 1 was quantified by IS MMRRT PCRassay. The ratio of BCR-ABL1/ABL 1 transcript as represented in IS scale was detected to be 5.931%.Genomic breakpoint observed was e 13a2 which corresponded to p210. Other cytogenetic abnormalities seen in multiple myeloma like IGH rearrangement， p53 del， del 13q were negative. Unfortunately on conventional cytogenetics or FISH analysis it is not possible to comment on the type of cells that are carrying specific genetic aberrations. Hence a dilemma might arise as whether they were myeloma cells or leukemic cells which were harboring BCR-ABL1 translocation. Plasma cell enrichment by cell sorting of CD-138 expressing cells in bone marrow or peripheral blood by immunomagnetic methods has been widely applied for targeted molecular cytogenetic analysis of multiple myeloma cases1-31.\n\nThe Philadelphia chromosome was originally detected by workers in Philadelphia as an abnormally short G-group chromosome in analysis of bone marrow metaphases from CML patients 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. It is the first genetic abnormality to be associated with a human cancer. Now it’s understood through chromosome banding techniques that Philadelphia chromosome was the result of a balanced translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22， denoted t(9；22)(q34.1；q11.21)， where the derivative chromosome 222 is significantly smaller. Chromosomal abnormalities can be germline (constitutional) or acquired. Germline abnormalities could be heritable or non-heritable.t(9；22) is as either non-heritable constitutional or acquired. The Philadelphia chromosome is present in hematopoietic cells from patients with CML but not in non hematopoietic cells， including bone marrow fibroblasts 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. BCR-ABL fusion transcripts resulting from translocation t(9；22)， are hallmarks of Philadelphia chromosome positive ph +leukemia patients. This translocation is detected in>90%patients with CML and ~20% patients with Acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. There are three common variants of BCR ABL1， p210 BCR ABL 1： This is created by fusion of ABL 1 at a2 with a breakpoint in the major BCR region at either e13 ore14 to produce an el3a2 or e14a2 transcript that is translated into a 210 kD protein 通用删除6(英):<u>[7-</u>|删除段之间换行|101. This variant is present in most of the CML patients. It is present in one third of the patients with ph positive B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. p190 BCR ABL 1： This is created by fusion of ABL 1 at a2 with a breakpoint in the minor BCR region at el to produce an ela2 transcript into a 190 kD protein. This variant is present in two thirds of those with Ph+ B ALL (80% of childhood and 50% of adult Ph positive B-ALL) and a minority of patients with CML p230 BCR ABL 1： This is created by fusion of ABL 1 at a2 with a breakpoint in the mu BCR region at e19 to produce an e19a2 transcript which is translated into a 230 kD protein. This variant is seen in some patients with chronic neutrophilic leukemia.\n\n【8】There are three hypothesis that have been thought of with regard to the presence of BCR ABL rearrangement in our case.\n\n【9】The first one that we considered initially was that this rearrangement is a part of a normal variant， the significance of which could be found out on regular follow-up of this patient. A study by Jew Win Kuan et al. was done in normal population in southern Sarawak by performing quantitative PCR for BCR ABL1with ABL1 as an internal control on total white blood cells. In this they demonstrated that the BCR ABL1 fusion gene is expected to be present in approximately 0.5% to 1% of normal individuals in that area. The positive subject in this study had BCR ABL1 Fusion gene of 0.002320.0032%， which is equivalent to MR4.5. In our patient in discussion， the BCR ABL1 transcript was 5.931%.\n\n【10】Secondly， tumorigenesisafter exposure toeenvironmental carcinogens such as ionizing radiation and chlorinated solvents is a well-known phenomenon. A common insult to the bone marrow can cause irreparable DNA damage potentially leading to neoplasms of myeloid and lymphoid origin. This might partially explain as the patient had been exposed to radiation therapy for plasmacytoma one year back.\n\n【11】Thirdly， treatment of first malignancy with cytotoxic drugs or radiation can potentially lead to secondary malignant transformation. The role of melphalan and cyclophosphamide in developing secondary malignancies is well documented in literature. Various secondary malignancies in lenalidomide-treated patients have also been described. Nevertheless， this hypothesis cannot be extrapolated to our patient because the two diseases were simultaneously detected. In addition， chronic antigenic stimulation due to multiple etiological factors may be involved in the development of simultaneous myeloid and lymphoid neoplasms. Other factors such as genotypic polymorphism may also be involved.\n\n【12】The other possibility is de novo ph+ multiple myelomas， which is an extremely rare event.\n\n【13】Another possible theory is the presence of a common malignant pluripotent progenitor stem cell which can be transformed to both lymphoid and myeloid lines 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>.\n\n【14】Also， it has been proposed that a more sustainable environment for the formation of secondary tumors is created due to the presence of myeloma cells. Studies have showed that multiple myeloma cells have pleiotropic proliferative and antiapoptotic properties 通用删除6(英):<u>[12，13]</u>.\n\n【15】At the outset we had hypothesized it to be a normal variant and decided to keep under close observation. However， subsequently we started TKI， in view ofleft shift in peripheral smear. Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) is a clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorder. The annual incidence of CML is 1.5 cases per 100，000 individuals.\n\n【16】Multiple Myeloma (MM) represents a malignant proliferation of plasma cells derived from a single clone. The co-occurrence of two rare malignancies CML and MM in the same patient is an extremely rare incident， and simultaneous diagnosis of CML and MM is reported in only five cases in the literature. Multiple Myeloma (MM) has been reported in association with a variety of myeloproliferative disorders， including polycythemia vera， myelofibrosis， essential thrombocythemia and Chronic Neutrophilic Leukemia (CNL). However， the association with Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia(CML) has been rarely reported 通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u>. A retrospective study between year 2013 to 2017 was done by Rouslan Kotchetkov et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>， in which they identified 46 patients with synchronous hematological malignancies， out of which 50% were myeloid + lymphoid 43%lymphoid + lymphoid and 7% were identified to have myeloid +myeloid synchronous malignancies， however none of them was CML with MM 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>.\n\n【17】There are few reported cases of multiple myeloma with a Philadelphia chromosome. One reported case is of a 61-vear-old man showing BCR ABL positive bone marrow after autologous bone marrow transplantation for multiple myeloma. Anecdotal cases of patients of multiple myeloma who developed CML after treatment or occurrence of multiple myeloma in a known case of CML on follow up are reported in literature.\n\n【18】Conclusion\n\n【19】After reviewing the literature， it is possible that the coexistence of these two hematological disorders is multifactorial. The occurrence can’t be attributed to one factor alone. No formal guidelines have been established regarding the use of antimyeloma therapy along with TKIs used in the treatment for CML. In our patient we used the combination of Dasatinib with VRD regimen with good response and minimal toxicity to the patient.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

Cardiac anomalies are common with congenital absence ofpericardium which includes Atrial septal defect， Patent ductus arteriosus， Mitral valve disease， Tetralogy of Fallot and Sinus venosus defect. We report two cases of retrospective diagnosis of congenital absence of pericardium after Atrial septal defect device closure which masqueraded as device embolization.\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Congenitalpericardial defects are rare with reported incidence of<1 in 10，000andunderestimated true prevalence due to asymptomatic and incidental diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. The most common variant is partial absence ofpericardium mainly left sided defects (70%) followed by right sided defects (17%) and least common complete bilateral absence of pericardium (9%) 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. Majority of the patients are asymptomatic and are diagnosed incidentally on chest radiographs or while undergoing cardiac surgery. Symptoms are often vague with chest pain， shortness of breath or palpitations and may also arise from associated cardiac anomalies. Atrial Septal Defects (ASD) are common cardiac anomaly found in congenital absence of pericardium. Transcatheter device closure of the atrial septal defect is a feasible option but may pose a dilemma regarding the position of the device post procedure due to leftward and posterior shift of the cardiac silhouette in congenital absence of the pericardium. We report two cases of ASD device closure which presented as device embolization and on further evaluation both the cases were found to have congenital absence of the pericardium.\n\n【4】Case Series\n\n【5】Case 1\n\n【6】A 4 years female came to our center with chief complaints of difficulty in breathing in the past3 years of age. She was first in birth order born out of nonconsanguineous marriage at term with normal vaginal delivery and had no postnatal complications. She had history of recurrent episodes of lower respiratory tract infections requiring hospitalizations for which cardiac consultation was advised.On examination，the patient was hemodynamically stable with systemic pressures of 111/64mmHg， respiratory rate of 30 beats per minute and SpO， of 100% on room air. On cardiovascular examination first heart sound was normal with wide and fixed splitting of second heart sound and soft mid diastolic murmur at left lower parasternal area. Chest radiograph revealed dilated right atrium and right ventricle with increased pulmonary blood flow. A 12 lead ECG showed sinus rhythm with evidence of right atrium and right ventricular volume and pressure overload.\n\n【7】Echocardiography demonstrated large malaligned ostium secundum ASD measuring 16mm with adequate rims， enlarged Eustachian valve， dilated right atrium and right ventricle and ventricular function was normal. Transcatheter closure ofthe ASD was done with 18 mm Amplatzer Septal Occluder without any complications. Post-procedure TEE showed device in position with no residual shunt. On the next day transthoracic echocardiography showed ASD device to be embolized in Left atrium with loss of atrioventricular rim. The child was taken for surgical ASD device retrieval and defect closure. During surgery it was found that there was absence of left posterior and mediastinal pericardium with ASD device attached to the septum. On retrospective analysis of chest X-ray revealed leftward and posterior rotation of cardiac silhouette with straightening and删除1换行elongated left heart border and the space between aorta and the main pulmonary artery appeared widened Snoopy Sign. It was concluded that false presentation of device embolization was due to congenital absence of left posterior and mediastinal pericardium.\n\n【8】Case 2\n\n【9】An 8 years male child， second in birth order， full-term with no ppostnatal complications was coincidentally found to have ostium secundum atrial septal defect while evaluating for increased precordial activity. On cardiac examination first heart sound was normal， second heart sound was wide and fixed split and a short eiection systolic murmur was heard at left lower sternal border. Chest X-ray demonstrated cardiomegaly with prominent pulmonary arteries and increased vascularity. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed moderate sized ostium secundum ASD with adequate rims and dilated right atrium and right ventricle. Child was taken for transcatheter closure of ASD which was done with 16 mm Amplatzer Septal Occluder. There were no procedural complications and child was discharged on oral antiplatelet. However， on follow-up child had complained of chest discomfort and on evaluation with ECG was normal and Echo showed stable device position with noresidual shunt and no evidence of erosion/effusion. Child was kept on follow-up. On 10 months of follow-up in view of persistent chest discomfort CT pulmonary angiography with coronary evaluation was done which showed levorotation of heart with air interposition between PA and aorta and below the heart with prominent left atrial and normal device position and normal coronaries giving the diagnosis of congenital absence of the pericardium. Retrospective evaluation of the chest X-ray showed levorotation of the heart with obscured right heart border and poor visualization of device due to its superimposition on spine and prominent LA with air seen in aortopulmonary window area in left border suggestive of absent pericardium.\n\n【10】Discussion\n\nCongenital Absence of Pericardium (CAP) is exceedingly rare cardiac anomaly which occurs due to failure of pleuropericardial membranes to fuse completely on one or both sides. Ellis classified pericardial agenesis into various subtypes namely complete or partial left sided defect， complete or partial right sided defects and diaphragmatic pericardium defects 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. Left sided defects are the most common accounting for 70% of all the defects. Diagnosis of CAP is challenging due to asymptomatic presentation or nonspecific symptoms like atypical chest pain， palpitations， dizziness， dyspnea and trepopnea 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. Majority of the cases are diagnosed incidentally on chest X-ray due to levoposition of the heart and during surgery for other associated cardiac anomalies. About 30% of the CAP have associated cardiac anomalies namely atrial septal defects， patent ductus arteriosus， mitral valve disease， Tetralogy of Fallot and sinus venosus defect. Chest X-ray shows leftward shifted cardiac silhouette， elongated left heart border， cardiomegaly， radiolucency between aorta and pulmonary artery due to lung tissue also known as Snoopy heart sign 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. ECG demonstrates right axis deviation， right bundle branch block in V1 and poor R wave progression. Echocardiography may show right ventricular dilatation， hypermobility of heart， posterior orientation of the apex， elongated atria with widened ventricles give tear drop appearance of the heart. Echocardiography may not be diagnostic but the above finding should make clinicians aware about congenital absence of pericardium. Meanwhile cardiac|删除段之间换行|MRI remains gold standard for diagnosis of CAP with high sensitivity demonstrating the absence of preaortic pericardial recess which is present in normal hearts. Despite these advancing modalities majority of the cases often goes undiagnosed and has been diagnosed incidentally during surgery or CT angiography which was seen in our cases too. Though complete defect of the pericardium have excellent prognosis but partial absence of pericardium can lead to tricuspid regurgitation by traction of chordal structures， fatal myocardial strangulation， ischemia and sudden death requiring surgical intervention 通用删除6(英):<u>[6，7]</u>. There are literatures which mentions about the rarity of this congenital anomaly and challenges during diagnosis of this entity 通用删除6(英):<u>[2-5，8]</u>. Our cases were much different from the described case reports because none of the literatures mentions about the ASD device orientation which masqueraded as embolization due to levorotation of the heart. Surgical intervention could have been avoided in our first case as false presentation of device embolization was due to levorotation of the heart seen in congenital absence of pericardium. Similarly in the second case persistent chest discomfort and device orientation in chest X-ray and echocardiography could unnecessarily lead to surgical intervention in the child for device retrieval and defect closure if diagnosis of CAP was not made. In both the cases suspicion of device embolization led to further workup and diagnosis of congenital absence of pericardium was made which would have been missed otherwise.\n\n【12】Conclusion\n\n【13】This case emphasizes that clinicians should be aware that ASD device embolization can sometimes be a false presentation due to levorotation of the heart. These features may clinch diagnosis for congenital absence of pericardium and clinicians should retrospectively analyze imaging modalities for presence of congenital absence of pericardium.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "54672e84-7007-41b2-8867-3c422390aacd", "title": null, "text": "【0】Abstract\n\n【1】Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is the most common mental health disorder in the United States as well as all over the world. According to the CDC， MDD affects more than 16.1 million American adults， or about 6.7% of the U.S. population age 18 and older in a given year. People suffering from MDD experience sadness， anhedonia， feelings of guilt， loss of energy， lack of concentration， loss in appetite， and psychomotor symptoms with possible suicidal ideation. It is a mental disease that unfortunately is still marginalized and ostracized in society today. We wrote this case report in hopes of raising awareness for depression and how it can affect individuals through secondary pathways.\n\n【2】Background\n\n【3】The role of the gut microbiome and its correlation with the production and dissemination of serotonin is still a relatively novel concept and one that has not been give its due amongst the scientific community. By showing how intrinsic the enteric nervous system and its maintenance is to promoting the production of various neurotransmitters involved in mental health diseases， we hope to make its role intricate to the understanding of mental illness and its potential treatment going forward. Gastric acid is involved in the primary function ofpreparing food for digestion and absorption by the intestine. Acid production is a central component of the stomach's contribution to digestion. Low gastric acid means higher susceptibility to food poisoning. Proton pump inhibitors use can cause diarrhea， enteric infections， and alter the gastrointestinal bacterial population by suppressing the gastric acid barrier leading to Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth (SIBO) 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Normally when food leaves the stomach， it is acidic， and it leads to changes in pH and the pancreas and gallbladder release pancreatic juice and bile but if the stomach is not producing gastric acid， the gallbladder stops releasing bile. Prolonged PPI treatment produces bowel symptoms and symptoms such as cramps，hypotension and hypomagnesemia. The gallbladder has a very important role to play as the same nutrients that work in the gallbladder produce bile. Therefore， when a patient undergoes cholecystectomy， they develop an imbalance of neurotransmitters. Bile makes glycine and taurine and when it is depleted we cannot absorb calcium and this leads to hypocalcemia. Gallbladder bile rinses bacteria off the intestinal lining and the bacteria sticks to the wall increasing its bowel population leading to gastrointestinal symptoms such as malabsorption. This now increasing enteric bacterial populace leads to the formation of the \"leaky gut”bacteria causing inflammation and depression by increased intestinal permeability associated with an upload of Lipopolysaccharide(LPS) translocation which induces depression symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. Hence gut microbiota and probiotics alter behavior and brain neurochemistry.\n\n【4】Case Presentation\n\n【5】In the case of our patient we had a 62-year-old female who had suffered from years of Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) as well as obesity class 1 with a BMI of 33. Our patient also complained of alternating bowel movements， abdominal cramps， dyspepsia， and years of H2receptor blockers and PPI use， as well as recurring cholecystitis and its affiliated symptoms. In March of 2017 our patient underwent a cholecystectomy after feeling months of gastric discomfort and dyspepsia and had finally had enough and could no longer further prolong her discomfort. Her ultrasound imaging and lab results pointed to a diagnosis of cholelithiasis with concurrent cholecystitis and she presented to the ER with intractable abdominal pain in the right upper quadrant. After initial stabilization with fluids， antibiotic treatment， and pain management， the patient in agreement with the consulting Gastrointestinal (GI) physician， decided to have a cholecystectomy删除1换行performed as she had been struggling with cholecystitis for years now. The procedure was done laparoscopically with no post operational complications. Three months later the patient presented with severe fatigue and weight gain and the recurrence of her pre-cholecystectomy symptoms. Additionally she did not feel like leaving her house， stopped socializing with her friends， felt a loss of energy and just seemed to stop caring about things. She was taken to her primary care physician， who referred her back to her GI doctor， and recommended a psychiatry consult. After standard imaging and pertinent lab results conducted by the GI physician failed to show any causal gastro intestinal factors that could be contributing to our patients state she visited a psychiatrist who，based on her presenting symptoms， diagnosed her with moderate depression secondary to the life stresses compounded by her recent surgery. The purpose of this report is to theorize how her enteric system undergoing chronic inflammation along with her cholecystectomy further exacerbated the inflammation and ultimately lead to her depression， highlighting the “Leaky Gut\"phenomenon.\n\n【6】Past medical history\n\n【7】删除3:<u>Hyperlipidemia， Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease， Hypertension， Gastritis and Obesity</u>\n\n【8】Past family history\n\n【9】Thepatient's father and motherboth had ahistory ofhypertension， gastroesophageal reflux disease and hyperlipidemia.

She was prescribed cholestyramine andesomeprazole to deal with any residual symptoms post-surgery. The patient was also scheduled to follow up with a dietician who prescribed a course of medical nutrition therapy individualized to our patient， and to follow up with her PCP to better manage her other chronic medical concerns and for medication reconciliation. The patient was advised to limit fat intake， increase dietary fiber gradually， and to avoid caffeinated and carbonated删除1换行drinks， chocolate， citrus products， spicy foods and to eat small meals. Due to a combination of factors including non-compliance with proposed dietary restrictions and inability to comply with her PCP's instructions pertaining to maintaining a healthier lifestyle， our patient experienced a return of pre-surgical symptoms as well as a sudden loss of interest in activities of daily living and was diagnosed with moderate depression by a psychiatrist. The psychiatrist after a careful review of the patient’s file suggested a thorough course of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)， a modified and realistic diet in consultation with a dietician， a workout routine and therapy sessions relating to the patient’s depression and eating habits. After two months of little improvement， the patient was started on Wellbutrin XL by her psychiatrist keeping the associated weight gain with other antidepressants in mind. The patient was instructed to take Wellbutrin XL 150 mg once daily in the morning for the first 4 days after which she would start on Wellbutrin XL 300 mg once daily.\n\n【27】Outcome and Follow-Up\n\n【28】Although our patient was given the appropriate post-op care， she initially did feet better but then began to deteriorate to her pre-surgery levels in terms of symptoms and in addition developed this new feeling of being depressed all the time which could have been related to her non-compliance with the physician ordered lifestyle recommendations in terms of her diet and other appropriate lifestyle changes. After a psychiatric consult and initial assessment， the patient tried to be more adherent to the recommendations and hoped her CBT sessions， therapy， and new dietary guidelines coupled with exercise would alleviate her concerns yet she continued to feel depressed and continued to have abdominal symptoms similar to what she felt before she had her cholecystectomy. The patient was then prescribed Wellbutrin XL and advised to continue her CBTand follow her dietary， exercise， and healthy lifestyle recommendations. After an intense and strict adherence to her diet/exercise/CBT routine together with the medication the patient experienced mild relief within five months post-surgery， her abdominal symptoms had disappeared， and she had started to lose weight and felt happier. The patient started to socialize more and took up a proactive approach to bettering her eating habits and other lifestyle choices. The Wellbutrin XL initially started at 150 mg once a day was increased to 300 mg once today after the initial four day period and then maintained as the patient did not feel like there was any need for an adjustment.\n\n【29】Discussion\n\n【30】A dysbiotic state leads to increased intestinal permeability and allows contents such as bacterial metabolites and molecules as well as bacteria themselves to leak through the submucosa and into the systemic circulation， a phenomenon aptly named leaky gut syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. In our digestive gut， sugar precursors E. coli &proteobacteria Bifidobacterial species act on the chorismite from where E. Coli， proteobacteria， B. subtilis， firm elves， mycobacterium and actinobacteria leads to formation of tryptophan which in the intestinal epithelial cells causes serotonin production in the gut. When the concentration of these bacteria is reduced due to antibiotics or PPI use， it decreases their quantity in the gut and the lack of bile post-cholecystectomy prevents the cleansing ofthe gut liningto get rid ofthe bad bacteria. This in part leads to less tryptophan and serotonin being produced in the enteric system，leading to depression. Tryptophan is synthesized from chorismite by members of several bacterial phyla including protein bacterium， actinobacterium & fircules. E. Coli can synthesize chorismite， a tryptophan precursor， which acts as a删除1换行branch point for microbial metabolic pathways consistent with this key role for bacteria. Antibiotics and PPI treatment alters tryptophan and undoes metabolism leading to less serotonin and melatonin in the brain. Tryptophan， tyrosine， and phenylalanine are made in the gut. When tryptophan is shuttled through the kynurenine pathway there is less tryptophan available to make serotonin and hence less serotonin in the gut available to be transported to the brain via the vagal nerve. Low bile，post-cholecystectomy， causes leaky gut as bile acid stimulates biliary lipid secretion due to their physical chemical properties. They can form mixed micelles together with biliary phospholipids which allows the solubilizing in bile of cholesterol and other lipophilic compounds. Mixed micelles also account for the emulsion of dietary fat and lip soluble vitamins in the gut， helping their absorption. Bile acids also facilitate intestinal calcium absorption. At the intestinal level， bile acids are known to modulate pancreatic enzyme secretion and cholecystokinin release. Moreover， they are potent anti-microbial agents that prevent bacterial over growth in the small bowel.\n\n【31】There is also a systemic IgM-mediated immune response in depression directed against LPS (which is part of the bacterial wall of gram negative bacteria) suggesting that bacterial translocation may play a role in the inflammatory and pathophysiology of clinical depression. Bacterial translocation indicates the presence of “leaky gut”or an increased permeability of the gut wall or loosening of the tight junction barrier 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. Hyperactivity of the HPA axis is also one of the most reliable biological findings in patients suffering from major depression. Exposure to stress and cytokine responses may impair neuronal plasticity and stimulation of neurotransmission. Administration of exogenous IL-1b significantly enhances IL-1b levels in the Pre-frontal Cortex (PFC) and hippocampus and further increases Hypothalamic， Pituitary， and Adrenal (HPA) axis activity. Likewise， acute stress markedly increases IL-1b levels in the PFC， hippocampus and hypothalamus. Repeated stress sensitizes the HPA axis response to administration of exogenous IL-1b and possibly leads to depression 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>.\n\n【32】The gut is composed of nerve tissues and uses neurotransmitters to communicate with the brain. The gut microbiota affects brain development and plasticity by secreting various neurotrophins and proteins， such as Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF)， synaptophysin and postsynaptic density 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. Our brain has an删除1换行intimate connection with our gut via vagal nerve， which has hundreds of millions of nerves cells that regulate our digestive processes. This“second brain\" in the gut is spread out throughout the entire length of the gut. This second brain has many sensors in the enteric nervous system. The connection between depression and the gut is integrative from serotonin in the gut and how it relates to serotonin in the brain. Many patients with depression complain of constipation. This might be due to 95% of our serotonin being produced and stored in the gut via enterochromaffin cells which leads to modulation of mood， appetite， and well-being. The serotonin in the gut is synthesized from the food that we inject and the microbes that live in our gut that stimulate the production of serotonin. 60% of the production is due to the signals that come from the microbes in our gut. The serotonin cells are sandwiched between the cells that make the lining ofthe gut. The cells have vagal nerve association and the signal when the cell is activated goes to the brain via the vagal nerve from where it is delivered into the limbic system. This case study involves a patient with a long history of GERD treated with H2 antagonists， PPIs， and a host of other medications over the vears who underwent a cholecystectomy. This was followed by symptoms of depression that required treatment with an ant-depressant coupled with healthier lifestyle changes and dietary restrictions. This case study is being written to establish a possible connection between the gut microbiome and depression.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) is a valuable diagnostic tool for ARVD/C due to the high negative删除1换行predictive value， which can identify LV impairment and thus has a significant impact on clinical decision-making 通用删除6(英):<u>[5，6]</u>. Most of the ARVD/C patients had CMR evidence of LV involvement， of which Late Gadolinium Enhancement (LGE) and Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) were the most sensitive indicators. Biventricular and left-dominant disease variants have been identified and have led some to use the term Arrhythmogenic Cardiomyopathy(ACM) to define the broader spectrum of the disease phenotypic expressions. LV involvement can be considered a late manifestation of advanced disease；however，recent studies at the level ofgenetic characterization have hypothesized that potential LV involvement may develop ahead of significant RV dysfunction in patients with ARVD/C. CMR evidence of LV involvement is a strong independent predictor of hard cardiac events 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. Additionally，the presence of LV dysfunction plays an incremental role in predicting adverse cardiac events compared to RV dysfunction alone.\n\n【9】Case Presentation\n\n【10】Patient presentation\n\n【11】A 73 years old patient was admitted in our clinic with symptoms and signs of decompensated right and left sided heart failure. There were the following concomitant diseases： optimally treated arterial hypertension and atrial fibrillation， known for 4 months before hospitalization. The treatment included Acenocoumarol and beta blocker -Bisoprolol5 mg/daily.\n\n【12】Physical examination\n\n【13】The following symptoms were observed： elevated jugular venous pressure with positive venous pulse and hepatojugular reflux； vesicular breathing with basal crackles； Heart Rate (HR) 80/min， systolic murmur in the 4\"h left intercostal space，louder in inspiration； hepatomegaly，peripheral oedema.\n\nElectrocardiogram (ECG)： on admission-atrial fibrillation， HR|删除段之间换行|80/min.\n\n【15】Holter ECG - Atrial fibrillation， heart rate 60/min， premature ventricular beats， non-sustained wide complex tachycardia .\n\n【16】Echocardiography demonstrated dilated d cardiac chambers， predominantly right sided， mildly reduced left ventricular ejection fraction- 42%；right ventricular dysfunction， Fractional Area Change(FAC) - 28%； Tricuspid Annular Plane Systolic Excursion (TAPSE)-12 m/sec， Moderate Mitral Regurgitation (MR)， severe Tricuspid Regurgitation (TR)， with Pulmonary Artery Pressure (PAP) - 37mmHg .\n\nInvasive study： coronary arteriography reveals no stenosis but dilation and aneurisms of coronary arteries， Left Circumflex Artery(LCx) arises from right coronary sinus.

Using Next Generation Sequencing(NGS) of genes’ panel for hereditary cardiomyopathy， the following genetic variant was detected： NM000256.3 (MYBPC3)： c.1316G>A. This sequence change replaces glycine with aspartic acid at codon 439 of the MYBPC3 protein . The glycine residue is highly conserved and there is a moderate physicochemical difference between glycine and aspartic acid. This variant is present in population databases at an extremely low frequency (rs763045718， ExAC 0.01%). Clin Var contains an entry for this variant in a patient with cardiomyopathy (Variation ID： 628463). Algorithms developed to predict the effect of missense changes on protein structure and function are either unavailable or do not agree on the potential impact of this missense change (SIFT： Deleterious； PolyPhen-2：Benign； Align-GVGD： Class C1). In summary， the available evidence is currently insufficient to determine the role of this variant in disease. Therefore， it has been classified as a Variant ofUncertain Significance.\n\n【20】Discussion\n\n【21】Abnormalities in cardiac Myosin Binding Protein C (MyBP-C， encoded by MYBPC3) are the most common cause of Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM) - mutations are detected in about 30% of HCM cases. Most MYBPC3 mutations in HCM result in premature termination codons that cause RNA degradation and a reduction of MyBP-C in the heart 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>. Pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants(mostly missense and splicing mutations) in MYBPC3 were reported in about 5% of cases with Dilated Cardiomyopathy (DCM) as well通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>. It is an interesting observation how different mutations in a same gene could make different myosin dysfunctions. It was demonstrated that stepwise loss of MyBP-C resulted in reciprocal augmentation of myosin contractility. Direct attenuation of myosin function， via a damaging missense variant (F764L) that causes Dilated Cardiomyopathy (DCM)， normalized the increased contractility from MyBP-C depletion 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>. Another therapeutic agent MYK-461， a pharmacologic inhibitor of myosin ATPase， rescued relaxation deficits and restored normal contractility in HCM cardiomyocytes with MYBPC3 mutations. These data define dosage-dependent effects of MyBP-C on myosin that occur across the cardiac cvcle. Therapeutic strategies to MyBP-C activity may rescue depressed cardiac contractility in patients with DCM， whereas inhibiting myosin by MYK-461 should benefit the substantial proportion of HCM patients with MYBPC3 mutations.\n\n【22】Conclusion\n\n【23】WVi quite complex arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy， with left ventricle involvement and anomalies in coronary arteries， whereby genetic testing revealed an extremely rare genetic missense variant in MYBPC3 gene. The genetic change in the exon 14 of the gene causes aminoacidic change Glycine/Aspartic acid with a moderate physicochemical difference in the protein. The association of this mutation with the development of that complex cardiomyopathy is worthy to be investigated， since it could have an important impact on the application of new treatment， using specific agents， connected to myosin activity.\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>1.

Alfa adrenergic effect causes vascular smooth muscle constriction and consequently decreases mucosal edema and inflammation findings； bronchodilator effect by induction of beta 2 adrenergic receptors in bronchial smooth muscle 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. Due to its effects on the alpha adrenergic system of PEH， it is frequently used by physicians interested in the treatment of colds. In this case report， we aimed to draw attention to the serious cardiac side effects of PEH treatment.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】Apatient with known history ofHypertension (HT) and Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) without known cardiac arrhythmia history was taking the drug containing PEH 3 times a day for 2 days due to cold flu. The patient was referred to the emergency department due to palpitations， faintness，and chest pain. General condition was evaluated as good， anxious， conscious open， oriented， coopered. In vital signs； blood pressure： 170/110 mm Hg， pulse： 170/min. Rapid ventricular atrial fibrillation(velocity： 170-180/min) was detected in the ECG of the patient . The patient’s medical story and hospital records showed that he had never had atrial fibrillation， palpitations， or any arrhythmia. This was evaluated as atrial fibrillation provoked by a drug containing PEH. The patient was given a 25 mg diltiazem slowly and then isotonic sodium hydration was added. The patient whose symptoms were improved and the sinus rhythm were obtained at ECG， and blood tests did not reveal any significant pathology was discharged with the recommendation of cardiology outpatient clinic.\n\n【7】Discussion\n\nEspecially in spring and winter， many people use excessive or often over-the-top topical or systemic decongestants to get rid of allergic or infectious nasal congestion. Despite the symptomatic benefits of these drugs， it has been reported that it can cause serious adverse cardiac events in all users，especiallythose withknown cardiac diseases. Ithas been reported in hypertensive patients that it may cause decompensation in patients with heart failure， which may cause myocardial infarction in people with elevated blood pressure， some that trigger many arrhythmias， such as ventricular tachycardia， known coronary artery disease， or normal coronary artery anatomy 通用删除6(英):<u>[3-5]</u>. In addition， a manuscript published in 2009 reported a case of transient diffuse cardiac transmission due to|删除段之间换行|PEH 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. There is also a case in which PEH triggers an epileptic event other than cardiac side effects 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. Apart from all these side effects， PEH， nausea， vomiting， diarrhea， abdominal pain， delirium， urinary retention， dermatitis， toxic epidermal necrolysis， acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis 通用删除6(英):<u>[8-111</u>\n\n【9】Conclusion\n\n【10】Despite side effects， PEH-containing preparations can be prescribed very frequently by physicians interested in treating colds for symptomatic treatment. In fact， some patients can obtain these medicines without prescription. Especially in patients with diabetes mellitus， hypertension， hyperthyroidism， epilepsy， coronary artery disease and cardiac disease， PEH-containing medicines can have serious side effects. For this reason， doctors should consider these serious side effects when prescribing PEH-containing medicines.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

The non-specific clinical symptoms and radiographic appearance make diagnosis difficult without postoperative pathological results. This report aims at providing a comprehensive overview on all GCP cases reported to date. A comprehensive literature search 通用删除7(英):<u>(1972-2014)</u> was conducted for all reported GCP cases， including one case from our group retrospectively. Keywords searched included gastritis cystica profunda， submucosal cysts of the stomach， and heterotopic submucosal gastric glands. A total of 52 cases was found， including 37 (71.2%) men and 15 (28.8%) women (M/F ratio =2.5). The overall mean age was 59.9 (range 39-91) years. Among them， 58.8%(n=30) were located in the body， 25.5%(n=13) in the fundus， 19.6%(n=9) in the antrum， 3.9%(n=2) in the cardia and occasionally one case in the prepyloric lesion and one case in anastomotic site. 52%(n=26) of cases had prior gastric surgery. The main clinical symptoms included abdominal pain (n=14， 36.8%)and gastrointestinal bleeding (including hematemesis and melena， n=7，18.4%). Among overall 52 cases， only 7.7%通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> were diagnosed before surgery， and the rest were diagnosed during postoperative histopathologic examination. In conclusion， GCP is difficult to be preoperatively correctly diagnosed due to being relatively rare and lack of typical clinical symptoms. The correct diagnosis should depend on histopathological examination. Complete surgical removal of the GCP is widely considered as the best treatment option.\n\n【2】Keywords： Gastritis cystica profunda； Cystic lesion； Submucosal cysts； Heterotopic submucosal gastric\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】GCP， a peculiar hyper plastic cystic lesion， was first described by Scott and Payne in 1947 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>； nevertheless， until 1972 littler and Glibermann 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u> coined the term“gastritis cystica polyposa”and suggested that the presence of cystically dilated gastric glands in the sub mucosa was a reactive， postsurgical condition. Subsequently， “gastritis cystica profunda” became a preferred term because it resembled similar condition in the colon 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>.\n\n【5】Very few GCP cases have been reported over half a century. It is well known that the lesion is related to several factors working in concert： something that predisposes to mucosal defects (e.g. surgery， biopsy， and polypectomy) with chronic ischemia and inflammation 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. Although it was commonly considered as a benign lesion， several studies have reported the correlation between GCP and gastric adenocarcinoma 通用删除6(英):<u>[5-7]</u>. The differentials for GCP should include GIST (Gastro Intestinal Stromal Tumor) 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>， Menetrier’s disease 通用删除6(英):<u>[9，10]</u>， inverted hyperplastic polyps 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u> and other polypoid lesions. Here， we report a case of GCP in an un-operated stomach and compare its clinical feature， diagnosis and treatment with other 51 published cases.\n\n【6】Case Presentation\n\nA 43-year-old woman， suffered from intermittent epigastric discomfort for almost a year， underwent an Endoscopic Ultra Sonography (EUS)， indicating that there was a huge sub mucosal mass in the anterior wall of gastric antrum and it was diagnosed as antrum deep cyst . Results of her physical examination showed nothing abnormal， andlaboratory findings including blood routine and tumor markers tests were all within the normal range. Also， her past surgical and family history was unremarkable. An abdominal Computed Tomography (CT) showed a 1.3 cmx2.2 cm irregular hypodense mass in the greater curvature of the stomach and enhanced scanning showed mild to moderate enhancement central in the lesion， which was suspicious of GIST (Figure|删除段之间换行|3). To further study the lesion， a Magnetic Resonance Imaging(MRI) of the stomach was performed， revealing the gastric wall on the greater curvature of antrum markedly irregularly thickened， also suggesting of GIST .\n\n【8】Because of highly suspected GIST， the patient underwent a distal gastric resection (Billroth I). Gross pathologic examination revealed that the tumor was 2.5 cm x 1.5 cm in size and had normal mucosal surface. Microscopic pathologic examination showed thickening of the muscular is and cystic down-growth of gastric glands into the submucosa of the stomach with low grade dysplasia， which is compatible with gastritis cystica profunda . The patient was discharged after 12 days hospitalization and after 3-month follow-up the patient was healthy and had no sign of recurrence.\n\n【9】Clinical Features\n\n【10】A total of 57 GCP cases were collected retrospectively， with one case from Shengzhou People’s Hospital and 51 cases from 32 reports during 1972-2014. The lesion was significantly associated with older age and male gender (71.1%， M：F ratio， 2.5：1). It is known that GCP occurred most commonly in patients who had undergone gastric surgery. However， in our study， we found that there was no much difference in percentage for patients with or without gastric surgery history (52% vs.48%).\n\n【11】Clinicaly， GCP patients have abdominal pain， followed by gastrointestinal bleeding， weight loss， anemia and other rare symptoms such as nausea， epigastric discomfort， vomiting， belching and mild dysphagia， anorexia， fatigue， fullness and hypoalbuminemia. Additionally， it was incidentally found in more than a quarter of cases and sometimes， the lesion could be found in an emergency situation as it could lead to hematemesis 通用删除6(英):<u>[12，13]</u>.\n\n【12】Diagnosis\n\n【13】GCP is a rare condition with non-specific symptoms and On-radiographic images， making its diagnosis difficult without definitive surgical resection. Physical examinations and laboratory studies are commonly not significant. Imaging tests included CT and MRI. GCP presents as a polypoid mass， unspecific circumferential thickening of the gastric wall with cystic changes in CT scan and MRI appearance hasn’t been reported before. In current study， a MRI scan was also performed， demonstrating that the gastric wall on the greater curvature of the antrum markedly irregularly thickened， with high signals on Diffusion Weighted Imaging (DWI)， and without identified perigastric or periesophageal lymph nodes. Both CT and MRI findings were not diagnostic since they mimic other hyper proliferative conditions. But Wu et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u> once reported a case that the features of GCP were preoperatively evaluated by CT. The differential diagnosis of GCP should include GIST， gastric adenocarcinoma and other submucosal lesions. Compared to gastric adenocarcinoma， GCP rarely presents with weight loss， cachexia and highly enhancement in CT performances. Radio graphically， GIST and GCP all appear as hypo echoic， intramural polypoid masses with cystic changes 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>. EUS examination should be conducted to provide more information to further investigate the mucosal pathology. The most frequent EUS feature of GCP was multiple anechoic cystic spaces/cysts in the sub mucosal of those cases 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>. Additionally， the diagnosis can be improved by EUS Fine Needle Aspiration (FNA). Chung et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u> considered EUS as an effective diagnostic tool to evaluate and differentiate GCP from the protruding and elevated gastric lesion， with 88.9% sensitivity and 100% positive rate. Four删除1换行patients were preoperatively diagnosed by Endoscopic Mucosal Resection (EMR) or Endoscopic Mucosal Resection (ESD) along with the development of endoscopic technique in recent years.\n\n【14】Pathological examination is a monopolistic diagnostic procedure to evaluate GCP. Histologically， GCP is characterized by elongation of the gastric foveolae with hyperplasia and cystic dilatation of the gastric glands， extending in the sub mucosal layer and sometimes mild dysplasia could be discovered， similar to current case.\n\n【15】Treatment and Prognosis\n\n【16】Given the rarity of the lesions and the difficulty in diagnosing them preoperatively， a defined treatment strategy on GCP has not been well described. To date， among the 37 cases providing specific treatment plans， only four patients were without surgical treatment， one with medication with proton pump inhibitor and the other three were in surveillance. Nearly 89.2% patients underwent surgical resection， similar to our current case. The most popular surgical treatment is partial gastrectomy， followed by complete removal of stomach， endoscopic mucosal resection and polypectomy. It is well known that the location of GCP determines surgery approach. In current study， distal gastrectomy with a Billroth I gastrojejunostomy was performed because the lesion was located in the antrum. Currently， since increasing reports tend to approve the potential malignance of GCP， gastrectomy or total gastrectomy is regarded as the most recommended approach to relieve the symptoms and cure the disease. However， the reflux after surgery，foreign bodies (sutures) and gastric mucosa damage may lead to the development of GCP， which requires an appropriate surgical plan and close follow-up. In addition， ESD and EMR have become new options for treatment along with the advantage in minimally invasive approaches. But it is noteworthy that these surgical procedures may facilitate the deep misplacement of gastric glands into the muscular is propria according to a report published in 2011， which found that after three attempts of endoscopic removal of the polyp， GCP recurred within short period and a gastric sleeve resection was performed eventually 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>.\n\n【17】In general， the prognosis of this condition is not bad ifnot coexists with gastric adenocarcinoma， Menetrier disease， gastric lymphoma and other malignant diseases. The possibility of recurrence is not well studied. To date， two cases have been reported of the GCP recurrences after surgical resections 通用删除6(英):<u>[17，18]</u>. And a 10-year follow-up for a case with GCP in an unoperated patient revealed low grade dysplasia， and the sizes of both the GCP and the adenoma overlying increased during the follow-up period 通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u>.\n\n【18】Results\n\n【19】Fifty-two cases of GCP have been documented， including the case reported here. Clinical and treatment data are detailed in below.\n\n【20】Among these 52 patients， 37 were men and 15 were women (M：F ratio， 2.5：1)， with an overall mean age of 59.9 years (range： 39-91years). The ones who were older than 50 years old accounted for 74%. The mean age among women was 60.2 years (range： 39-79 years)， and the mean age among men was 60.3 years (range： 44-91 years). Only 52% of patients had previous stomach surgery history. Among the 38 cases presenting symptoms， GCP was an incidental finding in 28.9% (n=11) of patients， and the main clinical manifestation is abdominal pain (n=14， 36.8%)， followed by gastrointestinal bleeding(n=7， 18.4%)， weight loss (n=4， 10.5%) and anemia (n=4， 10.5%). It is occasional to find the patient with nausea (n=1， 2.6%)， epigastric\n\n【21】Discussion\n\nThe etiology and pathogenesis of GCP are not fully elaborated at present. Chakravorty and Schatzki 通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u> considered GCP as a congenital disease in 1975 because it was found in some patients without gastric ulcer and previous gastric surgery history. However， more researchers supported that acquired factors played a leading role in the development of GCP. In 1981， by studying a particular case，Franzin and Novelli 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u> concluded that the presence of cystically dilated gastric glands in the sub mucosa was a reactive， postsurgical condition and was caused by disruption of the integrity of gastric mucosal. Furthermore， Fonde and Rodning 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u> in 1986 pointed out that GCP developed secondary to ischemia， chronic inflammation and foreign body (surgical suture) stimulation. Kcne2 is short for potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily E member 2， which is one of the important subunits ofapical potassium channels in parietal cells通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u>.In 2010， Torsten et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u> demonstrated a breakthrough finding， i.e. all of the eleven Kcne2 gene knockout mice exhibit a severe gastric preneoplastic phenotype comprising GCP， while none of the five mice|删除段之间换行|Whether or not GCP is malignant is still controversial. Historically， the performance of sub mucosal glands in GCP was not thought to represent cancer. However， it has been reported that GCP coexisted with gastric adenocarcinoma 通用删除6(英):<u>[5，7]</u>， Menetrier disease通用删除6(英):<u>[9，10]</u> and gastric carcinoma with lymphoid stroma 通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u>. A Japanese study 通用删除6(英):<u>[26]</u> performed an immunohistochemical analysis on a GCP gross specimen and described elevated expression of Ki-67， p53， and p21 in GCP lesions， which was indicative of increased epithelial proliferation and increased DNA repair， and thus might explain the etiology of GCP as the precursor of gastric cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>[27-40]</u>.\n\n【23】Although complete removal of the GCP using established surgical oncology principles is widely recommended as the most删除1换行perfect treatment， there is no much difference in GCP treatment whether with or without prior surgery. GCP is always confused with other submucosal gastric lesions without typical manifestations. The most common presenting symptom is abdominal pain， and EUS appears as the most effective approach to investigate the condition while imaging examinations as CT and MRI can provide limited information. Future studies need to elucidate the natural history of this disease process， and malignant potential， thus more evidence-based treatment strategies are warranted.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

Male infertility made by zinc limited diet is not yet fully understood because of complexity of its mechanism， however， zinc is believed to be involved in several assimilated processes linked with reproduction and has been stated seminal zinc concentration was lower in patients with idiopathic sub fertility than in normal control 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>.\n\n【15】In another study， it has been observed that geometric means of the seminal plasma zinc concentration was found to be significantly lower (p<0.05) in the infertile group compared with those in the fertile group 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>. In contrast， other authors had reported normal and even increased seminal plasma zinc levels in infertile males， but such studies are very low in magnitude. The probable explanation could be that zinc in semen is responsible for motility， therefore， it may not effect in both oligozoospermic and azoospermic groups通用删除6(英):<u>[13，14]</u>. We also found decrease level of semen zinc in azoospermic， oligozoospermic， asthenozoospermic and oligozoospermic groups.\n\n【16】High zinc content had also been reported in seminal plasma and has been associated with a high degree of sperm cell motility 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>， it has also been reported that extra cellular zinc performances as an inhibitor of human sperm motility and acrosome reaction 通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>.

Whereas， we in our study found that seminal plasma zinc in those subjects having more than 50% of motility had significant increased concentration than those having decrease (<50%) of motility.\n\n【17】In the present study， we observed significant decrease in seminal plasma zinc level in asthenozoospermic group.

The cardiac ultrasound allowed us to assess the condition heart and also to look for valvular calcifications. Parathyroid ultrasound was performed in all patients who had hyperparathyroidism. Parathyroid scintigraphy was not systematic； indicated in patients who had tertiary hyperparathyroidism requiring treatment surgical. Statistical analyzes were carried out with SPSS 10.0 software for Windows.\n\n【13】Results\n\n【14】The average age of our patients was 49 ± 14.6 years， with a predominance of men， and an M/F sex ratio of 1.3.

In our study，patients responding to KDIGO targets for serum calcium were63%. This rate is similar to that of the series studied in Mauritania， Tunisia and Senegal 通用删除6(英):<u>[6-8]</u>， while the patients responding to the KDIGO targets for phosphoremia is 60%， which matches the targets found in the series studied in Senegal， with lower rates observed in the series from Mauritania and Tunisia， and 48% of our patients meet the KDIGO targets for THA. This rate is higher compared to what is found in the series for Mauritania and Senegal and lower compared to that of Tunisia 通用删除6(英):<u>[6-8]</u>. Simultaneously adherence to three criteria recommended by the KDIGO were only 29.3%， this matches the data of many studies where the Most patients do not meet the 3 targets of recommendations cited above 9，10.\n\n【36】This can be explained largely due to the fact that the new targets of serum calcium and of PTH have been enlarged and appear more easily achievable.\n\n【37】Moreover， these observed results remain unsatisfactory. This is easily explained by the low socio-economic level. economic benefit of our patients， who lack social security the vast majority of cases； making a support therapy based on non-calcium phosphorus chelators and/or calcimimetics often difficult or even inconceivable given their high cost， associated with non-compliance therapeutic not evaluated but certainly important in terms of taste unpleasant calcium chelators 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>.\n\n【38】Conclusion\n\n【39】At the end of our work， which focused on 658 chronic hemodialysis patients， we underline the high frequency of mineral and bone disorders， the management of which remains a complex and constantly evolving field.\n\n【40】The latest recommendations make it possible to apply an individualized therapeutic strategy in orderto optimize the management of these disorders.

Six patients were male and 3 were female with the mean age of 67 years (range，57-83). The diagnosis of infected AAA was determined by clinicalevidence ofinfection (pain， fever andleukocytosis)，aortic image， and positive results from blood cultures， pus culture (from CT guide percutaneous and surgical drainage) and Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). Empirical parenteral antibiotics were administered on admission. At the time ofan operation， all were saccular and 4 of the 9 aneurysms (44.4%) were ruptured (3 contained，1 free ruptured). All patients have undergone EVAR for AAA；5 used Bifurcated stent grafts， 2 Tube stent grafts and 2 Aorto-uniiliac stent grafts with femoro-femoral bypass grafting. The parenteral antibiotics were continued in the postoperative period for 4-6 weeks.\n\n【4】Results： Chronic Renal Disease (CRD) was present in 66.66 %(6/9)， Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) was present in 55.55% (5/9)， Chronic Pulmonary Obstructive Disease (COPD) present in 44.44%(4/9) with diabetes mellitus present in 22.22%(2/9). The most common pathogen was Salmonella species (n =5)， Escherichia coli (n=2) and B. pseudomallei (n =2). Forty-four percent (4/9) of the patients presented with ruptured that needed an emergency surgery. There was no 30 days mortality and significant morbidity. Three patients (patient no. 1，5 and 7) had Infected Stent Grafts (ISG) at10， 26 and 36 months after EVAR， subsequently received CT-guided percutaneous tube drainage and 2 patients (patient no. 1 and 5) needed later stent graft explantation. One patient (patient no.7) refused stent graft explantation and died 1 month later at another hospital from gastrointestinal bleeding and septicemia.\n\n【5】Conclusions： The immediate results of EVAR for Infected AAA are fair with no 30 days mortality and few complications. The midterm results are not satisfied due to high rate of Infected Stent Grafts(ISG) 33.33%(3/9). EVAR is not a definitive treatment of Infected AAA； it could be a temporizing treatment prior to definitive open surgical repair， or a therapeutic alternative in critically ill patients who may not survive open surgery.\n\n【6】Keywords： Infected stent grafts， infected abdominal aortic aneurysm， endovascular treatment\n\n【7】Introduction\n\n【8】Management of infected AAA is a challenging and difficult clinical problem for the vascular surgeon. In the West， Infected AA A is rare； they represent only 1%to2% ofall aortic aneurysms 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. In an Asian population， infected AAA may raise up to 13.6%通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. Infected AAA are associated with high morbidity and high mortality 21-44% because they are frequently associated with complicating factors， such as late or delay in diagnosis， rupture， sepsis， and comorbid diseases of the patients通用删除6(英):<u>[1，2]</u>. The gold standard for treatment of infected AAA is aggressive surgical resection， debridement of infected periaortic tissues， and reconstruction of the aortic flow by anatomic or extra-anatomic techniques. However； the presence of unfavorable anatomy， a hostile operative field after previous surgery， a contained rupture， or a physiologically debilitated state can elevate operative risk and morbid level 通用删除6(英):<u>[3-5]</u>. In this report， we describe our experience with the management of 9 patients with infected AAA of the infra renal， all patients underwent endovascular repair.\n\n【9】Table 1： Patient demographics.\n\n| Case  | Age/Gender  | Pathogens  | Diagnosis  | Underling diseases  | Rupture  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1  | 71/M  | Samonella  | Hemoculture/Pus culture  | COPD/CHD/HT  | No  |\n| 2  | 69/M  | B.pseudomallei  | Hemoculture/PCR  | Beta-thalasemia/HT  | No  |\n| 3  | 72/M  | E.coli  | Hemoculture/Pus culture  | Bronchiectasis/CHD  | No  |\n| 4  | 83/F  | Salmonella  | Hemoculture  | CKD/COPD  | No  |\n| 5  | 57/M  | B.pseudomallei  | Hemoculture/PCR  | CKD/CHD/DM  | No  |\n| 6  | 75/F  | Samonella  | Hemoculture  | CKD/CHD/ COPD  | Yes  |\n| 7  | 58/M  | E.coli  | Hemoculture/Pus culture  | CKD/Gouty arthritis  | Yes  |\n| 8  | 81/M  | Samonella  | Hemoculture  | CKD/COPD/ HT  | Yes  |\n| 9  | 61/F  | Samonella  | Hemoculture  | CKD/CHD/DM  | Yes  |\n\n【11】COPD： Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease； CHD： Coronary Heart Disease； HT： Hypertension； CKD： Chronic Kidney Disease； DM： Diabetes Mellitus， PCR：Polymerase Chain Reaction\n\n【12】Case Presentation\n\n【13】During the study period from January 2009 to December l2011， nine patients (six men， three women) with primary infected infrarenal AAA were treated using this EVAR strategy. Patients were a mean age of 67 years (range， 57-83 years). All patients had positive blood cultures showing five Salmonella， two Escherichia coli， and two B. pseudomallei. Broad-spectrum antibiotics were used in all9 patients. Mean C-reactive protein level was 188 mg/L (range， 67mg/L to 486 mg/L) and mean white blood cell (WBC) was 11 (range，8-18 x 10/L). The diagnosis of aortic aneurysm was confirmed by abdominal CT scan and by CT angiography. All of the patients had aortic pseudoaneurysms with a mean size of 5.2 cm (range， 4.3 cm to7.2 cm). There was no 30 days mortality. After 4 weeks of intravenous antibiotics postoperatively， lifelong oral antibiotics were maintained， if possible. All patients were followed in an outpatient clinic at 1， 6， and 12 months and thereafter once a year. The mean follow-up period was 74 months (range， 54-81 months). Three patients had Infected Stent Grafts (ISG) at 10， 26 and 36 months after EVAR， subsequently received CT-guided percutaneous tube drainage and needed later stent graft explantation. Patient no. 1 underwent axillo-bifemoral bypass grafting and stent graft explantation. Patient no. 2 underwent stent graft explantation and In-situ Dacron graft interposition. Patient no. 3 refused stent graft explantation and died 1 month later at another hospital from gastrointestinal bleeding and septicemia. All nine patients consented to publication of this report.\n\n【14】Patient 1\n\nA 71-year-old man with a past history of arterial hypertension， chronic smoking， and myocardial infarction underwent elective EVAR for primary Infected AAA using a Cook Zenith Endograft for the main body TFFB-23-111-2T： legs TFLE-15-78-2T and TFLE-16-62-2T. (Cook Medical， Bloomington， IN). The patient had a history of positive hemocultures with Salmonella. Ten months after， he presented with back pain， asthenia， anorexia， 5 kg weight loss， and fever in the last 7 days. On physical examination， the abdomen was tender in the epigastric area to deep palpation. His blood results showed an elevated white blood cell count to 16 x 10/L with 75%of neutrophils and anemia of 7.5 g/dL. A CT scan revealed the stent graft surrounded by an abscess with air. CT guided percutaneous drainage was performed and yielded 30 cc pus with positive culture of Salmonella. The patient underwent an elective operation. First， a right-sided axillofemoral bypass was performed， employing an 8mm PTFE prosthesis. Through a midline laparotomy the endograft was completely removed . The infrarenal aorta and left|删除段之间换行|common iliac artery were closed using nonabsorbable sutures and covered with omentum. Debridement of the abscess and lavage of the cavity were performed. Salmonella grew in the endograft culture. Hemocultures， microbiological cultures of aortic tissue and the删除表格换行abscess were negative. The patient received empirical intravenous antibiotics during 6 weeks of hospitalization. The postoperative course was uneventful， and the patient was discharged in good clinical conditions. Twenty-four months after surgery， both the clinical syndrome and CT scan showed no evidence of recurrent infection.\n\n【16】Table 2： Treatment Procedures and Results.\n\n| Case  | Procedures  | Complications  | Second Procedure  | Third Procedure  | Follow up (months)/ Status  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1  | Bifurcatec Graft  | Infected Stent Graft 10 months after EVAR  | CT guided percutaneous drainage  | AFB/Explantation 1 month after drainage  | 64/ Alive  |\n| 2  | AUI Graft/AFB  | No  | No  | No  | 81/Alive  |\n| 3  | Bifurcated Graft  | No  | Surgical Drainage  | No  | 79/Alive  |\n| 4  | Tube Graft  | No  | No  | No  | 82/Alive  |\n| 5  | Bifurcated Graft  | Infected Stent Graft 36 months after EVAR  | CT guided percutaneous drainage  | Explantation/In situ Dacron Graft Interposition6 months atter drainage  | 57/ Alive  |\n| 6  | Bifurcatec Graft  | Left Graft Limb Occlusion  | Thromboembolectomy  | No  | 80/Alive  |\n| 7  | Bifurcated Graft  | Infected Stent Graft 26 months after EVAR  | CT guided percutaneous drainage  | No， refused an operation  | Dead 1 month later from sepsis andgastrointestinal bleeding  |\n| 8  | AUI Graft/AFB  | No  | No  | No  | 76/Alive  |\n| 9  | Tube Graft  | No  | No  | No  | 77/Alive  |\n\n【18】AUI： Aortouniiliac； AFB： Axillobifemoral Bypass；EVAR： Endovascular Aneurysmal Repair\n\n【19】Table 3： Patients with Infected Stent Grafts (ISG).\n\n| Case  | Age/ Gender  | Pathogens  | Endografts  | Interval.

(Medtronic， Inc.， Minneapolis，MN). The patient had a history of positive hemocultures with B. pseudomallei. Thirty-six months after， he presented with abdominal pain， anorexia， 3kg weight loss， and fever in the last 10 days. On physical examination， the abdomen was tender in the epigastric area to deep palpation. His blood results showed an elevated white blood cell count to13 x 10°/L with 81% of neutrophils and anemia of 8.5 g/dL. A CT scan revealed the stent graft surrounded by an abscess with air. CT guided percutaneous drainage was performed and yielded 25 cc pus with negative culture for organism. The patient underwent an elective operation. Through a midline laparotomy the endograft was completely removed. Aortic reconstruction with in situ Dacron graft placement with aortobi-iliac graft configuration was performed and covered with omentum. Debridement of the abscess and lavage of the cavity were performed. Hemocultures， microbiological cultures of aortic tissue， endograft and the abscess were negative. The patient received empirical intravenous antibiotics during 6 weeks of hospitalization. The postoperative course was uneventful， and the patient was discharged in good clinical conditions. Twenty-four months after surgery， both the clinical syndrome and CT scan showed no evidence of recurrent infection.\n\n【23】Patient 3\n\nA 58-year-old man with a past history of chronic kidney disease and gouty arthritis underwent emergency EVAR for primary Infected|删除段之间换行|AAA using a Cook Zenith Endograft for the main body TFFB-30-111-2T： legs TFLE-10-88-2T and TFLE-18-56-2T. (Cook Medical， Bloomington， IN). The patient had a history of positive hemocultures with E. coli. Twenty-six months after， he presented with back pain， anorexia and high fever in the last 7 days. On physical examination， the abdomen was tender in the epigastric area to deep palpation. His blood results showed an elevated white blood cell count to 15x10/L with 83% of neutrophils and anemia of 8.1 g/dL. A CT scan revealed the stent graft surrounded by an abscess with air. CT guided percutaneous drainage was performed and yielded 15 cc pus with positive culture of E. coli. The patient refused stent graft explantation and died 1 month later at another hospital from aorto-enteric fistula with gastrointestinal bleeding and E. coli septicemia.\n\n【25】Results\n\n【26】Between January 2009 and December l 2011， 9 consecutive patients (six men， three women) with primary infected infrarenal AAA were treated using this EVAR strategy. Patients were a mean age of 67 years (range， 57-83 years). The demographic data and the pathogens are presented in Tables 1 and 2.\n\n【27】All of the patients presented with abdominal or back pain， and five had recurrent fevers. All patients had positive blood cultures，3 patients had positive tissue cultures (33.33%) and 2(22.22%) had positive Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). Broad-spectrum antibiotics were used in all 9 patients. Mean C-reactive protein level was 188 mg/L (range， 67 mg/L-486 mg/L) and mean White Blood Cell (WBC) was 11 (range， 8x10-18x10/L). Chronic Renal Disease(CRD) was present in 66.66 %(6/9)， Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) was present in 55.55 % (5/9)， Chronic Pulmonary Obstructive Disease (COPD) present in 44.44% (4/9) with diabetes mellitus present in 22.22%(2/9). None of the 9 patients had evidence of immune deficiency. The diagnosis of aortic aneurysm was confirmed by abdominal CT scan and by CT angiography. All of the patients had aortic pseudoaneurysms with a mean size of 5.2 cm (range， 4.3删除1换行cm-7.2cm).\n\n【28】Four patients had ruptured aneurysms； 3 had focal aortic pseudoaneurysms with contained ruptures (33.33%) and 1 free rupture with signs of hemodynamic instability (11.11%)， all received urgency EVAR operations. Fever was present in two of the four urgency operative cases. Fever was controlled in most of the patients undergoing elective operations preoperatively. In addition to the typical infectious presentation and the imaging appearance on CT， all patients had positive blood culture reports showing five Salmonella， two Escherichia coli， and two B. pseudomallei. One patient (patient no. 6) developed left graft limb occlusion， which underwent successful thromboembolectomy； one (patient no. 3) underwent a minilaparotomy for open debridement due to persistent fever. There was no 30 days mortality. After 4 weeks of intravenous antibiotics postoperatively，lifelong oral antibiotics were maintained， if possible.\n\n【29】All patients were followed in an outpatient clinic at 1， 6，and 12months and thereafter once a year. The mean follow-up period was 74months (range， 54-81 months). Three patients (patient no. 1， 5 and 7) had Infected Stent Grafts (ISG) at 10， 26 and 36 months after EVAR， subsequently received CT-guided percutaneous tube drainage and needed later stent graft explantation . Patients with Infected Stent Grafts (ISG) Patient no. lunderwent axillo-bifemoral bypass grafting and stent graft explantation. Patient no. 5 underwent stent graft explantation and In-situ Dacron graft interposition. Patient no.7 refused stent graft explantation and died 1 month later at another hospital from gastrointestinal bleeding and septicemia.\n\n【30】Discussion\n\n【31】Primary arterial infections have been classified into 4 types 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>.\n\n【32】1. Mycotic aneurysm due to septic emboli (embolomycotic)； usually from endocarditis.\n\n【33】2. Microbial arteritis-Bacteremiacaiisesinfection in aan atheromatous plaque leading to destruction of the wall and aneurysm formation； this is most common in the aorta.\n\n【34】3. Infection of a pre-existing aneurysm.\n\n【35】4. Post traumatic false aneurysm， such as following penetrating injury， invasive intra-arterial cannulation or drug abuse.\n\n【36】There are several theories to explain the pathology of aortic infection. Infected microemboli may lodge in the aortic infection. Infected microemboli may lodge in the vasa vasorum causing occlusion and damage to the aortic wall， which leads to degeneration and aneurysm formation. Emboli can also lodge in the irregular intima or the thrombus in the aneurysm during bacteremia. Aortic wall infection can occur due to direct inoculation into the arterial wall. Organisms may colonize the intact vascular wall through the vasa vasorum， where a local suppurative process， which results in Microbial arteritis with aneurysm formation， weakens the arterial wall 通用删除6(英):<u>[6-8]</u>.\n\nWith the introduction of antibiotics during the past 50 years， the incidence of infective endocarditis decreased gradually， and infected aortic aneurysms associated with endocarditis became rare 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>. In nonendocarditis bacteremia or secondary to septic emboli， the most commonly reported site of infected aneurysms was the abdominal aorta due to infection of existing atherosclerotic plaque and aneurysms with a larger vasa vasorum， where infected emboli may dislodge. An interesting feature is that Salmonella spp.， rather than|删除段之间换行|Staphylococcus spp.， seem to cause most infected aortic aneurysms in Eastern countries. It may be plausible that people in Eastern countries eat foods which in general have a greater than average risk of contamination with Salmonella spp.\n\n【38】Salmonella species in particular have a strong predilection to infect damaged aortic intima and abnormal arterial intima， especially arteries harboring atherosclerotic plaque 通用删除6(英):<u>[7，10]</u>. Characterization of the different bacteria is important， since gram-negative sepsis results in higher rupture rates than infection with gram-positive bacteria 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>. The virulence species， Salmonella typhimurium and Salmonella chloeraesuis， account for over 50% of the reported cases of infected aneurysms 通用删除6(英):<u>[7，10]</u>. Other common organisms are Streptococcus， Bacteroides， Escherichia coli， and Staphylococcus aureus 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>. In our report， Salmonella sp. was responsible in 55.55%(n =5) of patients . E. coli 22.22% (n =2)， and Burkholderia pseudomallei 22.22%(n =2). Gram-negative organisms were by far the most common isolates from hemocultures. Salmonella sp. responded in66.66% (4/6) of patients and is thought to exhibit a more virulent course because of its ability to invade the normal intima and cause early aneurysm rupture 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>.\n\n【39】The complicated early outcome in patients with infected aortic aanIeurysms probably reflects the combination of an aggressive presentation， high rupture rate， and complex aneurysm location in hosts with chronic comorbid conditions. This study shows 44.44%(4/9) incidence of aneurysm rupture. All of our patients had at least one chronic comorbid condition； Chronic Renal Disease (CRD) was present in 66.66 %(6/9)， Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) was present in 55.55 %(5/9)， Chronic Pulmonary Obstructive Disease(COPD) present in 44.44%(4/9) with diabetes mellitus present in22.22%(2/9).Despite the fact that infected aneurysms occur in all age groups， the elderly comprised the largest group in our series. All of the 9 patients； 6 were men and 3 were women of mean age of 67 years(range， 57-83 years).\n\n【40】In our series， all patients were symptomatic， with symptoms having lasted for more than 7 days， and even up to 2 months. Classic manifestations include abdominal pain， fever， and a pulsatile abdominal mass. The presence ofleukocytosis-elevated sedimentation rate and positive blood cultures strengthen the surgeon's suspicion of the diagnosis of infected aneurysm. Symptoms of sepsis may be discrete and may easily go unrecognized，especially in the early stages. Broad-spectrum antibiotics should be started preoperatively after taking blood cultures. Positive blood cultures are helpful to signal the need for the specific antibiotic therapy. CT scan is also in establishing the diagnosis of infected aortic aneurysm 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>.\n\n【41】Although a period of antimicrobial therapy before EVAR is advised， immediate EVAR is indicated， irrespective of bacteriologic status， when there are signs of rupture. Emergency surgery was performed in 44.44%(n =4) of patients due to rupture. Three patients had focal aortic pseudo aneurysms with contained ruptures (75%) and 1 free ruptures (25%)； CT scan confirmed all these. Three of the4 (75%) ruptured infected abdominal aortic aneurysms were infected by Salmonella species .\n\n【42】The surgical management ofinfected abdominalaortic aneurysms includes extensively resect the infected aorta， aggressively debride the periaortic tissues，andreconstruct the aortic flow usingextra-anatomic or anatomic bypass prosthetic grafts 通用删除6(英):<u>[3，4，13]</u>. Adequate drainage， administration of organism-specific parenteral antibiotics， extensive debridement and excision of infected aortic tissue are the strategies删除1换行used to resolve infection 通用删除6(英):<u>[2-5，14]</u>. The virulence of the organism and severity ofthe arterial infection are more important determinants than any single operative procedure or method of arterial reconstruction通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>. The associated mortality was still high， ranging from 25% to 40%通用删除6(英):<u>[2-5，13-15]</u>. Death is usually related to persistent sepsis with multi-organ failure. The magnitude and long duration of the operation， especially in shocked and unstable patients， are major contributing factors to the perioperative mortality 通用删除6(英):<u>[3，14，15]</u>. Late graft infections occurred in 7% to 10% of the cases 通用删除6(英):<u>[3，4，14]</u>， and extra-anatomic bypass had worse outcome than in situ reconstructions 通用删除6(英):<u>[4，13]</u>.\n\n【43】Endovascular treatment with stent-grafts has been introduced， as an alternative， less invasive， especially in the septic patient with considerable co-morbidity， will reduce the risk of cardiopulmonary， neurological and renal complications 通用删除6(英):<u>[16，17]</u>. This could be a temporizing treatment prior to definitive open surgical repair， or a therapeutic alternative in critically i patients who may not survive open surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>[18-20]</u>.The potential benefits of endovascular repair include small incisions， minimal aortic cross-clamping time with reduction in end-organ ischemia，avoidance of general anesthesia， full heparinsation， single lung ventilation and cardiopulmonary bypass. Endovascular repair should reduce the length of stay in intensive care units， high dependency units and in hospital，with an earlier return to activities of daily living and consequent improvement in the quality of life 通用删除6(英):<u>[18-22]</u>. An additional drainage procedure is usually required either via CT guided drainage or by open surgical approach 通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u>.On our previous experience on open surgical management of infected AAA， we had a disease-specific mortality was 31.25% (5/16). 30-day mortality rate of the ruptured cases is high 25%(4/16) 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. We started EVAR for treatment of infected AAA since 2009 and hope that this alternative and less invasive procedure will decrease the patient's morbidity and mortality rates. We would go over on EVAR for treatment of infected AAA whenever the stents are available.\n\n【44】Immediate results are fair impressive； one patient (patient no. 6) developed left graft limb occlusion， which underwent successful thromboembolectomy； one (patient no. 3) underwent a minilaparotomy for open debridement due to persistent fever. There was no in-hospital death both in elective and emergency ruptured cases .\n\n【45】Antibiotic administration according to postoperative sensitivity testing is crucial： the duration of antibiotic therapy is not well established， but most authors recommend a minimum of 6 weeks intravenously and orally for another 6 weeks 通用删除6(英):<u>[5，21]</u>. Longer durations and even life-long antibiotic therapy have been recommended 通用删除6(英):<u>[3，20]</u>. Some authors believe that patients with a prosthetic reconstruction should continue on low-dose antibiotics for life. However， the advantage of a more prolonged therapy has not been confirmed.\n\n【46】The midterm results are not satisfied due to high rate of infected stent grafts 33.33%(3/9). Three patients (patient no. 1， 5 and 7) had Infected Stent Grafts (ISG) at 10， 26 and 36 months after EVAR， which are disease specific complications， subsequently received CT-guided percutaneous tube drainage and needed later stent graft explantation due to unresponsive conservative management. Patient no. 1 underwent axillo-bifemoral bypass grafting and stent graft explantation. Patient no. 5 underwent stent graft explantation and In-situ Dacron graft interposition. Patient no. 7 refused stent graft explantation and died 1 month later at another hospital from aorto-enteric fistula with gastrointestinal bleeding and E. coli septicemia.\n\n【47】Placing a foreign body in an infected field seems to be against the surgical infection principles. There is always concern about persistent infection after placing a stent graft in an infected field. Persistent infection after EVAR treatment of infected aortic aneurysms is usually associated with a poor prognosis. The endoprostheses become infected so compounding the problem over a greater length ofaorta， and they may cause rupture of a fragile vessel because of the necessary oversizing used to hold the device in place. Additionally， if the fever persists after the EVAR， This would be an indication to keep the patient on long-term broad-spectrum antibiotics until a definite surgical treatment is considered. Several reports have described a high incidence of recurrent infection and late mortality after endovascular repair 通用删除6(英):<u>[20，22]</u>.\n\n【48】Conservative management of infected stent grafts consists of antimicrobial therapy and percutaneous drainage (CT guided)； is accepted in high-risk patients with multiple comorbidities and patients with minor， low-grade infections 通用删除6(英):<u>[19，21-25]</u>. Mortality in these patients has been up to 40% 通用删除6(英):<u>[26]</u>. In the series of Lyons et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[27]</u> reported that their patients who did not have stent grafts explantation died of aortic disease progression， contrasted with a mortality rate of 30% when the graft was explanted. In suitable patients： when an infected graft is not manageable by a conservative approach， surgical treatment should be considered通用删除6(英):<u>[28]</u>.\n\n【49】The virulence of the organism and severity of the arterial infection are more important determinants than any single operative procedure or method of arterial reconstruction 通用删除6(英):<u>[29-32]</u>. When there is gross contamination from infected stent grafts， excision and extra-anatomical bypass is the treatment of choice. The argument in favor of extra-anatomic bypass is the theoretic advantage of reducing the risk of graft infection， because revascularization is generally performed in a location remote from the site of infection.\n\n【50】When contamination is less severe， the aorta may be replaced in situ. The choice of the ideal conduit is still controversial. Rifampin soaked grafts may prevent graft infection by reducing early graft seeding 通用删除6(英):<u>[28，31-33]</u>. Antibiotic-coated Dacron grafts presented an attractive adjunct. Prolonged anti-staphylococcal activity ofrifampin-bonded， gelatin impregnated Dacron grafts has been demonstrated after implantation in the arterial circulation， in experimental and human studies. Infection rates， as well as mortality and morbidity rates， are much lower for rifampin-treated grafts than for plain in situ graft replacement 通用删除6(英):<u>[34]</u>. Encouraging results have also been reported with the use of cryopreserved human allograft and silver coated polyester grafts 通用删除6(英):<u>[35]</u>. Other safe alternatives include autogenous superficial femoral vein grafts and cryopreserved arterial allografts36-39.\n\n【51】The duration of antimicrobial treatment in patients after removal of an infected aortic stent graft is controversial. No current guidelines exist on this issue and some authors suggest prolonging antibiotic administration until the C-reactive protein level has returned to baseline 通用删除6(英):<u>[40]</u>.\n\n【52】The immediate results of EVAR for Infected AAA are fair with no 30 days mortality and few complications. The midterm results are not satisfied due to high rate of infected stent grafts 33.33%(3/9). Endovascular treatment of Infected AAA is feasible and should be a durable treatment option； late infection-related complications do occur and are often lethal. EVAR could be considered a palliative treatment option， or a bridge to later elective radical open surgery， once the patient has recovered from the initial emergency.\n\n【53】Conclusions\n\n【54】Endovascular treatment of primary Infected AAA is feasible and for most patients a durable treatment option. EVAR is not a definitive treatment of Infected AAA； it could be a temporizing treatment prior to definitive open surgical repair， or a therapeutic alternative in critically ill patients who may not survive open surgery. T SU Late infections-related complications do occur； often lethal， need long-term antibiotic treatment and follow-up. In those cases， EVAR could be considered a palliative option or a bridge to later elective open repair.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

It is commonly used to lower the risk of stroke and systemic embolism in non-valvular atrial fibrillation and for the treatment of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. In addition， it has recently been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) after the COMPASS trial， which showed a 24% risk reduction of maior cardiovascular events in patients with chronic coronary artery disease and peripheral artery disease 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. The most common adverse effect of Rivaroxaban is related to the increased risk of bleeding. We are reporting the sixth case of spontaneous splenic rupture caused by Rivaroxaban. Written permission to publish this case was obtained from the patient.\n\n【2】Case Presentation\n\n【3】A 66-year-old gentleman with a background of hypertension and chronic atrial fibrillation， treated with Enalapril 20 mg (two times daily)， Bisoprolol 5 mg (once a day) and Rivaroxaban 20mg (once a day)， was admitted to the Emergency Department with abdominal pain， nausea， and vomiting. He was a smoker but denied any alcohol intake.\n\n【4】On examination， he was tachycardic (115 bpm)， hypotensive (BP 70/50 mmHg)，had abdominal distention with tenderness in the epigastrium and left hypochondrium. Fluid resuscitation was commenced with crystalloids，and a Noradrenaline infusion was started via a PICCline (Peripherally Inserted Central Venous Catheter). Initial blood tests revealed Hemoglobin (Hb) of 11 g/dL with a normal platelet count (150.000/pL)， and a coagulopathy [Prothrombin Time (PT) 43%， INR 1.93， activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT) 50 sec and fibrinogen 1.43 g/dL)]. Arterial blood gas sampling confirmed metabolic acidosis (pH 7.22， PO， 93 mmHg and PCO， 35 mmHg) and a Computed Tomography (CT) of the abdomen/pelvis with intravenous contrast was undertaken， revealing a splenic rupture with a moderate hemoperitoneum . The patient re-affirmed there was no trauma prior to the onset of abdominal pain. A repeat full blood count was performed and confirmed a significant decrease in Hb(5.7 g/dL) and hematocrit (17.6%). Two units of Red Blood Cells (RBC) were transfused immediately， and the patient transferred to the operating room for emergency laparotomy and splenectomy.\n\n【5】An arterialline inserted prior to induction revealed severe hypotension (50/20mmHg) requiring administration of small boluses of intravenous Adrenaline (5 ug +5 ug). General anesthesia was initiated with a rapid sequence induction (Etomidate 18 mg， Fentanyl 150 ug， Rocuronium 80 mg). Intubation was uneventful， and anesthesia was maintained with Sevoflurane and Remifentanil. A percutaneous sheath introducer with a 8.5 French was inserted under US guidance into the right internal jugular vein to facilitate rapid administration of blood products. Four units of RBC and three units of Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP) in addition to 500 mL of colloids and 500 mL of crystalloids were required during surgery aiming to stabilize the patient and reverse the coagulopathy. A total splenectomy was performed， and after safe extubation in the operating room， was transferred to the intensive care unit. His postoperative course was uneventful and successfully discharged home seven days later.\n\n【6】Discussion\n\n【7】Rivaroxaban has a rapid onset of action with a relatively predictable pharmacokinetic profile and a relatively short plasma half-life making initiation， maintenance， and discontinuation of anticoagulant therapy considerably more comfortable than with traditional oral anticoagulants. It is highly protein-bound (92% to 95%) with renal excretion at 36%， and in contrast to other new anticoagulants as Dabigatran， dialysis is not effective for its removal.\n\n【8】Table 1： Management of bleeding secondary to Rivaroxaban.\n\n【9】Rivaroxaban Moderate bleeding： action Severe bleeding： action\n\n|  | Fluid replacement.

There is， at present， no consensus on the best methodology for assessing Rivaroxaban activity in vivo and hence no guiding dosage. Unlike traditional oral anticoagulants， traditional coagulation tests cannot be used to assess or adjust dosing. At therapeutic concentrations， Rivaroxaban has a relatively weak influence on the PT；however， it is more profound at higher concentrations， with a good correlation between prolongation of the PT and plasma concentration.\n\n【13】Although hemorrhage iiss the significant adverse effect of Rivaroxaban， unfortunately， there is no immediate reversal agent currently available. Although Andexanet alfa has been approved by the FDA， for reversal of anticoagulation in life-threatening or uncontrolled bleeding in patients treated with Rivaroxaban， it is not available in many countries. Therefore， other measures should be taken to treat significant hemorrhage .\n\n【14】Conclusion\n\n【15】Rivaroxaban's datasheet details no reference to spontaneous splenic rupture due to its use； however， this is the sixth case report of spontaneous splenic rupture in a patient， with no history of trauma， treated with Rivaroxaban.\n\n【16】A pharmacologic interaction could be the potential cause of an increase in activity ofRivaroxaban resulting in major hemorrhage. An interaction between amlodipine and telmisartan/hydrochlorothiazide删除1换行was reported as a cause of hemorrhage in a previous case report 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>.

High morbidity and mortality are the characteristics of nosocomial infections caused by Acinetobacter spp.， which included urinary tract， skin and soft tissue infections， pneumonia and bacteremia especially in patients with severe health condition通用删除6(英):<u>[1-3]</u>. The antimicrobial resistance in this nosocomial pathogen is mainly caused by B-lactamase inactivating enzymes， alteration of membrane porin channels and mutation that changes cellular function 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. Widespread dissemination of A. baumannii infections， which are resistant to B-lactam antibiotics particularly to the 3rd generation of cephalosporin’s and carbapenems， has become a globally significant problem 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. Extended- Spectrum B-Lactamases (ESBLs) are enzymes that confer resistance to penicillin’s， 3d generation cephalosporin’s， monobactams and determined by CTX-M，TEMand SHV genes 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. These enzymes are mainly plasmid mediated and most are parts of the TEM and SHV families 通用删除6(英):<u>[5，7]</u>.ESBLs play an important role in resistance against later generation cephalosporin such as cefepime， Cefotaxime and ceftazidime 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>. Concerning the emergent importance of ESBLs in antibiotic resistance and its effect on treatment failure， this study was led to assess antibiotic sensitivity patterns of studied strains and determine the prevalence of CTX-M， TEM and SHV genes in A. baumannii strains isolated from tertiary care hospital in Mymensingh.\n\n【11】Materials and Methods\n\n【12】删除13:<u>an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License， which permits unrestricted use， distribution， and reproduction in any medium， provided the original work is properly cited.</u>\n\n【13】This cross sectional observational type of study was conducted in the Department of Microbiology of Mymensingh Medical College (MMC) over a period of 1 year from March 2019to February 2020 after getting approval from Institutional Review Board (IRB) of MMC.

It has been the object of growing interest since its frequency tends to augment as life expectancy has increased globally considered. In this work， we study the eventual neuroprotective effect of Progesterone (P) injected a few days before establishing a Reserpine (R) model of Parkinsonism in adult male rats. We focused on cognitive (Novel Object Recognition test； NOR)， affective (Forced Swimming Task； FST) and motor (Catalepsy Test； CT) outputs. We performed the appropriate tests along with the administration for two weeks of low doses of R. Our results show very clearly that P prevents the impairment of several tasks regarding the deleterious effects of R， without affecting negatively other areas of the subject behavior. In total accordance with current information， we show here that P -in particular- and neuroactive steroids -in general- are promising molecules to delay diverse manifestations of neurotransmitters depletion.\n\n【2】Keywords： Progesterone； Neuroactive steroids； Parkinsonism； Neuroprotection； Male rats\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Parkinson's disease is a threatening health problem in the world. It is the second most common neurodegenerative disease 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Besides many advances in the management of the illness， it remains complicated 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. This is so -at least in part-because what was once the hallmark of the disease， the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra， has since changed to consider the disease as a multi-systemic degenerative process involving several pathways， structures and neurotransmitters通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. Ongoing research is highly interested in the possibility of using neuroprotective drugs to avoid the damages of the disease or at least delay them long enough to give the patient a better quality of life.\n\n【5】Neuroactive steroids are a well-known set of molecules that comprise steroids from any source that show effects on the Central Nervous System (CNS). Among them， there are a group of neuroactive steroids-collectively named neurosteroids- that are synthesized the novo in the CNS， and that exert autocrine and paracrine effects only 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. Both groups of molecules have a renowned target as putative molecules regarding neuroprotection. Progesterone (P) is one of the major players among them 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. Parkinson’s disease remains elusive in terms oftreatment， being one major reason that the disorder， once thought as merely a motor illness， is a complex set of signs and symptoms that involve cognitive， affective and motor expressions 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. Today， a major goal is to recognize early subtle behavioral (cognitive， affective and motor) signs of malfunctioning to promptly begin with the treatment.\n\n【6】There are several animal models of Parkinsonism that have proved to be very useful in researching several essential aspects of the disease， from behavior to molecules 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. In this work， we try to study whether or not P. could be eventually neuroprotective when administered just a few days before of injecting our subjects with severallow doses of Reserpine (R) 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. We selected R as our model since it affects not only dopaminergic neurons but also catecholamines and indoleamine as a whole 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. What was once a disadvantageous situation， today it has been reverted since the human disease involves a much more complex landscape that the mere loss of dopaminergic删除1换行neurons. Additionally， the method-comparatively- is a rapid way of establishing the deficits in the subiects and also testing the effects of putative protective molecules.\n\n【7】Methods\n\n【8】Subjects\n\n【9】Male Sprague-Dawley rats， 60 days old， and 450 g average weight were used. Animals were housed in groups of three individuals per cage. Room temperature was maintained at 22℃±2C， on a 12 h artificial light/dark cycle (light from 7：00 am to 7 pm). Commercial rodent food and water were provided ad libitum. All procedures were approvedbythelocal committee for care and use ofanimals in medical research (CICUAL， Facultad de Ciencias Medicas， Universidad Nacional de Cuyo， cicual@fcm.uncu.edu.ar)， and experiments were performed in accord with the National Institutes of Health guide for the care and use of laboratory animals.\n\n【10】Reagents and solutions\n\n【11】Reserpine (R) and Progesterone (P) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich St Louis MO， USA. R was diluted in glacial acetic acid (final concentration 0.5% acetic acid in distilled water) and subcutaneously administered (SC) at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg. P was dissolved in ether， benzyl alcohol was added， and finally， it was resuspended in corn oil. P administration was also SC， at a dose of 4 mg/kg.\n\n【12】Experimental design\n\n【13】The experimental protocol was carried out along 21 days， according to Figure 1. From day-5 to-1 animal received either a daily Intraperitoneal (IP) injection of sterile saline or an SC injection of P. On odd days from 1 to 13 animals received either daily reserpine or sterile saline according to the group . Catalepsy test was carried out on even days from 2 to 14. Novel Object Recognition test(NOR test) was performed on day 8， and Forced Swimming Test(FST) was performed on day 9.\n\n【14】At the beginning ， animals were randomly assigned to one of 4 groups (n=10 each) injected with： 1) Sham (S)， saline-saline；2) saline-reserpine (R)； 3) Progesterone-Reserpine (P+R)； and 4) Progesterone-Saline (P+S).\n\n【15】Reserpine model\n\n【16】Reserpine (R)， a monoamine depleting agent， is an ester alkaloid derived from Rauwolfia sp. root utilized initially for the treatment of hypertension 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. R was underused for years as a useful reagent to induce animal Parkinsonism since it was not selective for dopamine， the hallmark neurotransmitter whose lack by death of dopaminergic neurons in the substantial nigra was always considered to be the responsible for the pathophysiology of the illness， according to Jenner in 1989 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>. Today this is not the case anymore as different monoamines besides dopamine (noradrenaline， serotonin) and different nuclei besides the substantia nigra (raphe nuclei and locus coeruleus) are all known to be affected by the disease 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. Today， R is a well-established model to induce animal Parkinsonism 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>.\n\n【17】Catalepsy test\n\n【18】In the catalepsy test， the subject is placed in an unusual posture and then the observer measures the time that takes to the animal to correct this unusual posture 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>. We used a horizontal Plexiglass bar held between two vertical support bars located at 9 cm from a smooth surface. Animal's front limbs were positioned on the bar and the latency time to step down from the bar was recorded. Three trials were made per rat on each observation. Result for each observation删除1换行was the mean value. We establish catalepsy like behavior criteria， considered as immobility posture time. Maximum time allowed for the whole test was 180 sec.\n\n【19】Novel object recognition\n\n【20】The experiment was realized as described elsewhere 通用删除6(英):<u>[10，11]</u>. Briefly， the apparatus consisted of a wooden box (70 cm x 45 cmx30 cm) with a white acrylic floor. It was located in an isolated testing room that was dimly lit by constant indirect illumination from the primary source， a 25 Wlight bulb suspended over the box. The objects utilized as familiar (previously experienced object) or unfamiliar(object not previously experienced， i.e. the novel one) were three copies of a pink truncated pyramid and a grayish-opaque candlestick of approximately the same size， all of them heavy enough to prevent accidental displacement by the subjects.\n\n【21】The animals were allowed to get used to the experimental room for at least 1 h. The day before training， each animal freely explored the apparatus with no objects for 2 min. A training session (T1) was followed by a test session (T2) 24 h later. During the training session， animals were placed in the arena containing two identical objects(pink truncated pyramids). In the test session， a familiar object was changed for an unfamiliar one (grayish opaque candlestick). Both training and test stages were 3 min each. The position of the objects(familiar and unfamiliar) and the extreme of the box used to place the objects were randomly exchanged for each experimental animal to avoid the use of potential confounding spatial clues. Exploration was defined as the orientation ofthe animal’s snout toward the object within a range of 2 cm or less from the object. Running around the object or sitting on it was not recorded as exploration. The objects and floor were carefully cleaned with ethanol (10%) after each trial to equate olfactory cues. The experiments were recorded with a camcorder digital camera JVC Everio GZ-MG330 (Japan) using a black and white recording mode to improve the register. The measures in the object recognition test were as follows： 1) total time spent by the subject exploring both objects during training (T1)； 2) total time spent by the subject exploring just the novel object during T2； and 3) discrimination index， the difference between time spent exploring unfamiliar and familiar objects during T2.\n\n【22】Forced swimming test\n\n【23】The FST was slightly modified from the original one 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>. The device consists of a plexiglass cylinder 38 cm in diameter and 60 cm in height. The cylinder contained water at 25C， 45 cm in height. Rats were individually introduced into the cylinder for 5 min and removed to be dried before returning them to their home cages. The test was videotaped . The following parameters were scored：1) Immobility time： time spent with the head above the water surface， and the necessary movement to maintained it； 2) swimming time： movements through the apparatus with front limbs inside the water； 3) climbing time： Movements with the front limbs against the cylinder wall； and 4) diving： Events of exploratory movements under the water with all the body submerged\n\n【24】Statistical assays\n\n【25】All data were analyzed by a one-way ANOVA test followed by a Tukey post hoc test and expressed as the mean ± SEM. A value of p<0.05 was considered statistically significant.\n\n【26】Results\n\nIn the present work， when compared to another study 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>， relatively small but repeated doses of R (0.1 mg/Kg) were used to|删除段之间换行|C= Control group； R=Reserpine group； P=P group； P+R=P plus reserpine group. Results are expressed as mean ±SEM. p<0.05， \"p<0.01，p<0.001.删除1换行obtain subtle but reliable motor changes as well as cognitive and affective ones. In this sense， we were able to induce Parkinsonism signs in our subjects since all of the animals treated with R developed changes in each of the testing conditions.\n\n【28】These changes included： a) More time spent in the bar during the catalepsy test， indicating a definite impact on motility， particularly from day 10 of R treatment until reaching a peak on day 14 ； b) subjects significantly spent less time swimming during the forced swimming task， which is a clear indication of what is known as a \"depression\" like behavior in rodent models when compared to controls without treatment or subjects treated with P alone . The diving activity was measured by the number of accumulated events. Control group made 21 dives， while in the reserpine group we observe only 4 events.\n\n【29】Reserpine group previously treated with progesterone obtained a cumulative result of 11 dives， while for the group treated only with progesterone the cumulative result was 16 dives； c) also in the删除1换行recognition of the novel object during the test， controls， and P alone treated subjects did not have any problem at all in recognizing the new object. On the other hand， R treated subjects， nonetheless spending the same total amount of time in exploratory behavior -also a clear indicator of what is supposed to be expected from animals that did not suffer from any lack of motivation and/or translation problems ignored the condition of new object during the test day， indicating an impact on memory， a cognitive component of the model. These results， when taken together， allow us to consider our subjects as a valid model of monoamine depletion. By extension also as a modelofpremotor and motor signs of Parkinsonism， suitable for being used to study eventual neuroprotection by the neuroactive steroid P.\n\n【30】Discussion\n\nRegarding P， it was striking the effect when administered for five days before the injections of R. In fact， in every condition tested， P. prevented the impairment of all the components previously|删除段之间换行|C =Control group； R=Reserpine group； P=P group； P+R=P plus reserpine group. Results are expressed as mean ±SEM. Swimming time in seconds. p<0.01，“p<0.001.\n\n【32】Several papers stress the importance of sex steroids and neurosteroids as neuroprotective factors 通用删除6(英):<u>[14，15]</u>. Men are more susceptible than women to Parkinson's disease， at least until women reach menopause 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>， which is highly suggestive for a role of sex steroids like estrogen 通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>. Moreover， steroid hormones synthesized by the brain have been shown to display neuroprotective properties eventually useful for the prevention and treatment of删除1换行neurodegenerative diseases 通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u>. Probably， what it is particularly interesting here are twofold：1) the validity of reserpine as a reagent suitable for generating a deficit constellation in rodents that remembers what happens -at least in part- in Parkinson's disease. It does so relatively quickly when compared to another method通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>， and it does consistently every time according to our results. Additionally， the whole picture is reversible when R is discontinued； and 2) P. prevented impairments in all areas-again consistently-when administered for a short time before R administration. There are advantageous animal models of Parkinsonism that are widely used 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. However， all of them involved some cumulative changes and cell death with compensatory changes as well. In this work， we show short bursts of P. before Rtreatment， and a short Rtreatment to induce the reported malfunctions.\n\n【33】Parkinson's disease is a very complex disorder in which probably many factors contribute to the onset and later stages of the disease通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>. At present， there is no single successful treatment to stop the progression of the illness 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>. As such it results interesting the possibility of addressing the role of several treatments at once acting synergistically to prevent neuronal death or restore brain damage. In this sense -among others- gonadal steroid hormones have been shown to result promising. As we mentioned earlier， since women are less prone than men to present Parkinson's disease 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u> at least until menopause- it looks promising to think about gonadal steroids as putative candidates to be one of the combined strategies to treat the disease. In fact， and besides that estrogens have been less contradictory that progestin's in showing beneficial effects， P also has been reported to be useful 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>. In our lab， treatment with P. for 3 days after 6-OHDA injections improved behavioral targets as well as normalized glutamatergic and dopaminergic activities通用删除6(英):<u>[11，18]</u>. However， here we are dealing with acute effects， instead of the chronic model of neuronal death by 6-OHDA， which poses the question of that， apparently， at least， we could talk of dysfunctional neurons here more than dead cells. Since one of the possible targets of Parkinson’s disease is neurotrophic factors 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>， it would be possible that P. before administration of reserpine could -acting quickly- exert their protective effect on membrane progesterone receptors， stimulating neurotrophic factors， such as BDNF. In our lab we have seen an increase in BDNF levels in response to administration of allopregnanolone， an endogenous neurosteroid derived from progesterone that acts as a GABAA positive allosteric modulator (unpublished data). Since nigral Dopamine (DA) neurons are sensitive to several neurotrophic factors (BDNF among them) it would not be impossible to think of P as inducing an increase of such neurotrophic factors and then， preventing DA neurons of becoming dysfunctional and hence， avoiding the potential proinflammatory damage of reserpine. Interestingly， Jarras et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u> reported that in mice gut -gastrointestinal symptoms are also common in Parkinsons disease- lesioned with 1-Methyl-4-Phenyl-1，2，3，6-Tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) they showed neuroprotection and immunomodulation of DA neurons (they had previously shown also neuroprotection in brain DA neurons；通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u>).\n\n【34】In brief， we suspect (being careful of taking into account the great complexity ofthe first motor disorder in human beings) that， at least in early stages ofthe disease there could be a possible proinflammatory situation enhanced by some kind of oxidative stress that would be deleterious for-among others-DA neurons in substantia nigra. Based on the evidences， we suggest that neurotrophic factors could protect the neurons under dysfunctional state. In this sense， P. could be in删除1换行part responsible for stimulating such trophic factors； however， more studies become necessary to test this hypothesis. Actual efforts are underway to increase our understanding in this devastating disease.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

Although SARS-CoV-2 is known to be responsible for primary pulmonary disease， including pneumonia and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome(ARDS)， many extrapulmonary manifestations of COVID-19 have been detected by clinicians 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. We report a metabolic acidosis due to ketoacidosis in an eglycemic diabetic patient with COVID-19pneumonia.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 55-year-old woman applied to emergency unit with fever and cough. She had a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus， obesity and hypertension. Her blood glucose was regulated with oral anti-diabetic drugs at home. At the time of hospital admission her blood glucose was： 248 mg/dL， creatinine： 0.62 mg/dL， CRP： 127.62 mg/L，leukocyte： 4630 (lymphocyte： 730). Her D-dimer：and procalcitonin results were detected 305 ng/mL and 0.14 respectively. Her infection was due to coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV-2) infection that confirmed by computed tomography of chest  in connection with a positive Reverse-Transcriptase-Polymerase-Chain-Reaction in line with(RT-PCR) assay. In the absence of another etiology， we concluded she had pneumonia possibly associated with COVID-19 infection， and started on Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) 400 mg per day and ceftriaxon 1 gr twice daily. Due to higher D-Dimer levels， low molecular weight heparin4000 unit per day subcutaneously was also added to her treatment regimen. On the sixth day of admission her dyspnea， shortness of breath， repetitive cough with fever were worsened and she was transferred to intensive care unit. Treatment was continued with favipiravir， piperacillin-tazobactam and low molecular weight heparin. On the seventh day her venous blood gas analysis as follows； pCO2 was 20.2 mmHg； pH was 7.28； HCO3 was 10.5 mmol/L.， serum lactate was 1.9； glucose was 151 mg/dL， creatinine： 0.53 mg/dL， sodium： 135； color： 104 mEq/L and anion gap： 20.5. Her blood glucose monitoring was done and glucose levels were between 150 mg/dL to 200 mg/dL； glucose was negative and ketone was +3 in her urine test. On the ninth day of hospitalization her dyspnea progressed and she had hypoxemia consistent with respiratory failure. Thus， she was intubated her arterial blood gas analysis as follows； pO2 was 54.3 mmHg， pCO2 was 48.1 mmHg； pH was 7.22 HCO3 was 19.4 mmol/L， serum lactat was 1.53； procalcitonin： 2.67. Kidney and liver functions were normal. Immune plasma treatment was also given to the patient. Her respiratory failure was improved during ICU follow up and then she was extubated. The patient was transferred to the service after 25 days hospitalization in ICU. Total 37 days of hospitalization she recovered and discharged from hospital.\n\n【7】Diabetes is the one of the most frequently detected comorbidities in patients infected with COVID-19. When current data are examined， increased risk of COVID-19has not been detected in diabetic patients compared to the general population. Nevertheless， diabetes mellitus can increase the risk of severe and critical forms of COVID-19， as a result of this the need for an intensive care unit and/or use ofinvasive mechanical ventilation might increase， with high mortality rates 31.\n\n【8】The clinical symptoms of COVID-19 infection vary but mainly cause fever and cough. Although mild upper respiratory disease and gastrointestinal disease are mostly observed in COVID-19 infection， severe viral pneumonia with systemic organ failure， or even death might be seen.\n\n【9】Recently some studies have reported that older age or medical comorbidities， such as cardiovascular disease， diabetes mellitus， hypertension， and obesity are risk factors for severe illness and mortality among patients with COVID-19 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. A few case reports also were published that COVID-19 may trigger acute hyperglycemic crises (DKA/HHS) in patients with inadequately controlled diabetes， as well as newly diagnosed diabetes 通用删除6(英):<u>[5，6]</u>. In a retrospective study from China， Li et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u> reported that； 42 (6.4%) patients admitted with COVID-19 had ketosis out of which 15 (35.7%) had diabetes. Three (20%) out of 15 patients with diabetes had DKA， five patients(26.7%) with diabetic ketosis died， and one of these (25%) presented with acidosis. Two (7.4%) and four (14.3%) of the non-diabetic ketotic patients developed severe acidosis and died， respectively， one of these (25%) presented with acidosis.

{"seq_id": "0a1755f1-aa16-41ae-8cb4-17d1cb8fddc0", "title": null, "text": "【0】Abstract\n\n【1】There are increasing in reports of mucormycosis in the post COVID-19 patients especially in India. Diabetes mellitus plays a vital role in both severe COVID-19 and mucormycosis. Our aim is to review a literature to find out the patient's characteristics having mucormycosis and COVID-19with the source of electronic database of Google Scholar and PubMed for the search of review. We have analyzed the data and characteristics of post COVID patients with mucormycosis Overall， we have collected 288 cases from 50 articles and analyzed. We additionally reviewed why this mucormycosis maiorly affects India and mentioned what are all the causes that affect in post COVID patients. The post-COVID patients with uncontrolled diabetes must be altered and aware with disease mucormycosis.\n\n【2】Keywords： Diabetes mellitus； Mucormycosis； Post-COVID patients； Electronic database\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Mucormycosis is a rare type of fungal infection that occurs through exposure to fungi called mucormycetes.These groups of fungi are commonly occurring in the environment， particularly in all plant surfaces， soil， compost and animal dung. The infection caused by fungi belonging to the order Mucorales. Mucormycetes can enter the body through breathing， inhaling and exposed wounds in the skin. Fungi that most commonly cause mucormycosis are Rhizopus sp， Mucor sp， Rhizomucor sp， Syncephalastrum sp， Cunninghamella Bertholletia， Apophysomyces sp and Lichtheimia sp. There are five types of mucormycosis， such as rhinocerebral (sinus and brain) infection in the sinuses that can spread to the brain. This is most common in people with uncontrolled diabetes and in people who have had a kidney transplant， pulmonary (lung) infection is the most common type of mucormycosis in people with cancer and in people who have had an organ transplant or a stem cell transplant， gastrointestinal mucormycosis is more common among young children than adults， especially premature and low birth weight infants less than 1 month of age， who had antibiotics， surgery or medications that lower the body's ability to fight germs and sickness， cutaneous (skin) mucormycosis occurs after the fungi enter the body through a break in the skin (after surgery， a burn， or other type of skin trauma). This is the most common form of mucormycosis among people who do not have weakened immune systems and disseminated mucormycosis occurs when the infection spreads through the bloodstream to affect other part of the body. The infection most commonly affects the brain， but also can affect other organs such as the spleen， heart and skin. For mucormycosis， precautions are debatable with respect to their efficacy in preventing these infections. But the main goal is prevention， which will require ensuring a good immune system， especially in those who are post-COVID-19. However strict monitoring of diabetes and avoiding dead/decaying organic matter will helps 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>.\n\n【5】The major risk factors for mucormycosis include uncontrolled diabetes mellitus in ketoacidosis， other forms of metabolic acidosis， treatment with corticosteroids， organ or bone marrow transplantation， neutropenia， trauma and burns， malignant hematologic disorders， and deferoxamine therapy in patients receiving hemodialysis 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. Higher rates of mucormycosis cases in India are due to a combination of COVID-19 and diabetes mellitus. For instance， more than 30million people in India have a diabetes diagnosis. While the country is still dealing with COVID-19pandemic， cases ofblack fungus or mucormycosis are on the rise in the country. Meanwhile， cases of white fungus and yellow fungus have also been reported from some parts of the country 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>.\n\n【6】However steroids reduce inflammation in the lungs for COVID-19 and appear to help stop some of the damage that can happen when the body's immune system goes into overdrive to fight删除1换行off coronavirus. But they also reduce immunity and push up blood sugar levels in both diabetics and non-diabetic COVID-19 patients. It's thought that this drop in immunity could be triggering these cases of mucormycosis. Unchecked level of blood sugar， abuse of steroids during COVID treatment is being considered as the reasons for this outbreak. Fighting the coronavirus can leave people's immune systems compromised or weakened， which means they may have a higher chance of developing mucormycosis 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>.\n\n【7】Black fungus is Mucor fungus Occiirs， when the immunocompromised patient comes in contact with the Mucor fungus， which spreads to the eyes， nose，lungs and skull cavity. Though non-contiguous， it can be deadly if not treated on time. It mainly affects lungs， respiratory system and digestive tract. White fungus is Candida fungus which begins from the tongue or private parts， it makes the patchy tongue white， and then it spreads to other parts like the lungs， brain and food pipes. It also affects face， nose， and eye orbit and skull tissue. The yellow fungus starts internally， causes pus leakage and leads to slow healing of wounds. In severe cases， it could further lead to organ failure and serious necrosis 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. The primary reason that appears to be facilitating Mucorales spores to germinate in people with COVID-19 is an ideal environment oflow oxygen，high glucose， acidic medium， high iron levels and decreased phagocytic activity of white blood cells due to immunosuppression (SARS-CoV-2 mediated， steroid-mediated or background comorbidities) coupled with several other shared risk factors including prolonged hospitalization with or without mechanical ventilators. Globally，the prevalence of mucormycosis varied from 0.005 to 1.7 per million populations， while its prevalence is nearly 80 times higher (0.14 per1000) in India compared to other developing countries， in a recent estimate of year 2019 to 2020. In other words， India has highest cases of the mucormycosis in the world 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. These prompted us to conduct a systematic review of published case reports of mucormycosis in people with COVID-19， to know overall characteristics of patients with its outcome. We additionally reported why this cause largely in India.\n\n【8】Diabetes Mellitus Impact on Mucormycosis\n\n【9】The lethal combination of high COVID-19 caseload in a country with around 70 million diabetes patients in India and when as part of dealing with COVID-19 steroids are administered. India is already having second largest population with diabetes mellitus and was the diabetes capital of the world， until recently. The probable reasons include a delay in diagnosis and the high cost of managing mucormycosis. Importantly， diabetes mellitus has been the most common risk factor linked with mucormycosis in India， with an overall mortality of 46% 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. The reason we are seeing such large number of mucormycosis than in any other country is because of the high number of diabetic patients， that too with uncontrolled diabetes， record number of COVID cases， large doses of steroids being administered for too long bordering onto indiscriminate use of steroids. To cause infection， these fungal spores will typically enter the respiratory tract through inhalation； however，they can also enter host cells through the skin as a result of trauma or through accidental ingestion. As previously mentioned， patients with diabetes mellitus are at the highest risk of developing mucormycosis 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>.\n\n【10】More specifically， the most frequent presentation of this fungal infection in patients with diabetes mellitus is rhino-orbital-cerebral mucormycosis. First and foremost， patients with diabetes mellitus often exhibit impaired innate and adaptive immunity， which increases删除1换行their susceptibility to anytype ofinfection，particularly mucormycosis， as this infection is rarely seen in non-immunocompromised hosts. Upon exposure to Mucorales spores， a competent immune system will send macrophages to engulf spores and prevent their germination. Comparatively， diabetes mellitus patients often have altered phagocytic pathways， thus rendering macrophages unable to phagocytize these spores. As a result， the free spores swell and form buds throughout the blood vessels of the respiratory tract. Although polymorph nuclear cells are recruited to these areas， these cells often exhibit an impaired function in diabetes mellitus patients， which limits their ability to prevent the proliferation of Mucorales. As a result， the fungal spores are able to extensively invade tissues and large blood vessels. In addition to the altered immune system in diabetes mellitus patients that allows for the proliferation of Mucorales fungi， both the iron and pH levels of diabetes mellitus patients can also contribute to the development of mucormycosis. When the pH of human serum is reduced， which often occurs in ketoacidosis， mucorales can disrupt the iron-binding capacity of transferrin. This disrupted function in transferrin， therefore， allows for free iron to be released into the serum， which can be readily used by the Mucorales spore to thrive in these environments通用删除6(英):<u> 7]</u>.\n\n【11】In addition， oxygen support for people with severe COVID-19can cause drying of the nasal cavity and further increase the risk of infection. The lack of immunity allows the fungus to spread， invade and destroy tissue. The recent pandemic of COVID-19 infection has led to a large number of people suffering severe illness， which has left them to have the following issues prolonged ICU stay， high blood sugars and prolonged oxygen use. Previously the patients were getting inflicted with these diseases. Amongst the diabetic patients， poorly controlled type II diabetes mellitus is the most common risk factor for mucormycosis， mainly from north to south India， with nearly half of them exhibiting ketoacidosis. It should be noted， however， that as confounding factors， renal failure and alcoholism related chronic liver disease have also been detected in patients along with diabetes in India. The probable reasons include a delay in diagnosis and the high cost of managing mucormycosis. Post coved patients with uncontrolled diabetes must be altered and aware with disease mucormycosis 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>.\n\n【12】Methods\n\n【13】A systematic literature survey was conducted through electronic database of Google Scholar and PubMed until November 194，2021 using keyword COVID-19， and Mucormycosis， Zygomycosis， Mucorales， Mucor and Rhizopus.Details of all the cases that reported mucormycosis in people with COVID-19 so far were retrieved. Characteristics of each patient was collected on excel sheet and analyzed 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>.\n\n【14】Results\n\n【15】Overall， we have collected 38 articles from the database of PubMed (30/50) and Google Scholar (20/50). A total of 288 cases of mucormycosis in people with confirmed COVID-19 were retrieved. Largely， 172 cases (59.72%) of mucormycosis in patients with COVID-19 were reported from India， followed by 52 cases (18.05%) from USA and 22 cases (7.63%) from Iran. Only 37 (12.84%) cases were reported from other parts of the world as shown in Table 1. Data from this study showed mucormycosis was predominantly seen in 209 male cases (72.56%)， and in female 79 cases (27.43%). Majority of the cases were recorder with diabetes mellitus and hypertension.\n\n【16】Table 1： Mucormycosis and COVID-19 cases reported in selected countries.\n\n| S.No  | Countries  | No. of Cases  | Percentage of cases (%)  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1  | India  | 172  | 59.72  |\n| 2  | USA  | 52  | 18.05  |\n| 3  | Iran  | 22  | 7.63  |\n| 4  | Egypt  | 16  | 5.55  |\n| 5  | Turkey  | 12  | 4.16  |\n| 6  | Europe  | 4  | 1.38  |\n|  | Spain  | 4  | 1.38  |\n| 8  | Pakistan  | 1  | 0.34  |\n\n【18】History of diabetes mellitus and intake of steroid for COVID-19 are the major reason for mucormycosis 通用删除6(英):<u>[51-58]</u>. Number of mortality was reported as 73 cases (25.34%) and case reports were shown in Table 2.\n\n【19】Discussion\n\n【20】number of cases in India seems to be alarmingly high， with uncontrolled diabetes being the most important risk factor. The risk factors for mucormycosis differ significantly amongst the developed and developing countries. Nearly 60% of the mucormycosis cases reported from India are in patients with uncontrolled diabetes， with or without Ketoacidosis. The distribution of risk factors varies across geographical regions， as uncontrolled diabetes is the most common underlying disease found in India studies. Mortality associated with mucormycosis in India is considerably high due to delays in seeking medical attention and diagnosing the disease， and challenges in managing the advanced stage of infection. The diagnosis is thus often delayed， which result in poor outcomes despite the availability of better diagnostic and therapeutic tools. Multidisciplinary approach is essential for prompt diagnosis and management of mucormycosis. It is necessary to study the role of newer antifungal agents such in the treatment of mucormycosis.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

The patient was kept in isolation room. On duty staff refused to care this patient. Staff reported fear about to get infected with tuberculosis. The incident was reported for nursing staff refusing to care Tuberculous (TB) patient in respiratory isolation room.\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Tuberculosis (TB) is a worldwide epidemic infecting approximately one-third of the world's population 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u> and according to WHO report， in 2015， over 10.4 million people got ill due to tuberculosis. Tuberculosis is responsible for 5.1% of the national disease burden in Pakistan and according to National Prevalence Survey report 通用删除7(英):<u>(2013)</u> the annual incidence of tuberculosis in Pakistan is 276/100，000 population for all ages and forms (National Tuberculosis Control Program， Pakistan).“Since 1990， the Tuberculosis incidence rate has dropped in most countries， as a result of investments that have been made and effective tuberculosis diagnosis and treatment have saved about 43 million lives between 2000 and 2014”(Cavalcante & Silva， 2016， p.2). The burden of tuberculosis patients creates an overall responsibility to care these patients on health professionals and especially on the nurses. However， the nurses reluctant to care these communicable disease patients due to fear of contracting disease， lack of appropriate knowledge about disease and lack of experience to care Tuberculosis patients 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. This is an ethical and moral dilemma for refusing to care patients suffering from tuberculosis and nurses have the professional obligation to provide care to all patients. So， this scenario has raised some questions； is it ethically permissible that nurses can refuse to care tuberculosis patients? Did nurses do right by refusing to care to tuberculosis patients? If so， how colud the ethics of care and ethics of justice be justified?\n\n【4】Ethical aspects of scenario\n\n【5】Nurses have violated the following ethical principles in the scenario：\n\n【6】The moral norms of ethics and morality\n\n【7】Nurses violated norms of moral practices in professional context (Normative ethics) and moral conduct， right， obligation， justification， morality and responsibility (Non-normative ethics) of providing care to Tuberculosis patients 通用删除6(英):<u>[3，4]</u>.\n\n【8】Violation of the principle of beneficences and non-maleficence\n\n【9】The nurses have violated the principle of Beneficences and according to this principle， it is the responsibility of nurse to maximize benefit to patients by providing due care'to patients. The nurses have inflicted harm by showing rejection， and let patients feel their concern of the possibility of contracting the disease 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>.\n\n【10】Violation of principle of justice-right to receive care\n\n【11】In this scenario the patients’right ofcare was violated\"Rights are justified claims that individuals can make on other individuals or on society. \"Having rights means to be in a position to determine， by having choices what others should or should not do”通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. In this scenario， the basic needs of basic nursing care of patients were not fulfilled during the “respiratory isolation\".\n\n【12】Violation of principle of respect for autonomy\n\n【13】Furthermore， in this scenario， the concept of respect ofautonomy was seen as individualistic and posing an impact of nurses own choice and action on patients of not providing care to Tuberculosis patients and nurses did not respect the need of care of these patients. Autonomy involves respecting the autonomous agents by acknowledging their rights to hold views， to make choices and take删除1换行decisions according to their values and believes 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>.\n\n【14】There are two positions to see the scenario from the lens of ethics.\n\n【15】Position one and arguments\n\n【16】Duty to care and professional obligation： According to the moral philosophy of Immanuel Kant， the moral responsibility of nurses to provide care to patients “does not change with changing disease”conditions 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. Furthermore， nursing code of ethics clearly states that nurses are required to provide due care to any one in need regardless of their personal beliefs， religion， creed. Providing care and treating these patients can make them recover from the Tuberculosis disease and they can have a healthy life to fulfill their roles and responsibilities adequately in the society. Therefore， nurses have professional Obligation to care Tuberculosis patients and the patients have a medical right to receive due care.\n\n【17】Position two and arquments\n\n【18】Self-autonomy of nurses； not providing care to tuberculosis patients： Nurses (as a healthcare provider) have right to refuse to care tuberculosis patients as self autonomy and it is their right for not doing care to these patients. But， it affects， the well being of patients under their care and in the profession nurses have professional obligation to provide care to all patients， while they have taken oath to care to all patients.\n\n【19】My position and arguments\n\n【20】Although， nurses are suppose to provide care based on ethical principles. But， some practices are observed as unethical acts， errors and negligence in the hospitals 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. After， internalizing the scenario， the refusal of care to Tuberculosis patients is one of example and there could be many more patients for which nurses are making choices and refusing to care 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. To maintain the standard of practice， nurses are obligated to care Tuberculosis patients and if it is not， so it is against the professional practices and hospital authority need to take necessary action to ensure nurse to full fill their professional responsibility to care to tuberculosis patients. The code of ethics justifies that providing care to Tuberculosis patients preserves the trust ofpatients and nurses should avoid refusal to care. According to Burkhardt et al. “dignity and autonomy of individuals， and allow all people equal consideration”. The ethics of justice asserted that nurses have professional responsibility to care Tuberculosis patients on the basis ofuniversal principles and rules and in an impartial and verifiable manner to ensure the fair and equitable treatment to them. According to ethics of care， the nurses need to provide the care to Tuberculosis patients in a harmonious way to full fill their needs 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>. The Tuberculosis patients require professional services in a culture of care and holism， and the nurses need to show involvement and empathy to these patients. However， providing care to Tuberculosis patients looks difficult task for some of nurses， but， refusal to care may leads to lack of care， malpractices， negligence and immediate correction of complex care issues may be delayed. Despite of that the guidelines are available to care Tuberculosis patients， but they are not practiced. These findings support my stance of nurse’s duty to care'to Tuberculosis patients and refusal to be avoided and hospital authority must organize appropriate actions for nurses to feel nurses that care is their duty and refusal to be avoided.\n\n【21】Counter arguments\n\n【22】On the other hand， nurses are right in their fear of getting Tuberculosis infection. Most of Tuberculosis patients are open carrier删除1换行to spread the infection to other people. When nurses are diagnosed of having Tuberculosis disease positive， they are moved to non-clinical area of not doing direct patient care， and future work opportunities extremelybecome narrowed down. In addition to that the nurses had reported repeated iatrogenic infections from work despite the correct use techniques of Personal Protective Equipments.\n\n【23】Justification of my position\n\n【24】I consider that my stand is ethically sound than the counter position because ultimately this position maintains balance between professional practices of nurses， patients right to receive fair care according to the ethics of care and justice， and the intention is doing good (beneficence) to patients and others. Nurses historically have accepted the risk of contagion， while caring patients with infectious diseases， whenever the value of care is considered important than any harm 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>. Furthermore， The nurses with more experience caring for infected patients were more willing to care for these patients， and the level of experience for caring people with communicable was not correlated with reported incidents of occupational Tuberculosis exposure risk 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>. Though， refusing to care is persistent problem and aim should be to harvest good and no harm to patients and nurses. Providing care to Tuberculosis patients is ethical but it is to be done with considerations for nurses as well， who fear due to lack of knowledge and experience to care these patients. Providing care to these patients fulfills the duty to care， sympathy improves trust， and does fairness. Subsequently， it is in the benefit of humanity and maintenance of quality and standard of practices of care.\n\n【25】Possible consequences\n\n【26】My stand point is strongly in the favor of obligation to care Tuberculosis patients and disciplining refusal of care， and justification with patients and professional practices with the use of infection prevention methods and airborne precautions. Some of the benefits of providing care to Tuberculosis patients are in favor of saving other patients and nurses for contracting the disease， avoiding psychological disorders due tuberculosis disease among patients for example depression，leaving the treatment， and suicidal attempt， due to stigma in the society. However， refusal to care may lead to increase disease burden， negative impression of profession and increase mortality and mobility rates and legal cases 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>.\n\n【27】Recommendations\n\n【28】The scenario has some specific and general recommendations.\n\n【29】The implication of my position for nurses is clear. It is necessary that Tuberculosis patients must receive due care and authority need to be more aware of links between moral dilemmas and the rights of provider to refuse to provide care to infected patients， including the nurses knowledge， training， and the extraordinary risk to the nurse to deal with infectious patients 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>. The refusal to care for patients is mainly due to three reasons as mention above. The first reason of nurses is the fear to contract infection. The best way to first to find out； what are fears， feelings and anxieties of the nurses about taking care of tuberculosis patients. The reasons keeping them away from caring these patients should be identified. The nurses need to be counseled and information should be provided to overcome the fear to contract infection. The nurses should be nurtured through the situation and the explanation to them that fears are unnecessary if proper precautions are taken.\n\n【30】The second reason of nurses to refuse to care to Tuberculosis删除1换行patients is lack ofcorrect scientificknowledge and experience. In most instances， new nurses do not feel comfortable in handling patients with communicable diseases. Independently caring for a patient with infectious disease could be a new and novel experience for many new nurses because of little exposure and information about the disease. An example is that a new nurse found to be saying that “I don't want to take Tuberculosis to home\". They fail to understand that the patient is terribly debilitated or immune- compromised. Therefore， orientation to new nurses to care Tuberculosis for experience and education about the disease and universal precautions， infection prevention methods and airborne precautions (use of a N95 respiratory and negative pressure ventilation rooms) to be discussed and it is observed that the refusal reverses after educating the staff. The nurses to be instructed to follow universal precautions， and correct use of personal protective equipment to avoid contracting infection with Tuberculosis infection. The new nurses can also be assigned to the Tuberculosis patients with experienced nurse to provide support/mentor for the situation after that the nurse can be assigned to the patient independently and the previous mentor to be available for a help ifneeded. The support must be available for the new nurse， who is trying to cope with the role stress of changing beliefs and values. The guidelines are available to prevent infection and senior nurses should monitor the performance of new nurses in order to overcome refusal to care 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>.\n\n【31】There are also some general recommendations in which hospital needs to design and introduce patient centered approaches that help proper strategic planning for Tuberculosis patients care needs. The hospital also need to protect the nurses from contracting the disease by having negative pressure isolation rooms， ensuring the availability of personal protective equipment， vaccinating the nurses against the disease. The hospital authorities， not only to develop infection control program， and regular surveillance， but also to conduct comprehensive analysis of performance of activities， expenditure and outcomes for Tuberculosis patients in the hospital. The hospital also have responsibility to provide general awareness (Health Education) to patients and families about disease， and care at home， such as isolation to controltransmission to avoid exposing other populations， such as children， pregnant women， and elderly people in the family通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u>.\n\n【32】Conclusion\n\n【33】In conclusion， the new nurses perceive that refusing to care for Tuberculosis patients is a safe way for them from getting infection of Tuberculosis disease. However， in reality the safe way to provide care to these patients with infection control methods and provide care to these patents with sense of duty and care and according to code of ethics. In such scenario， it becomes difficult for nurses to balance between selfautonomy and patient`s rights of care. So， being a nurse such issues should not be ignored. All ethical considerations删除1换行have their practical implications to such scenario. However， the main message for new nurses is to provide care to all patients，live and serve to humanity with compassion to care.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

There is reported significant negative association of semen volume， total sperm count， sperm motility， and morphology with advanced male partner’s age. Therefore， combination of the sperm preparation and assisted reproductive treatment were used for a better chance of pregnancy. This study was aimed to evaluate the in fluence of age on the sperm quality and pregnancy outcome in couple with subfertility undergoing Intrauterine Insemination (IUI).\n\n【2】Material and Methods： This retrospective cross-sectional study in vestigating 181 cases of IUI cycles from reproductive clinic of two public universities from January 2019 to December 2020. They were categorized into study group (male partner’s age 40 years and above) and control group (male partner’s age less than 40 years old). Sperm parameter reports were extracted from the patients records. Clinical pregnancy was the criteria for the IUI success.\n\n【3】Results： The mean age of male and female partners were similar in both groups. Sperm parameters showed an improvement after density gradient centrifugation sperm preparation with significant results in grade 1 and grade 3 sperm motility.

A man who failed to produce high quality sperm in terms of density， motility and morphology is considered as infertile male. There are increase rates of infertility and adverse pregnancy outcomes seen after the age of 40 years old (independent of female partner’s age)， thus the male age factor might have some contribution to this matter， even though the spermatogenesis known to continue in elderly men， in contrast to oogenesis 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. From the literature， contribution to conception by male partner is still occur ev after 40 years of sexual maturity 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. But， degenerative changes in germinal epithelium occur with aging， causing Leydig cells to reduce in quantity and its function， thus affecting the spermatogenesis process due to decrease testosterone level， in which it starts at 30 years ofage 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，3，4]</u>. Studies suggest that male partner's age is associated with diminished semen volume， sperm motility and/or sperm morphology. Increasing seminal ROS levels and changes in epididymal and accessory sex gland function may be possible causative factors for the decline in motility with aging. Emergence idea of intrauterine insemination with sperm preparation has shown some improvement in semen parameters but with conflicting data. In this respect， our objective is to established evidence on influence of age on the sperm quality and effect of density gradient centrifugation on pregnancy outcome in infertile couple undergoing Intrauterine Insemination (IUI).\n\n【8】This was a retrospective cross-sectional study involving two university hospitals in Malaysia删除1换行with fertility services. Completed one hundred and eighty-one IUI cycles from January 1， 2019 to December 31， 2020 were included in this study.\n\n【9】Couples who underwent IUI during the study period were enrolled in this study. Only the first IUI cycle of the couples were included in the study.\n\n【10】The inclusion criteria were as follow： Men age between 18 to 70years old， with semen analysis results either normal or one， or two of the sperm parameters were below the normal value established by the WHO 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. The semen parameters are the sperm count， sperm motility with characterized into Grade 1 (rapid and slow linear progressive motility)， Grade 2 (non-progressive motility) and Grade 3 (immotile spermatozoa). The female partner had regular menstrual cycle， normal pelvic ultrasound findings and at least one fallopian tube patent in hysteroscopy or laparoscopy dye insufflation test.\n\n【11】The exclusion criteria were including men with azoospermia， femalepartnerwith endometriosis，polycystic ovarian syndrome，poor ovarian responder， or premature ovarian insufficiency. Incomplete data on pre- and post-processing semen analysis or missing data regarding the pregnancy outcome were also being excluded.\n\n【12】All the data such as age of the couple， duration of infertility， semen analysis parameters before and after sperm processing， and the IUI results were obtained from the patient’s records. Pregnancy was defined as positive serum beta Human Chorionic Gonadotropin(b-HCG) taken at 14 days after IUI followed by presence of the fetal heart activity after 6 weeks period of a menorrhea.\n\n【13】The eligible couple were stratified into two groups according to the male partner’s age - study group (male partner’s age 40 years and above) and control group (male partner's age less than 40 years old). The semen parameters and pregnancy outcome were compared between the groups.\n\n【14】Semen sample collection and preparation for IUI\n\n【15】Semen samples were collected from the male partners following2 to 5 days of sexual abstinence by masturbation in sterile plastic containers at the clinic. Liquefaction was performed at roor temperature for 30 min. The initial analysis of the semen parameters(semen volume， sperm count， and sperm motility) was performed manually according to WHO guidelines 通用删除7(英):<u>(2010)</u> 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>.\n\n【16】Subsequently the semen samples were processed using the density gradient centrifugation to remove seminal fluid and enhance sperm quality for IUI. The total volume of semen was divided so that a 15-ml conical tube marked with patient's identification would contain2 ml of a 90% density lower layer， 2 ml of a 45% density upper layer， and 2 ml of semen upper most layer. A gentle and careful move was required to ensure the layers were not mixed-up at each centrifugal stage. The sample was then centrifuged at 1，500 rpm for 20 min at Room Temperature (RT). After centrifugation， the supernatant was removed and the spermatozoa (pellet) was placed into another 15-ml conical tube， which contained 2.0 ml of sperm rinsing medium and mixed thoroughly； it was then centrifuged at 1，500 rpm for 10 min at room temperature. The supernatant was again removed， and the final pellet was suspended in the same medium solution， obtaining a final volume of 0.5 ml. A 10-ul aliquot was used to perform the analysis of post-processing seminal parameters. The motility of spermatozoa in the sample determined and incubated sample at 37°C until ready for insemination. The Makler counting chamber was used to assess删除1换行the count and motility and the processed sample in the best possible way. The sample was ensured to maintain its temperature at 37°Cby placing it in a test tube warmer before IUI procedure.\n\n【17】Ovulation induction and insemination\n\n【18】Standard protocol was used involving administration of 100 mg clomiphene citrate from the second day of menstruation for five days and injection of human menopausal gonadotropins (75 IU to 150IU) on day five onwards up to day ten of menstruation， either daily or every other day. When at least one follicle achieved more than 17mm， intramuscular HCG 10，000 IU was given for final maturation. Single insemination was done at thirty-six hours later with 0.5 mL to 1.0 mL of processed sperm from the fresh semen sample， injected intrauterine using a Gynetics catheter. After the insemination the patient was lying in the supine position for 15 min to 30 min. Oral dydrogesterone 10 mg three times daily was prescribed for the luteal phase support.\n\n【19】Statistical analysis\n\n【20】The Statistical Package for Social Sciences for Windows 通用删除1(英):<u>(SPSS version 22.0)</u> was used to record and analyzed the data. Quantitative variables were compared using Mann-Whitney test and the results were expressed as mean ± Standard Deviation (SD) and percentage. Categorical variables were evaluated using the Chi-squareand Fisher's exact test. A p-value of less than 0.05 is considered as statistically significant.\n\n【21】Results\n\n【22】A total of 181 of IUI cycles， from January 15， 2019 and December31，2020， were analyzed. The mean (± Standard Deviation， SD) age of male and female partner included in this analysis were similar for each group. Majority of the indication for the IUI was unexplained infertility .\n\n【23】Table 2 showed the results of sperm parameters of the two studied groups. As can be noted， there was no difference of sperm parameters among the male partner with different age groups. There was an improvement in the sperm concentration and Grade 1 sperm motility after the DGC， however not statistically significant. In the study group (male age 40 years and above)， there is significant increment in the grade 1 sperm motility and significant reduction of immotile sperm after GDC as illustrated in Table 3. Regarding the successful pregnancy， there was also no significant difference of the semen parameters between the studied group . The number of pregnancies was higher in group of male partner less than 40years old， compared with older age male partner，however， it was not statistically significant .\n\n【24】Discussion\n\n【25】Semen fluid analysis is the first step in the evaluation of male infertility. Semen characteristics that being evaluated includes the volume， sperm concentration， sperm motility， and sperm morphology. The standard value of semen analysis that is accepted by the World Health Organization (WHO) 2010 is the volume of1.5 mL， pH of 7.2， sperm concentration of 20 million/mL or more， total motility (progressive and non-progressive) of 40%， and normal sperm morphology of 4% 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>.\n\n【26】There was an association between male age and sperm parameters in the literature. Decrease in sperm quantity except for concentration was more compelling among men aged 30 to 50 years old 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. A similar删除表格换行study by Stone et al. affirmed that decrease in semen parameter starts at the age of 34 and it postulated to affect the pregnancy status 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>. In conjunction， study in Central India by classified age 36 to 42 as under the 3d group in a five-age class (21 to 60 years) that is relates with the decline in semen parameters and it is significant when the individual is after the age of 35通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Meanwhile， Gao et al. revealed a significant association between the increasing age and a drop in sperm quantity and quality based on 7-age groups among men aged25 to 51 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>. The large dispersion also believed to derive this smaller删除1换行number of groupings to elucidate age as factors in differentiating the sperm counts. This study showed better sperm motility of the younger male compared to the older male who aged more than 40years old. Therefore， testing the subjects with different age level may validate the influence of age on semen parameters at certain degree of comparison.\n\n【27】Table 1： Demographic characteristics.\n\n| Variables  | Male 40 years and above N=31通用删除7(英):<u>(100)</u>  | Male less than 40 years N=150通用删除7(英):<u>(100)</u>  | p value  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Age， mean ± SD  |  |  |  |\n| Male  | 43.32±3.15  | 33.60±3.35  | <0.01  |\n| Female  | 38.39±2.79  | 33.08±3.86  | <0.01  |\n| Indication of IUI，N(%)  |  |  |  |\n| Anovulation  | 5(16.13)  | 30(20.00)  |  |\n| Tubal factor  | 6(19.35)  | 8(5.33)  |  |\n| Unexplained infertility  | 11(35.48)  | 68(45.34)  |  |\n| Male factor  | 7(22.58)  | 30(20.00)  |  |\n| Recurrent miscarriage  | 1(3.23)  | 0通用删除7(英):<u>(0)</u>  |  |\n| Discordant couple  | 0通用删除7(英):<u>(0)</u>  | 3(2.00)  |  |\n| Others (ED， vaginismus)  | 1(3.23)  | 11(7.33)  |  |\n\n【29】IUl： Intrauterine Insemination； ED： Erectile Dysfunction\n\n【30】Table 2： Sperm parameters of the between two different male age group.\n\n| Sperm parameters  | Male 40 vears and above N=31  | Male less than 40 yearsN=150  | p value  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Sperm concentration (x10)， mean ± SD  | 73.19±46.64  | 69.96±52.23  | 0.75  |\n| Motility G1 (%)， mean ± SD  | 41.12±16.74  | 41.74±21.39  | 0.86  |\n| Motility G2 (%)，mean ± SD  | 17.61±8.28  | 21.44±11.71  | 0.85  |\n| Motility G3 (%)， mean ± SD  | 41.14±18.56  | 36.93±18.92  | 0.26  |\n\n【32】G1： Grade 1 (progressive rapid and slow linear)， G2： Grade 2 (non-progressive linear)， G3： Grade 3 (immotile)\n\n【33】Table 3： The effect of Density Gradient Centrifugation (DGC) on sperm parameters of each group.\n\n| Semen parameters  | Male 40 years and above， N=31  |  |  | Male less than 40 years，N=150  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Semen parameters  | Pre-DGC  | Post-DGC  | p value  | Pre-DGC  | Post-DGC  | p value  |\n| Sperm concentration (x10)， mean ± SD  | 73.19±46.64  | 78.74±61.41  | 0.60  | 69.96±52.23  | 87.47±70.81  | <0.01  |\n| Motility G1 (%)，mean ± SD  | 41.12±16.74  | 77.50±14.41  | <0.01  | 41.74±21.39  | 77.46±19.89  | <0.01  |\n| Motility G2 (%)， mean ± SD  | 17.61±8.28  | 13.11±10.93  | 0.03  | 21.44±11.71  | 13.87±12.60  | <0.01  |\n| Motility G3 (%)， mean ± SD  | 41.14±18.56  | 8.92±5.21  | <0.01  | 36.93±18.92  | 8.64±12.07  | <0.01  |\n\n【35】G1： Grade 1 (progressive rapid and slow linear)， G2： Grade 2 (non-progressive linear)， G3： Grade 3 (immotile)\n\n【36】Table 4： Semen parameters between the groups with successful pregnancy after Density Gradient Centrifugation (DGC).\n\n| sperm parameters  | Male 40 years and aboveN=3  | Male less than 40 yearsN=6  | p value  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Sperm concentration (x109)， mean ±SD  | 64.33±59.80  | 80.47±110.19  | 0.82  |\n| Motility G1， mean ± SD  | 55.43±30.91  | 86.35±16.16  | 0.08  |\n| Motility G2， mean ± SD  | 29.57±28.65  | 3.6±2.10  | 0.26  |\n| Motility G3， mean± SD  | 15.00±3.22  | 8.4±16.38  | 0.53  |\n\n【38】G1： Grade 1 (progressive rapid and slow linear)， G2： Grade 2 (non-progressive linear)， G3： Grade 3 (immotile)\n\n【39】Table 5： Reproductive outcome of intrauterine insemination procedure between the groups.\n\n| Reproductive outcome  | Male 40 vears and above N=31  | Male less than 40 vearsN=150  | p value  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Pregnancy  | 3  | 6  | 0.19  |\n| No pregnancy  | 28  | 144  | 0.19  |\n\n【41】Most of the finding showed an increase of the mean value in the count and motility. The significant difference was obtained in the study mostly in the post DGC for Grade 3 motility (immotile删除1换行sperm) suggesting positive effect of DGC on semen motility. Density gradient is the preferred technique for sperm processing for ART as it improved sperm motility and quality 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>. This study also highlighted the higher chance of pregnancy in female with the male partner who aged less than 40 years old， control group (3.3%) compared to female with male partner aged more than 40 years old. It showed that as the age of the couple grows older， the likelihood of pregnancy decreases， and most studies link aging to a drop in sperm parameters 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>.\n\n【42】On a separate note， Dong et al. concluded that chances of pregnancy from IUI decreases as semen sample contained lower than 2 million motile sperm 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>. Thus， other studies specified that pregnancy from IUI is more probable with the existing of linear progressive motile among pairings with subfertility male with the higher likelihood of pregnancy from larger counts of post-prepared sperm with greater motility in IUI 通用删除6(英):<u>[13，14]</u>. In addition， Ajayi et al. suggested than men with lower sperm counts had a 4 times higher likelihood to develop progressive sperm motility than men with normal sperm counts 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>. Somehow， Ombelet et al. reviewed that studies should consider association of sperm parameters with other factors that may determine the success of IUI such as female age and period of subfertility. In addition， they iterate that prediction on pregnancy rate is acceptable yet considered as poor in sensitivity as comparison made with standardized limit sperm counts classing. Perhaps this study may output to different significance if sperm counts categorized in to non-parametric groupings for comparison with the nominal measure of pregnancy status. For the time being， this study suggests that IUI has done effectively in ensuring pregnancy from samples with lower sperm counts from pre-processed total or from post-processed non-progressive spermatozoa that originates from men below 40 years old. On the other side， female may conceive offspring in relation with lower counts of motile sperm or higher counts of immotile sperm after the post wash procedures conducted for semen samples of men aged 40 and above 通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>.\n\n【43】Readings of bHCG level recorded pregnancy outcome either pregnant or not were insignificantly correlated with male age group as a result from IUI denoted from Fisher's Exact Test p-value of 0.185. This hypothesis in several manner is consistent with findings from other study with differing fertilization procedures that remarks male age as not a defining factors of pregnancy rates or outcome 通用删除6(英):<u>[17-20]</u>. On the other hand， Tatsumi et al. described age among men does not correlate with pregnancy outcome， yet simulation from IUI revealed women at the age of 38 to 40 years old as the sole factor influencing chances of pregnancy 通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u>.\n\n【44】Conclusion\n\n【45】In conclusion， similar semenparameters andcomparable pregnancy outcome was seen among couples with male partner's age below and above 40 years old. There was an improvement in sperm parameters after density gradient centrifugation which may involve in the achievement of pregnancy following IUI. This study is limited to sperm count and motility without analysis of morphology and sperm DNA， therefore further study with these added sperm parameters and larger sample could be considered in the future study.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

This big data is of very important for designing the new drug product but it is very difficult to extract the information manually from this huge source. Now days a new ways of data mining and processing are on focus of the scientists such as Machine Learning (ML)， Deep Learning(DL) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). Therefore， in the era of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer revolution， the conventional methods of product design seem to be irrelevant as personalized medicines are now getting more attention. Now the conventional approach of “one drug-fits all”have been replacing by the “customizable dosage forms\" based on the individual needs. So a large scale updation of pharmaceutical sector is indeed required to adopt for innovative engineering and processing methods of formulation development. Induction of computer simulation and computational approaches such as Quality by Design (QbD) concept， statistical analysis and simulation software's now shifted the paradigm from lab-based research to in-silico research where majority of the research activities related to product development are performed on the computer simulated mathematical models with high degree of accuracy covering the interaction of all the process variables. In silico approach eliminates the irrelevant sets of experiments and only provides the best suitable ones using AI based simulated model. The areas of application of AI approach in formulation development can be formulation optimization and pharmacokinetic evaluation as discussed one by one in the coming sections. The data of physicochemical properties of the different drugs， chemicals and excipients is stored in the AI enabled computer software. The AI algorhythm in the computer system find the expected results of the mutual interaction ofany given set of excipients and drug by the aid of algorhythm based mathematical calculations and predict the characteristics of the resulting formulation. Here we can optimize the formulation for the desired results as defined by the QbD tools by varying the concentrations of the excipients without performing the actual experimentation. Statistical tools such as Central Composite Design (CCD)，box-behnken design or others provide us with the different formulations with the varying concentration ranges of polymers which may have the desired and optimized formulation. Using computer algorhythm a blend of raw materials can be designed based on the physical and chemical properties ofthe drug and excipients to produce the product with desired characteristics. This saves the cost and time of research and increase the confidence on the quality of product. The customization of the dosage forms based on the individual needs is also possible through in-silico approach. The customization is done to adjust the pharmaceutical， pharmacokinetic and therapeutic characteristics of the product as per the need of the individual patients i.e.， based on the behavior of the drug in individual patients due to different genetic makeup and different body physiology. AI based evaluation of pharmacokinetics parameters is the necessary and important part of the formulation development as it reduces the attrition rate and failure of drug compounds during the clinical studies. AI based techniques predicts the ADME profile of the drug in a particular dosage form that not only help in drug optimization but also in drug repurposing. Establishing an In Vitro-In Vivo Correlation (IVIVC) predicts the pharmacokinetic behavior of the drug inside the body in earlier phase of the study before going in to the actual experimentation. In this manner a product can be designed from initial step to final optimized formulation using the computer simulated algorhythm. After validation of the final design， the product is developed in the lab and tested for its characteristics to check if these are as per the given specifications or not", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "df035619-dda7-432b-a0c8-4c89181d811a", "title": null, "text": "【0】Abstract\n\n【1】After surgery， intra-abdominal intestinal adhesions present a big problem that is not solved yet. The formation of adhesions begins at the moment when the discontinuity of the peritoneal integrity occurs and the endocrine metabolic response is initiated at a cellular level to repair the defect caused in the peritoneum's surface. However，preventing adhesions from forming in the abdominalportion is considered to be a correlation， from the moment of the execution of the techniques to the total recovery of the patient. Containment measures and the best healing of the tissue can be applied， such as； the use of bio-resorbable membranes and specific dressings emphasized in this analysis. Ensuring stability and a lower probability of the development of the tissular adhesion.\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Intraperitoneal Adhesions constitute an important cause of postoperative complications in patients undergoing abdominopelvic surgery， including infertility， intestinal obstruction， and chronic pelvic pain， making explicit a high potential for morbimortality 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Directly correlated to the intestinal microbiota and the correlation between the human tissues of healing， the abundant production ofa fibrous repair tissue can be harmful to the intestinal tract since it causes abdominal chronic pain， a recurrent intestinal obstruction that requires multiple hospitalizations， and infertility通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. Moreover， it can become a chronic disease with significant mortality and minimum perspectives of a cure.\n\n【4】In a general context， defined as “adhesions\"， they can be developed in many areas of the human body， possessing many nomenclatures such as； intrauterine adhesion， pericardial adhesion， epidural adhesion， and peritoneal adhesion，the latter being more emphasized in this study. The postoperative adhesions are pathological peritoneal tissues that connect adjacent structures. Then， the physical properties of these tissues can vary significantly from a thin membrane of connective tissue to a thick fibrous structure that can contain blood vessels and nerves. Still， avoiding its formation is of primordial importance 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>.\n\n【5】From the start of the incision， it is necessary to respect the caution and care with which the tissue and the rupture of its cells are handled， that is， specific cutting techniques are theoretically utilized with precision. Even the prevention in the act of the surgical cut alone does not guarantee that the adhesions cannot be eventually and periodicaly developed. In this regard， current methodologies that make use of biomaterials as a theoretical and practical foundation are based on the possibility of avoiding the friction between the tissues and the exacerbated inflammation， as well as the coagulation cascade and the production of fibers 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>\n\n【6】The biomaterials are generally active biochemical compounds that prevent intestinal adhesions such as； biofilms， hyaluronic acids， bio-resorbable membranes， hydrogels， natural films， and resorbable biofilms. Each classification has specific physical properties， being used in specific cases of cellular regeneration. In short， they can avoid the consequences of adhesions 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>.\n\n【7】Methodology\n\n【8】The present study has a descriptive-discursive character， emphasizing primarily the intestinal adhesion's theme， as well as a possible form of prevention and treatment through the usage of membranes and bio-absorbable dressings applied in a perspective of proof of activity in the human body， besides emphasizing concepts in physiology， anatomy， and Pathophysiology in general.\n\n【9】In this way， objective research was performed in the following databases； PUBMED，SCIELO，删除1换行and Google Scholar. This article's bibliographical research made use of these terms； “Intestinal adhesions\"， “biological dressings”and“bio-absorbable membranes\"， without exclusion criteria， however， greater attention was given to the most recent papers due to their greater applicability.\n\n【10】Results and Discussion\n\n【11】Adhesion formation process\n\n【12】The peritoneum is a membrane that covers the cavity of the abdomen and its internal organs， which is composed of two layers： a parietal layer that covers the abdominal wall and a visceral layer that covers the organs. Adhesions occur after peritoneal trauma from damage cauised bysurgicalinterventions，abdominopelvic inflammatory disease， or infections， and can take form between the intestinal loops， as well as among other abdominal structures such as the liver and diaphragm 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>.\n\n【13】In the surgical process， the skin is injured by a local incision， the tissue injury initiates an inflammatory response and the subsequent healing process， which stimulates the formation of fibrous tissue. Systemic coagulation results in fibrin deposits， which are a matrix for the development of fibro-collagen tissue and the formation of the extracellular matrix 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. The trauma of peritoneal tissue and other intra-abdominal tissues results in a substantial compound rich in proinflammatory cytokines： Fibronectin， hyaluronic acid， glycosaminoglycans and proteoglycans， and various cell types：Mesothelial，macrophages，neutrophils，lymphocytes， and fibroblasts. These，exhibit activation of the coagulation cascade， and a fibrin mesh forms，eventually reabsorbed or matured into an adhesive connection between surfaces 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>. The process of formation of intestinal adhesion is explained in Figure 1.\n\n【14】Thus， postoperative adhesions are a consequence of abnormal peritoneal healing： Thelack of early postoperative fibrinolysis (in the first 48 h) allows cellular infiltration of the initial fibrinous matrix.\n\n【15】Around the seventh day， the adhesions are composed ofa collagenous extracellular matrix infiltrated by fibroblasts， smooth muscle cells， and neovascularization； this group is covered by a mesothelial covering 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>.\n\n【16】Surgical treatments and techniques\n\n【17】Treatment can be challengingandoften1inyolves2multidisciplinary approach， including the use of medication， physical therapy， endoscopic interventions， and in some cases， surgery. In the case of intestinal obstructions caused by adhesions， initial treatment may include the use of medications to control pain and symptoms， as well as nasogastric tube feeding to reduce pressure on adhesions 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>.\n\n【18】Removal surgeries can be a complex procedure， the adhesions often can be dense and deep， involving multiple layers and scar tissue formation. Delicate manipulation of the tissue should be fully performed using meticulous hemostasis， choice of sutures of small caliber， frequent irrigation of the dissection area to prevent the formation of fibrinous deposits， minimal use of monopolar electrocautery to prevent diffuse thermal injury， maximum resection of devitalized tissues， removal of fibrinous residues， and blood clots before peritoneal closure 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>.\n\n【19】In this regard， techniques can be used at the last stages of the surgery to aid healing in the best way possible， such as containment barriers or tissues that allow better fixation between human tissues. An ideal barrier must possess certain properties： Biodegradability and biocompatibility properties， so a second surgical procedure is not required to recover it. Also， the area of the lesion must be accurately identified and covered completely， the barriers are difficult to apply due to the complex geometries of the abdominal cavity， however， the surgeon must apply the barriers manually and uniformly 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>.\n\n【20】Biomaterials in general\n\n【21】Biomaterials， bio-membranes， and tissues are technologies that can be used as treatment and prevention of body adhesions； however，删除1换行they have specific factors for distinct cases. Biomaterials have been studied as an option to prevent and treat intestinal adhesions. These materials can be used as a physical barrier to prevent the intestinal loops from joining during the postoperative healing process and improving intestinal function 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>.\n\n【22】Hyaluronic acid and hydrogels\n\n【23】It is estimated that 93% of patients undergoing intra-abdominal surgery will develop some type of viscera-with-viscera or viscera-with-abdominal wall adhesions， the estimated risk being 60-90% in gynecological surgeries， thus consequently becoming one of the main causes of secondary infertility and chronic pelvic pain. Barrier intermediates that use hyaluronic acid and hydrogels are appointed as a method of prevention， avoiding the occurrence of adhesions. These barrier intermediates reduce the development of adhesions by disassociating the peritoneal areas injured during mesothelial restructuring， which is completed at around the eighth postoperative day 通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u>.\n\n【24】Hyaluronic acid is a protein that is naturally present in the human body， with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties and its applications are on-site during the surgical procedure or in the gel after the closure of the incision. The most common formulas of pharmacological agents containing hyaluronic acid and hydrogels found in the pharmaceutical industry are Intergel， Hyalobarrier gel， ACP gel， Sepracoat， and Seprafilm， which is a promissory non-stick barrier that is formed by the biopolymer and carboxymethylcellulose通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>.\n\n【25】An in vivo test performed in rabbits demonstrates the very high efficienc of the use of hyaluronic acid， effective in reducing the formation of intraperitoneal postoperative adhesions. It was demonstrated using a model of cecum abrasion with a defect in the side wall of a rabbit. This became particularly clear when comparing the prevalence of score 3 adhesions (firm and difficul to cut). In untreated rabbits， 8 out of 10 developed adherences， however， in rabbits treated with acid，only 2 in 8 developed adherences，confirming a high success rate and a possible treatment alternative 通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>.\n\n【26】In addition， Seprafilm (a chemically based on hyaluronic acid) demonstrates a remarkable reduction in the severity of adhesion formation after application in patients undergoing the Hartmann procedure. Particularly， in the case of planned relaparotomy， as in Hartmann's procedure， the application of Seprafilm can facilitate re-exploration and may reduce the risk of damage to the intestine during surgery. Therefore， the use of Seprafilm as a non-stick barrier is considerably effective 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>. As in the hydrogel of Hyaluronic Acid (HA)， the application of HA gel reduces the number oforgans involved in the formation of adhesions in an ischemic bud， moreover， the polarization of macrophages is associated with the formation of adhesions 通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u>.\n\n【27】The using of several types of gels is a good option for preventing intestinal adhesions.Adhesive-capablehydrogel barriers can reach the physical isolation of the adjacent tissues and therefore are considered an ideal solution. Nevertheless， integrating the convenience of endoscopic delivery and viscoelastic hydrogel formation remains a major challenge 通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u>. Theefficac ofanti-adhesion in an in vivo model revealed that the hydrogel effectivelyseparated itselffrom the wounds of the abdominal wall and cecum. In the seventh post-surgery， the wounds were completely covered by a new epithelial layer， while the wounds in the negative control group were glued 通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u>.\n\n【28】Biofilm and resorbable bio-membran\n\n【29】Biofilms and resorbable biomembranes are a kind of covering and have been studied as an approach to reduce the risk of complications and susceptibility to long-term bacterial infections. These materials are made of biocompatible polymers and， are designed to be absorbed by the body after a certain period， they can also be programmed to release compounds that help reduce inflammation. These can be constituted of various biomaterials， such as collagen， cellulose， acids， and fibers among others 通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u>.\n\n【30】A barrier membrane composed of hyaluronic acid can separate the peritoneal surfaces for about 7 days. The efficac of these membranes in reducing intra-abdominal adhesions after fibroid enucleation and colectomy has been investigated and verified in the scientific literature. A study conducted by Briiggmann et al. analyzed the use of the barrier membrane as the only preventive measure against occlusion related to small bowel adhesion after intestinal resection. They found that the membrane resulted in an absolute reduction of 1.6% and a relative reduction of 47% in the occurrence ofthis complication 通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u>.\n\n【31】Another type of adhesion barrier， which can be applied as a spray， comprises a pair of polyethylene glycols in a two-component system. The barrier is sprayed on the injured serous surfaces and seals them for 7 to 14 days. Its effectiveness in an in vivo study reached 83% of effectiveness 通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u>\n\n【32】Using a resorbable collagen membrane， a prospective multicenter studypoints out that the removal of the gastric band without the use of a nonstick product was correlated with a higher rate of postoperative adhesions (90.3% including 29% of severe adhesions)， while a highly significant reduction (89.9%) was observed in severe adhesions using the bio-membrane 通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u>. The effects of three electrospun fiber membranes on the formation of postoperative adhesions in surgical models of rats were studied， and submitted to laparoscopy， and the results were positive. The three electrospun submicrometric membranes were soft， flexible， easy to handle， and effectively reduced adhesion formation in rats 通用删除6(英):<u>[251</u>.\n\n【33】Resorbable microbiological dressing\n\n【34】The microbiological dressing is a technology in development， in which its most recent studies include the use of beneficial microorganisms such as probiotics and lactic acid bacteria， assisting the rearrangement of the intestinal microbiota. Probiotics are living microorganisms that can be found in food or dietary supplements and that provide health benefits， especially for the digestive system. The lacticacidbacteria，forinstance，areatype ofbeneficial microorganism that can be found in some types of food， such as yogurts and kefir， that promote resistance to colonization by pathogens. In this regard， microbiological techniques can be used as a method of prevention and postoperative care 通用删除6(英):<u>[26，27]</u>.\n\nBacterial cellulose within biomedical engineering is considered one of the ideal possibilities for its biocompatibility and possible applications withinvarious prototypes ofdressings such as nanocomposites， due to its properties of skin protection， blood coagulation， and healing. The use of implantable dressings to physically block surgical wounds is the main solution to prevent postoperative adhesions. Thus， the synergy between practicality and the high tissue recovery rate shows the method's effectiveness. As mentioned earlier，collagen and hyaluronic acid are great compounds that aid in the correct healing process of tissue. However， not only删除1换行bioactive can produce them， but specific bacteria can produce collagen and tissue activation properties 28|.\n\n【36】The production of cellulose through bacteria is done by a metabolic process， directly correlated to cellular multiplication. Primarily， the metabolism is activated after the consumption of nutrients， usually， glucose and sucrose， which initiate the metabolic process in the pentose phosphate cycle and the Krebs cycle， resulting respectively in the oxidation of carbohydrates and oxidation of organic acids. In this regard， the synthesis of bacterial cellulose is the product of metabolic reactions of hexoses phosphate based directly by phosphorylation of exogenous hexoses and， indirectly， by the pentoses and gluconeogenesis pathway involving various biochemical reactions， which are regulated by a high number of enzymes and regulatory and catalytic protein complexes. Bacterial cellulose can be biosynthesized by several species of bacteria belonging to the genera： Acetobacter， Achromobacter， Aerobacter， Agrobacterium， Alcaligenes， Azotobacter， Escherichia and Komagataeibacter 通用删除6(英):<u>[29]</u>.\n\n【37】With the use of bacterial cellulose， with collagen properties， the dressing can be further enriched by vitamins and acids. Its effectiveness rate is usually higher than ordinary membranes， due to its high metabolism. However， its production is not yet fully feasible due to the complexity of the methods 通用删除6(英):<u>[30，31]</u>. Also， the resorption of the dressing can be used in the final surgical moments， or be applied in a superior way to the skin with the addition of antimicrobial factors， which can also be applied to the dressing， ensuring that infections can hardly occur.\n\n【38】Conclusion\n\n【39】In summary， efficien methods to prevent and treat painful intestinaladhesionsLS。suchhasdressings andbio-membranes， demonstrate full capacity on aiding in tissue regeneration. Moreover， active compounds such as hydrogel and hyaluronic acid can be great helpers. The combination of bioactive and membranes can be even more revolutionary. In general， new technologies can still be developed and fully applied， avoiding adhesions and promoting better postoperative quality.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

Cutaneous lesion involvement is a rare clinical manifestation of IgG4-RD. We report a case of IgG4-RD presenting with cutaneous lesions in combination with autoimmune pancreatitis and subacute thyroiditis. A skin biopsy pathology confirmed the diagnosis of IgG4-RD. Here we present an uncommon case of IgG4-RD with subacute thyroiditis with pancreatic and skin involvement and provide a brief literature review of skin manifestations and treatment.\n\n【2】Keywords： Autoimmune pancreatitis； IgG4-related disease； Rash Skin pathology\n\n【3】Case Presentation\n\n【4】A 78-year-old woman was presented to the rheumatology clinic a year ago for scattered rashes on her lower extremities and pain in. The skin lesion began to be pinpoint-like and gradually merged， with clear boundaries， no pruritus， and hyperpigmentation . Six years before this presentation， she was treated for diarrhea and anorexia in another hospital. Pancreas Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) was performed which revealed suspected pancreatic cancer . Endoscopic Ultrasonography (EUS) revealed a 2.5 cm×1.6 cm round mass in the pancreatic tail. The EUS of a fine-needle aspiration ofpancreatic mass showed clumps of acinus and ductal epithelium， and no malignant cells and atypical epithelial cells were discovered. The serum IgG4 concentration was 4.78 g/L. Treatments such as supplementation of pancreatic enzymes， inhabitation of retinoic acid and protection of the gastric mucosa were initiated. But the patient is still suffering from recurrent diarrhea. Autoimmune pancreatitis was presumed after CT angiography of the pancreas was administrated with contrast material. Treatment with prednisone at an initial dose of 25 mg per day was started in April 2015， and the dosage was gradually reduced to 5 mg per day. After half a year of treatment， the diarrhea had not significantly abated， so the therapy was withdrawn. The pancreas lesion did not no progress at the 6-year follow up confirmed by CT scan， however IgG4level increased to 7.01 g/L.\n\nThree years before this presentation， the patient was evaluated by colonoscopy due to abdominal IOS pain and asubmucosaleminence lesion was detected in the ascen ding colon. Therighthemicolectomy was performed to remove the cancer. The biopsy demonstrated a partial mass-like lesion in which all mucosa infiltrated with lymphocytic clusters， fibrous tissue hyperplasia， twisted blood vessels， and no granulomatous lesions was found. The distribution of T lymphocyte and B lymphocyte infiltration was proportional. No medication was administrated to her. The patient also had a history of hypertension and thrombocytopenia. On examination， she was found to have cutaneous lesion on her lower extremities and tenderness in her neck. The polymorphic eruption consists of multiple， scattered， dark brown rashes， varying in size up to 5 cm on both lower extremities， with no desquamation or raised lesions. Hemoglobin was 109 g/L (reference range 115-150 g/L)， C-reactive protein was 26.37 mg/L (reference range 0-10 mg/L)， erythrocyte sedimentation rate was50 mm/H (reference range 0-20 mm/H)， procalcitonin was 0.051 ng/mL (reference range <0.046ng/mL)， creatinine was 90 umol/L (reference range 41-81 umol/L)， IgG4 was 2.56 g/L (reference range 0.03-2.01 g/L)， serum thyroglobulin was more than 500 ng/mL (reference range 3.5-77 ng/mL). Coagulation， complement， thyroid function and tumor markers were normal. Autoantibodies were positive for antinuclear antibody with titer 1：300 (Immunofluorescent pattern： Granular type). Antinuclear antibody profiles， rheumatoid factor， anti-CCP antibody， anticardiolipin antibody， and antineutrophil antibody were all negative. B-ultrasound ofperipherallymph nodes revealed enlarged|删除段之间换行|The clinical manifestations involved multiple organs and combined with increased serum IgG4 concentration and the biopsy results， the patient was diagnosed with IgG4-RD associated with删除1换行subacute thyroiditis. Accordingly， the patient was prescribed oral prednisone 30 mg daily. Her rash and diarrhea gradually improved after treatment. After two months， IgG4 was reduced to 1.24 g/L， the rash had completely subsided， and the diarrhea had improved significantly. The prednisone was reduced to 5 mg per day as a maintenance therapy， and there was no rash and diarrhea recurred during the subsequent 1-year follow-up.\n\n【6】Discussion\n\n【7】IgG4-RD is a unique clinical pathological disorder characterized by elevated circulating IgG4 levels and tissue infiltration of IgG4+plasma cells. Various organs are involved in IgG4-RD including the pancreas， salivary glands， lacrimal glands， bile ducts， peritoneum， kidneys， pituitary glands， lungs， and thyroid glands. Thus， symptoms and signs vary depending on the organs involved and the severity of the disease 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>.\n\n【8】This case provided a patient with IgG4-RD involving the pancreas， skin and subacute thyroiditis. The cutaneous pathology facilitated a definitive diagnosis for this patient and allowed her to respond well to therapy. Only a few dozen cases of skin lesions associated IgG4-RD had been reported so far. Skin lesions can present as erythema， subcutaneous nodules， or papules， and are mostly distributed around the ears， face， and limbs， and are often combined with dacryoadenitis and sialadenitis， with infrequent involvement of the pancreas，liver， and biliary tract. Given this patient's previous history， clinical presentation， and constellation of symptoms， we suspect that subacute thyroiditis is secondary to IgG4-RD 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>.\n\n【9】The specificity of skin lesions related to IgG4-RD is very poor. At present， the skin lesions can be classified into seven subtypes： 1) cutaneous plasmacytosis (multiple papulonodules or indurations on the trunk and proximal part of the limbs)，2) pseudolymphoma and angiolymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia (plaques and papulonodules mainly on the periauricular， cheek and mandible regions)， 3) Mikulicz disease (palpebral swelling， sicca syndrome and exophthalmos)， 4) psoriasis-like eruption (strikingly mimicking psoriasis vulgaris)， 5) unspecified maculopapular or erythematous eruptions， 6) hypergammaglobulinemic purpura (bilateral asymmetrical palpable purpuric lesions on the lower extremities) and urticarial vasculitis (prolonged urticarial lesions occasionally with purpura) and 7) ischemic digit (Raynaud phenomenon and digital gangrene). Most of the lesions are subacute and it often takes months or years to be diagnosed. Regardless of the organ involved， the key histologic features are dense lymphoplasmacytic infiltration， storiform fibrosis， and thrombophlebitis. Among skin lesions， however， thrombophlebitis is rarely observed and occurs clinically in IgG4-RD通用删除6(英):<u>[3-7]</u>.\n\n【10】Not all patients with skin lesions require treatment， but without treatment， skin lesions are at risk of persistence or enlargement， whether treated or not， depending on symptoms and the extent of organinvolvement. IgG4levels can often be used as a markerto monitor therapeutic response. Steroids are usually effective in treating IgG4-RD， but immunosuppressants such as methotrexate， azathioprine， and mycophenolate mofetil are also effective. In addition， rituximab also has some effect on IgG4-RD treatment. After this patient was treated with a moderate dose of prednisone monotherapy， the rash did not recur， thyroid pain and diarrhea significantly resolved， and the levels of serological marker IgG4 returned to the normal range. Imaging findings on the pancreas is still under follow-up. While删除1换行patients respond well to glucocorticoids， relapse rates remained high during reduction and maintenance therapy. Currently， the optimal therapy is still being explored 通用删除6(英):<u>[8-10]</u>.\n\n【11】This patient also had a mucosal protrusion in the ascending colon. She received a diagnosis of suspected Crohn's disease by a gastroenterologist at another hospital. The diagnosis was ruled out after a multi-disciplinary team discussion. We speculate that the mucosal lesion in the ascending colon may be related to IgG4-RD.\n\n【12】In conclusion， we have described an infrequent patient with IgG4-RD involving the skin and pancreas who was definitively diagnosed and effectively treated with the help of skin pathology. Importantly， it has been recognized that many different morphological rashes can also occur in IgG4-RD. Correct diagnosis relies on serum IgG4 levels and histological and immunohistochemical analysis.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

He had a background history of ischemic heart disease and diabetes mellitus with End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) on regular hemodialysis and history of right BKA for diabetic foot ulcer.\n\n【9】As he was in severe sepsis， he required urgent Above-Knee-Amputation (AKA). However， his preoperative coagulation profile was deranged with prolonged Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (APTT) 131.9 sec， PT 35.3 sec， and International Normalized Ratio (INR) 3.70.

He was not on heparin or any anticoagulant.\n\n【10】Initial impression was coagulopathy secondary to sepsis. Despite transfusion with Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP)，his coagulation profile worsened with the highest APTT>180 sec and INR 10 without any bleeding event. APTT and PT were not corrected by immediate and 2 h incubation mixing tests， with factor VIII level of 600% and hyperfibrinogenemia. These findings were suggestive of strong LA.\n\n【11】Intravenous methylprednisolone was administered， and plasmapheresis was performed twice\n\n【12】Table 1： Serial coagulation profile monitoring.\n\n| Day of Admission  | Coagulation Profile  |  |  | Remarks  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Day of Admission  | APTT (second)  | PT (second)  | INR  | Remarks  |\n| Day 1  | 52.9  | 16.1  | 1.31  |  |\n| Day 3  | 131.9  | 35.3  | 3.7  |  |\n| Day 4  | 112.6  | 43.5  | 4.87  | Transfused 2 units FFP  |\n| Day 5  | 135.6  | 46.3  | 5.29  | Transfusec 4 units FFP  |\n| Day 6  | 133.5  | 47.8  | 5.52  | Transfusec 2 units FFP  |\n| Day 7  | 155.7  | 50.4  | 5.92  |  |\n| Day 8  | 169  | 48.9  | 5.69  |  |\n| Day 10  | 137.3  | 49.1  | 5.72  |  |\n| Day 13  | 176.8  | 51.5  | 6.1  |  |\n| Day 14  | >180  | 62.1  | 7.8  | Transfusec 2 units FFP  |\n| Day 15  | >180  | 65.5  | 8.37  | Transfused 2 units FFP  |\n| Day 16  | >180  | 49.5  | 5.78  |  |\n| Day 17  | 146.4  | 46.4  | 5.31  | Startec onVMethylprednisolone 50mg OD  |\n| Day 18  | >180  | 69.5  | 9.05  |  |\n| Day 19  | 116.4  | 45.2  | 5.12  | Plasmapheresis x1  |\n| Day 20  | 98.4  | 51.1  | 6.03  | Plasmapheresis x2  |\n| Day 21  | >180  | 53.5  | 6.4  |  |\n| Day 22  | >180  | 75.4  | 10.08  | Went in for operation AKA  |\n| Day 23  | 75.1  | 37.4  | 4  | Day 1 post operation  |\n\n【14】APTT： Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time： PT： Prothrombin Time； INR：International Normalized Ratio； FFP： Fresh Frozen Plasma； AKA： Above Knee Amputation删除1换行with transient improvement in the coagulation profile.

The surgery was successfully carried out with an estimated blood loss of 400 ml. Day 1 post-operative， his APTT was 75.1 sec， PT 37.4 sec， and INR 4.00.\n\n【16】LA confirmatory test revealed a positive Staclot LA and a prolonged Dilute Russell's viper venom time of 181.2 sec.\n\n【17】Discussion\n\n【18】A deranged coagulation profile can be due to factor deficiency， presence of specific factor inhibitor or LA. Identification of the underlying cause is important as some disorders increase the risk of bleeding while the others are prothrombotic. The initial approach to a prolonged APTT or PT is to rule out an artefactual abnormality due删除1换行to a mixture of heparin solution with blood， use of anticoagulant， or due to liver disease 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. An additional test that can be done is a mixing test to differentiate between a coagulation factor deficiency and the presence of an inhibitor.\n\n【19】LA is an inhibiting antibody which causes prolonged APTT in vitro despite its prothrombotic activity. In sepsis， DIVC is the foremost important diagnosis of coagulopathy. However， persistently deranged coagulation profiles in a non-bleeding patient， which are not corrected with FFP transfusion or vitamin K should raise the suspicion of LA. Although rare， acquired LA is one of the possible differential diagnoses and has been reported in literature to be frequently developed in critically ill patients 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>.\n\n【20】Lupus Anticoagulant-Hypoprothrombinemia Syndrome(LAHS) should be considered in LA with a prolonged PT and INR An acquired factor II deficiency in association with the acquired lupus anticoagulant complicates the management further as it may predispose the patient to both thrombosis and severe bleeding 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. PT is usually relatively insensitive to LA；however， a strong LA might give rise to a falsely increased PT 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. A factor II level and an uncorrected PT mixing test can help to differentiate a strong lupus anticoagulant from LAHS.\n\n【21】Managing a sick patient with the presence of LA and deranged coagulation profile who needs a surgical intervention may pose a big dilemma for the surgeons and physicians. In the present case， surgical intervention is the definitive management in acquired LA associated with severe sepsis from the infected stump. Improvement of the coagulation profile post-operatively indicated the infected stump was the most likely source of LA formation. Therefore， it is imperative to diagnose acquired LA as they differ in the coagulability state especially in the decision for surgical intervention and in critically ill patients whom the risk of thromboembolic event is high.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

His initial Model for End-Stage Liver Disease(MELD) score was 25， and the total bilirubin level was 7.45 mg/dL(normal range： 0.2 mg/dL to 1.2 mg/dL). Serological tests revealed a negative hepatitis B and C status . Imaging tests， including Panendoscopy， colonoscopy， abdominal Computed Tomography(CT)， and liver magnetic resonance imaging， were performed to rule out malignancies and major vascular anomalies. Subsequently， the patient was referred to the waiting list for a liver transplant. However， his liver function deteriorated rapidly after several episodes of bleeding from esophageal varices， with the MELD score escalating to34. On the basis of the MELD score，the estimated 3-month mortality rate was 52.6% 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. Because of the recent high mortality without liver transplants in time attributing to the cadaveric liver shortage， we discussed the possibility of an LDLT with his family. His younger sister expressed willingness to be a donor； therefore， an LDLT was initiated.\n\n【12】删除10:<u>Donor</u>\n\n【13】The living donor was a 39-year-old woman with blood type B. She had a weight of 61 kg and a height of 163 cm； moreover， her BMI was 23.0， BSA was 1.66， and history was noncontributory. Her pretransplant serological test results were normal； however， HCV-RNA was more than 4 log 10， with a sub-genotype of 1b .\n\n【14】Abdominal CT and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography revealed neither vascular variation nor bile duct anomalies. Although the risk of postoperative hepatic insufficiency is influenced by multiple factors， the preoperative Future Liver Remnant (FLR) volume is a key determinant for ensuring adequate functional remnant liver 通用删除6(英):<u>[6，7]</u>. CT liver volumetry revealed a total liver volume of 1266.1 mL， with 753.4 mL in the right liver lobe without the middle hepatic vein and 512.7 mL in the left liver lobe with the middle hepatic vein. The results suggested an acceptable volume for the recipient and indicated that harvesting the right liver lobe without the middle hepatic vein was safe for the donor. Regardless of HCV infection， the donor’s clinical condition was suitable for right lobe liver donation， with a graft-to-recipient weight ratio of 0.978 and the donor's liver remnant of 39.76%. The estimated FLR， calculated using the Urata formula (SLV=2.4+706.2×BSA)， was 55.48% and 43.57%for the recipient and donor， respectively. The donor was informed of the risks associated with the procedure， and coercion was excluded during an independent， confidential evaluation. Surgical agreement was approved by the medical ethics committee followed by the discussions with hepatologists， hepatobiliary surgeons， and intensive care staff. Informed consent was obtained from the patients.\n\n【15】Results\n\n【16】We developed a novel protocol for LDLTs from HCV-positive1OVE donors into HCV-negative recipients. According to the Treatment of Hepatitis C 2018 recommendations of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and European Association for the Study of the Liver， treatment-naive patients with HCV genotype 1b infection and without cirrhosis can be treated with the fixed-dose combination of sofosbuvir and ledipasvir for 8 weeks (grading B1； moderate evidence quality and strong recommendation) 通用删除6(英):<u>[8，9]</u>. We initiated DAA therapy for the donor with a daily fixed-dose combination of ledipasvir (90 mg) and sofosbuvir (400 mg； Harvoni) for 8 weeks通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>. The presence of HCV-RNA was evaluated at 4， 8， and 12 weeks posttherapy ， and the Rapid Virologic Response (RVR)， SVR12， posttherapy SVR， and posttransplant SVR suggested that the disease was cured. The donor HCV-RNA diminished from4 log 10 to less than 15 IU/mL， which is below the lower limit of quantification. Although the HCV-RNA was not detected post transplantation， anti-HCV seropositivity was detected before and after the transplant. The LDLT was performed after the end of DAA therapy. To ensure donor safety， physicians requested a preoperative liver biopsy that was suggested using the options of laparoscopic or conventional percutaneous procedure because of the latter process-related bleeding risks， as informed by the radiologist. Subsequently， an intraoperative laparoscopic liver wedge biopsy was performed before the liver harvest surgery. The frozen section of the bilateral liver lobes revealed a minimal fatty change of less than 5% and no fibrosis. The laparoscopic liver biopsy was converted to an open donor right hepatectomy， with an uneventful perioperative period. The donor developed transient postoperative hyperbilirubinemia， however， the level decreased to normal range 1 weeklater. The donor was discharged in stable condition on postoperative day 7. Currently， the donor is undergoing regular follow-ups by the hepatologist and surgeons in the outpatient department. The donor resumed her job3 months post-donation. No other complications have been noted during the 3-year follow-up period.\n\nThe recipient without hepatitis C history was not treated with DAAs all the time during the perioperative period. Transient anti-HCV antibodies were detected at the first serological follow-up|删除段之间换行|2 weeks post transplantation， with the antibodies disappearing2 months later. No HCV-RNA was detected during follow-ups. Postoperative bile leak complicated with intraabdominal biloma formation was noted. The sono-guided Intra-abdominal pigtail drainage and the endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography-guided biliary stent placement was performed. The recipient was discharged in a stable condition 1.5 months post-operation. The2-year posttransplant liver biopsy revealed Ishak fibrosis stage 0with a modified histology activity index score (neuroinflammatory score) of 2 (of 18) and no rejection. The recipient had a herpes zoster infection of the trigeminal nerve 1 year after the transplant， with the long-term neurological deficits of dizziness and vertigo that disabled him from the job. Currently， the patient is being followed up at our OPD， with no HCV flare-ups over 3 years.\n\n【18】Discussion\n\n【19】Here， we present an HCV-positive donor treated with DAAs before donating the right liver lobe to her elder brother. Few articles have discussed this topic. Prior to the approval of DAAs， HCV recurrence after liver transplant was the most common cause of graft failure and reduced recipient survival in HCV-positive patients compared with HCV-negative patients 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>. Chhatwal et al. demonstrated that HCV-seronegative patients have an increased life expectancy after accepting any liver graft regardless of HCV status if the MELD score is more than or equal to 20 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>.\n\n【20】The survival rates in HCV-positive donors and HCV-negative recipients are similar to those of HCV-negative donors and recipients because of the use of DAAs， with cure rates of nearly 100%. The use of HCV-positive organs in a selected group of recipients with and without HCV infection was reported by Dhaliwal et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>.\n\n【21】Because of the recipient’s high 3-month mortality rate and the involved cost， the DAA therapy duration for the donor was shortened to 8 weeks. Under existing guidelines， most patients are prescribed12-week DAA therapy， a treatment duration resulting in high rates of SVR across various viral and host characteristics 通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u>. Moreover， the guidelines do not encourage a treatment duration of less than12 weeks 通用删除6(英):<u>[15，16]</u>. However， increasing evidence suggests that many patients can achieve an SVR with only 8 weeks of therapy. In clinical practice，an SVR rate of93% to 98% has been observed after treatment withledipasvir and sofosbuvir for 8 weeks 通用删除6(英):<u>[17，18]</u>. In Taiwan， the cost of DAA therapy is similar to that in the United States； however， it is not covered by National Health Insurance， making it unaffordable to ordinary people. The wholesale acquisition cost of ledipasvir and sofosbuvir is $1125 per pill，and the cost of a ledipasvir and sofosbuvir course reduces from $94，500 to $63，000 when the treatment duration is shortened from 12 to 8 weeks 通用删除6(英):<u>[19，20]</u>. In Taiwan and neighboring countries， such as Japan and South Korea， routine pretransplant liver biopsies are not performed for living donors if CT and MRI images reveal no fibrosis， fatty change (less than 5%)， or hemosiderosis. However， we performed a pretransplant laparoscopic liver biopsy for donor safety in the setting oftreated HCV infection.\n\n【22】Although LDLTs have been performed in patients with fulminant liver failure or advanced liver disease categorized as the United Network of Organ Sharing (UNOS) status 2 A， posttransplant survival rates are low 通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u>. In a series， 1-year patient survival was57%， with an average stay of 23 days in the intensive care unit 通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u>. By comparison， 1-year patient survival was 82% in cadaveric organ transplant recipients， with UNOS status 2 A at the time of the transplant 通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u>. With the advent of MELD， decisions on LDLTs are删除1换行made on a case-by-case basis， and LDLTs are uncommon in patients with MELD scores above 25. In these patients， short-term mortality without liver transplants approaches 100% 通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u>. In regions such as East and South Asia with low cadaveric organ availability， the decreased posttransplant survival rates with LDLT may be superior to the high waiting list mortality， especially when the outcomes of LDLT are improving通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u>.\n\n【23】What mortality rate is acceptable when the donor understands the risks， and when coercion has been excluded? Even if the donor is willing to accept a potential mortality risk for the life of a loved one， would the medical community proceed with an LDLT? A balance should be achieved between the risk incurred by the donor and what is acceptable to society， the medical community， and the recipient.\n\n【24】Conclusion\n\n【25】In the DAA era， a transplant from deceased HCV-positive donors to HCV-negative recipients has become feasible and safe. Our study also revealed the feasibility and safety as well of HCV-seropositive LDLTs to seronegative recipients. However， some issues remain to be debated， and more studies are required to confirm the long-term ouitcome.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

The scope of this review is to establish the role of various inflammation-based markers as prognostic tools in Colorectal Cancer (CRC).\n\n【2】Methods： A literature search was performed for articles that reported on the prognostic and predictive value of the Neutrophil-Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR)， Platelet-Lymphocyte Ratio (PLR)， Lymphocyte-Monocyte Ratio (LMR)，and Glasgow Prognostic Score as well as the modified Glasgow Prognostic Score (GPS/mGPS) in relation to CRC.\n\n【3】Conclusion： Further prospective studies may result in better risk stratification in patients eligible for curative surgery， limiting the administration of neo-adjuvant and adjuvant therapy to high-risk candidates. In patients with unresectable metastatic disease， inflammation markers can be used as a tool for predicting chemotherapeutic outcomes and monitoring tumor progression.\n\n【4】Introduction and Background\n\n【5】Colorectal Cancer (CRC) is a significant public health issue； currently， it is the third most prevalent cancer with 1，931，590 cases diagnosed in 2020 behind breast and lung cancer. In 2020colorectal cancer accounted for 9.4% of the total cancer-related deaths with 935，173 deaths. These numbers are predicted to increase to 3.2 million new cases and 1.6 million deaths per year by 2040通用删除6(英):<u>[1，2]</u>. Despite advancements in surgical methods， adjuvant and neoadjuvant therapy dose， and scheduling， the 5-year survival rate for patients with CRC ranges from 90% to 10% with tumor 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. Currently，the International Union Against Cancer(UICC-TNM)通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u> and American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u> staging categories are used to predict the prognosis of newly diagnosed CRC patients. Several parameters for predicting survival in CRC patients have been identified， including patient characteristics (performance status， age， gender) and tumor characteristics (TNM stage， biomarkers， gene mutations)， but it is well known that survival time can vary even among patients with the same characteristics and disease stage at diagnosis. The host inflammatory response to tumors is currently one of the most intriguing areas of clinical investigation. In many cancer forms， systemic inflammation has been shown to be significantly related to the risk and amount of metastatic involvement 通用删除6(英):<u>[6，7]</u>. A series of studies have shown that inflammation may play an important role in cancer growth and metastasis because inflammatory mediators enhance vascular permeability， allowing cancer cells to infiltrate lymphatic and blood arteries. Additionally， these cytokines contribute to tumor angiogenesis and protumoral immune cell recruitment 通用删除6(英):<u>[8，9]</u>.\n\nAlthough several cytokines are involved in the systemic inflammatory response， Interleukin-6(IL-6) plays a critical role due to its capacity to boost the synthesis of acute phase proteins， notably C-Reactive Protein (CRP)， while decreasing albumin production in the liver. It also accelerates the development of megakaryocytes into platelets， is implicated in neutrophil recruitment， and can boost thrombopoietin synthesis， resulting in increased platelet numbers 通用删除6(英):<u>[10-12]</u>. Another important cytokine in the antitumoral systemic inflammatory response is TGF-B which polarizes antitumoral neutrophils into protumoral neutrophils. This polarization creates a tumor immune microenvironment conducive to tumoral growth and invasion 通用删除6(英):<u>[13，14]</u>. Numerous studies have evaluated the role of inflammatory response in the tumor microenvironment and as a result， an increasing number of inflammatory scores have been proposed for predicting survival in several删除1换行tumor types. Several of these inflammatory biomarkers have been included in colorectal prognostication models such as Glasgow Prognostic Score (GPS) and modified Glasgow Prognostic Score(mGPS)， others biomarkers such as Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR)， Platelet-to-Lymphocyte Ratio (PLR) and Lymphocyte-to-Monocyte Ratio (LMR) have been extensively researched as independent prognostic factors for survival in patients with colorectal cancer 15-17|.\n\n【7】The aim of the current review is to provide an overview of the role of inflammatory biomarkers in colorectal cancer prognosis.\n\n【8】Methods\n\n【9】A literature search evaluating the prognostic role of Glasgow PrognosisScore(GPS)， modified GPS(mGPS)， Neutrophil-Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR)， Platelet-Lymphocyte Ratio (PLR)， and Lymphocyte-Monocyte Ratio (LMR) was conducted in the National Library of Medicine (MEDLINE)， the Excerpta Medica database(EMBASE)， and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews(CDSR). The inclusion criteria consisted of only English-language research articles that reported on the prognostic value of the aforementioned biomarkers. We examined the title and abstract of each identified study， and the full text of the study was obtained for relevant studies.\n\n【10】Glasgow PrognosticScore (GPS)and modified Glasgow Prognostic Score (mGPS)\n\n【11】The Glasgow Prognosis Score (GPS)， an inflammation-based cancer-prognostic marker constituted of serum CRP elevation and albumin concentration decrease， is considered to reflect the host systemicinflammatory response as well as his metabolicstress，andhas been demonstrated to be a helpful prognostic factor in the survival of patients with colorectal cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u>. According to the GPS individuals with both increased CRP (>10 mg/l) and hypoalbuminemia (3.5 g/dL receive a score of 2； individuals with just one parameter or none of these biochemical abnormalities receive a score of 1 or O， respectively. Since hypoalbuminemia alone does not have prognostic value the GPS has been modified as follows： The mGPS score can have a value of 0 for patients with low CRP ≤ 10 mg/L and any value of albumin，1 for patients with CRP>10 mg/L and albumin ≥ 3.5 g/dL， and 2 for patients with CRP>10 mg/L and albumin <3.5 g/dL 通用删除6(英):<u>[19，20]</u>.\n\n【12】Numerous studies have suggested that GPS/mGPS isan important prognostic factor for survival in patients diagnosed with CRC. A retrospective study that included 105 patients diagnosed with stage I-IV CRC showed that patients with elevated GPS/mGPS had a lower rate of survival independently from other common factors that influence survival such as TNM stage and tumor differentiation 通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u>. Another similar retrospective study which included 271 patients with stage I-IV CRC showed that an elevated mGPS had a lower 5-year survival rate (mGPS 2 vs. mGPS 1 vs. mGPS O； 35.2% vs. 74.9% vs.92.6%，p=0.0001)通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u>.\n\nA high GPS score has been shown to reflect metabolic stress， more precisely malnutrition in patients with CRC 通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u>. Richards et al. assessed 174 patients with CRC from stage I to III and discovered a tight connection between high mGPS and sarcopenia (p=0.001). However， there was no link between CRP and the total fat index， subcutaneous fat index， or visceral fat index. Albumin had no relationship with the total fat index or the subcutaneous fat index， but it did have a significant positive link with the visceral fat index|删除段之间换行|(p=0.02) and the skeletal muscle index (p=0.001) 通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u>. Mauricio et al. reported in a prospective study that all patients with a GPS 2 were malnourished according to the Subjective Global Assessment (SGA)， while 80.9% of patients with GPS 0 had no signs of malnutrition. There was a significant correlation between the three SGA categories(A-wel1l1nourished， B-moderately malnourished， C-severely malnourished)and GPS/mGPS score， suggesting inflammation's role in cancer-induced cachexia 通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u>.\n\n【14】Several studies have shown that GPS/mGPS is a useful prognostic model in resectable early-stage CRC， in terms of both postoperative complications as well as survival 通用删除6(英):<u>[23-26]</u>. Moyes et al. reported an association between postoperative complications such as infectious complications， pulmonary embolism， cardiac complications， and a higher GPS 通用删除6(英):<u>[27]</u>. Similarly， Park et al. conducted a comprehensive retrospective analysis to assess the predictive impact of mGPS and its association with other prognostic markers in 1，000 patients with early-stage CRC (stage I to III) undergoing possibly curative surgery. A high mGPS level was linked with aging and emergency presentation(both p<0.001)， primary site， increasing T and TNM stage， poor tumor differentiation， surgical margin involvement， peritoneal involvement， and tumor perforation (all p=0.001). Cancer-Specific Survival (CSS) ranged from 80% in patients with mGPS=0 to 61% in people with mGPS =2. Overall Survival (OS) was also reduced with a5-year OS of 70% for patients with a mGPS=0 to 46% in patients with mGPS=2 通用删除6(英):<u>[28]</u>.\n\nThe role of adjuvant chemotherapy is uncertain in stage II CRC， so newly validated prognostic models can be useful for better patient selection. A retrospective study done on 99 patients with stage II CRC who underwent curative surgery has shown that patients with a mGPS of O had a 5-year OS of 83.6%， while patients with a mGPS of 1 and 2 had a 5-year OS of 75.9% and 33.3%， respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>[29]</u>. A retrospective study by Sugimoto et al. reported that after multivariate analysis mGPS was the strongest prognostic factor for CSS in patients with stage II CRC， in stage III CRC therre was no significant correlation between CSS and mGPS 通用删除6(英):<u>[30]</u>. Some studies have reported that a higher GPS score is associated with a higher risk of distant metastasis 31|.\n\n【16】Palliative surgical resections are advised in some patients with metastatic CRC (mCRC) to ease symptoms such as blockage， perforation， or bleeding. Kishiki et al. investigated the predictive value of mGPS in 79 mCRC patients who underwent palliative surgical procedures (resection of a main lesion alone， bypass surgery， or colostomy). The presence of lung metastases， peritoneal spread， distant metastases， low hemoglobin， elevated CRP levels， decreased albumin， and prior chemotherapy were all associated with lower overall survival. Tumor excision， adjuvant chemotherapy， and mGPS were all used. When the population was separated into three groups based on mGPS score， significant differences in mean survival time were found： with mGPS=0/1/2， CSS was 24， 18， and 8 months， respectively (95% CI of 19 to 37 months， 7 to 41 months， and 1 to 9months， respectively) 通用删除6(英):<u>[32]</u>.\n\n【17】A retrospective study by Adachi et al. with a cohort of 65patients with mCRC who received surgical intervention and systemic chemotherapy showed that mGPS is an independent predictor of fatality rate. A greater 3-month death rate was associated with a higher mGPS score (p=0.00001) and multivariate analysis demonstrated that mGPS (0/1，2) was an independent risk factor 通用删除6(英):<u>[33]</u>. Furukawa et al. investigated the role of GPS in 40 patients with unresectable删除1换行synchronous and metachronous liver metastases from CRC 通用删除6(英):<u>[34]</u>. The absence of initial tumor resection and systemic treatment，blood CEA>100 ng/ml， serum CA19-9 100 U/ml，and GPS=2 (p=0.0362) were significant predictors of inferior outcome. Recent research has revealed that mGPS can predict outcomes in mCRC patients who have undergone chemotherapy. Ishizuka et al. conducted a retrospective study of a cohort of 112 patients who were taking chemotherapy for advanced or recurrent CRC with regimens such as FOLFIRI (5-Fluorouracil/Leucovorin/Irinotecan hydrochloride) or FOLFOX (5-Fluorouracil/l-Leucovorin/Oxaliplatin) and found that a mGPS=2 predicted a greater risk of mortality than mGPS=0 or 1(p<0.001).Only mGPS was found to be an independent risk factor of death in multivariate analyses that included neutrophil ratio， CA 19-9，CRP，albumin， and mGPS.\n\n【18】Dreanic et al. investigated the predictive effect of GPS in49 patients with mCRC who were receiving 5-fluorouracil with cetuximab and oxaliplatin (60%) or irinotecan (30%)通用删除6(英):<u>[35]</u>.55%，29%， and 16% of patients had GPS values of 0， 1， and 2， respectively，at the time of diagnosis. In the first group， median Progression-Free Survival (PFS) and median Overall Survival (OS) were considerably longer (p=0.0084 and 0.0093， respectively). GPS was also tested in a group of 80 patients with mCRC who were taking bevacizumab and 5-fluorouracil plus oxaliplatin (51%) or irinotecan (34%). At diagnosis，56%，31%，and 13% of patients had GPS values of 0， 1，and2， respectively. The median PFS in these groups was 10.1， 6.5， and5.6 months， respectively (p=0.16). The median OS was 20.1， 11.4， and 6.5 months (p=0.004)， respectively. Sharma et al. investigated 55patients with mCRC undertaking first-line oral capecitabine mono chemotherapy. GPS (p=0.016)， colonic primary (p=0.022)， high CEA (p=0.027)， and hypoalbuminemia (p=0.008) were significant predictors of CSS on univariate analysis； patients with GPS scores equal to 2 had a lower OS compared to those with GPS scores of 0or 1通用删除6(英):<u>[36]</u>.\n\n【19】Neutrophil-to-Lym phocyte Ratio as a Prognostic Factor in CRC\n\n【20】The antitumoral inflammatory response is distinguished by an increase in circulating neutrophil levels and a decrease in circulating lymphocyte levels. Because a high concentration of neutrophils is known to promote tumor progression and to suppress the antitumor effect of lymphocytes， the Neutrophil-Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR) may be regarded as the balance between pro-tumor inflammatory status and antitumor immune status. NLR is calculated by dividing the absolute neutrophil count by the absolute lymphocyte count. Several studies suggested that an imbalance of neutrophils and lymphocytes in peripheral blood is correlated with the imbalance of the same cells in the tumor microenvironment and that this imbalance can be associated with tumor development 通用删除6(英):<u>[37-39]</u>. Although the NLR is associated with survival， the GPS/mGPS appears to be a better predictor of survival. In a large cohort study (Glasgow Inflammation Outcome Study)， mGPS outperformed the NLR. Although an advantage of NLR is that it can distinguish between good and bad prognostic groups in a range of tumor types， including CRC 通用删除6(英):<u>[40]</u>. A retrospective study by Inamoto et al. showed that the combination of the NLR and GPS/mGPS into a novel prognostic model for CRC survival was superior to the NLR and GPS/mGPS alone通用删除6(英):<u> 41]</u>. Because of its ease of calculation， the preoperative NLR is gaining popularity as a prognostic marker； its relevance in predicting disease recurrence and postoperative problems has been explored at length删除1换行in the literature. Interestingly， several studies have revealed that assessing local lymphocyte response， which is defined as a prominent lymphocytic reaction near the invasive boundary， is related to a lower NLR and thus a better prognosis 通用删除6(英):<u>[39]</u>. Cook et al. discovered that a high NLR value on the first postoperative day is a good predictor of postoperative complications. In this study， the NLR cut-off was high with a cut-off value of 9.3， one argument for this high cut-off value is its proximity to the surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>[42]</u>.\n\nIn a retrospective investigation of 524 patients with stage II-III CRC who underwent curative laparotomic resection， Kubo et al. developed a novel NLR score based on both preoperative and postoperative neutrophil and lymphocyte counts. Adjuvant chemotherapy was administered according to their risk class，156 individuals with stage III CRC and 38 patients with stage II received the treatment. Patients with R1 and R2 resections and those undergoing emergency intervention， laparoscopic surgery， multiple carcinomas， inflammatory bowel disease， preoperative clinical evidence of infection， or other inflammatory conditions were excluded. Neutrophil and lymphocyte counts were performed as follows： Before surgery， on the first postoperative day， and on the third or fourth postoperative day. Patients were categorized into two groups： Those with a low perioperative NLR (score of 0 or 1) and those with a high perioperative NLR (score of 2 or 3). NLR score was found to be an independent risk factor for both DFS (HR=1.53，95%CI 1.01-2.37； p=0.02) and CSS (HR=1.71，95% CI 1.03-2.88；p=0.04) in multivariate analyses |43.\n\n【22】In a retrospective study performed by Yasui et al. on 568 stage I-III CRC patients， patients were stratified by inflammation status：Preoperative low NLR (normal group)， preoperatively high NLR but normalized after surgery (normalized group)， and persistently high NLR (elevated group). They reported an OS time superior for the normal and normalized group compared to the elevated group 通用删除6(英):<u>[44]</u>.\n\n【23】The function of NLR in resectable CRC liver metastases was explored in a retrospective study of 169 patients who had liver resection after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The previously established NLR cut-off number was 2.5.HigherNLR was linked with both lower OS (HR=1.17； 95% CI， 1.03-132；p=0.011)and increased probability ofextrahepatic/multifocal recurrence (p=0.007)，implying a decreased post-recurrence survival (HR=1.24， 95% CI， 1.02-1.52； p=0.032)通用删除6(英):<u>[45]</u>. Similarly in another retrospective study of 289 patients with resectable liver metastases， patients with high NLR had significantly lower 5-year survival than patients with lower NLR (22% vs. 43%， p<0.001). On both univariate and multivariate analysis， high NLR was associated with a poorer survival outcome (p<0.001)通用删除6(英):<u>[46]</u>.\n\n【24】Ganhim et al. conducted a prospective study on 52 patients who were candidates for the first excision of CRC pulmonary metastases. Neutrophil and lymphocyte counts were measured upon admission to the hospital， prior to surgery or any other procedure. The NLR cut-off value was determined to be 4. Patients were divided into two groups， an inflammatory phenotype group (high NLR and mGPS value)， and a non-inflammatory phenotype group (no signs of systemic inflammation). The inflammatory phenotype group had a shorter median OS time as well as a shorter time to recurrence 通用删除6(英):<u>[471</u>.\n\nA series of retrospective studies reported that NLR could have predictive value for liver recurrence after metastasectomy. Giakoustidis et al. reported that patients with an elevated NLR had a higher risk of hepatic recurrence 通用删除6(英):<u>[45]</u>. Verter et al. showed that a high|删除段之间换行|NLR value after metastasectomy was associated with a higher rate of extrahepatic recurrence 通用删除6(英):<u>[481</u>.\n\n【26】Elevated NLR appears to be a strong predictor of poor response to palliative chemotherapy in individuals with unresectable mCRC， regardless of treatment. A retrospective by Chua et al. evaluated the prognostic role of NLR in a study that included 349 patients with unresectable mCRC who were receiving first-line palliative care chemotherapy 通用删除6(英):<u>[49]</u>.\n\n【27】Another retrospective study performed by Kaneko et al. included50 patients with metastatic CRC treated with oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy. After ROC curve analysis the NLR cut-off value was set to 4. In univariate analysis， a higher NLR value，hypoalbuminemia， and worse performance status was correlated with a shorter OS and PFS. In multivariate analysis， NLR (HR=4.39， 95% CI 1.82-10.7， p=0.0013) and thrombocytosis (HR=5.02， 95% CI 1.69-13.4； p=0.0066) were the only variables that were significantly associated with OS 通用删除6(英):<u>[50]</u>.\n\n【28】A retrospective analysis of104 patients with CRCwithunresectable liver metastases who were treated with liver radioembolization after failing first and second-line chemotherapy found that NLR could be a valuable biomarker for predicting outcome in these patients. A cutoff value of 5 was determined using ROC analysis. The median survival time for patients with elevated NLR was 5.6 vs. 10.6 months. A high NLR value， a lack of radiographic response after radioembolization， and the presence of extrahepatic illness were all independently correlated with an increased risk of death in a multivariate analysis通用删除6(英):<u>[51</u>J.\n\n【29】Platelet-to-Lym phocyte Ratio (PLR)\n\n【30】Similar to neutrophils platelets are a common blood component with a significant role in the antitumoral inflammatory response. Thrombocytosis is frequently detected in solid tumor patients with persistent inflammation 通用删除6(英):<u>[52，53]</u>. Platelets can stimulate tumor growth by secreting a variety of cytokines and growth factors in the tumor microenvironment that are conducive to tumor growth and invasion. The main cytokines are proangiogenic factors such as Vascular Epidermal Growth Factor (VEGF) and Transforming Growth Factor-Beta (TGF-B). PLR is a well-known prognostic factor for CRC， an increase in platelet count is usually associated with a decrease in lymphocyte count.\n\n【31】Most studies assessed or compared the Platelet-Lymphocyte Ratio (PLR) to the NLR. In a retrospective study conducted by Emir et al.， PLR was assessed in three groups of patients： The first with only colorectal polyps (n=100； Group A)， the second with CRC (n=113； Group B)， and the third with solely healthy people (n=124； Group C). Patients in group B had a higher median NLR and PLR value compared to patients in groups A and C. There was no significant difference between groups A and C regarding NLR and PLR 通用删除6(英):<u>[54]</u>.\n\n【32】Ishizuka et al. assessed the predictive value of an inflammation-based prognostic score which includes platelet count and the NLR in retrospective research on 490 patients with resectable CRC. The COP-NLR (Combination of Platelet count and Neutrophil to Lymphocyte Ratio)， was calculated as follows： Patients with elevated NLR (>3) and elevated platelet count (>30×104mm) were allocated 2 points， and patients with only one parameter elevated parameter had a score of 1. Patients with no elevated parameters had a score of 0.

While only the NLR was verified as an independent predictive factor for OS in multivariate analysis， elevated levels of both the NLRand PLR were related to a shorter OS time in univariate analysis， showing that the NLR is preferable to the PLR as a prognostic factor for survival in CRC patients 通用删除6(英):<u>[57]</u>.\n\n【35】Ir.a retrospective study by Erstad et al.， 151 patients with Colorectal Liver Metastases (CRLM) who underwent liver resection a PLR>220 and an NLR>5 were independent variables that decreased OS in both univariate as well as multivariate analysis 通用删除6(英):<u>[58]</u>.\n\n【36】The role of PLR as a predictive factor for patients with resected CRLM was evaluated in a retrospective study by Neofytou et al.； preoperative NLR was high (>2.4) in 53 patients while preoperative PLR was high (>150) in 58 patients. Elevated NLR and PLR were associated with decreased OS and PFS in univariate analysis， while only PLR remained significantly associated with PFS and OS in multivariate analysis通用删除6(英):<u> 59]</u>.\n\n【37】Lym phocyte-to-Monocyte Ratio (LMR)\n\n【38】Monocytes play a vital role in tumor growth in the tumor microenvironment. Tumor-Associated Macrophages (TAMs) are formed when monocytes differentiate into protumoral macrophages as a result of the tumor microenvironment. TAMs can contribute to tumor infiltration and metastasis. Circulating lymphocytes， on the other hand， can transform into Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes(TILs) by migrating into the tumor microenvironment； it has been established that stage III CRC patients with a high number of TILs had a better prognosis 通用删除6(英):<u>[60，61]</u>.\n\n【39】Zhang et al. reported in a study done on 270 patients with resected T3N0M0 CRC that an elevated monocyte count(>595/mm) was correlated with poor OS and DFS 通用删除6(英):<u>[62]</u>. Similarly， Sasaki et al. reported that an elevated monocyte count(>300/mm’) was associated with poor CSS in CRC patients with liver metastases who underwent Imetastasectomy 通用删除6(英):<u>[63]</u>.\n\n【40】A study of 372 patients with stage II and III colon cancer found that patients with preoperative LMR>2.83 had significantly better time-to-recurrence and OS than patients with LMR≤2.83 and that the benefit of adjuvant 5-FU-based chemotherapy was limited to patients with LMR>2.83. Increased preoperative LMR was associated with longer time-to-recurrence (HR=0.47， 95% CI： 0.29-0.76， p=0.002) and OS (HR=0.48， 95% CI： 0.29-0.78，p=0.003) in univariate analysis and remained significant in multivariate analysis for both time-to-recurrence and OS 通用删除6(英):<u>[64]</u>.\n\nChang et al. were the first to use SIS as a predictive factor in patients with renal cell carcinoma. SIS is a novelprognostic modelthat uses the serum albumin level and LMR. Patients with albumin >4.0 g/dL and LMR>4.44 were assigned a score of 0， patients with albumin>4.0 g/dL and LMR>4.44 were assigned a score of 2， and everyone else was assigned a score of 1 通用删除6(英):<u>[65]</u>. Suzuki et al. examined 727 stages|删除段之间换行|I-IV CRC patients who underwent curative resection and found that higher SIS and higher mGPS scores were both independently related to a worse prognosis 通用删除6(英):<u>[66]</u>. By using a time-dependent ROC curve to assess the prediction abilities of SIS and mGPS， they discovered that SIS was a better prognostic model for OS than mGPS.\n\n【42】CRP-Related Markers\n\n【43】CRP is an excellent biomarker to evaluate the inflammation status of cancer patients. As a prognostic factor in CRC Koike et al. evaluated 300 patients with CRC and showed that a high preoperative value ofCRP (>0.5 mg/dL) wasan independent predictor ofprognosis通用删除6(英):<u>[67]</u>. Another CRP-related prognostic marker is the Lymphocyte-C-Reactive protein ratio (LCR). In a large retrospective study by Suzuki et al.， they evaluated the prognostic value of 16 inflammation-related markers such as NLR， LMR， PLR， Neutrophil-to-Albumin Ratio(NAR)， Monocyte-Albumin (MAR)， Platelet-Albumin Ratio (PAR) and LCR in 1303 patients with stage II-III CRC. The study reported that a low LCR value (≤ 12，980) was associated with a lower OS and DFS median time 通用删除6(英):<u>[68]</u>.\n\n【44】A similar prognostic marker to LCR for CRC survival is CAR(C-reactive protein-to-albumin ratio). Several studies have evaluated the role of CAR in postoperative CRC survival， the main consensus is that a higher value is significantly correlated to a shorter OS and CSS 通用删除6(英):<u>[69-71]</u>.\n\n【45】Discussion\n\n【46】One of the most important indications of tumor development ISthe cancer-associatedsystemic inflammatory response.The relationship between hematological indicators of the systemic inflammatory response and survival outcomes in cancer patients has been an intensely studied subject. One of the most important indications of tumor development is the cancer-associated systemic inflammatory response. Numerous previous studies have identified serum systemic inflammatory markers that can be used to predict prognoses， such as the Glasgow Prognostic Score and the modified Glasgow Prognostic (GPS/mGPS)， Neutrophil-Lymphocyte Ratio(NLR)， Lymphocyte-Monocyte Ratio (LMR)， Platelet-Lymphocyte Ratio (PLR)， LCR (Lymphocyte-C-Reactive protein ratio)， SIS(Systemic Inflammation Score). One of the biggest advantages of these markers is their availability by use of routine blood examinations.\n\n【47】Despite these advantages， the majority of studies that evaluated potential inflammatory prognostic markers are retrospective in nature and do not have a shared platform of exclusion criteria regarding patient pathologies or treatments that could skew the blood cell count. Also， the best cut-off value can vary between patient groups and cancer types， which makes any conclusion regarding the clinical utility of these scores difficult. However， the results of the studies presented in this review suggest that inflammatory biomarkers of prognosis have value in patients treated with curative intent， in patients with advanced CRC that receive palliative chemotherapy where inflammation scores have been associated with PFS， and in patients with resectable liver or lung metastases where inflammation scores seem to be associated with a poor DFS.\n\n【48】In this review， we have analyzed the main inflammatory biomarkers that havebeen developed andvalidated，and accumulating evidence suggests that inflammation-based biomarkers appear to be independent powerful prognostic indicators； thus， combining these criteria with traditional clinicopathological markers may be beneficial. Further prospective research is needed to find the optimal删除1换行cut-off values.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

The individual who takes the drug assigns multiple meanings both to the drug itself and to the fact of taking it 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. Considering that today's patients often seek diagnosis online before visiting a doctor， and verify the recommendations received after the appointment itself， they often arrive at their doctor's doorstep having already formed a preconceived opinion about their alleged condition and the treatment required. In some cases， this can make consultation easier； in others， it may result in increased difficulties in introducing the correct drug therapy. In the latter case， the doctor's clinical experience may prove to be of paramount importance 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. This paper describes the case of an individual suffering from generalized anxiety disorder who presented for counselling with a self-diagnosis of dissociation and a hesitant attitude towards pharmacological treatment. The first step enabling the introduction of treatment was to reformulate the patient's prior beliefs.\n\n【2】Case Presentation\n\n【3】A 38-year-old IT company employee came forward with complaints of \"derealization and dissociation\"， which he diagnosed himselfwith based on descriptions available online， claiming that“there are no cures for this\"， also based on internet sources.\n\n【4】First appointment\n\n【5】通用间距删除-1:<u>OPEN ACCESS</u>\n\n【6】通用间距删除-1:<u>Correspondence：</u>\n\n【7】通用间距删除-1:<u>Slawomir Murawiec， Mental Health Centre， Harmonia Luxmed Medical Centre， Warsaw， Poland，</u>\n\n【8】The patient described the symptoms experienced in a way that mostly corresponded to his self-diagnosed condition， saying： \"I have been in a state of permanent dissociation and derealization for3 weeks. In these states， I feel like I'm doing everything on autopilot； my consciousness is watching what I'm doing； these states are exacerbated in stressful situations. My stress resistance has dropped to zero.\"Further， he added the following： \"I have also read that there is no treatment for dissociation and derealization， only psychotherapy can help.\n\n【9】删除7:<u>删除1:<u>E-mail： smurawiec@gmail.com Received Date： 14 Feb 2023Accepted Date： 23 Feb 2023Published Date： 27 Feb 2023 Citation：</u></u>\n\n【10】The meaning structure imposed by the patient at the onset of the appointment was based on a diagnosis formulated by the patient himself and a narrowing of the range of treatment options available. Yet， at the same time， the patient reported to a psychiatrist rather than a psychotherapist， which indicated uncertainty about his own attitude. During anamnesis， it was established that the patient had already experienced such a state of mind before. He recounted： \"I had already felt like this at one point， the previous time was after a party， during which I had taken a psychoactive substance.\n\n【11】Murawiec S.

Sharing this concern expanded the scope of the conversation to include a new area： Anxiety. This made it possible to go beyond the meaning of \"dissociation and derealization\"-for which \"there are no cures\"- as proposed at the beginning. It soon turned out that the patient was facing an increased workload and experienced more pressure at work (which he caused himself) and believed his workplace intellectual performance to be declining. His interpretation was as follows： \"I am not so efficient at work because I had damaged my brain at that time； this damage has permanent consequences\".\n\n【13】Subsequent statements by the patient directly pointed to anxiety symptoms\n\n【14】“My thoughts are that I'm very scared it's going to get worse； I'm going to run out of strength to fight it. I feel like I'm losing my identity in a way. I have this question about who I am， what I want and what is important lingering over my head. Profoundly philosophical. I am afraid this condition will get worse. I am afraid that something might happen to me， a serious illness. If I wake up in this state at night， allI want to do is survive； sometimes panic sets in.\"\n\n【15】He also reported experiencing a “constant feeling of anxiety\"and claimed： \"I have always been thinking of what might go wrong； my head couldn’t stop； I would go from a minor thing to tragic consequences. The patient had a multifaceted neurological diagnosis. No features of CNS neurological problems were found.\n\n【16】This statement by the patient also indicated another aspect of the treatment that proved crucial. One important value for the patient was his identity -the question \"Who am I?\". Indeed， this question made the context of treatment more meaningful still. It made it clear that the patient would not accept treatment that would lead to a subjectively discernible violation of his sense of identity. The patient needed to be in control of himself and that which concerned him. After all， he reported to the doctor with a ready-made self-diagnosis and views on the possibility of receiving help. In the subsequent part of the conversation，he stressed the importance of his sense of self， of who he was.\n\n【17】After reformulating the diagnosis from1“dissociationi and derealization\" to \"anxiety disorder\"， to which the patient agreed，he was presented with a description of generalized anxiety disorder. The patient fully identified with this description. Treatment with pregabalin was then suggested， which included a reference to the presentation ofdrug-related information and the summary ofproduct characteristics. The remainder of the visit was spent discussing the patient's fears， anxieties and beliefs about the possible use of the drug. While the patient ultimately agreed to take pregabalin， he did indicate that he had an appointment with another psychiatrist to get a \"second opinion\".\n\n【18】Further treatment stages\n\n【19】The second opinion he sought confirmed the recommendation to take pregabalin. At the follow-up appointment， the patient reported that \"This drug has helped a little， I don't have as many panic attacks\". He was taking 75 mg of pregabalin at the time； however， he did not consent to an increase in the dosage of the drug. He feared that taking higher doses would make him lose his identity. Subsequent appointments with the patient can be described as a \"negotiation\"between the desire to take higher doses of pregabalin， linked to perceived improvements in mood and function， and fears of losing control. Although the patient had carefully read the information about the drug， including the dose range starting from 150 mg， and did not dispute this information，he expressed strong concerns about increasing the drug dosage (and simultaneously a desire to do so). These concerns applied even to the threshold dose indicated in the leaflet. The patient was concerned about losing control over himself and his well-being， as well as suffering a loss of identity， and feeling a sense of dependence on a drug-a factor beyond his control.\n\n【20】After increasing the dose of pregabalin to 150 mg， the patient experienced a marked improvement， including in terms of mood and function throughout the day. As a result， he grew even more hesitant删除1换行about the drug he was taking. The drug's effect proved to be very helpful； the irritating and function-limiting symptoms he had been suffering from for years began to disappear. On the other hand， this confronted the patient with the feeling that his well-being was not entirely up to him and was not fully un der his control， raising his fear and，ironically， creating some anxiety. Nonetheless， so great were the benefits of taking pregabalin that the patient opted for another dose increase to 225 mg. The features of generalized anxiety have subsided， and the patient's functioning in many spheres has significantly expanded in capacity. The patient reframed his mindset， recognizing that “I'm myself the way I am now\". He was satisfied with the new opportunities to meet other people (which had previously been significantly limited)， to travel and go on trips， and the significant improvement in his workplace status and image.\n\n【21】Conclusions\n\n【22】An important feature of generalized anxiety disorder is a specific form of anxiety- thinking of negative scenarios of future events， anticipatory anxiety and having anxious thoughts about the future. Individuals suffering from this disorder often craft elaborate scenarios full of negative expectations based only on a piece oftrivial information 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>.\n\n【23】Their anxiety can take many forms， some of which do not directly indicate that they are experiencing it. Patient complaints can include a range of somatic and psychological symptoms， as well as a variety of behaviors. To formulate a diagnosis， it is necessary to carry out a more thorough history taking and discuss with the patient the content of the experiences underlying the reported symptoms.\n\nIndividuals suffering from anxiety may express fear of SDe treatment and various aspects of it， including those of a highly improbable nature. This fear should be thoroughly discussed to ensure the patient's cooperation in treatment.

Three months earlier， the patient had been fully independent， with no previous cognitive difficulties. Language and executive function were the first to be affected. Attention and memory were initiallypreserved. Within a few weeks， however， he had become restless， disorientated， and dependent on others for basic activities of daily living. We therefore carried out cerebral scintigraphy， which showed a discrete bilateral parietal and posterior cingular hypofixation compatible with early Alzheimer's disease (AD) and a second lumbar puncture.\n\n【18】Two months before presenting at our Geriatric Department， our patient developed predominantly left peripheral bilateral facial palsy (House Brackmann III left and II right) without any cognitive impairment. He had then undergone initial neurologic assessment at another hospital. CSF analysis highlighted lymphocytic meningitis performed then. Infection workup with PCR HSV， VzV and Lyme antibodies in the CSF was negative. Miller-Fisher and Guillain-Barre Syndromes were excluded on the basis of a lower-limb EMG and the absence of anti-GQ1b antibodies. No facial Electroneuromyography(ENMG) was performed. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) showed FLAIR hyperintensity in the right head of the caudate nucleus and the right anterior arm of the internal capsule； this was consistent with ischemic lesions.\n\n【19】The second CSF analysis showed pleocytosis with 34 cells/mm. Cytomorphological examination of the CSF showed abnormal lymphocytes highly suggestive of lymphoid malignancy .

Multidisciplinary tumor board advised neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (weekly administration of five cycles ofneoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (intravenous carboplatin (AUC2mg/mLper min) and intravenous paclitaxel (50 mg/m通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> of body-surface area) for 23 days) with concurrent radiotherapy(41-4 Gy， given in 23 fractions of 18 Gy on 5 days per week) followed by esophagectomy after restaging. Six weeks after the end of neoadjuvant therapy his dysphagia had disappeared (clinical response) but he presented with fatigue， dyspnea， and fever (39C). Oxygen saturation was 85%， CRP=60 mg/L and leukocyte count is 9.3×10/L. CT-scan showed the typical image of radiation pneumonitis  which corresponded completely with the margins of the irradiated field. The subsequent weeks were notable for progressively worsening of his pulmonary condition despite administration of prolonged steroids and antibiotics and he ultimately expired.\n\n【2】Depending on patient-specific factors， radiation dose， and tumor site， radiation-induced lung injury may occur. This is a typical case of radiation pneumonitis， which usually occurs between 1and 6 months after the completion of radiation therapy. The radiation dose given in the neoadjuvant setting is relatively low， making this an extremely rare complication of neoadjuvant therapy for esophageal cancer. It is treated with steroids and antibiotics to prevent the patient form bacterial pulmonary superinfections.\n\n【3】通用结尾删除-1:<u>OPEN ACCESS</u>\n\n【4】删除7:<u>通用结尾删除-1:<u>Correspondence：Lagarde SM， Department of Surgery， Erasmus MC， Rotterdam， The Netherlands.

He had a past medical history of hypertension， dyslipidemia and acute myocardial infarction in 2008. His daily medication included bisoprolol， rosuvastatine， enalapril and hydrochlorothiazide. He lived in an urban area， with no exposure to biomass burning and had no pets. He worked as stonemason， carving marble for 38years and had also worked with wood and upholstery. He reported a 12-month history of dyspnea on exertion， worsened after SARS-CoV-2 infection (3 months earlier). Chest High Resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT) at the time of infection revealed diffuse Ground Grass Opacities(GGOs)， subpleural reticulation and traction bronchiectasis with upper lobe predominance， and also mediastinal lymph nodes with “eggshell” calcification.

In face of a reasonable doubt pending on the definitive diagnosis， it was decided in multidisciplinary discussion LOperform transbronchiaalllung cryobiopsy， which histology showed interstitial focal fibrosis with accumulations of dust-laden macrophages and a significant number of lightly birefringent particles seen under polarized light； no silicotic nodules were observed . These morphologic aspects were consistent with silica and other less fibrogenic dust exposure， such as iron and silicates (mixed dust fibrosis).

There are less than 10 reported cases of orbital myxofibrosarcoma. The authors report a case of a patient with a previous resected low-grade myxofibrosarcoma in the right orbit， who 16-years later presented with the same tumor. This first recurrence was resected， leaving a residual mass. Two years later， the patient presented with an extensive mass in the right orbit， sinuses， and nasal cavities.

The risk of metastasis ofthis type of tumor depends on the degree ofhistological differentiation. But local recurrence rate is similar for all with an increase of metastasis risk with every recurrence. Due to the few cases reported there are no standardized management guidelines. However， it is recommended wide surgical margins be associated with postoperative radiotherapy in the presence of residual lesions or high-grade tumors.\n\n【2】Keywords： Myxofibrosarcoma； Orbital； Proptosis\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Myxofibrosarcoma (MFS) is the most common type of fibroblastic sarcoma in elderly patients. It is a slow-growing mesenchymal tumor that usually occurs in the extremities 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Its orbital location is extremely rare as there are few cases described in the literature at the moment of this review. Therefore， there are notreatments guidelines available for this disease， thus the authors present this case of a recurrent orbital myxofibrosarcoma in order to collaborate towards future studies and this orbital tumor management.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 73-year-old woman presented with a 5-month painful right proptosis and a same-side Ipro exodeviation. Her past medical history was significant for a right orbital mass resection reported by an external hospital as a low-grade myxofibrosarcoma 16 years earlier. Her other medical background included arterial hypertension， dyslipidemia， fibromyalgia， essential tremor， suspended tobacco use， and she had been treated for a depressive episode. The patient was taking atorvastatin and sertraline， at the moment of presentation.\n\n【7】On the first physical examination， she presented with an obvious right exophthalmos and exotropia . Uncorrected visual acuity was 20/150 in the Right Eye (RE) and 20/20 in the Left Eye (LE). Intraocular pressure was normal in both eyes. Slit-lamp examination was unremarkable. Fundus examination revealed a congested right optic disc.\n\n【8】Computerized Tomography scans (CTs) revealed a thrombosed right orbital vascular malformation and Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA) revealed an orbital mass with a vascularized component in the internal portion of the right orbit .\n\n【9】Considering the patient's background， a relapse of the original tumor was suspected. Thus， a transcaruncular orbitotomy with excisional biopsy of the lesion was performed. The mass was lobular and solid in appearance， of medial location， and deep extension， almost reaching the orbital apex. Due to the lesion size， it was necessary to widen the surgical field with a vertical division of the upper eyelid at 5 mm from the superior punctum. The resected mass was 50 mmx30mmx19mm .删除1换行cited.\n\nHistologic examination revealed fused cells， ofelongated， oval， round nuclei， some pleomorphic and hyperchromatic， eosinophilic cytoplasm， mitotic count of 1 to 3 in 10 fields of higher magnification.Stroma with mild to moderate inflammatoryelements of lymphocyte type， congestive|删除段之间换行|vascularization， hyalinized fibrosis， myxoid areas. No necrosis was found.Immunohistochemical analysis of the tumor cells was positive for vimentin， desmin， ki-67 positive in 10% of the nucleuses and CD34 in 80% of the cells negative for S100 and actine. These features were suggestive of low-grade myxofibrosarcoma.\n\n【11】Due to the presence of tumor in the surgical margin of the biopsy a post-surgical CT was done， which confirmed the presence of a residual mass. This case was presented to the oncology committee to evaluate the need for exenteration of coadjuvant therapy. Consensus was not reached. Therefore， no further procedures were done.\n\nThe patient stayed asymptomatic during medical follow-up for two years， after that period， the patient presented with two-week paresthesia of the right orbital region， progressive exophthalmos， and a recurrent nosebleed from the same side. On examination， the patient showed greater proptosis in the right eye. The evaluation by otolaryngology revealed a nasal cavity mass. Resonance revealed an extensive mass centered in the perinasal cavities of about 60 mmx50 mm x 62 mm. The tumor occupied the ethmoid cells， maxillary|删除段之间换行|Through the nasal passage， a new biopsy was performed. It was diagnosed as high-grade myxofibrosarcoma. The case was presented again to the oncology committee， along the lesion was out of surgical reach. It was decided that palliative care management and palliative radiotherapy was the best option for this patient.\n\n【13】Discussion\n\n【14】Myxofibrosarcoma (MFS)， previously called malignant myxoid fibrous histiocytoma， is one of the most common fibroblastic sarcomas in elderlypatients (20%). It is a slow-growing mesenchymal tumor that usually occurs in the extremities， and its orbital location is extremely rare 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. In the literature there are less than 10 reported cases of orbital myxofibrosarcoma， however， it is likely that there is an underreporting due to the change in its nomenclature in recent years 通用删除6(英):<u>[2-10]</u>. In 2002， the World Health Organization modified the classification of MFS， so that part of the previously reported orbital Malignant Fibrous Histiocytomas (MFH) could correspond to the same entity， unlike other subtypes of FMH (pleomorphic， giant cell and inflammatory) that did not represent a defined entity通用删除6(英):<u>[11，12]</u>. Characteristics of the previous studies are summarized in Supplementary Table 1； however it was not possible to find the full article of the work by Imai et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>.\n\n【15】The clinical behavior of myxofibrosarcomas is related to the degree of histological differentiation. Low-grade tumors have a low probability of metastasizing (20%)， however the local recurrence rate is similar for all tumor grades， with rates ranging between 17% and60%， and with each new recurrence the risk of metastasis recurrence increases 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，8，13，14]</u>. The high rates of local recurrence could be explained by the frequent vascular extension of the tumor 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>. Recent studies have shown that the only significant predictor of local recurrence risk is the surgical margin 通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u>. Risk factors associated with disease-specific mortality are size greater than 5 cm， tumor necrosis， and <75% myxoid component on histology 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>. Compared to other soft tissue sarcomas， MFS have better survival， since a 5-year survival rate is estimated at 64% to 77% in high-grade MFS 通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>.\n\n【16】Managing these patients is a real challenge. The described infiltrative character makes it very difficult to define the tumor margins， increasing the probability of residual lesions and therefore of local recurrence.In addition，each recurrence increases the probability of having higher-grade lesions， and therefore of metastasizing. The few cases reported to date do not allow for standardized management删除1换行guidelines， but in general， resection with wide surgical margins is recommended， associated with postoperative radiotherapy in the presence of residuallesions or high-grade tumors.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

However， the development of PET/CT system， which includes a digital PET/CT system and reconstruction algorithms， has been shown to increase the detection and visualization of internal properties for breast cancer due to its higher spatial resolution 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. Here we report a case of breast cancer in which heterogeneous IBF-FDG accumulation demonstrated on digital PET/CT correlated with intratumoral heterogeneity histopathologically.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 56-year-old Japanese woman presented to our medical center with a palpable mass in her right breast. She had no previous or family history of breast or ovarian cancer. Elastic hard mass was palpable in her right breast. Mammography and ultrasound revealed a lobulated shaped mass in the breast and multiple enlarged lymph nodes in the right axilla suspicious of breast cancer with multiple axillary lymph node metastases. The internal echo was homogeneous on ultrasound. The MRI appearance was of a lobulated mass surrounded by slight rim and septal enhancement within the tumor. Biopsy of the lesion revealed invasive ductal carcinoma.\n\n【7】The patient underwent 'F-FDG PET/CT of the right breast and axillary lesions as part of the preoperative work-up. Scanning was performed using a digital PET/CT scanner (Discovery MI； GE Medical Systems， Milwaukee， WI) about 60 min after the intravenous administration of 5.49MBq/kg oflF-FDG. PET was performed from the skull base to the proximal thigh with the patient in the supine position； the patient was then moved into the prone position using a hand-made breast positioning device， and single-bed PET/CT was performed of the breast region alone. The CT and PET acquisition parameters were as follows. Non-contrast whole-body and additional regional CT scans were obtained at 120 kV with automatic dose modulation， and PET was performed with acquisition time of 2.10 min per bed position in three-dimensional mode. The PET images were then reconstructed using Q.Clear (GE Medical Systems； B=400) with attenuation correction. The删除1换行interval between the two PET/CT scans was 17 min. The images revealed marked focal IF-FDG uptake with SUVmax of 27.9 that corresponded to the breast lesion identified on other modalities. The tumor appeared heterogeneous accumulation on PET image . No distant metastases were detected. The clinical staging was T2N1M0 Stage II. Right modified radical mastectomy was performed. Histological analysis revealed invasive ductal carcinoma， mixed type， with pleomorphic carcinoma components. The histological appearance was of a mixed tumor with solid and cystic components bounded by fibrous septa. Areas with abundant tumor cells in the lesion identified with Hematoxylin and Eosin (HE) staining and with Ki-67 staining matched the site of marked IF-FDG accumulation seen on the PET images， and fibrotic or cystic sites corresponded with areas of hypo-1F-FDG accumulation seen on the PET images.\n\n【8】Discussion\n\n【9】In the present case of invasive ductal carcinoma， the tumor demonstrated heterogeneous accumulation on PET that correlated to intratumoral heterogeneity histopathologically.\n\n【10】The role of PET/CT in breast cancer has been the pre-treatment systemic staging of locally advanced breast cancer. Several breast cancer guidelines have not recommended PET/CT for women with删除1换行apparent early-stage breast cancer or even for those with operable stage III breast cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. The use of PET/CT for imaging primary breast lesions is hampered by its low spatial resolution， which reduces its sensitivity by missing small lesions； in addition， it is less sensitive than sentinel lymph node biopsy for assessing axillary lymph node involvement. The low prevalence of distant metastases in these patients and the relatively high risk of false-positive findings are considered to detract from the usefulness of PET/CT for distant staging in these patients 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>.\n\n【11】The development of dedicated Breast PET (dBPET) systems has enabled detailed high-resolution imaging by setting the detector close to breast lesion. An association between baseline tumor glycolytic activity and tumor biology have been reported. Masumoto et al. reported that intratumoral heterogeneity on dBPET can predict the malignancy grade of breast cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. They considered that such intratumoral heterogeneity could not be demonstrated on conventional PET/CT. However， the dBPET is specialized for breast scan， it cannot obtain whole-body image at same equipment.\n\n【12】Advances in PET/CT technology have improved image quality and the ability to detect small lesions. In a previous study， the quantitation and detectability of sub-centimeter spheres was higher with a digital PET/CT system compared with conventional OSEM-based reconstruction 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. In the present case of invasive ductal carcinoma， PET/CT imaging acquired with a digital PET/CT system demonstrated heterogeneous 18F-FDG accumulation. A. marked abundance of tumor cells identified within the lesion histopathologically with HE staining matched the region of marked18F-FDG accumulation identified on the PET images， and fibrotic and cystic sites matched those of 1F-FDG hypo-accumulation. It is known that US and MRI have high tissue resolution； however， the present case shows the ability of digital PET/CT to evaluate the internal properties of tumors.\n\n【13】In conclusion， we report a case of invasive ductal carcinoma that demonstrated heterogeneous IF-FDG accumulation on novel digital PET/CT that correlated to histopathological intratumoral heterogeneity.

The presented case-reports illustrate both entities and the difficulties faced in its differential diagnosis， as well as the utility of US on their detection and management. On the first case， patient presented the typical clinical features and risk factors of AVM. The US findings included the classical highly-specific signs： Multiple hypoechoic myometrial spaces with multidirectional turbulent high velocity flow seen on color Doppler US， and prominent parametrial vessels. On the second case， the clinical presentation and the background of curettages prior to the current pregnancy led the medical team to initially suspect AVM， even when the patient did present the three sonographic signs with higher PPV for RPOC diagnosis： A well-defined endometrial mass， a thickened endometrium， and endometrial vascularization. Key point on US differential diagnosis between the two entities is the presence of endometrial vascularization vs. exclusively myometrial vascularization.\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Early or late PPH are common complications in the obstetric wards worldwide. The differential diagnosis for early PPH -which happens within the first 24 h after delivery- includes uterine atony， lacerations， coagulopathies and RPOC； while for late or secondary PPH -which happens between 1day and 12 weeks after delivery-RPOC， endometritis， subinvolution of the placental implantation site， coagulopathies and AVM should be taken into consideration 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，21</u>.\n\n【5】RPOC are intrauterine tissues developed after conception which persist after birth， miscarriage or pregnancytermination. The anatomopathological diagnosis is based on the presence of chorionic villi. Incidence of RPOC is remarkable (about 17% during the 1% term， 40% during the 2n term and 3% during 3 term deliveries， with an estimated incidence of 3% to 5% for on-term vaginal births) 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. The most prevalent risk factors are previous retained placenta， maternal age， previous dilation and curettage， caesarean section or uterine surgery， labor induction， pre-term birth， uterine malformation andplacental features such as velamentous cord insertion or placentalimplantation site通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. Complications include PPH，endometritis， and in fertility related to the formation ofintrauterine adherences and scar tissue 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，5]</u>. There is a lack of a formal consensus on diagnostic sonographic or imaging criteria regarding RPOC， although US has a key role on its detection and management when there is a clinical suspicion. Treatment options range from expectant management to medical-induced expulsion or surgical resection of RPOC (via curettage or hysteroscopy) depending on the presence and intensity of hemorrhage， the presence of concomitant infections and the sonographic characteristics of the placental remnants 通用删除6(英):<u>[5，6]</u>.\n\n【6】Acquired AVM is an infrequent cause of severe vaginal bleeding， in which uterine tissue damage -mainly caused by uterine instrumentation， or less likely in context of trophoblastic删除1换行disease， diethylstilbestrol exposure， neoplasms or infections- cause an abnormal arterio-venous communication without a capillary bed in between 通用删除6(英):<u>[7，8]</u>. Patients present with intermittent or severe vaginal bleeding， sometimes debuting days after birth or uterine instrumentation 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>. The gold standard for AVM diagnosis is angiography， showing early venous filling， with color Doppler US also being a reliable and available diagnostic tool. Active treatment for AVM is Uterine Artery Embolization (UAE) 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，7-9]</u>. Early differential diagnosis between RPOC and AVM may be challenging but it is key since the primary treatment for RPOC presenting with active severe bleeding (surgical resection of the remnants) may fatally worsen the hemorrhage in case of AVM.\n\n【7】Materials and Methods\n\n【8】On April 2020，a 37-year-old nullipara was admitted with Preterm Premature Rupture of Membranes (PPROM) and clinical chorioamnionitis at 17+5w. Antibiotic coverage was initiated.\n\n【9】During the expulsion of the fetus， she presented massive acute vaginal bleeding (1.4 L in 2 min). Patient underwent an emergent echo-guided suction curettage to evacuate the placenta and a Bakri Balloon was placed. Intra-surgery， she required transfusion with6 blood units and administration of vasoactive drugs to preserve hemodynamic stability. Patient was discharged asymptomatic 3days after the surgery. She was readmitted 5 days later presenting endometritis： endocervical culture was positive for E. coli BLEA. Treatment with Imipenem was started. Us showed a thickened endometrium of 69 mm with a solid mass of 28 mm x 27 mm with moderate vascularization on Doppler-US (color score 3)， compatible with RPOC .\n\n【10】A second echo-guided curettage was performed. Due to severe intra-surgical bleeding， patient required another Bakry Balloon placement and transfusion with 2 more blood units. After removing theeBakry Balloon， patient persisted asymptomatic andWas discharged. Two weeks later she was readmitted in hypovolemic shock， needing 2 more blood units and vasoactive drugs. US showed a thickened avascular endometrium of 34 mm and a heterogeneous and intensely vascularized myometrium，with important dilatation of the arcuate and radial arteries， and a nodular image of 28 mm ×13mm in its posterior wall， color score 4 with turbulent multidirectional high-velocity flow， suggestive of AVM .\n\n【11】Arteriography was performed， objectivizing hypertrophic uterine arteries with 4 points of arterio-venous fistula. Patient needed 2\n\n【12】On the second1 case， on December 2021， a 35-year-old nulliparous woman with an antecedent of two curettages in context of a therapeutic abortion due to fetal acrania and a posterior transfer of a cryopreserved embryo， presented early and late postpartum hemorrhage after a breech delivery instrumented with forceps at37+5w， with hemodynamic instability.\n\n【13】First transvaginal US performed in the emergency ward 16 h after delivery showed a thickened avascular endometrium of 40 mm， congruent with clots. An emergency transabdominal echo-guided suction curettage was performed 48 h afterbirth. During theprocedure，删除1换行myometrial zone was seen， with pulsatile vascularization and dubious continuity with the endometrial cavity， initially suspected to be an AVM.删除1换行a highly vascularized myometrial zone was sonographically detected on the upper third of the uterus， with pulsatile vascularization and dubious continuity with the endometrial cavity， initially suspected to be an AVM .\n\n【14】Due to this diagnosis suspicion and with the patient in progressive anemization (Hb 53 g/L)，angio-TCand UAE with resorbable material were performed. Vaginal bleeding receded. During the admission she was transfused with 8 blood units. A weeklater， a sonohysterography was performed， observing a 26 mm heterogeneous endometrial cavity with a solid heterogeneous formation of 53 mm x 22 mmx 41mm which appeared to depend on the left posterior-lateral uterine wall， with moderate vascularization on Doppler-US (color score 3)， suggestive of RPOC .\n\n【15】A consecutive attempt to evacuate the RPOC was made with a second echo-guided curettage， which resulted unsuccessful due to the intense vascularization of the remnants and the danger of massive bleeding， as well as the fact that they were intensely adhered to the删除1换行myometrium. As the patient was asymptomatic at the time， she was discharged with a sonographic control scheduled 3 weeks later.\n\n【16】However， a week later， she restarted profuse vaginal bleeding with secondary anemization， once the UAE was no longer effective due to reabsorption of the embolizing material. She needed transfusion with2 more blood units.\n\n【17】A multidisciplinary committee decided to practice a second UAE -this time with non-resorbable material- followed by a surgical hysteroscopy， in which RPOC intimately attached tothe myometrium were completely resected with bipolar loop . The patient is now asymptomatic.\n\n【18】Results and Discussion\n\n【19】On the first case， patient presented the typical clinical features and risk factors of AVM： Massive vaginal bleeding after two consecutive curettages for RPOC. The US findings included the classical highly-specific signs： multiple hypoechoic myometrial spaces with systolic and diastolic multidirectional turbulent high-velocity flow seen on color Doppler， and prominent parametrial vessels 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，7-9]</u>.\n\n【20】On the second case， the US image during the first attempt of echo-guided curettage -which showed a highly vascularized myometrial zone with pulsatile vascularization in continuity with the endometrial cavity- as well as the clinical presentation and the background of curettages prior to the current pregnancy， led the medical team to initially suspect AVM. Nevertheless， the patient did present the three sonographic signs with higher PPV for a RPOC diagnosis： A well- defined endometrial mass， a thickened endometrium， and endometrial vascularization 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，10]</u>. In RPOC， endometrial vascularized component is seen， while in AVM the abnormal vascularization is located exclusively in the myometrium.

Lactic acidosis although very rare is a serious complication of metformin use. It can be life-threatening with mortality as high as50% if not recognized and treated early. We report a rare case of fatal metformin poisoning due to severe lactic acidosis following a 40 yr old divorcee with primary infertility secondary to polycystic ovarian syndrome. Treatment of metformin induced lactic acidosis involves the use of renal replacement therapy， sodium bicarbonate infusion and general measures. This case was reported in order to alert physicians on the existence of this rare but life-threatening endocrine emergency. Late presentation was a major limiting factor in the management ofthis patient.\n\n【2】Keywords： Lactic acidosis； Metformin； Coma； Suicide\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Metformin， a dimethyl-biguanide， is a widely used oral anti-hyperglycemic agent used in the long-term treatment of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM)， polycystic ovarian syndrome and gestational diabetes 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，2]</u>. As a result of its efficacy， safety， lower tendency to Hypoglycemia， cardiovascular and metabolic benefits， it has become the first drug of choice in the treatment of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) 通用删除6(英):<u>[3，4]</u>. It acts primarily in the liver to reduce blood glucose by decreasing glucose output and， secondarily， in the peripheral tissues mainly in the muscles by increasing glucose uptake 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，5]</u>.\n\n【5】Although the most common adverse effects of metformin are mainly gastrointestinal (nausea， vomiting， diarrhea and abdominal discomfort)， it also has the potential to cause lactic acidosis. Metformin associated lactic acidosis has been reported even at therapeutic doses in patients with end stage renal disease， heart failure or liver disease 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. Therefore， caution must be exercised in administering such drugs in those groups of patients.\n\n【6】Studies have not shown any difference between the incidence of lactic acidosis in patients with diabetes taking metformin and those not taking metformin as reported in a meta-analysis of 194studies by Salpeter et al.， it however a recognized complication of metformin use 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. We present a fatal case of metformin associated lactic acidosis where interactions with benzodiazepines and nicotine may have potentiated the condition that led to the demise of the patient.\n\n【7】Case Presentation\n\n【8】A 40-year-old divorcee diagnosed with primary infertility secondary to polycystic ovarian syndrome， being treated with metformin 1000 mg daily. She was also taking Bromazepam 3 mg daily for clinically diagnosed depression. She was referred to the emergency of our hospital after deliberately ingesting about 100 tablets of metformin (100 g) 48 h earlier in a suicide attempt. At presentation， she was deeply unconscious with GCS of 3/15 on 100% oxygen via nasal prong. She had intravenous fluid and later vasopressors. The urethral catheter was in-situ and draining less than50 ml in 12 h and RBS was 122 mg/l. Blood pressure was 70/? mmHg， pulse rate was weak， and all extremities were cold and clammy. Chest findings were wide spread coarse crackles in all lung zones.\n\n【9】No jaundice or bleeding from anybody orifice. She had about three episodes of cardiac arrest and was resuscitated.\n\n【10】Results of laboratory investigations reported a hematocrit of 19.5%， Urea of 2.1 mmol/l， creatinine of 44 mmol/l，potassium of 5.6 mmol/l， bicarbonate of 13 mmol/l， sodium of 141 mmol/l， chloride of 123 mmol/l， whole blood lactate of 16.1 mmol/l normal range (0.5 mmol/1-1mmol/l)， urine toxicology positive for benzodiazepine and cotinine.\n\n【11】Liver function tests was normal (AST 28U/L， ALT 32U/L， GGT41U/L， and ALP 169U/L). After about four hours of resuscitation， the patient was confirmed clinically death as she had unrecordable oxygen saturation， fixed and dilated pupils.\n\n【12】Discussion and Conclusion\n\n【13】Lactic acidosis is a rare but life-threatening complication of metformin use and can occur at high doses of administration or at therapeutic doses in the background of end organ damage like， heart liver and kidney failure or in situations of cardiorespiratory compromise 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. The symptoms of lactic acidosis are non-specific， may include anorexia， nausea， vomiting， abdominal pain， lethargy， hyperventilation，and hypotension. It is clinically characterized bythe presence of pH<7.35， blood lactate levels of >2.0 and a PCO， of <42mmHg.\n\n【14】Although metformin associated lactic acidosis is a rare condition， with an estimated prevalence of one to five cases per 100，000populations， it has a reported mortality of 30% to 50% 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>.\n\n【15】Several studies have reported that the prognosis of individuals who develop lactic acidosis from the use of metformin is unrelated to plasma metformin concentration or lactate level 通用删除6(英):<u>[2，3]</u>.\n\n【16】Once ingested， metformin is absorbed in the gut via the enterocytes where it is transported to the liver through the portal circulation， in the liver； it causes an increase in the production of lactate by promoting glycolysis and causing a shift from aerobic to anaerobic respiration. Metformin induced lactic acidosis develops when there is an imbalance between increased lactate production and impaired metabolism and/or reduced lactate clearance.\n\n【17】The mechanism of Metformin induced lactic acidosis is due to the impairment of the clearance of lactate via inhibition of complex1 in the mitochondrial respiratory cycle 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. Despite the fact that metformin is considered safer than insulin or sulphonylureas due to its lesser tendency to hypoglycemia， the mortality in biguanides(6.1%) overdosing is much higher than overdoses of insulin and sulphonylureas (0.9 and 3.6%) respectively as reported in a study by Von March et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>. Interactions with other drugs like alcohol， benzodiazepines and barbiturates can potentiate the risk of developing lactic acidosis. Therefore， early diagnosis and initiation of intervention in the form of renal replacement therapy is important in order to restore blood lactate levels to normal. This is largely due to the fact that metformin does not bind to plasma proteins and is excreted mainly unchanged in the urine. The index patient presented late as such she could not benefit from the renal replacement therapy.\n\n【18】The type of renal replacement therapy to be instituted depends the nature of the metformin intoxication. In metformin overdose， Intermittent or continuous renal replacement therapy with Hemodiafiltration is recommended. This has been attributed to the fact that the reductions in the metformin plasma levels have been found to be correlated with improvement of lactic acidosis. Extracorporeal hemodialysis is preferred provided that the patient is hemodynamically stable. Discontinuation of treatment is indicated when lactate levels are lower than 3 mmol/L and pH is higher than7.35. Hypotension should be treated with intravenous fluids and vasopressors in order to restore the circulatory status to normal. Treatment of acid base disturbances is necessary in order to restore normal cellular function resulting from alterations in the cellular concentrations of Nat and Ca+ levels due the pH disturbances. The mainstay in the treatment of acidosis is to target the underlying删除1换行cause as the use of sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO，-) is controversial. In diseases where there is evidence of NaHCO.-losses， there is clear evidence ofthe benefit of replacement therapy. There are however no validated clinical studies on NaHCO，-replacement involving patients with lactic acidosis and hemodynamic instability.\n\n【19】At a certain point acidosis has a protective effect in anoxic or ischemic cell， this effect is however lost as the level of acidosis becomes severe. The indications for interfering in acidosis include pH<7.2，HCO，-<10 mmol/l， and base deficit >10 mmol/l. Mortality in metformin induced lactic acidosis can be as high as 50%， although that is lower than that of other causes of lactic acidosis (50% vs.74%) 通用删除6(英):<u>[9，10]</u>. Therefore， metformin induced lactic acidosis has a better prognosis than other causes of lactic acidosis like sepsis and circulatory failure. Benzodiazepines， when ingested alone are rarely associated with a high mortality or morbidity， but the risk of death rises exponentially when ingested with other drugs especially alcohol， opiates or other sedatives. The risk of death with benzodiazepines is largely due to the fact that they can cause apnea， a risk is highest with alprazolam 通用删除6(英):<u>[6，10]</u>. One of the limitations of our report is the inability to measure serum metformin levels which is not available in oiir center.\n\n【20】This case was reported in order to alert physicians and care givers on the existence of this rare butlife-threatening endocrine emergency. Early detection and institution of appropriate management measures is essential to survival. A Late presentation was a major limiting factor in the management of this patient. This is in addition to the interaction of metformin with benzodiazepines which by themselves can cause lactic acidosis and increased the risk of death of the patient. The inability to measure the serum levels and exclude sulphonyl urea is a major limitation in this study.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

Also， there was no statistical difference between the both eyes intraocular pressures， as shown in Table 5 and Figure 5.\n\n【48】Discussion\n\nIn recent， the use of prone position ventilation is becoming more widespread as an important measure in the treatment of ARDS. Upon meta-analysis of 8 randomized controlled trials over 12 vears， Munshi et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u> found that prolonged prone position ventilation (at least 12 h， or even longer than 16 h) reduced death rate of patients with moderate to severe ARDS (oxygenation index <200 mmHg) and that prone position ventilation was safe and feasible. However， during their treatment， changes in intraocular pressure due to prone position and even the resulting development and progression of glaucoma disease should be of concern to the majority of intensivists and ophthalmologists|删除段之间换行|Glaucoma is a group of eye diseases characterized by irreversible optic nerve damage and visual field defects that can lead to permanent impairment of visual function and even blindness in patients 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. Studies have found that optic nerve damage caused by glaucoma is mainly because of mechanical compression and ocular blood supply disorder induced by pathological increased intraocular pressure通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>. In the long-term high intraocular pressure or large fluctuations删除1换行in intraocular pressure， patients may have different degrees of eye distension， vision loss， headache on one side， and even nausea and vomiting， and in the advanced stage， patients may have irreversible visual field narrowing in the affected eye， tubular vision， night blindness， which will seriously affect patients lives 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>. Intraocular pressure refers to the tissue pressure against the wall of the eyeball， and under normal physiological conditions， the intraocular pressure of most people is maintained at 10 mmHg to 21 mmHg， with a difference between left and right eyeballs that is not greater than 5mmHg and a fluctuation between day time and night time that is not greater than 8 mmHg 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>. The stability of intraocular pressure is mainly dependent on the dynamic homeostasis between production and drainage of aqueous humor， and both increased production or obstruction of aqueous humor can cause increased intraocular pressiire.\n\n【50】In the above test results， it can be seen that there is a statistical difference between the intraocular pressure measured in the prone groups and supine groups. In the study of intraocular pressure during position change in the prone group， patients in the prone group had lower intraocular pressure when changing from prone to supine position and higher intraocular pressure when changing from supine to prone position. Also， during the period when the patients were in the prone position， the intraocular pressure increased further with the prolongation of the prone position. And the range of intraocular pressure changes caused by patients in prolonged prone position exceeds the physiological data in the 2017 Glaucoma Diagnosis and Consensus 通用删除6(英):<u>[121</u>.\n\n【51】According to current studies， the main factors of changes of intraocular pressure caused by postural changes may include advancement of iridolenticular diaphragm， venous pressure of episclera， blood pressure， ocular perfusion pressure and hormones通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>. The patients in this testing process were all severe ARDS patients in our ICU. In treatment， the blood pressure and hormones were controlled stably. The venous pressure of episcleral， however， is mainly dependent on the relative position between eyes and heart通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u>. In this experiment， due to the illness of patients， all patients in the two groups were always in lying position， the relative position between eyes and heart at supine position and prone position was virtually the same? Therefore， there was no clinical difference in terms of venous pressure of episcleral. So， we considered that the difference of intraocular pressure between the two groups and the change of intraocular pressure within the same group after change of body position were mainly caused by obstruction ofaqueous humor due to anterior displacement of the crystalline iris septum in the prone position. When a patient is at prone position， there is anterior删除1换行displacement of crystalline lens because of gravity which causes anterior displacement of the crystalline iris septum and reduced the depth of anterior chamber. As a result， the anterior chamber angle is narrowed and the lens is widely and tightly connected to the iris forming a pupillary block caused obstruction of aqueous humor， resulting in increased intraocular pressure， as shown in Figure 6.\n\n【52】There was also similar report of this idea in the study by Anderson et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>， who also found higher intraocular pressure and shallower the anterior chamber depth in the prone position compared to the supine position， the same results as our test， and they found no significant change in the anterior chamber depth between the supine and prone position. Prior to this， Lam et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u> considered that the proneposition did notlastlongenough (4min) to cause changes in the anterior chamber depth. But in our study， some patients with ARDS have to be ventilated in prone position ventilation for a long time due to the necessity of their treatment， it means they had to suffer high intraocular pressure for a long term but cannot avoid the significant fluctuation of intraocular pressure caused by change of body position. Although the body maintains hemodynamic stability after a change in body position through a series of regulatory mechanisms， including self-regulation and venous and arterial systems， and neurological reflexes， which regulate intraocular pressure to some extent 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>. However， prolonged exposure to such pathologically high intraocular pressure and frequent large fluctuations in intraocular pressure may cause damage to the optic nerve cells， affecting visual acuity and visual function and causing irreversible glaucoma damage. And in the treatment of ARDS patients， besides paying attention to the systemic prognosis， their long-term complications and quality of life are also something we cannot ignore. Therefore， for ARDS patients who have to receive prone position ventilation and patients with high risk of glaucoma， early predication and diagnosis of eye diseases should be performed before serious visual impairment is caused， so as to give corresponding treatment通用删除6(英):<u> 18]</u>.\n\n【53】In summary， throughout the testing process， some ARDS patients have had their intraocular pressure altered beyond normal physiological standards due to the need to maintain a special body position for long periods of time. Since the increased intraocular pressure and its significant fluctuation caused by unfavorable body positions cannot be avoided， it's a major problem to be addressed in guaranteeing effective treatment to patients while reducing or avoiding increased intraocular pressure and the irreversible impairment to optic nerves and visual field. At last， we hope that this study will provide some reference for clinicians to alert relevant departments that need to perform prone ventilation on patients， so that more physicians will be aware of the changes in intraocular pressure and the increased risk of glaucoma in these patients.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

Despite close monitoring by PCR and early treatment with combined foscarnet and ganciclovir， a rapid and fatal evolution was observed.\n\n【8】Case Presentation\n\n【9】A 42-year-old Caucasian male with no relevant personal medical history was diagnosed with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia with t(9；22) (q34.1；q11.2) in June 2022. He received intensive induction chemotherapy with vincristine， daunorubicin， prednisone plus imatinib (600 mg daily) and standard intrathecal chemotherapy， achieving morphologic complete remission. Afterwards，consolidation chemotherapy was given according to the PET THH1EMA LAL Ph+ 2008 protocol for patients under 55 years ofage 通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>. Complete remission was maintained but minimal residual disease(0.04% BCR-ABL/ABL) was detected. Due to the high risk of disease progression an HSCT was indicated，andan unrelated searchinitiated，asthepatient did nothavean HLA matched family donor.\n\n【10】A fully matched unrelated donor peripheral blood HSCT conditioned with total body irradiation (12Gy) and cyclophosphamide (60 mg/Kg for two consecutive days) was performed. For GVHD prophylaxis， a CD34-positive selection followed by a CD45RA naive T cell-depletion was planned. Therefore， 8.71×10 CD34+ cells/kg were infused followed by an infusion of1×10 /kg CD45+ depleted CD3+cells. The total number of residual CD3+CD45RA+ cells infused was5.4 ×10/kg. The patient also received prophylactic antimicrobial treatment with rifaximin，trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole， acyclovir， letermovir， and fluconazole.\n\n【11】Early post-transplant complications were grade 4 mucositis requiring intravenous morphine and total parenteral nutrition and radiodermatitis on face， neck， armpits， and groin， successfully treated with topical silver sulfadiazine. On day +3 post-transplant neutropenic fever of unknown origin appeared and empirical progressive antibiotic treatment with meropenem was started. Fever without microbiological documentation persisted and amikacin， vancomycin and posaconazole were added to the empirical antibiotic treatment. On day +12 post-transplant， an erythematous， non-pruritic skin rash appeared on the arms， legs， and neckline. A skin biopsy was negative for GVHD， implant syndrome or infection. However， all the symptoms subsided with prednisone 1 mg/kg/bid. Granulocyte engraftment (>0.5×10/L， absolute neutrophil count) was achieved at day +11 and platelet engraftment (>20×10/L， without transfusions) by day +8. An early complete donor chimerism was observed on day +15.\n\n【12】On day +13 post-transplant a new onset of persistent fever was detected in parallel with elevated acute phase reactants and progressive cytopenia’s. Extensive and repeated blood， urine and fecal microbiological tests and imaging studies were performed but they were all negative ((bacterial and fungal cultures， multiviral PCR testing including HHV-6 and high-resolution turaco-abdominal scans). However， only three days later， a new PCR for HHV-6 was positive with 164，872 copies/mL. On day +19 post-transplant a bone marrow study detected hemophagocytosis and ruled out leukemic recurrence. Due to the concomitant presence of hypertriglyceridemia(1，241 mg/dl)， increased LDH (14，847IU/L)，elevated ferritin (356，000mg/dl)， thrombocytopenia (36×10/L) and monocytosis (11.3x10/L)， a diagnosis of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis secondary to acute infection by HHV-6 was made. Treatment with intravenous immunoglobulins (30 g/d， two days)， foscarnet (90 mg/Kg/bid， ganciclovir (5 mg/kg/d)， etoposide (100 mg) and anakinra (200 mg/day) was started. Dexamethasone was not included due to the viral infection. After administration ofetoposide， the patient developed an acute renal failure showing creatinine 4.5 mg/dl， hyperuricemia (12.7mg/dl)， hyperphosphatemia (7.3 mg/dl)， hyperkalemia (5.4 mmol/L) and hypocalcemia (5.7 mg/dl) and requiring rasburicase and intensive fluid therapy with electrolytes balance. Despite treatment， the HHV-6 infection reached 5，811，644 copies/ml and the patient worsened clinicaly and analytically， developing SIADH with hyponatremia(119 mmol/L)， Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC)(fibrinogen of 73 mg/dl) and a generalized hemorrhagic rash. Two days later， the HHV-6 levels subsided (1，858，396 copies/ml)， but the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit due to multi-organ failure (renal， hepatic， pulmonary， neurologic， DIC) and died on day +25 post-transplant with a concomitant septic shock from Enterococcus faecium.\n\n【13】Discussion\n\n【14】Transplant related mortality following allogeneic HSCT has been significantly reduced due to better donor selection and improvement in transplant techniques 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>. To prevent the onset of GVHD and the need for long immunosuppressive treatments， new graft manipulation techniques， such as CD45RA or CD3aB/CD19 depletion of lymphocytes， have been developed 通用删除6(英):<u>[6，7]</u>. These techniques have successfully controlled GVHD， but they induce a delaved immune reconstitution that may increase life-threatening fungal or viral infections. Among these are HHV-6 infections， that can cause exanthema， kidney and liver failure， encephalitis， graft failure， or even the development of GVHD 通用删除6(英):<u>[12-15]</u>. Therefore， it is important to recognize the variety of initial clinical manifestations that HHV-6 infection may produce， including fever， cutaneous rash， or mild neurological signs and start a diagnostic procedure immediately. Our case illustrates a highly aggressive HHV-6 infection that progressed to multi-organ failure and death after a fully matched unrelated donor myeloablative HSCT whose graft was manipulated with a CD34-positive selection followed by a CD45RA naive T cell-depletion. This is consistent with a recently reported increased incidence of HHV-6 infections and the use of naive T cell-depleted grafts of haploidentical stem cell transplantation in pediatric patients， although， in contrast with our case， the clinical evolution of these patients was not fatal 通用删除6(英):<u>[18，19]</u>. Moreover， we describe an HHV-6infection in an adult patient and after a different type of transplant， a matched unrelated donor HSCT.\n\n【15】Although there are some preliminary initiatives with the infusion of NK cells immediately posttransplant as a prophylaxis of viral infection 通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u>， there is no generally accepted strategy in terms of detection， early monitoring， or prophylactic treatment for HHV-6 in patients undergoing allogeneic HSCT with or without manipulated grafts. However， pre-transplant and post-transplant serial PCR determinations could help to make an accurate diagnosis and， consequently， establish early treatment with ganciclovir or foscarnet. A previous negative HHV-6 PCR does not exclude the need for further PCR tests， especially when symptoms or signs consistent with HHV-6 reactivation appear. Due to the high number of viral copies detected and rapid clinical deterioration， ganciclovir and foscarnet were introduced simultaneously in this case. Despite an initial drop in viral copies， the patient developed a multi-organ failure and died of septic shock from Enterococcus faecium.\n\n【16】It is important to consider that HHV-6 can be integrated in germline， being these subjects strongly positive in PCR 通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u> and making diagnosis difficult. A previous negative HHV-6 PCR excluded this possibility in our patient. Another relevant aspect is the rarely described relationship between HHV-6 and the development of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis， mainly in pediatric patients通用删除6(英):<u>[22，23]</u>. This HHV-6 related hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis may be a serious and potentially life-threatening complication 通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u>.\n\n【17】This very severe case reflects that HHV-6 infection must be highly suspected not only in haploidentical HSCT but also in fully matched unrelated donor HSCT， especially when CD45RA T cell-depleted grafts are infused. The clinical evolution may be rapidly fatal even when combined treatment with ganciclovir and foscarnet is used. Therefore， it is important to make the diagnosis and start antiviral treatment as soon as possible， for which serial PCR determination is highly suggested whenever a clinical suspicion of HHV-6 infection appears.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

During the operation， there was no evidence of bowel atresia but had microcolon and a flexure at the transitional zone，45 cm from the Duodenojejunal (DJ-flexure). Results of the biopsies revealed the presence of ganglion cells 20 cm from the distal to the stoma， but absence of ganglion cells 40 cm distal to the stoma. She was diagnosed with Hirschsprung Disease-Total Colonic A Aganglionosis.The repeated laparoscopic biopsies on March 2015 had confirmed that ganglion cells present up to 20 cm distal to the stoma. The stoma was re-sited distally； 78 cm distal to DJ-flexure， due to the exteriorized ileostomy was ganglionic as confirmed by the frozen section biopsy of the stoma edge intraoperatively.\n\n【9】In February 2016， at the age of 14 months， she underwent laparotomy， adhesiolysis and serial transverse enteroplasty STEP procedures for bowel lengthening initiative. Prior to the lengthening procedure， the total length of the proximal small bowel to the ileostomy was 130 cm and the enteroplasty process managed to secure another 31 cm length. The proximal bowel was generally dilated but peristalsis was seen. She was started with 2-in-1 total Parenteral Nutrition (PN) in mid-January 2015 through right internal jugular vein. The central venous catheter was re-inserted in June 2015 to the left internal jugular vein. She has been under close monitoring for her nutritional requirements and intake， fluid and electrolyte status， and catheter care during her hospitalization in UMMC.\n\n【10】Finally， in June 2017， the UMMC team has come to agreement that the nutritional requirements and the PN regimen had been stabilized and optimized. She was discharge from UMMC for home删除1换行parenteral nutrition. Prior to discharge， her mother has demonstrated competence in performing HPN management； line care and management， setting up enteral and parenteral nutrition under strict aseptic technique and also capable of performing ostomy care. Her family also has made all the necessary adiustment and renovation of their house in Kemaman， Terengganu to provide a dedicated room that is safe and clean for PN administration.\n\n【11】Further discussion and arrangement have been made by UMMC with Hospital Sultanah Nur Zahirah， Kuala Terengganu (HSNZ) for PN supply， with Kemasik Health Clinic， Terengganu (KKK) for home visit and emergency health management， and Hospital Kemaman， Terengganu (HKM) for PN transportation from HSNZ to HKM and routine medical follow-up. All of this arrangement is crucial as the patient will stay 250 km away from UMMC， while HKM， the nearest hospital to patient house， didn’t equipped with the facility deemed suitable for compounding PN. HSNZ on the other hand， is about 103km from HKM.\n\n【12】Discussion\n\n【13】Pre-discharge preparation\n\n【14】Patient’s mother underwent home PN training， coordinate byUMMC Surgery Department in 2017. Prior to discharge， an assessment was conducted and she was able to perform and competence in hand washing and gloving techniques， setting up the dressing table， handling PN administration and discontinuation， handling the PN infusion pump and central line care.\n\n【15】A series of discussion were conducted with patient family on the technical aspect of the HPN therapy. Although PN was supplied by the hospital， but some of the consumables were self-purchase by the SpO family. There were also equipment and consumable items， sponsored by Department of Social Welfare Malaysia， Terengganu and Islamic religious and Malay Customs Council， Terengganu such as infusion\n\n【16】Table 2： Summary of nutrient required and delivered to patient via parenteral route.\n\n| Macro & Micronutrients  | Start 通用删除7(英):<u>(2017)</u>2 vears old  |  |  | Current 通用删除7(英):<u>(2022)</u>7 vears old  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Macro & Micronutrients  | Requirement  |  | Delivered  | Requirement  |  | Delivered  |\n| Macro & Micronutrients  | per day  | by weight  | Delivered  | per day  | by weight  | Delivered  |\n| Energy (kcal/kg/day)  | 65-75  | 845-975  | 1049 (107%)  | 65-75  | 962-1110  | 1011(91%)  |\n| Amino acids (g/kg/day)  | 2.5  | 32.5  | 39(120%)  | 2.0  | 29.6  | 43(143%)  |\n| Glucose (g/kg/day)  | 4.3-8.6  | 55.9-111.8  | 151(135%)  | 4.3-8.6  | 63.6-127.3  | 95(75%)  |\n| Lipids (g/kg/day)  | 3(max)  | 39  | 36(92%)  | 3  | 44.4  | 44.4(100%)  |\n| #Vitamins and trace elements (daily dose)  | Complete  | Complete  | Complete  | Complete  | Complete  | Complete  |\n| Fluid (ml)  |  | 1150ml  | 1144 (99%)  | ★  | 1240ml  | 960 ml(77%)  |\n\n【18】#Vitamin and trace elements： SoluvitB and VitalipidB\n\n【19】Fluid requirement =(100 mlx 10 kg) +(5 ml x10 kg)+(25 ml x[Weight-20 kg])\n\n【20】Peptamen Junior； 4 scoops + 120 ml x 3-5/day 464 kcal， 13.7 g Protein， 62.8 g CHO and 17.5 g Fat in 500 ml water.\n\n【21】Table 3： Summary of patient body weight from 2017 until 2022.\n\n|  |  | May 2017  | Jun-17  | Jun-18  | Jun-19  | Jun-20  | Jun-21  | Jan-22  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Age  | Year  | 2  | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5  | 6  | 7  |\n| Age  | Month  | 5  | 6  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 删除8:<u>门 </u> | 删除8:<u>门 </u> |\n| Weight-for-age(kg)  |  | 16.3  | 15.8  | 15.3  | 15.3  | 15.3  | 15.5  | 15.8  |\n| Actual body weight (kg)  |  | 13  | 13  | 11.5  | 13  | 14.8  | 14.3  | 15  |\n\n【23】The standard growth chart for Malaysia girl age 2-20 years old adapted from National Center for Health Statistics， USA删除1换行pump and also syringe pump.\n\n【24】As home PN therapy require a lot of preparation， UMMC had organize teams to help patient family on technical aspects especially for the house preparation. The team visited the house to ensure the room or space for home PN administration， electricity supply， refrigerator， sink， water supply and telephone were in place. All of the aspect is crucial in reducing the risk for contamination and infection to the patient. Pre-discharge home visit was done on Jun 2017 by Kemaman Hospital team， while the post-discharge home visit was conducted by Kemasik Health Clinic team every 3 to 6 months.\n\n【25】The patient was 2 years old and the body weight was 13 kg at the time she was enrolled into the HPN program. Apart from PN， she also taking oral food and received enteral nutrition support. Macronutrient and micronutrient regimen for nutrition support were developed bythe UMMC Surgery team.

{"seq_id": "3d979fc6-cb53-493c-a8df-3d918e4b2d88", "title": null, "text": "【0】Abstract\n\n【1】Aim： Under the introduction of the two-child policy， women with second pregnancies having a previous cesarean section have suddenly increased. The two-child policyhas provided a new chance for studying the previous cesarean section， which is considered a new medical risk in China. This study aimed to examine the previous cesarean sections influence on pregnancy complications among women with singleton delivery in their second pregnancies.\n\n【2】Method： A total of 2018 eligible women with second pregnancies who had a singleton delivery from January 2015 to October 2017 were studied retrospectively. Data on the previous delivery mode for the first pregnancy， maternal characteristics and pregnancy complications for the second pregnancy were obtained from the electronic medical records. Chi-square test was used to describe and obtain the significant maternal characteristics according to the previous mode of delivery. The pregnancy complications associated with previous cesarean section was analyzed with binary logistic regression.\n\n【3】Results： Of 2018 eligible women with singleton delivery in their second pregnancy， 942 (46.7%)had a previous cesarean section (study group) while 1076 (53.3%) also had a previous vaginal delivery LISC(reference group). Previous cesarean section had an increase risk on the following pregnancy complications； Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) (Adjusted Odds Ratio [aOR]： 1.438；95% CI，1.093-1.894)， fetal anomaly (aOR： 14.258； 95% CI， 4.213-48.248)， and placenta previa (aOR： 2.890；95% CI，1.623-5.148).\n\n【4】Conclusion： This study demonstrates that the previous cesarean section is associated with increased risk of GDM， fetal anomaly and placenta previa on second singleton pregnancy after the implementation of the universal two-child policy in China.\n\n【5】Keywords： Cesarean section； China； Pregnancy complications； Second pregnancy； Two-child policy\n\n【6】Introduction\n\n【7】Cesarean Section (CS) is the most common obstetrical operation known worldwide. Over the past decades， the rate of CS has increased both in developing and developed countries. The WHO issued a disclosure in 1985， stating the CS regional rates must not exceed 10% to 15%通用删除6(英):<u>[1，2]</u>. Nonetheless， China is one of the countries with the prevalence of CS averagely of 46.2% over the past decades that are higher than the recommended threshold. Coincidentally， this high prevalence of CS began during the implementation period of the one-child policy introduced in 1979 to reduce the then growing population in China. CS is considered safe under medical indications， but most women who had CS under the one-child policy opted for it without any medical indications 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，3]</u>. In 2015， the one-child policy was replaced with the universal two-child policy. This new policy has encouraged most couples to consider having a second child. As a result， it suddenly increased the number of pregnancies with an obstetrical history of previous CS 通用删除6(英):<u>[4，5]</u>. Hence， previous CS has become a new medical risk for clinicians in China.\n\n【8】A study on previous CS and its association with adverse pregnancy outcomes has been studied extensively in other countries. However，literature on such studies in China is sparse， mainly due to删除1换行the one-child policy， which could not all ow for subsequent pregnancies that could be used to access previous CS's influence on pregnancy complications. However， these previous studies' findings have been reported to be associated with some pregnancy complications通用删除6(英):<u>[1，2]</u>， but the results were inconsistent. Some studies have indicated previous CS to be associated with pregnancy complications such as pregnancy-induced hypertension disorders 通用删除6(英):<u>[6-8]</u>， placenta previa 通用删除6(英):<u>[7-10]</u>， placenta abruption， placenta accreta/adhesions 通用删除6(英):<u>[8，9]</u>. In contrast， other studies showed that previous CS had no significant effect on placenta disorders such as placenta previa 通用删除6(英):<u>[6，11]</u>， placenta abruption通用删除6(英):<u>[7，9]</u> and placenta accrete 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>.\n\n【9】Furthermore， other pregnancy complications are not well known to be associated with previous CS due to the limited number ofstudies on these outcomes. Few studies have reported an increased risk for Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u> and polyhydramnios 通用删除6(英):<u>[6，7]</u> in pregnancy after CS when compared with vaginal delivery. Also， a previous study indicated high incidence of pregnant women with a previous CS diagnosed with fetal anomaly when compared with women with previous vaginal delivery 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>. Studies conducted to support the hypothesis of previous CS association with GDM， polyhydramnios， and fetal anomaly remains sparse to the best of our knowledge. Given the limited evidence on the influence of previous CS on these pregnancy complications such as GDM， polyhydramnios and fetal anomaly and the inconsistencies in the association between previous CS and the placenta disorders shown in other studies， there is a need for research attention on these pregnancy complications to update clinicians and women on the risk associated with CS.\n\n【10】The implementation of the universal two-child policy provides an ideal situation to study previous CS's influence on pregnancy complications. Therefore， this study examines previous CS's influence on pregnancy complications such as Gestational Diabetes Mellitus， polyhydramnios， fetal anomaly， Pregnancy Induced Hypertension(PIH)， placenta disorders (placenta previa， placenta abruptions and placenta accreta among women with singleton delivery in the second pregnancies.\n\n【11】Methods\n\n【12】Subject's section\n\n【13】This study used clinical data of 2018 women with singleton delivery in the second pregnancies delivered between January 2015and October 2017 at the Third Xiangya Hospital of Central South University. These women were identified from the electronic medical records and enrolled in the study. The 2018 women were selected based on the following inclusion criteria： (i) women who had live delivery at ≥ 24 weeks gestation； (ii) had singleton delivery for both the first and this second pregnancy. Women were excluded if they do not meet the criteria above or； (i) women whose pregnancy were as a result of Artificial Reproductive Technology (ART)； (ii) women whose records had missing information on the previous mode of delivery， pregnancy complications in the second pregnancy as well as maternal characteristics of second pregnancies.\n\n【14】Clinical data on theeprevious delivery mode， maternal characteristics and the pregnancy complications in the second pregnancy were retrieved from the electronic medical records and further validated and maintained by our research team. Women with a singleton pregnancy with previous CS in the first pregnancy were categorized as the study group. In contrast， those with spontaneous vaginal delivery for the first pregnancy were categorized as the删除1换行reference group.\n\n【15】We obtained ethical approval for this study from the Xiangya School of Nursing and the Institutional Review Board from the Third Xiangya Hospital of Central South University， Hunan， China.\n\n【16】Definitions of variables\n\n【17】Maternal characteristics included demographic and obstetric information such as maternal age at second pregnancy， Body Mass Index (BMI)， which was obtained from the weight and height of the pregnant woman at the first prenatal booking and was calculated as (weight in kg)/(height in m)， the number of prenatal care visits2 4 (standard prenatal care according to doctor’s suggestion)， Interpregnancy Interval (IPI) was also defined as the interval of years between the first delivery and the second pregnancy， history of Terminations of Pregnancy (TOP) before this second pregnancy and preexisting medical conditions which were all diagnosed by an obstetrician (pre-pregnancy diabetes， chronic hypertension， angiocardiography， anemia， systemic lupus erythema， asthma， fibroid， ovarian and fallopian cyst， syphilis， hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism).The continuous yvariables of the maternal characteristics were further sub-grouped into categories.\n\n【18】The pregnancy complications for this study are defined as disorders or diseases that occur during the second pregnancy period. Hence the pregnancy complications that obstetricians diagnosed were selected for this study and included Gestational Diabetes Mellitus{(GDM)， Polyhydramnios，Fetalanomaly， Pregnancy Induced Hypertension (PIH)， Placenta Previa， Placenta abruption， Placenta accreta. Gestational Diabetes Mellitus GDM was diagnosed using a 2-h， 75 g oral glucose tolerance test 通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u>. Polyhydramnios was defined as an abnormally sizeable amniotic fluid of 24 cm or greater during pregnancy and diagnosed through ultrasound examination通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>. The fetal anomaly was defined as a delivery defect or congenital malformation during the intrauterine life and can be identified prenatally or at delivery (WHO). Pregnancy Induced Hypertension(PIH) was defined as diastolic blood pressure >90 mmHg on two occasions， four hours apart or a single reading of >110 mmHg from20 weeks gestation 通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>. Placenta previa is an implantation of the placenta over or near the internal opening of the cervix. Placental abruption is the premature separation of a usually implanted placenta from the uterus， and placenta accrete refer to the clinically apparent morbidly adherent placenta 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>.\n\n【19】The study's covariates included significant maternal characteristics and the possible pregnancy complications (in the second pregnancy) known in the published literature as risk factors of the pregnancy complications in this study (potential confounders). For significant maternal characteristics that were used as covariates， we excluded pre-pregnancy diabetes and chronic hypertension when analyzing for GDM and PIH， respectively. We considered potential risk factors for the following： GDM (PIH通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u>)， polyhydramnios (fetal anomaly通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u>， GDM 通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u>) and PIH (placenta disorders 通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u>， GDM 通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u>).\n\n【20】Statistical analyses\n\n【21】The maternal characteristics were described and summarized by frequencies and percentages. Chi-square and Fisher's exact test was used to compare the groups. Probability values of <0.05were considered statistically significant. We used univariate and multivariate logistic regression to ascertain the influence of previous CS on pregnancy complications. The influence of the covariates was analyzed. First， maternal age， Body Mass Index (BMI) at booking，删除1换行history of pregnancy termination， and significant preexisting medical condition (diabetes， chronic hypertension， asthma， fibroid， ovarian and fallopian cyst) were added as covariates. For the covariates of GDM and PIH， we excluded pre-pregnancy diabetes and chronic hypertension， respectively. Then potential risk factors for GDM(placenta disorders， PIH)， polyhydramnios (fetal anomaly， GDM) and PIH (placenta disorders， GDM) were further analyzed. We presented the logistic regression results as crude and adjusted Odds Ratios (ORs) with 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs). The data was analyzed using SPSS 25.0 (IBM Corp.，Armonk，NY，USA).\n\n【22】Maternal characteristics\n\n【23】Amongthe 2018 eligible women with singleton second pregnancy，942(46.7%) had experienced one previous CS， while the remaining1076 (53.3%)had one previous vaginal delivery.\n\n【24】Women with previous CS were older and had advanced age (≥35years) than women withprevious vaginal delivery. Those with previous CS had a higher BMI>25.0kg/m'and a longer IPI (5years and above) than those with previous vaginal delivery. Both women with previous CS and previous vaginal delivery had the recommended number of prenatal visits 2 4 visits. The history of pregnancy termination was slightly higher among those with previous CS than those with previous vaginal delivery. Furthermore， women with previous CS had a higher rate of preexisting medical diseases such as diabetes， hypertension， asthma， fibroid， cyst of the ovary and fallopian tube than those with previous vaginal delivery .\n\n【25】Analysis of previous CS on pregnancy complications\n\n【26】Regarding the pregnancy complications， women with previous CS had a significantly higher rate of Gestational Diabetes Mellitus， fetal anomaly and placenta previa when compared with those with previous vaginal delivery. When these pregnancy complications were analyzed using the univariate binary logistic regression (odd crude ratio)， they were all associated with previous CS .\n\n【27】After the multivariate logistic regression (adjustment for the covariates， which include significant maternal characteristics and potential risk factors)， there was an association between previous CS with GDM， fetal anomaly and placenta previa. Comparing the adjusted odds ratio of the pregnancy complications among women with previous CS and previous vaginal delivery (reference group)， women with previous CS were 1.44 times more likely to have GDM(95%CI， 1.09-1.89) and 14.26 times more likely to have fetal anomaly(95%CI， 4.21-48.25). Furthermore， women with previous CS were2.89 times more likely tohave placenta previa (95% CI，1.62-5.15)than those with previous vaginal delivery.

This placenta insufficiency may result in hyperglycemia in the maternal circulation that may contribute to GDM. GDM in previous pregnancy can be recurrent in the subsequent pregnancy. However， a study 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u> indicated that recurrent GDM in previous pregnancy does not significantly reduce previous CS’s influence on GDM. Also， advanced maternal age and overweight or obesity is identified as risk factors for gestational diabetes mellitus. Although most of the women with previous CS were of advanced maternal age and were overweight， we adjusted for these confounders. Nevertheless， there remained an association between previous CS and GDM. However， further studies elucidating the current findings on the relationship between previous CS and GDM and the possible biological and physiological relationship need to be appraised.\n\n【43】Furthermore， previous CS showed a significant impact on the fetal anomaly in our study. To our knowledge， this is the first recent study that shows the association between previous CS and fetal anomaly. These findings of this study， might be due to the increased risk of placenta disorders associated with previous CS， which can predispose the women to placenta insufficiencythat may affect the fetus s normal development leading to increased risk for fetal anomaly 通用删除6(英):<u>[26，27]</u>. It could also be speculated that the risk of fetal anomaly may be due to the uterine cavity changes induced by a uterine scar from previous CS， which can alter the uterus s anatomy that predisposes women to have删除1换行a fetal anomaly. Although advanced maternal age， pre-gestational diabetes， and chronic hypertension are considered high-risk fetal anomaly factors， there remained a higher risk for fetal anomaly associated with previous CS when adjusted for our studies. However， most of the pregnancies with fetal anomaly were terminated at the first or second trimester， which may not represent the exact number of women with a fetal anomaly. Therefore， more studies focusing on the association between previous CS and fetal anomaly need to be conducted in the future.\n\n【44】Among the placenta disorders， only placenta previa has an association with previous CS in our study. Previous CS was associated with an increased risk of placenta previa with an adjusted Odds Ratio(ORs) of 2.89， higher than some previous studies 通用删除6(英):<u>[7，28，29]</u>. These previous studies have indicated the association between previous CS and placenta previa， but the Odd Ratios (ORs) were lesser than our study. However， parity and multiple gestations，considered to increase the risk of placenta previa in a previous study 通用删除6(英):<u>[30]</u>， were excluded from our study. Furthermore， when adjusted for the covariates(significant maternal characteristics)， which were also considered potential confounders to placenta previa in previous studies 通用删除6(英):<u>[28，31]</u>， it remained a higher risk. This higher Odd Ratio (OR) may be due to the study conducted with data from a tertiary hospital where women with high-risk pregnancies such as placenta previa are referred to. Currently， the exact cause of placenta previa is unknown. However， placenta previa is hypothesized to be related to a failure of apparent placental migration， impaired differential growth of the lower uterine删除1换行segment， and deficient decidua basalis in the presence of previous surgery injury 通用删除6(英):<u>[10，32]</u>.\n\n【45】However，polyhydramnios was not associated with previous CS in our study； this is in variance with previous studies 通用删除6(英):<u>[6，7]</u>. The difference might be attributed to the small number of pregnant women with polyhydramnios in our study， which contributed to a small effect size that did not associate previous CS and polyhydramnios. This is supported by the wide Confidence Interval (CI) observed in its Odds Ratio (OR). Furthermore， among the placenta disorders associated with previous CS in the previous studies， placenta abruption and placenta accreta did not show any association with previous CS. This finding is in variance with other previous studies 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，8-10]</u>. An observation of no increased risk between previous CS and Pregnancy Induced Hypertension (PIH) existed in our study. This may be due to a smaller number of women with PIH in our study which could not predict the association.\n\n【46】Our study also confirms the high CS rate of 46.7% in the first delivery as the previous CS. This finding is congruent with the WHO study， which indicated China to be the country with the highest CS rate of 46.2% among the 24 Asian countries. This present study is one of the few studies conducted after the two-child policy that examines previous CS's influence on pregnancy complications. This study also adjusted for several confounding factors that could have influenced our result. The study was conductedthree years after implementing the two-child policy that accurately represents pregnancy complications among women with a second pregnancy.\n\n【47】The present study also had some limitations， primarily due to the retrospective nature of the design. Firstly， misclassification of the pregnancy complications may exist just as other administrative databases， which can lead to bias， but this may have occurred randomly and therefore could have the tendency of reducing the bias that could have occurred in this stuidy.\n\n【48】Secondly， some details of information on the first pregnancy， such as the pregnancy outcomes and indications for previous CS， were not present due to the transitioning from paper medical records entry to electronic medical records. Information regarding their first pregnancy， which happened very long ago， was not captured. There can be a reduction of bias from lack of indication for the previous CS since most women during the one-child policy had CS without any medical reasons 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，3]</u>. Also， some women did not have their first child at our hospital； hence the available details ofthe first pregnancy were obtained from maternal self-report， of which there could be a P presence of recall bias.\n\n【49】Thirdly， the BMI used for the study was BMI at admission for delivery， which may not represent the exact BMI since the fetus’s weight could have influenced maternal BMI at admission. Lastly， there could be selection bias since most women who had obstetric complications in their first pregnancy might opt for a tertiary hospital or be referred to a tertiary hospital to seek medical help during their subsequent pregnancy.\n\n【50】Conclusion\n\n【51】In conclusion， our study revealed the association of previous first CS with pregnancy complications such as GDM， fetal anomaly and placenta previa on singleton pregnancy among women having their second child under the universal two-child policy. Hence， this study provides the needed information for obstetricians， nurses删除1换行and midwives to acquaint themselves with knowledge pertaining to pregnancy complications and provides intensive management and follow-ups of women with previous CS to ensure a healthy mother and baby throughout the pregnancy and delivery periods. Such information obtained from this study could help the decision-making process regarding CS for the health care providers and expectant mothers alike， mainly when there are no clear medical indications for CS.\n\n【52】Data Availability\n\n【53】The datasets generated during and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

Among them are the selection of the agent， dose， treatment schedule， length of therapy and the decision， posterior to the surgical treatment， to continue it or not as adjuvant treatment. Surgery continues to be initially the standard of treatment whenever possible. Results obtained from clinical essays where a single drug immunotherapy was used in the context of neoadjuvant treatment have failed to show a clear benefit with such strategy； however， in the last few years several studies have been developed with combination therapy with promising results通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. The NADIM Phase II trial included 46 patients with stage IIIA lung cancer achieved a Major Pathological Response (MPR)， which is defined as <10% residual viable tumor after neoadjuvant chemotherapy， in 85% of the patients and a Pathological Complete Response (pCR) in 71.4% of patients， using a treatment schedule conformed by Nivolumab+Carboplatin+Nab-Paclitaxel 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>.\n\n【8】A trial by Shu et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u> of only 18 patients with stage IB-IIIA used Atezolizumab+Nab-Paclitaxel+Carboplatin as neoadjuvant therapy achieving a RPM of 50% and a pCR of 21% 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>， and the NEOSTAR trial which included 44 patients in clinical stage I-IIIA reported RPM of 33.3% and pCR of 29% with the combination of Nivolumab+Ipilimumab 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>.\n\n【9】删除1:<u>Copyright @ 2020 Rodriguez-Cid Jeronimo Rafael.删除13:<u> This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License， which permits unrestricted use， distribution， and reproduction in any medium， provided the original work is properly cited.</u></u>\n\n【10】Finally， in some of the abovementioned trials， one of the most utilized endpoints to assess the efficacy of the treatment has been the Major Pathological Response (MPR).

The main current challenge in the neoadjuvant treatment is the progression of the disease due to a delay in the surgical treatment. Nonetheless， there are some early studies with Nivolumab as immune， single agent， PD-L1 neoadjuvant therapy that showed that 45% of the patients had a Major Pathological Response (MPR) and that 15% of them had a Complete Pathological Response (pCR). Neoadjuvant therapy with Atezolizumab showed that 19% of patients had a MPR and 5% achieved a pCR7.\n\n【17】In particular， previous studies of neoadjuvant chemotherapy showed that the partial pathological response is more likely to occur in patients with squamous cell lung cancers (26%) than those with adenocarcinomas (12%)， possibly due to an increased response to necrosis in squamous cell carcinomas 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>.\n\n【18】We still lack more robust Phase III studies to really assess the impact of partial response versus complete response in the primary tumor， likewise we need to know if negativization of the lymph nodes has an effect on disease free survival and if the neoadiuvant treatment with immune agents has a sustained impact in the elimination of distant micro metastasis and relevance on the Overall Survival (OS) and on Recurrence Free Survival (RFS) 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>.\n\n【19】In our case， the patient had a MPR of 80% with a residual viable tumor of 20% without any lymphatic or vascular infiltration and without lymph node involvement according to the pathology report and although adenosquamous lung cancers are infrequent the删除1换行immune activity of the therapy was significant with an 80% fibro-inflammatory stroma reported by pathology.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

He underwent parathyroidectomy for secondary hyperparathyroidism. Five months after surgery a rapid regression of MCP and soft tissue calcification was observed， but calcific uremic arteriolopathy keep progressive development.\n\n【2】Case Presentation\n\n【3】A 43-year-old man with uremia due to glomerulonephritis， receiving hemodialysis since 2010， three times per week， four hours per time， was presented with ulcer of left heel for 1 month. He found a swelling over the right shoulder joint in early 2011. The swelling was mobile and soft， and grew rapidly from 2 cm to 10 cm in five months， but he had neither pain nor skin changes. There was no special treatment or regular examination of serum calcium， phosphorus and intact Parathyroid Hormone (iPTH). Over the next two years， another swelling developed over the left elbow joint similar to the ones described for the right shoulder joint. He hospitalized for lumbosacral area and bower limbs pain in July 2016. Blood tests revealed： (iPTH) 2156.5 pg/ml (<72 pg/ml). Computed Tomography (CT) scans showed bilateral， diffuse， centrilobular， ground-glass opacities areas distributed in the upper lobes . He was diagnosed with uremic renal osteopathy and uremic pulmonary metastatic calcification. There was no significant decrease in iPTH level after treatment with calcimimetics for 2 months. The lumbosacral area and bower limbs pain still progresses. He was difficulty in walking by the end of 2017.

Two irregular， hard masses were found around right shoulder joint and left elbow joint. Joint range of|删除段之间换行|(A) and coronal (B) computed tomography in lungs window shows more calcifications in both upper lungs.\n\n【5】Blood tests revealed： Calcium 2.27 (2.02-2.57) mg/dl，phosphorus of 2.53 (0.6-1.6) mg/dl， and iPTH levels up to 2580.5 pg/ml. Parathyroid scintigraphywas performed 15 min and 2 h after injection of Tc99m MIBI. The Tc-99 MIBI scintigraphy demonstrated a focus of intense uptake in the upper pole of the right lobe， lower and upper pole of left lobe on the early and late images. CT scans show multiple， centrilobular， calcified nodules through-out both lungs . The nodules were predominant in the upper and mid lung zones which was worse than 2016. Severe vascular calcification of thoracic and lower limb ， multilobulated calcified masses around the right shoulder joint were found at the same time .

Metastatic calcification refers to the deposition of calcium in normal tissue， that is commonly|删除段之间换行|The diagnosis of secondary hyperparathyroidism is mainly depending on the history of chronic renal failure and elevated PTH levels， hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia were also observed.\n\n【9】Visceral calcinosis can affect lung， stomach， heart， pancreas， and kidneys， but lung is the most vulnerable organ 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. The pathological characteristics of Metastatic Pulmonary Calcification (MPC) is calcium salt deposition in basement membranes ofthe epithelium and endothelium of pulmonaryalveoli 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. The main pathogenesis of MPC has not yet been illustrated， but some factors， such as hypercalcemia and hyperphosphatemia， dialysis-associated intermittent acid-base imbalance， and local secretion of free hydrogen ions in the lungs， kidneys， and stomach have been suggested as the risk factors for MPC formation 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. The diagnostic rate of MPC is very low， but histological changes of MPC are seen at autopsy in 60% to 75% of maintenance hemodialysis patients 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. This may probably due to insufficient sensitivity of chest X-ray examination， poorly understood about the imaging manifestations of MPC among clinicians， and the benign clinical course of the disease.\n\n【10】Chest radiographs are not very sensitive in the detection of MPC， especially in early stage of disease (small calcifications)， and are usually show patchy or confluent airspace opacities or normal. CT has high sensitivity in an early detection of MPC. A chest CT scan of metastatic pulmonary calcification reveals of bilateral， diffuse， centrilobular， ground-glass nodular opacities and partially calcified nodules or consolidations， predominantly in the upper lung fields， is the most common finding on 通用删除6(英):<u>[5，6]</u>. Calcium preferentially deposits in relatively alkaline tissues. The upperlung fields have high Ventilation/Perfusion (V/Q) ratio， creating high oxygen and low carbon dioxide levels.\n\n【11】The high V/Q ratio results in decreased PaCO， and increased pH 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. Therefore， it had nothing strange that the lung apex is more commonly involved than the lung base. In our case showed symmetrical， multiple， centrilobular areas of ground-glass opacity throughout both upper lung area in 2016. Preoperative CT scan showed more calcareous were deposited in upper lung zones， but not in lung base，which was in accordance with the characteristics of MPC imaging changes. In addition， radionuclide imaging is another useful technique in finding out the early MPC， demonstrating generally symmetrical and increased radioactive isotope uptake in affected lung fields 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. The pathological examination is the diagnostical golden standard for metastatic pulmonary calcification. However， it is largely limited in clinical applications since it is an invasive procedure.\n\n【12】MPC is a benign lesion， it generally slows progression in a long time， but it can also deteriorate rapidly within several weeks or months通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>. Most patients with MPC are asymptomatic， but several cases of hemoptysis， cough， dyspnea have been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>[2，9]</u>. In our case， diffuse， patchy high-density shadows were found in both upper lungs删除1换行in 2016. The imaging changes of MPC were obviously aggravated in 2018 before operation， but throughout， the patient have no any respiratory symptoms. Preoperative pulmonary function test mainly shows mild restrictive ventilatory dysfunction. The pathological changes were absorbed gradually after five months of operation.\n\n【13】So far， the best treatment of MPC has not been established.

Another means is too applicate of active vitamin D to control secondary hyperparathyroidism on the basis of maintaining normal calcium-phosphorus product 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>. Most of these patients with asymptomatic， non-progressive MPC do not need to intervention since these patients eventually died of other causes instead of MPC. Cases have been reported that MPC can be fully absorbed after parathyroidectomy 通用删除6(英):<u>[11，12]</u>. More research’s need to be done to see whether renal transplant is good for MPC通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>. In this case， the patient has no any respiratory symptoms， however， besides MPC， the patient had multiple periarticular metastatic calcifications， severe systemic vascular calcification， bone deformation，bone pain and calciphylaxis of the heel at the same time. Therefore， he underwent total parathyroidectomy. Five months after surgery a rapid regression of MCP was observed.\n\n【14】Soft tissue calcifications are another common manifestation of secondary hyperparathyroidism， characterized by large calcium phosphate deposition into cutaneous and subcutaneous tissues. Depositing of calcium salt in periarticular soft tissue region on patients of maintenance hemodialysis for chronic renal failure call Uremic Tumoral Calcinosis (UTC). Its estimated incidence is between 0.5% and 7% of hemodialysis patients 通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u>. It usually presents with benign nodules at periarticular sites， mainly manifests as firm， painless， lobular， tumor-like masses around the joints that can lead to limitation of movement of joint when large in size. The key feature is absence of erosion and destruction of nearby bone， and such lesions is reversible after medication or parathyroidectomy 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>. The sites commonly affected are soft tissues of periarticular shoulder， elbow， hip regions 通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>， other areas such as wrist 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>， spine 通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u>， and knee have been observed 通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u>. Our patient had extensive involvement of the shoulder and elbow； findings were consistent with metastatic calcinosis cut is secondary to TC. Why does it preferentially occur around joints? The exact mechanism behind this clinical entity is unknown. It may be related to the pH value of joint fluid， like the pathogenesis of gout. However， there have been no related experimental investigations published on this subject. In the natural course of such lesions is usually slow and progressive over several years 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>. Sometimes， too much tumoral masses leads to ulceration with superadded secondary infection. In this case， five months after surgery， a rapid complete absorption of the tumoral masses around the right shoulder and left were observed.\n\n【15】Additionally， this case also showed calcification in vessels along chest and limbs. There was no improvement in systemic vascular calcification， instead an aggravation of calcific uremic arteriolopathy on his left heel was observed. These results consistent with the previous reports 通用删除6(英):<u>[19，20]</u>， indicating that once calcification develops it probably cannot be reversed and tends to become more severe as time passes.\n\n【16】Overall， we report this case for the purpose of expanding the clinical and treatment of multiple metastatic calcifications in patient with SHPTH.

Today it is known that strength training (TF) has benefits such as decreased fasting glycemia， glycated hemoglobin， stimulates translocation of GLUT4 in skeletal muscle， increases insulin sensitivity， restoring metabolic control. The objective of this research was to observe the glycemic responses of a type 1 diabetic who underwent strength training at different intensities.\n\n【2】Methods： A 26-year-old woman with type 1 Diabetes Mellitus participated in this research， with a trained diagnosis time of 22 (twenty-two)years. The volunteer participated in three non-consecutive days of intervention at the first visit. The evaluation was performed with a test of Maximum Repetition (1RM) in the following exercises： Bench press； Knee extension on the device； Peck Deck； Front high pulley with cable； Leg 45；Low row with triangle. On the second visit to the laboratory， the TF session was performed at 40% of 1RM. On the third visit， the session was performed at 80%of 1RM， capillary blood glucose was collected before， during and immediately after each strength training session.\n\n【3】Results： The results observed showed that the exercise of less intensity， at 40% of 1 RM， showed a greater drop in capillary glycemia during and immediately after the TF session.\n\n【4】Conclusion： Different intensities will result in different physiological responses. It is important to highlight the need for blood glucose monitoring before， during and after training.\n\n【5】Keywords： Type 1 Diabetes； Blood Glucose； Strength Training\n\n【6】Introduction\n\n【7】Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (DM1) is concentrated between 5% and 10% of the total number of people with diabetes. In most cases， DM1 arises as a result ofautoimmune destruction of pancreatic B cells causing complete deficiency in insulin production，being diagnosed more frequently in children， adolescents and young adults， equally affecting men and women， although its pathophysiology is not fully known. It is known that it is a polygenic disease， thus genetic and environmental factors trigger the autoimmune response 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>.\n\n【8】The treatment of DM1 has historically followed the insulin/food/physical exercise triad. Currently， the triad should switch to insulin/diabetes monitoring/education， including education in nutrition， exercise and guidance for patients and their families 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>.\n\n【9】Among the treatments， physical exercise offers different methods for controlling DM1， such as aerobic training， which is the most used， since strength training before 2005 was not suitable for DM1 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. Today it is already known that strength training has benefits such as decreased fasting blood glucose， glycated hemoglobin， visceral fat， and body weight； stimulates GLUT4 translocation in skeletal muscle， increases insulin sensitivity and， consequently， restores metabolic control 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. Insulin injected by the DM1 carrier acts on the IRS-1 and IRS-2 receptors， promoting a cascade of intracellular signaling that results in the translocation of GLUT4 and the entry of glucose into the cell， physical exercise enhances the phosphorylation of IRS-2， which results in a greater PI3K activity causing an increase in Akt protein phosphorylation， which promotes an increase in the删除1换行translocation of GLUT4 to the cell membrane， consequently greater glucose entry into the cell， decreasing circulating glycemic levels通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u> strength training also minimizes cardiac risks， increases muscle strength and is a good strategy to improve health， physical fitness and performance 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>， justifying its inclusion in the treatment ofDM1.\n\n【10】However， studies relating strength training in isolation and type1 diabetes are still scarce in the literature， in the same way studies that show the efficiency of different intensities under individuals with DM1 are a great gap in which little has been investigated. Comparing different intensities could clarify the benefits of strength training and provide support for practical applications and recommendations regarding the adequate and safe prescription of strength training for glycemic control in DM1， in addition， the little information on strength training related to DM1 demonstrates the need for further studies that address the topic， in order to elucidate the acute and chronic responses of DM1 through this training method 通用删除6(英):<u>[6，7]</u>. In this sense， the objective of this research was to observe the glycemic responses of a type 1 diabetic who underwent strength training at different intensities.\n\n【11】Materials and Methods\n\n【12】Participants\n\n【13】This research was characterized as a case study and is linked to the Project Doce Vida - Supervised Physical Exercise Program for Diabetics， held at the Higher School of Physical Education at the University of Pernambuco. Participated in this research a woman aged 26 (twenty-six) years with type 1 Diabetes Mellitus， with a diagnosis time of 22 (twenty-two) years. The participant is trained.\n\n【14】Instrumentation and data collection\n\n【15】The training was carried out at the Biodynamics Laboratory of the Higher School of Physical Education at the University ofPernambuco in the morning.\n\n【16】Capillary glycemia\n\n【17】Capillary blood glucose was collected before， during and immediately after each strength training. Capillary blood glucose was measured before and after each workout， always on the little or ring fingers， discarding the first drop of blood， the second drop being used 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>. The glucometer， reagent strips，lancets and lancets used were from the Freestyle Optium Neo model from Abbott. The infectious material (gloves， lancets， tapes and paper towels) used for collection， was deposited in a specific box of hospital material.\n\n【18】Blood pressure\n\n【19】Blood pressure was measured before and after each strength training session， using the OMRON HEM 7113 digital automatic blood pressure monitor.\n\n【20】Initial evaluation and test of a maximum repeat (1RM)\n\n【21】The volunteer participated in three non-consecutive days of intervention. On the first visit to the Biodynamics Laboratory， the volunteer was familiarized with the training protocol. Soon afterwards， a test of Maximum Repetition (1RM) was performed in the following exercises： Bench press； Knee extension on the device； Peck Deck； Front high pulley with cable； Leg 45°； Low row with triangle 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>. The equipment was made by New Fit.\n\n【22】Before starting the 1RM test， the volunteer warmed up， in each exercise， from 10 to 15 repetitions， with an equivalent load of 40%to 60% of the maximum perceived strength 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>. Then， the load was删除1换行increased to approximately， 60% to 80% of the maximum perceived force. After this warm-up， there was an interval of 2 min， while the load was increased to perform the 1RM test.\n\n【23】Experimental sessions\n\n【24】On the second visit to the laboratory， the strength training session was performed at 40% of 1RM. On the third day， the session was performed at 80% of 1RM. Each day of intervention aimed to assess the impact of a strength training session on glycemic control. Glycemic responses were analyzed before， during and immediately after each session.\n\n【25】Pre-intervention\n\n【26】Before each intervention， the volunteer remained seated in the laboratory for a period of 10 min， in a quiet room without noise interference and with a temperature between 23·C to 24C通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>.\n\n【27】Intervention\n\n【28】Strength training intensities were established based on the ACSM and ADA classification for individuals with DM1 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>， with low intensity exercise with 40% 1RM and high intensity with 80% 1RM. The strength training sessions consisted of seven exercises in the same sequence as the 1RM test (Bench Press in the machine； Knee extension on the device； Peck Deck； Front high pulley with cable； Leg 45°；Low row with triangle). For the strength training session at 40% of 1RM，02 sets were performed with 16 repetitions in each exercise， with a recovery interval of 60s between sets and 120s between exercises. For the strength training session at 80% of 1RM， 02 sets were performed with 08 repetitions in each exercise with an interval of 90s between sets and 120s between exercises. The duration of the repetition in each series of the strength training was 3s， being 1s in the concentric phase and 2s in the eccentric phase of the movement.\n\n【29】Statistical analysis\n\n【30】A descriptive analysis of the variables was performed through the variation of the delta at baseline during and immediately after the intervention.\n\n【31】Results\n\n【32】According to the observed results， the exercise of less intensity， at 40% of 1RM， showed a drop between the measurement of the pre-training moment and the measurement of the moment during the training， and continued to fall until the moment immediately after the training， showing a greater blood glucose drop compared to training at 80% of1RM.\n\n【33】The strength training session at 80% of 1RM， showed an increase删除表格换行in capillary glycemia in the measurement during the training session， but， immediately after the training session， there was a decrease in capillary glycemia below the pre-training values. RT data at 40% and80% are shown in Table 1 and 2.\n\n【34】Table 1： Variation of the capillary glucase Delta (A) with 40% of 1RM at baseline， during and after intervention of a RT session.\n\n| Glycemia  | Moment  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Pre Workout  | 143 mg/dL  |\n| During  | 137 mg/dL  |\n|  | 06 mg/dL  |\n| During  | 137 mg/dL  |\n| After  | 100 mg/dL  |\n| A  | 37 mg/dL  |\n| Pre Workout  | 143 mg/dL  |\n| After  | 100 mg/dL  |\n| A  | 43 mg/dL  |\n\n【36】Table 2： Variation in the capillary glucose Delta (A) with 80% of 1RM at baseline， during and after the intervention of a RT session.\n\n| Glycemia  | Moment  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Pre Workout  | 267 mg/dL  |\n| During  | 281 mg/dL  |\n| A  | 14mg/dL  |\n| During  | 281 mg/dL  |\n| After  | 240 mg/dL  |\n| A  | 41 mg/dL  |\n| Pre Workout  | 267 mg/dL  |\n| After  | 240 mg/dL  |\n| A  | 27 mg/dL  |\n\n【38】Discussion\n\n【39】The objective of this research was to evaluate the glycemic responses of a type 1 diabetic who underwent strength training with different intensities. Our findings showed a better acute response in low intensity exercise， at 40% of 1RM.\n\n【40】A study conducted by Silveira et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u> investigated the acute effects of different strength training intensities on glycemic fluctuations in individuals with DM1， using the intensities of 40%， 60% and 80%of 1RM， with capillary blood glucose measurements being taken at rest， immediately after exercise ， 10 min after exercise， 20 min and30 min after exercise， resulting in a lower concentration of glucose in all intensities up to 30 min after training， however， without showing a significant difference between the three training intensities during each training period time.\n\n【41】However， the study showed a significant difference between rest and 10 min after， 20 min and 30 min after training at the three intensities investigated， and during these periods of time， the glycemic drop at 40% of 1RM was moderate， unlike the fall between the highest intensities， 60% and 80% of 1RM， which revealed a fall in great magnitudes 30 min after the last exercise 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>.\n\n【42】Campos， Paixao et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u> conducted a case study with a type 1diabetic in order to evaluate the hypoglycemic effect of resistance training with an emphasis on movement along the eccentric phase in an individual with an insulin infusion pump， the study lasted four weeks where the applicability of the training was three times a week.\n\n【43】Capillary blood glucose data were collected 15 min， 30 min and45 min， during and after training. The study found a significant drop in glycemia during the training sessions， the authors associate the glycemic drop with a greater activity of the GLUT4 protein， physical exercise promotes an increase in energy expenditure and associated with this there is an increase in the AMP： ATP ratio， this mechanism promotes the activation of AMPK， which is associated with translocation of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane 通用删除6(英):<u>[5，6]</u>.\n\n【44】The activation of the AMPK enzyme may explain the reduction in glucose during the training intensities performed in this study， as it is one of the precursors of activation of GLUT4， in addition， exercise promotes the suspension of the mTORC1/S6K1 protein删除1换行that is capable of phosphorylating IRS1 into serine and interrupting the insulin signaling cascade 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Thus， a greater phosphorylation of AMPK and Akt protein occurs， a mechanism that activates GLUT4through an insulin-independent signaling cascade 通用删除6(英):<u>[5，13]</u>.\n\n【45】A study carried out with type 2 diabetes conducted by Moreira， compared the acute effect of strength training exercise of different intensities of lower cardiovascular-metabolic stress on glucose control， intensities of 23% 1RM and 40%1RM were used， while end of the study it was concluded that both intensities were effective in reducing glycemia in individuals with type 2 diabetes， demonstrating that even at low intensities， the muscle contraction performed by exercise can promote GLUT4 translocation and in the reduction of capillary glycemia 通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u>.\n\n【46】The increase in capillary glycemia during training to 80% of1RM and a smaller drop immediately after training compared to a session at 40% of 1RM may be related to hormonal and metabolic responses antagonistic to the decline in blood glucose stimulated to high-intensity exercise 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>. Guelfi et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u> state that， metabolic and hormonal responses， elevated catecholamine and growth hormone levels， may contribute to avoiding a decline in blood glucose levels at the beginning of recovery， since these hormones stimulate increased hepatic glucose production and inhibits insulin-mediated glucose通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>. One study that compared responses to glucose levels in high-intensity interval aerobic training vs. moderate-intensity aerobic training demonstrated a drop in blood glucose in both protocols， but glucose levels in interval training high intensity remained stable during recovery due to the hormonal versus regulatory response， which it did not occur in moderate training， where glucose levels continued to fall 通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>.\n\n【47】Despite the benefits of physical exercise， one of the biggest concerns when relating physical exercise and DM1 patients is the risk of hypoglycemia 通用删除6(英):<u>[16，17]</u>. However， unlike continuous mild to moderate exercise， in high-intensity exercise the occurrence of hypoglycemia does not is frequent 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>. Exercises with anaerobic component (weight lifting/resistance exercises， sprints and high intensity interval training) reduce the risk of hypoglycemia during and after physical exercise in DM1通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>.\n\n【48】Processes regulated by independent insulin mechanisms are generally preserved when people with diabetes engage in high-intensity work. These processes include normal increases in glucose production and disposition during and immediately after exercise， as well as a normal rate of decline in glucose production after exercise. Since glucose production is mainly controlled by catecholamine’s， current data suggest that physically fit patients with insulin-dependent diabetes can exercise vigorously and exercise require high-intensity workloads 通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u> Catecholamines (epinephrine， nor epinephrine， dopamine) exhibit effects excitatory and inhibitory effects of the peripheral nervous system and actions in the Central Nervous System(CNS)， in addition to modulation of endocrine function， such as insulin secretion and glycogenolysis rate 通用删除6(英):<u>[17，18]</u>.\n\n【49】The findings of the present study revealed that in strength training at 40% 1RM， glycemic levels showed a continuous drop in the moments during training and immediately after training which occurred due to muscle contraction that is one of the factors responsible for the greatest GLUT4 activity. However， in the 80%1RM strength training session there was an increase in capillary glycemia above pre-workout levels， which can be justified by the删除1换行regulatory action of the hormones responsible for the production of liver glucose， even so， the higher intensity strength training was able to promote glycemic drop at the end of the training session to lower levels than with the pre-workout moment. Strength training can also be prescribed because it has a lower risk of hypoglycemia in addition to promoting increased muscle strength and cross section that only the high intensity of strength training can promote 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>.\n\n【50】Conclusion\n\n【51】It is concluded that in this case study， for this participant， both training protocols showed a drop in capillary glycemia values at the end of the training session， however the protocols showed different behaviors during the session， where the strength training at 40% of1RM. The fall happened continuously， while in strength training at80% of 1RM there was an increase in blood glucose during the session and then a fall in capillary blood glucose levels， which demonstrate that different intensities will result in different physiological responses. It is important to emphasize the need for blood glucose monitoring before， during and after training， in order to obtain greater safety for the diabetic and reduce the risks ofhypoglycemic events.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

In addition to autoantibodies， Helicobacter pylori or Hepatitis C may be the cause of ITP. These illnesses are accompanied by co-existing antibodies that may have an impact on the antiphospholipid antibodies， and coexisting immune dysfunctions and molecular mimicry 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. Ayurveda， yoga therapy， and nutrition modification can all be used as integral part of an integrated treatment plan for a variety of illnesses.\n\n【2】Case Presentation\n\n【3】The patient， a 10-year-old girl， was identified having Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura(ITP) in 2019. She was admitted in the hospital due to symptoms that included an unremarkable peripheral smear， a physical exam that only indicated minor signs of bleeding linked to the low platelet count. The doctor suggested repeated hospital stays in addition to typical conventional medical therapy. Romiplostim 500 mcg Sc/once weekly， Pantop 40 mg/daily， Folvite 5 mg once daily， Tab. Tranexamic acid 1 g when bleeding occurs， and Tab. Shelcal 500 were normally administered to the patient as part of the standard care. Till June 16\"， 2023， these said medications were still being used. On the same day， the girl was brought to a clinical set up having the facility of complementary and alternative medicine near Betnoti，Odisha， East India. In addition to having an abnormal differential leukocyte count (Neutrophilic leukocytosis with myeloid left shift， Dc：Myelocyte + metamyelocyte=16%， Stab Segmented=67%，Lymphocytes =15%， Monocytes =02%)， the patient also had a lower platelet count (68，000/mm’of blood) and a higher white blood count(18100/mm’of blood). Additionally， the patients complained of excruciating bodily pain， weakness， and excessive menstrual flow. The patient additionally underwent yoga and ayurvedic therapy in addition to normal medical care. The patient asked to en gage in yoga meditation， Yoga Nidra 通用删除1(英):<u>(longer version of yoga induced relaxation)</u>， and Sukshma Vyayam (subtle light intensity yoga techniques). Two turmeric tablets， two Giloy tablets， one table spoon of Triphala churna (a blend of Emblica officinalis， Terminalia bellerica， and Terminalia chebula)， and one teaspoon of Chirata powder (Swertia chirayita) each day was recommended. Four tablespoons of each of two different plant leaf juices were taken by the patients on an empty stomach. For a week， the following plants were utilized to make a chart： Syzygium cumini L， Carica papaya， Triticum aestivum， Dalbergia sissoo， Murraya koenigii， Mangifera indica， and Psidium guajava L are some examples of related plants. Any two-plant leaf that is prepared as leaf juice on a rotating basis. For preparation of leaf juice， healthy young plant leaves were frequently selected and crushed in a stone grinder. Additionally， the patient was told to have a vegetarian diet composed of 50% raw food and50% cooked food. The dish was cooked with Indian indigenous ghee. For detoxification， the patient was instructed to consume one bowl of papaya and one bowl of guava.\n\n【4】After undergoing additional treatment for 21 days， the patient significantly improved. The platelet count (342000/mm’ of blood)， hemoglobin concentration， and RBC count increased markedly.Neutrophil by 69.2%， Lymphocytes 25%， Eosinophil 3%，Monocytes 0.5%， Basophils 0.7%were the normal differential leukocyte counts， and the total WBC count (11725/mm’of blood) was reduced to a normal level. The patient reports feeling better， having less physical discomfort， and having fewer blood stains on their skin after receiving the Yoga and Ayurveda treatment module.\n\n【5】Discussion\n\n【6】In general， yoga practice improved mental stability， happiness， and mental calmness， as well as overall life quality. Moreover， a study reported that pregnant women who practiced yoga for three months had higher platelet counts than the control group 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. This is in response to the patient's requesttoincorporate yoga to their treatment regimen. ILP is mostly caused by autoantibodies， and a study found that doing yoga for 8 weeks couldreducethe symptoms ofautoimmune disease 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. In addition， the patient was instructed to take several Ayurvedic drug combinations， which were primarily composed of plant extracts. In dengue patients， platelet counts increased by taking extracts of the leaves of the giloy (Tinospora cordifolia) plant 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. The herb giloy has an immunomodulatory effect， improves cellular immunity， encourages the formation ofantibodies， and also improves lysosome activity and antibody responses 通用删除6(英):<u>[6-8]</u>. In a mouse model， a methanolic extract of Syzygium cumini L dramatically increased both the platelet and leukocyte counts 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>. Moreover， a study with Busulfan-treated mouse models， demonstrated that administering nanocurcumin (curcumin derivatives) could retain bone marrow integrity and enhance the quantity of circulating platelets while the patient is receiving treatment with turmeric tablets 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>. To boost immunity against autoantibodies and raise platelet count， patient was instructed to take various leaf extracts. The platelet count in dengue patient markedly elevated with the juice of Carica papaya leaves 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>. Mango leaf was shown to considerably boost RBC count in normal albino rats 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>. Patients with thrombocytopenia caused by alcohol-induced liver cirrhosis， Carica papaya and Tinospora cordifolia phytoextracts increased platelet count within 15 days and return it to normal within 90 days of treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. However， a study reported that giving a patient one tea spoon of Chirata (Swertia chirata) powder dramatically increased the platelet count in healthy rats when given at high doses 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. Murraya koenigii is a rich source of phenolic chemicals， alkaloids， flavonoids， and steroids. According to one study， Murraya Koenigii semi-solid plant extract ingestion increased blood count in phenylhydrazine-induced anemic rats 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>. An excellent source of phenolic acid and flavonoid content is wheat grass (Triticum aestivum) and it was reported in thrombocytopenic rats that wheat grass (Triticum aestivum) considerably lowered bleeding and clotting times and raised platelet counts 通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u>. As the patient was advised to consume papaya fruits and leaves，possibly the polyphenolic chemical present in papaya fruit， leaves， and seeds had improved the formation of RBC and platelets 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>. It was accepted with the fact that the immune system was made more tolerable by a number of plant extracts， which prevented autoimmune diseases. WBC count， cellular immune response， and humoral immune responses were enhanced by Dalbergia Sissoo 通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>. The patient was instructed to consume Triphala powder because it has a positive effect on the immune system. According to a study， Triphala demonstrated immunomodulatory effect by changing neutrophil activities in albino rats， including phagocytosis， adhesion， and NBT reduction 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>. In a dose-dependent manner， Triphala treatment demonstrated a considerable suppression of complement activity， HMI， CMI， and mitogen-induced T-lymphocyte proliferation. These findings indicated that Thiphala inhibited the experimentally generated inflammation， demonstrating its potency in the management of autoimmune illness and inflammation 通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u>. Currently it is very clear with the fact that combining yoga treatment with Ayurveda improved cell-mediated immunity and platelet count in ITP.\n\n【7】Conclusion\n\n【8】In the patient with Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura(ITP)， the platelet count considerably rises after doing yoga and an ayurvedic module， and the differential leukocyte count returns to normal. Numerous studies demonstrated that the plant extracts used in Ayurveda increased platelet count， while its mechanism of action remains unclear. Yoga also boosts the immunity and enhances the production of blood cell. Precisely we can conclude that Yoga and Ayurveda module improved the quality of life by improving the physicaland mental health. Since there have been very few studies on Ayurveda and Yoga therapy， it is exceedingly challenging to pinpoint the exact mechanism by which the platelet count rises in ITP. Future researches may be carried out to understand its mechanism more appropriately.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

The diagnosis is usually made using cystoscopy with biopsy. Here we report a case about a tumor-like eosinophilic cystitis in a 36 vear old man.\n\n【7】Case Presentation\n\n【8】A 36 year old smoking man， with history of psoriasis since the age of 20， was admitted December2018 in our department with hematuria， suprapubic pain and frequency evolving for 2 months. The patient had no known an atopic disease nor drug allergies.\n\n【9】On physical examination he was afebrile and hemodynamically stable with hypogastric tenderness. He was passing hematuria with clots. Skin examination revealed erythema-squamous lesions on the elbows and knees. Blood Cell Count (BCT) showed neither eosinophilia nor anemia. Renal function was normal. Urinalysis showed no infection.\n\n【10】Computer Tomography (CT) scan  revealed a large budding lesion with a large implantation base without secondary lesion.\n\n【11】He underwent cystoscopy which found a large solid tumor on the right side of the bladder dome that was partialy resected. Pathology  reports on the tissue biopsy indicated dense and polymorphic inflammatory reorganization with eosinophilic predominance of the mucosa without signs of malignancy.\n\n【12】The diagnosis ofEC was retained. Postoperative recovery was unremarkable， urine was cleared， and corticosteroids 20 mg/daywere administrated for 4 weeks associated with topical corticosteroids. We performed a second cystoscopy for complete resection. A follow up 20 months later revealed an asymptomatic patient on the urological and skin level，and ultrasound examination and cystoscopy showed no evidence of disease recurrence.\n\n【13】Literature Review\n\n【14】Eosinophilic cystitis is an inflammatory condition defined as the infiltration of the bladder by eosinophilic cells.\n\nThe etiology of EC is still unknown， but some conditions were blamed， such as transitional-cell carcinoma，intravesicalimmunotherapy 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>，allergic diseases (asthma，rhinitis)，autoimmune diseases(psoriasis as in our case， coeliac disease)， certain medications (sulfonamide， cyclophosphamide) parasitic disorders， eosinophilic enteritis 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u> and allergyto chromic catgut suture.

Blood tests can reveal eosinophilia， especially found when EC is associated with an allergic disease.\n\n【16】Urinalysis is often normal， but may show a urinary tract infection which shouldbetreated. Renal failure may exist due tohydronephrosis or bleeding.\n\n【17】Ultrasound，as well as CT scan and MRI may showvariable aspects：Thickening of the bladder wall， a mass formation， hydronephrosis and blood clot or can be normal. Cystoscopic abnormalities include inflammatory lesions (edema， erythema and velvety red lesions)， ulcerations and tumors. None is pathognomonic. Therefore，biopsy is needed to confirm the diagnostic.

It is postulated to be a reactivation of JC virus in a severely immunocompromised state， to manifest as a multifocal inflammatory white matter disease of the brain， commonest in supratentorial region. We present a case of subacute ataxia and bulbar weakness in an undiagnosed HIV patient， mimicking a lateral medullary infarct.\n\n【2】Case Details： A 57 year old patient， not previously undiagnosed to have HIV infection， presented with slurring of speech and imbalance， 3 weeks after COVID-19 pneumonitis.

However， patient had progressive worsening of dysarthria and sensorium， warranting us to dig deeper and unmask HIV disease and a low CD4 cell count， thus helping us clinching the diagnosis of infratentorial presentation of PML.\n\n【3】Conclusion： Isolated medullary involvement in PML is an even rarer presentation of this rare disease seen in immunocompromised individuals.\n\n【4】Introduction\n\n【5】PML is alytic infection of oligodendrocytes and astrocytes seen in an immunocompromised host， caused by reactivation of JC virus 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. The neurological deficits correspond to areas of demyelination in the brain. The most frequently affected regions are the cerebral hemispheres at the periventricular and/or subcortical white matter 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. Infratentorial presentation is rare and when occurs， is seen typically in the middle cerebellar peduncles and pons. Isolated medullary involvement is even rarer (5% to 7%) 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. We present a rare case of infratentorial PML mimicking a lateral medullary syndrome in an undiagnosed HIV patient.\n\n【6】Case Presentation\n\n【7】57 year old male， no known comorbidities， presented with dysarthria， dysphagia and imbalance for 5 days. Patient had a past history of COVID pneumonia 3 weeks ago and was treated with oxygen with mask and remdesivir.\n\n【8】Patient had scanning speech and dysphagia， more to liquids. Examination revealed right gaze evoked nystagmus with right limb ataxia， with impaired tandem gait and swaying towards right side. MRI brain revealed multifocal areas of diffusion restriction and FLAIR hyperintensity involving the right half of thelateral medulla，left frontal and parietal lobes and right parietal lobe.MRI angiogram was normal .\n\n【9】通用间距删除-1:<u>Citation：</u>\n\n【10】通用间距删除-1:<u>2D echo did not reveal any abnormality， and patient was discharged on dual anti-platelets and statins with a Ryle's tube.</u>\n\n【11】After 3 weeks， patient presented with worsening of dysphagia and imbalance with visible tachypnea， pooling of oropharyngeal secretions and hypoxia. Patient needed elective intubation for airway protection. Repeat MRI showed expansion of right medullary lesion with FLAIR hyperintensity with peripheral diffusion restriction and a new frontal hyperintensity， involving subcortical U fibers with a sharply demarcated peripheral border and an ill-defined inner border， without contrast enhancement .\n\n【12】HIV by ELISA was detected to be positive with CD4 count 155 cells/ml. Serum toxoplasma IgM was negative. CSF showed protein 94 mg/dl， sugar 53 mg/dl with parallel blood sugar 98 mg/dl with2 cells， no atypical cells were noted.\n\n【13】The characteristic MRI picture and HIV positive status with low CD4 cell count pointed towards possibility of PML. Hence CSF John Cunningham Virus PCR was ordered and it turned out positive. Unfortunately， patient succumbed due to progressive brainstem involvement.\n\n【14】Discussion\n\n【15】PML is a white matter disease of immunocompromised host with predominant fronto-parietal involvement. It has been observed in a variety of immunocompromised states like HIV， SLE； post-chemotherapy， chronic kidney disease etc 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>.\n\n【16】In a case report by Finelli et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>， misdiagnosis of PML as a stroke mimic was discussed， with case details of two patients who turned out to be HIV positive at a later date. One of these patients had a transient ischemic attack with retrospective evaluation of MRI showing subcortical white matter changes. The other patient had a left thalamic and left parietal lesion that was treated as a chronic infarct， with a diagnosis of a cryptogenic stroke. Both patients were删除1换行reevaluated at a later date in view of progressive worsening of clinical deficit and had a poor outcome.\n\n【17】Infant et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u> have reported a single case of infratentorial PML mimicking an acute ischemic stroke in a patient of chronic lymphocytic leukemia.\n\n【18】Initial presentation of PML as predominanttmedullary involvement mimicking lateral medullary syndrome was also observed in another case report by Durafort et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u> in a patient undergoing hemodialysis. This report highlighted the possibility of PML in an unconventional immunocompromised state such as chronic kidney disease.\n\n【19】Similar to this scenario， our patient did not have a known immunocompromised condition atpresentation， delaying the diagnosis of HIV and initiation of ART. The clinical presentation of bulbar weakness and ataxia with gaze evoked nystagmus coupled with a history of COVID pneumonitis in recent past prompted the consideration of a lateral medullary infarct. This clinical suspicion was further strengthened by the diffusion restriction in right lateral medullary lesion. As with other cases described in the literature， progressive worsening of bulbar weakness and sensorium prompted a repeat imaging and search for other etiologies.\n\n【20】In 2012， Liu et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u> have published an article from a neuroradiologists’ perspective of stroke mimics. They mention.1Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease CJD， PML and Herpes encephalitis as infections mimicking stroke clinically and radiologically. They noticed that an ADC bright signal in the diffusion restricted lesions should alert the clinician against the diagnosis of infarct.\n\n【21】MRI hasa superior sensitivity in the detection2and characterization of PML lesions though the diagnosis may be suspected by CT scan 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. However the diffusion restriction observed in PML lesions can mimic an infarct. On TiW sequence， the lesions are hypointense， due to apoptosis of virus infected oligodendorcytes. There may be an incomplete hyperintense rim on pre-contrast T1W images， representing lipid laden macrophages at the advancing edge of the lesion. T2 W images the lesions appear hyperintense due to demyelination， and typically involve the periventricular and subcortical white matter， having scalloped lateral margin when they involve the subcortical white matter predominantly in the parieto-occipital lobes. Lesions are more conspicuously visualized in the T2FLAIR sequences， appearing hyperintense against a background of suppressed CSF signal intensity. Mass effect is infrequently described and usually minimal and correlation with shorter survival when seen on initial studies. The pattern may be unilateral， but more often bilateral and asymmetrical with involvement of posterior fossa. PML may also involve the basal ganglia and deep white nuclei as there are white matter fibers in these regions. The lesions typically do not enhance as the blood brain barrier is intact. There have been some reports ofperipheral mild or diffuse enhancement suggestive of good immune response and hence improve prognosis. There have been reports with lesions having cystic component suggesting tumors or abscess4.\n\n【22】The CSF biochemistry and cytology is normal. Our patient showed raised proteins with normal sugar and no cellularity. In CSF， detection of JC virus by PCR is diagnostic. The sensitivity is 70% and specificity is 90% to 100%. If the PCR for JC virus is negative in a scenario with high degree of suspicion， a repeat CSF examination or brain biopsy is advocated which confirms the diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>.\n\n【23】Infratentorial involvement in PML is rare， till now 5 to 6 cases have been documented with brainstem/cerebellar involvement as a presenting feature of PML 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>. Typically， middle cerebellar peduncle， pons and cerebellum is involved clinically and radiologically. Pontine lesions may extend to the midbrain and medulla. Isolated medullary lesions are uncommon (5% to 7%). There is a single case report with bilateral medullary lesion by Matthew et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>. Our patient had a unilateral lateral medullary involvement， which gradually progressed to involve medial structures engulfing the cardiac and respiratory centers.\n\n【24】The delay in diagnosis of PML due to its presentation like a stroke mimic has been discussed by Finelli et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>， advising screening of all suspected stroke patients to be screened for HIV.\n\n【25】Conclusion\n\n【26】PML is an important differential for a stroke mimic， both clinically and radiologically. Characteristic MRI features help distinguish between these two clinical entities with separate treatment approaches.

The results of PTC for a patient with illness anxiety disorder are presented here based on a brief account of his video recorded therapy sessions. The results and the empirical evidence obtained from the treatment of the patient indicated that PTC psychotherapy is a short-term yet very effective approach. The results of 28 months follow-up proved that the improvements were stable and constant. No relapse was reported within the follow-up period. The results of the present study can be applied to new developments in the field of psychotherapy theory， research， and practice.\n\n【2】Keywords： Psychotherapy； Paradox； Timetable； PTC； Illness Anxiety Disorder\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Treatment ofpsychological disorders has faced serious challenges sincethe beginning of scientific approaches to psychotherapy 通用删除6(英):<u>[1-3]</u>. Among these challenges are the preferred treatment approach， the length of treatment (number of treatment sessions)， the treatment costs， the treatment efficacy and outcomes， the treatment suitability， the treatment ending， and the relapse of the symptoms. The two major approaches to psychotherapy constitute psychodynamic psychotherapy and behavioral therapy. In recent decades， these approaches have sought to create intervention techniques and methods to overcome the aforementioned shortcomings and increase the treatment success 通用删除6(英):<u>[4-71</u>. However，the existence of limitations andproblems related to the treatment， the patient， the disorder type， the therapist， the length of treatment， the costs oftreatment， the treatment outcomes， and the rate of relapse necessitate devising more efficient psychotherapeutic approaches. As a paradoxical psychotherapy， PTC 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u> is an approach to treating psychological disorders which aims to overcome the aforesaid limitations and shortcomings. The present paper aimed to report a briefaccount of the PTC treatment for illness anxiety disorder.\n\n【5】A brief summary of PTC-treatment protocol\n\n【6】PTC treatment consists of two components： paradox and timetable. Paradox refers to the prescription of disorder symptoms； and timetable refers to executing the paradoxical task within a certain amount of time and to a certain degree. In PTC therapy， these two components are inextricably linked and the therapist should prescribe them together for the patient. Similarly， the patient ought to do the task to a certain degree and within the pre-planned period of time. The inseparability of these two components， called the paradoxical timetable， is regarded as one of the innovations in this psychotherapeutic approach. According to PTC， the paradoxical task should be done only within the pre-planned period of time. In other words， the paradoxical timetable should either be performed within the time limits or never performed at all. The therapist asks the patient to start the paradoxical timetable tasks 24 h after the first session is held. The delayed beginning is another feature of PTC psychotherapeutic model.\n\n【7】Case Presentation\n\n【8】Mr. NK is a 26-year-old single man admitted to an academic psychotherapy center with IAD. He is a university graduate with an M. Sc degree. The patient signed an informed consent document prior to performing the treatment sessions for both treatment and use of the anonymized case information for educational，learning， and research purposes. A written consent also signed by the patient for video recording of all treatment sessions. For initial evaluation the patient participated in a diagnostic interview 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>， the short version of the Health Anxiety Index (SHAI； 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>)， and Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II； 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>). The patient met criteria for DSM-5 illness anxiety删除1换行disorder， as well as a total score of 38.7 for the SHAI indicating significant health related anxiety，and a total score of 17.9 for BDI-II. Subjective ratings on illness anxiety and symptoms on a scale of 0(none) to 100 (extreme) percent were obtained at regular intervals. Illness anxiety during the first session was 100 out of 100. At his last session， his illness anxiety reduced to 0.00/100. Total scores of the SHAI and BDI-II reduced to 13.2 and 8.7 at post treatment， respectively. We next present the application of PTC for treatment of IAD based on a detailed video recorded treatment sessions of NK.\n\n【9】The application of PTC to lAD-case of NK\n\n【10】The clinical interview based on the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V；通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>)， confirmed the existence of Illness Anxiety Disorder. He explained his symptoms thus in the first session： Following an unprotected sexual intercourse， I was afraid I might have contracted AIDS. I have had tests twice so far， which said that I am HIV negative. As time goes on， however， I feel more and more anxious and scared and I constantly check my body for AIDS symptoms. Whenever I hear anything about this illness， I feel really， really bad. My sleep is disturbed， I have lost my concentration， I have become short-tempered and irritable， I feel indifferent about everything and I have lost all motivation. He said that he had a long history of disturbed sleep， indifference and bad moods， the only difference being that they were short-term before and disappeared after a few days. But， following the anxiety about AIDS that started last year， they have remained with him. He had no history of taking medication and does not use drugs now. In line with the PTC model， the exact symptoms were prescribed along with the following timetable： for the first week， recreate thoughts and worries about AIDS three times a day (at 8：00， 16：00， and 23：00)， each time for 7 to 10 min. For the second week， do the same task twice a day (at8：00 and 23：00). At the beginning of the second session， the patient reported that he had done successfully about 80% of the tasks：“I feel I am much better. When I recreated those thoughts according to the timetable， at other times they did not bother me. I mean， they rarely entered my mind. Even while doing the tasks， I tried so hard to summon those thoughts， but they just didn’t come (smiles). All in all， the frequency of the thoughts has decreased by 30 to 40 percent， but they still haunt me every once in a while\". He was then assigned the following timetable： for the first week， four 5-min sessions (at 9：00，13：00， 17：00， and 23：00) every day， and for the second week， three5-min sessions (at 9：00， 17：00， and 23：00) every day. Answering the patient’s request for tasks related to depression and bad moods， the therapist told him that if depression continues after the fear of AIDS has been cured， they can arrange a timetable for it. According to the report given by the patient in the third session， he had made further improvements up to 50%. The fourth session was arranged to be four weeks later， with the following timetable to be carried out in between：for the first two weeks， three times a day (at 9：00，19：00， and 23：00)， each time for 5 min； and for the second two weeks， twice a day (at9：00 and 23：00). The patient reported in the fourth session that he had made improvement up to 90%. He also added that his bad moods and depression had also gone away， and he could sleep soundly. The following timetable was then arranged： one 5-min session for the first week (at 17：00)， and sessions on even days for the second week. He was to cease the tasks on the third week. The therapist explained to the patient that if there is a relapse after the third week， he must wait for 5 days to a week， in order to make sure the symptoms have returned. Then，he can arrange a timetable himself， similar to what was assigned to him for the first week. In the fifth session， that was删除1换行held about four months later because of the summer holydays， the patient reported that he had made further improvements and there had been no relapse.\n\n【11】Evaluating the treatment outcome and follow-up\n\n【12】The result of the treatment evaluation was based on the patient's ratings and was graded on a scale from 0 to 100 as well as an open-ended question. The evaluation indicated that the 100% improvement of the patient， which resulted from PTC therapy， continued after28-month follow-up.\n\n【13】Discussion\n\n【14】The accounts given by the patient of the second session show that he has succeeded in doing the tasks. The patient reported having forgotten to say in the first session that he had been obsessed with AIDS because he thought the needle they used to take his blood was contaminated. However， due to the nature of the special clinical interview in the PTC model， in which the patient is asked to recreate the exact symptoms (the symptoms which are mentioned during the session or are later remembered； another feature in PTC model)， the patient tried to recreate these fantasies and thoughts during the tasks between the sessions. Despite the efforts made by the patient to recreate the symptoms exactly during the task， the symptoms were not re-experienced. This different condition is common during the paradoxical timetable tasks. The patient surrenders to the conditions of the disorder and is defeated by the symptoms. Suffering from these anxious symptoms， he is willing to be relieved of them and bends over backward to eliminate them. At the time of doing the tasks， the patient acts quite the reverse， according to the therapist's instructions. He wants the symptoms to be present for a couple of minutes and wants to experience them of his own volition. In this stage of treatment， the mere “wanting” constitutes the beginning of the individuals empowerment. This is the same empowerment which is called “ego-strength” and is the main and ultimate goal of PTC treatment. This wanting at the present is clearly the opposite of“not wanting in the past and signifies the individual's power and temporarily resolves the fundamental intrapsychic conflict， which is the basis for the symptoms of the disorder. In the absence of this conflict， the symptoms disappear. The amount of the symptoms was reduced during certain times of the day at a satisfactory level： the删除1换行patient stated that 40% of the thoughts and worries concerning the illness anxiety were gone.\n\n【15】Based on the progress reported by the patient， the frequency and severity of the disorder， and the amount of the residual symptoms， the paradoxical timetable tasks were prescribed for the patient to be carried out in the interval between the second and the third sessions. According to a 40% progress， the patient was asked to do the tasks four times a day during the first week and three times a day during the second week. The report of the patient at the third session showed that the prior level of progress increased by 10% (i.e. 50% between the second and the third session). A one-month interval was inserted between the session three and four so that the patient would be able to do the task three times a day for the first two weeks and to continue to do it twice a day for the second two weeks. The reason behind this time interval was the severity of the illness anxiety and its consequences such as depressed mood and attention deficit， which the patient raised in the previous session. A longer interval provides an opportunity for the therapist to prove or reject the hypothes is that the symptoms are reactive； likewise， the patient will have a chance to see whether the depression and attention deficit symptoms will be relieved when the symptoms of the illness anxiety disorder are treated.\n\n【16】The patient reported a 90% progress， a condition which continued in the interval between the third and fourth sessions， which was about a month. It is regarded as a controlled and favorable condition in which the patient has a four-month break before the fifth session. According to the agreed plan， the patient ought to do the tasks once a day during the first week and every other day during the second week which concludes the tasks. Since a four-month break comes before the next session， the paradoxical timetable is explained for the patient in a way that he can prescribe for himself. This is a sort of self-therapy and is one of the features specific to PTC model. It is the same feature that turns the patient into a therapist at the end of the PTC therapy. This treatment plan will be explained to all patients in the last session and will totally obviate the need for another therapy session in case of the relapse. According to this treatment plan， and based on the therapist's instructions， the patient is trained to stop doing the tasks at a certain interval (usually two weeks) after the last therapy session. If the symptoms happen to return， the patient should prescribe and do the paradoxical timetable according to the symptom severity and similar to the therapist's instruction. The clinical evidence based on the patient's account indicates that this method is effective just like the treatment under the supervision of the therapist， returning the patient to his normal condition. The patient's account of the fifth session showed that the improvement had continued for four months and that the patient was 100% content and was ready to end the therapy.\n\n【17】Conclusion\n\n【18】The results of PTC treatment for IAD showed that PTC psychotherapy model is a successful and efficient psychotherapy. This model is a simple very short-term psychotherapy， which benefits both the therapist and the patient. Experts in the treatment of psychological disorders can easily learn the principles and techniques of this model and apply them to a range of psychological disorders. Patients can achieve the best results as well， based on the therapist's prescribed tasks in the shortest possible time. According to the删除1换行treatment outcome of the patient’s follow-up as well as the published results of twenty patients with different psychological disorders 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>， the results of this very short-term therapeutic model have apt stability and constancy. Moreover， the relapse rate in this model is in its lowest level compared to other psychotherapeutic methods. Along with other evidence and reasons， this finding is an empirical evidence that shows PTC psychotherapy has succeeded in bringing about deep and constant therapeutic changes. Among other features of PTC psychotherapy model is the fact that the patient becomes a therapist and， if necessary， he/she can prescribe and do a similar paradoxical timetable for himself/herself.\n\n【19】Compliance with Ethical Standards\n\n【20】Ethical Approval： All procedures performed in studies involving Wer human participants were in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional and/or national research committee and with the1964 Helsinki declaration and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards.\n\n【21】Funding and Acknowledgement\n\n【22】The authors would like to acknowledge the financial support of University of Tehran for this research under grant number5106003/1/81.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

After several ADP injections at the T12/L1 level， spinal anesthesia with hyperbaric bupivacaine 9 mg and fentanyl 15 g was delivered via the L3/4 interspace； however， analgesia only reached the T12 level. If bupivacaine leaked into the epidural space along with the CSF through the damaged dura， it would be responsible for the lack of analgesia. Under general anesthesia， the scheduled procedure went off without a hitch. If there is significant CSF leakage during spinal anesthesia in pregnant women following ADP， the anesthesia level may not grow as planned.\n\n【2】Keywords： Accidental dural puncture； Spinal anesthesia； Combined spinal-epiduralanesthesia； Cerebrospinal fluid； Failed spinal anesthesia\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Post-Dural Puncture Headache (PDPH) is hypothesized to be caused by Cerebrospinal Fluid(CSF) leaking following an epidural， and Accidental Dural Puncture (ADP) is a complication of epidural anesthesia that can lead to PDPH.

When the Tuohy needle was progressed around 5 cm with a median approach， however， ADP occurred and CSF flowed forcefully. Next， an effort was made to implant an epidural catheter at T11/12， however gradual CSF leakage was noticed from the Tuohy needle. A second puncture was performed at T11/12， but CSF leakage was discovered， thus the epidural catheter was not inserted. A 25-G pencil-point needle was used to provide spinal anesthetic from L3/4. 1.8 ml of 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine and 16 g (0.4 ml) of fentanyl were delivered upon confirmation of CSF reflux by regurgitation at about 5.5 cm needle depth. After eight minutes in the supine head-down tilt posture， the patient's anesthetic level had only grown to T12. The patient was subsequently moved into the left lateral position and 1 ml of 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine was injected from L3/4. However， the patient continued to feel discomfort in the lower abdomen after 18 min， therefore the surgery was conducted under general anesthesia. The abdomen X-ray following surgery revealed no lumbar deformity. After surgery， the patient continued to experience severe headaches for more than three weeks. Two years later， the patient was scheduled for a second caesarean surgery. Spinal anesthesia was delivered with 2 ml of0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine and 15 g (0.3 ml) of fentanyl using a 25-G pencil point needle inserted at L3/4， attaining an anesthetic level of T5 this time.\n\n【14】删除1:<u>Copyright C 2023 Harmilan K.删除13:<u> This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License， which permits unrestricted use， distribution， and reproduction in any medium， provided the original work is properly cited.</u></u>\n\n【15】Discussion\n\n【16】The patient's analgesia level was expected to spread considerably following spinal anesthesia due to the confirmed CSF backflows. However， even after repeated injection of bupivacaine， analgesia删除1换行remained insufficient， and there might be various reasons for this. Bupivacaine may have been injected outside the subarachnoid area， notwithstanding the confirmed backflow of CSF. The CSF collected in the epidural space following dural puncture may have been aspirated into the spinal needle implanted from L3/4 and bupivacaine may have been administered into the epidural space due to a misconception that the spinal needle had been appropriately advanced into the subarachnoid space. It might have been accomplished. In this case， however， such a situation could be ruled out since the anesthetic level climbed to T12 following medication administration， indicating that pharmaceuticals were administered into the subarachnoid area， and the backflow of cerebrospinal fluid was unquestionably from the subarachnoid space. In clinical situations， even anesthetic solutions that are administered into the epidural area are not easily aspirated. Arachnoid cyst may have been one of the causes of spinal anesthesia failure 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>， which would not have occurred because spinal anesthesia administered two years later was successful. A second option is that some of the bupivacaine delivered to the subarachnoid area escaped into the epidural space， leaving inadequate anesthetic in the subarachnoid space. After the patient was positioned in the supine position， the hyperbaric bupivacaine migrated cephalad in accordance with gravity and leaked through the dura injury site. We assume that a substantial volume of Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) spilled into the epidural area， based on the intensity of the postoperative headache 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. The CSF exuding from the Tuohy needle at T11/12may have been CSF collected in the epidural space that seeped through the dura injury site， since collection of CSF in the epidural space following spinal tap has been documented in both infants and young adults 通用删除6(英):<u>[3，4]</u>. This report is limited by the absence of an MRI删除1换行or ultrasound imaging confirming the accumulation of CSF in the epidural space. It has been found that continuous spinal anesthesia is beneficial for caesarean section 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. After the second ADP， the conversion of CSEA to continuous spinal anesthesia may have been an option for anesthetic management.\n\n【17】In conclusion， we saw a situation in which spinal anesthesia following ADP in a pregnant lady did not produce the required amount of anesthesia. Clinicians must consider the risk that spinal anesthetic administered to pregnant women following ADP may be insufficient due to CSF leaking.\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>1. Parikh KS， Seetharamaiah S.

Within this group， one of the most frequent lesions is pancreatic serous cystadenoma. Usually， this is a benign pathology， with very low risk for malignancy.\n\n【3】We present a case of a woman， operated on because ofa long-standing pancreatic lesion， with a pathological diagnosis of serous microcystic pancreatic cystadenoma.\n\n【4】Case Presentation\n\n【5】A 69-year-old female patient， diabetic， with a tumor on the head of the pancreas， compatible with serous pancreatic cystadenoma， negative cytology for malignancy and negative tumor markers， which conditions compression of the stomach and duodenum causing abdominal pain and abdominal bloating. An abdominal mass was palpated on physical examination. The abdominal CT and MRI revealed a huge heterogeneous lesion in the head of the pancreas， well-defined contours， multiloculated， moderately hyperintense in sequences with long TR and hypointense in T1， parietal and septal enhancement . In upper gastrointestinal endoscopic ultrasound showed a lesion of more than 9 cm in the head of the pancreas， formed by microcysts giving the typical honeycomb image. A biopsy of the tumor was taken and the pathological results were compatible with serous cystadenoma.\n\n【6】Withtheseresults，itwasdecidedtodoasurgicalresection，performingapancreaticoduodenectomy with Y-Roux reconstruction through bilateral subcostal laparotomy. The pathological study of the piece was a serous microcystic cystadenoma of the pancreatic head， with respected margins and the lymph nodes included do not present notable alterations .\n\n【7】The patient had a favorable recovery being discharged on the eighth day ofhospitalization.\n\n【8】Discussion\n\n【9】Pancreatic cystic neoplasms are rare lesions. Its prevalence is estimated between 2.6% to 15%of cystic lesions， increasing its incidence with age. It also represents 1% of pancreatic neoplasms通用删除6(英):<u>[1-3]</u>. The most common are mucinous cystic neoplasms， serous cystadenoma， mucinous papillary intraductal neoplasms， and solid-papillary cystic neoplasms. The main challenge is to differentiate the lesions that will benefit from a conservative management from those that require surgical treatment due to their potential for malignancy.\n\n【10】In the European evidence-based guidelines on pancreatic cystic neoplasms published in 2018， it is established， with a high degree of recommendation， that MRI is the gold standard test for diagnosis and follow-up of this entity. It is especially useful to identify the possible communication between the main pancreatic duct and the cyst as well as the presence of mural nodules 通用删除6(英):<u>[4，5]</u>. CT\n\n【11】One of the most frequent is serous cystadenoma， the second most frequent pancreatic cystic tumor of this pathology. Its prevalence is estimated around 10% to 16%通用删除6(英):<u>[7-10]</u>. It is considered a benign tumor， which originates from the centroacinar cells of the pancreas. The risk of malignant progression is very low， less than 1% of cases are malignant serous cystadenomas 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>. In a multinational study， Jais et al. includes the largest cohort of patients diagnosed with pancreatic serous cystadenoma， which includes 2，622 cases， and only 0.1% were diagnosed with pancreatic serous cystadenocarcinomas 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>.\n\n【12】It predominantly affects women， around 75%， with a mean age at diagnosis between 58 to 65 years，according to the series 通用删除6(英):<u>[7，9，10，121</u>.\n\n【13】Most of serous cystadenoma are asymptomatic but depending on the location of the tumor and its size， symptoms such as abdominal pain， jaundice or episodes of acute pancreatitis may appear 通用删除6(英):<u>[7，12]</u>. Jais et al. in their article， around 61% of the cases were asymptomatic. If symptoms occur， the most frequent were nonspecific abdominal pain(27%)， pancreaticobiliary symptoms (9%)， diabetes mellitus (5%) and other less frequent symptoms such as palpation of an abdominal mass， nausea， vomiting or asthenia 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>.\n\n【14】As they are mostly asymptomatic， serous cystadenomas are frequently diagnosed by chance in imaging tests performed for another reason. They are usually located in the body and tail of the pancreas， although they can be located in any part of the pancreas7，10，12.\n\n【15】Morphologically， four different types can be established 通用删除6(英):<u>[8，12]</u>. The most frequent variety is microcystic， characterized by presenting multiple cysts smaller than 2 cm separated by fibrous septa， which gives it a typical “honeycomb”image and， in some cases， an area of fibrosis or central calcification can be observed 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u> and they are usually found in the body-tail of the pancreas. The next most frequent is the oligocystic or macrocystic type， which shows cysts in a smaller number than the previous one but larger in size and they are commonly located in the pancreatic head. There is a mixed variety among those previously described and finally， the variety of solid cystadenoma， characterized by a single cyst with a solid appearance with enhancement on CT but histologically they are serous cystadenomas.\n\n【16】Despite advances in imaging tests， the definitive diagnosis can be difficult， so the main goal is to identify those cystic lesions that are malignant or those which could progress into a malignant lesion. For this， the combination of at least two imaging techniques (CT and MRI) are useful. Endoscopy ultrasound with fine needle aspiration permits analyze intracystic fluidl providing information about cytology， viscosity and levels of amylase and tumor markers， among others 通用删除6(英):<u>[14-16]</u>.\n\n【17】Histologically， serous cystadenomas are characterized by a layer of epithelium formed by cuboid cells rich in glycogen and the presence of mucin is not characteristic. CEA and amylase levels will be low in intracystic fluid. In fact， high levels of CEA almost completely rule out serous cystadenoma and would be reason to consider another entity 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>. For example， in mucinous cystic neoplasia and mucinous papillary intraductal neoplasia， CEA will be elevated 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>.\n\n【18】Both the European evidence-based guidelines on pancreatic cystic neoplasms and the American Gastroenterological Association Institute Guideline on the diagnosis and managementofasymptomatic neoplastic pancreatic cysts for the diagnosis and management of pancreatic cystic neoplasms， in those cases in which the diagnosis of serous cystadenoma is confirmed and they are asymptomatic， a conservative management and a follow-up based on the patient’s symptoms is recommended 通用删除6(英):<u>[10，12，18]</u>.\n\n【19】Surgical treatment is indicated in those cases in which imaging tests， including CT，MRI and gastrointestinal endoscopic ultrasound， have not been able to reach a clear diagnosis or there are doubts about its malignancy， in rapidly growing lesions and symptomatic patients due to pancreatic tumor 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>. The surgical technique resection of the lesion will depend on the location of the tumor.\n\n【20】Conclusion\n\n【21】Although it is a benign entity， the management of pancreatic serous cystadenoma remains controversial， as it is difficult to reach a definitive diagnosis with the available diagnostic tests nowadays.

A late diagnosis， unplanned pregnancy course and delivery are related to a 40% to 50% maternal and fetal mortality risk. Conversely， early detection and treatment significantly reduces both to 5% to 15%. Based on a literature review and our implications for the present case report， we suggest a multidisciplinary diagnosis and management algorithm PHEO in pregnancy.\n\n【2】Case Report： A35-year-old primigravida at 27+1 weeks of Gestation [GA] presented with headache and previously diagnosed chronic Hypertension [HTN] aggravation. Complete evaluation ruled out pregnancy related HTN. A high suspicion level for an alternative cause for HTN was raised. Appropriate imaging studies revealed a heterogenous mass adjacent to the left adrenal 8 cm x 7cm in diameter， highly suspicious for adrenal tumor. Elevated urine catecholamines confirmed the diagnosis ofPHEO. A multidisciplinaryteam was formed and a joint decision for disease control and delayed surgery until after delivery was taken. Blood pressure control was achieved by a combined alpha and beta-adrenergic blocker approach at levels of 135-140/80-90.\n\n【3】Antenatal steroids for fetal lung maturation were administered with concurrent 24 h BP Holter. Her condition remained stable and at 32+0 GA a planned cesarean section delivery using a minimal intraperitoneal handling technique under neuraxial anesthesia. A male newborn of 1，960 g was delivered， 1'/5'Apgar score 6/9. The medical therapy was continued with lower BP goals and a planned laparoscopic adrenalectomy performed after 2 weeks of postpartum recovery. The mother and child were discharged in good condition.\n\n【4】Conclusion： The maternal and fetal lethal consequences of PHEO during pregnancy may be prevented by a high index of suspicion for the diagnosis and following a multidisciplinary algorithm of management， adapted to the individual patient， mainly based on achievement of BP control and the gestational age.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】35-year-oldprimigravida at 27+1 weeks of Gestation [GA]，work immigrant from the Philippines， was referred to our center with a diagnosis of severe aggravation of chronic Hypertension [HTN].\n\n【7】Her medical history was positive for a HTN disease diagnosed four years prior to referral and diagnosed as essential； treated with TRITACE (5 mg/25 mg ramipril and hydrochlorothiazide 5mg) tid. Her family history was positive for chronic HTN (mother and maternal grandmother). Additionally， she was diagnosed with Diabetes Mellitus type 2 [DM通用删除6(英):<u>2]</u> and treated with Metformin850 mg/daily with no regular control of glucose levels.\n\n【8】Her pregnancy was spontaneously conceived while a HbA1C % level of 6.5%. Genetic screening consisted of nuchal translucency， biochemical 1 and 2n trimester screening as well as fetal anatomy Ultrasound [US] evaluation； all reported within normallimits. During the 1trimester she reported intractable headache and Blood Pressure [BP] values registered as high as 240/125. At the time the patient denied flushing， palpitations， and sweating. Labetalol 200 MG tid was then added.\n\n【9】She was referred to the emergency department at 27+1 GA because of headache. The initial examination the BP measured 198/119， with no skin or vasomotor changes. The laboratory workup was within normal limits； hemoglobin percentage 13.6 g %， platelet count 413K， normal liver function and Protein Creatinine Ration [PCR] of 0.14. The uterine fundal height corresponded to the GA and the fetal biophysical profile was 10/10. A diagnosis of aggravated chronic HTN删除1换行prompted treatment with intravenous hydralazine and magnesium sulfate and admission to the maternal fetal medicine ward.\n\n【10】Due to the sustained high BP the differential diagnosis was extended from superimposed Preeclampsia [PET] spectrum other chronic HTN causes (endocrinopathies， renal artery stenosis etc.). Further examination included ophthalmologic examination， echocardiography， renal artery Doppler studies； all within normal range. Abdominal Sonography revealed a heterogenousmass adjacent to her left adrenal measured 8 cm × 7 cm . A subsequent Magnetic Resonance Imaging [MRI] showed a T2hyperintensity space occupying lesion， without hyper vascularization and neither lymphadenopathy . A differential diagnosis of Pheochromocytoma [PHEO] versus Adreno-Cortico-Carcinoma[ACC] was raised. A 24 h urine with a metanephrine level of 94.9mcg/24 h [range 39 to通用删除6(英):<u> 256]</u> nor-metanephrine 14777.7 mcg/24 h[range通用删除6(英):<u> 92-604]</u> confirmed a diagnosis of PHEO.\n\nA multidisciplinaryteam Of maternal-fetal medicine， neonatology， endocrinology， anesthesiologists， and general surgery删除1换行was formed. The midpoint of the discussion was the balance upon the immediate surgical tumor removal in the presence of pregnancy induced cardiovascular changesand a 28 weeks uterus and subsequent delivery or deferral of the adrenal surgery until fetal maturity. After consideration of the data and previous surgical experience and a joint consult with the mother a decision was made for continuous hospitalization aimed towards the utmost conservative approach regarding the pregnancy. The aim was set for a Cesarean Delivery[CD] at 32 weeks to be followed by the adrenal surgery. A combined antihypertensive therapy was started consisting of Labetalol 400 mg tid， Amlodipine 10 mg tid and Doxazosin 7 mg bid； with a therapeutic goal of BP of 130/80； a dose of corticosteroids for fetal lung maturation under Holter monitoring of BP. Within a week of the medical therapy the BP goal was achieved. In parallel insulin therapy was started and glucose control reached. The fetal growth was appropriate and daily|删除段之间换行|fetal wellbeing assessment (US BPP and NST) were reassuring.\n\n【12】At 32+0 weeks of gestation the mother was prepared for a minimal intraperitoneal handling technique of cesarean delivery with neuraxial anesthesia.\n\n【13】Upon entering the surgical suite， the patient was connected to a non-invasive BP monitor， administrated Midazolam (1 mg) and Esmolol (10 mg)； to meet the anxiety and related hypertension during the preparations. A radial arterial line was then placed (local anesthesia) towards a Combined Spinal Epidural anesthesia (CSE)， the patient received a spinal shot of hyperbaric Bupivacaine (5 mg)， Fentanyl (20 mcg) and Morphine (0.15 mg)， followed by Lidocaine2%(4 ml) injected into the epidural catheter， sensory T6 level block was diagnosed by pinprick.删除1换行with the umbilical cord 3 times around neck and a true knot. The placenta was sent for pathological assessment and later reported to be normal and adequate to the GA. Intravenous oxytocin was during surgery continued with administered， a low dose of Oxytocin drip (1unit/h) 24 h postoperative. The postoperative course was normal. The medical therapy was continued after the CD surgery for an additional two weeks in hospital. Thereafter， a planned for laparoscopic adrenalectomy under general anesthesia was preformed following a rigorous pharmaceutical preparation； a large highly vascular adrenal mass measured 8 cm in diameter was removed， no signs of macroscopic metastatic disease . The antihypertensive medication was limited to Labetalol 200 mg twice bid. The pathologic assessment ofthe adrenal mass confirmed the diagnosis of PHEO with intact capsule and no evidence of mitotic activity (Ki-67 proliferation index： 1%) or invasion.\n\n【14】Discussion\n\n【15】Pheochromocytoma [PHEO] a benign type catecholamine-secreting tumor， originating from chromaffin cells of medullary region of the adrenal gland or sympathetic ganglia， is an extremely rare cause of HTN disease；0.2% to 0.4%， ofall causes of hypertension. During pregnancy a scarce prevalence of 1 in 54，000 pregnancies has been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，2]</u>.\n\nThe diagnosis of PHEO is based on a high level of suspicion facing related severe HTN crisis. The immediate medical interventions as aimed to limit the hazards related to extreme HTN while the definite therapy is surgical resection with the laparoscopic approach being|删除段之间换行|GA： Gestational Age； BP： Blood Pressure； CD： Cesarean Delivery；TOP： Termination of Pregnancy； IUFD： Intrauterine Fetal Demise； NST： Non-Stress Test； BPP：Biophysical Profile， EFW： Estimated Fetal Weight删除1换行preferred 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. The effect of a concomitant pregnancy presents an additional consideration of the PHEO related hazards in view of the maternal-fetal safety concerns. Previous reports show that the two thirds of PHEO cases during pregnancy were diagnosed antepartum and the rest postpartum 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>.\n\n【17】The present case of PHEO during pregnancy is representative of all these challenges. We will focus on the PHEO-pregnancy related considerations and present a management algorithm  aimed to early antepartum diagnosis and therapy； both reported to decrease maternal mortality rates from 50% to less than 5% to 15%15-81\n\n【18】In PHEO， as in other surgical intervention during pregnancy， the second trimester of pregnancy is considered the optimal timing； due to the fetal organogenesis stage and in cases of intra-abdominal approaches， the gravid uterus does not impair the surgical view 通用删除6(英):<u>[9-14]</u>. Earlier reports of the PHEO included cases diagnosed after adverse outcome of a delivery or uncontrolled BP， thus with a significant bias towards a recommendation of immediate medical therapy and PHEO removal， irrespective of gestational age or fetal maturity. We hereby raise the concerns of catecholamine excessive secretion when manipulating the tumor， prolonged exposure to general anesthesia agents， prolonged right decubitus position with subsequent profound maternal hypotension and fetal deterioration. We suggest that reviewing the later cases， adrenal surgery may be deferred until after delivery in the late prematurity period.\n\n【19】The present suggested multidisciplinary conservative approach is aimed towards all these concerns. Mainly， it consists of an initial alpha-blocker together with an optional beta-blocker therapy to obtain BP control at any GA 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>. Predelivery medical therapy is based a-blockers at least until up to 14 days before surgery， followed by B-blockers to prevent reflex tachycardia 通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>. Among a adrenergic receptor blockers doxazosin rather phenoxybenzamine； although both category C drugs during pregnancy， the later was reported to be associated with neonatal cardiorespiratory complication 通用删除6(英):<u>[17，18]</u>. We suggest that the BP therapeutic goals in pregnancy should be higher than in the non-pregnant state， especially if longer period until delivery is expected； hypoperfusion of the uteroplacental unit， intrauterine growth restriction and placental abruption may occur with excessive low BP 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>.\n\n【20】Although the non-pregnant BP goal is considered less than130/80 mmHg while seated and greater than 90 mmHg systolic while standing 通用删除6(英):<u>[19，20]</u>， we suggest， a BP goal of 140/90； all the more in cases of PHEO diagnosis in the late 2n and 3r trimester ofpregnancy.\n\n【21】Gestational age， fetal status， patient’s response to medical treatment，malignantcharacteristics ofthetumorandthe respectability of thetumor are the main factor to take into consideration in order to plan the surgical excision 通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u>.\n\n【22】Before 24 weeks of pregnancy， the recommendation is that the delivery should be postponed after the surgical therapy， for full maternal benefit； and the mode determined by obstetric considerations. The 24 weeks limit has been derived from the fetal viability limits； however， we may suggest that since these limits are re-defined， 22 weeks of gestation seems a more reasonable bound. After fetal viability， additional considerations such as HTN crisis， placental abruption prior to or during adrenal surgery together with the difficult surgical field approach are to be taken in consideration通用删除6(英):<u>[9，17，22]</u>. Nevertheless， antihypertensive therapy and hemodynamic删除1换行instability during adrenal surgery may be seriously detrimental to the fetus leading to severe brain hypoperfusion. We consider that the consult in the fetal pre-viability period should include the option of termination of pregnancy. In case surgical intervention is performed and the pregnancy is continued， careful targeted fetal brain imaging into the second part of the pregnancy is warranted.\n\n【23】In cases the PHEO is diagnosed after fetal viability， that the mainstay of the management should be aimed the achievement and maintenance of maternal BP response to medical therapy， under hospitalization in a center with multidisciplinary facilities. This first goal successful achievement is the indicator that allows postponing delivery and refraining from extreme prematurity，i.e.，at least until 32weeks gestation 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>. Although fetal movements have been postulated an ability to induce adrenal hypertensive crisis； we found no robust proof in the literature； including the present case. Antenatal steroids for fetal lung maturation are to be administered with concurrent 24h BP Holter.\n\n【24】The delivery， either emergency or planned should be attended by a multidisciplinary team. Previous case reports suggested a higher maternal mortality rate after Vaginal Delivery [VD] in contrast with elective Cesarean Section [CS] 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>； CS is reported to lower the maternal and fetal mortality rate from 33% to 19% 通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u>. This might be the base that approximately 80% of the cases were delivered by CS； either planned or emergent 通用删除6(英):<u>[20，21]</u>.\n\n【25】The excess of maternalfetal hazards in the case ofavaginal delivery， has been explained by the maternal BP stress induced rapid changes， elevation of the intra-abdominal pressure during labor and the labor and the related pain which can result in excessive catecholamine's secretion. We consider that independent of the BP control， in view of a planned premature delivery with an expected low cervical Bishop score， a planned CS is the preferred mode of delivery. Importantly， the pain management is critical in either delivery situation 通用删除6(英):<u>[24-26]</u>.\n\n【26】The anesthetic management goal for the CS is preoperative anxiety limitation and BP stability and monitoring； in addition to ASA standard monitoring， a radial arterial line is warranted.\n\n【27】Neuraxial anesthesia should be considered for PHEO Caesarean sections 通用删除6(英):<u>[26]</u>. This type of anesthesia may prevent the swift rise in BP often observed during intubation and reduce pain-related hypertension via use of intrathecal morphine. However， neuraxial anesthesia (namely spinal anesthesia) often results in sympathectomy， causing an associated decline in BP. In the present case a Combined Spinal Epidural anesthesia (CSE) approach was elected， as it allows the use of reduced doses of intrathecal Bupivacaine and reduced subsequent hemodynamic effects， with additional epidural doses， if needed.\n\n【28】Conclusion\n\n【29】In cases of concomitant PHEO and pregnancy， timed diagnosis， a multidisciplinary approach  with planned delivery will benefit the mother and the fetus with a favorable outcome.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

For further evaluation a transesophageal echocardiography was performed， which showed a 3.2 cm × 2 cm vegetation on the Right Ventricular (RV) lead. The patient was referred to our hospital for further diagnostics and treatment. We repeated the transesophageal echocardiography， which brought the same result so we decided to perform a CT-scan. A full cardiac cycle CT scan was performed on a photon-counting CT scanner， which showed besides vegetation on RV lead other multiple vegetations on the anterior leaflet of tricuspid valve in 4D imaging. The CT finding convinced us to opt for open surgical explanation of CRT-ICD System and surgical intervention of tricuspid valve. The CRT-ICD System was explanted safely， the vegetations were removed， and the anterior leaflet of tricuspid valve was partly resected and reconstructed using modified De Vega technique.\n\n【2】Keywords： CRT-ICD System； Tricuspid valve Endocarditis； Photon counting CT scan； Full cardiac cycle CT-imaging\n\n【3】删除1:<u>OPEN ACCESS Introduction</u>\n\n【4】通用间距删除-1:<u>Correspondence：</u>\n\n【5】删除7:<u>通用间距删除-1:<u>Mohammed Yusuf Asif， Department of Cardiac Surgery， Bundeswehr Central Hospital， Rubenacher StraBe 170，56072 Koblenz， Germany， E-mail：YusufMohammedAsif@</u></u>\n\n【6】通用间距删除-1:<u>bundeswehr.org</u>\n\n【7】删除7:<u>通用间距删除-1:<u>Received Date：01 Dec 2022Accepted Date： 19 Dec 2022Published Date： 27 Dec 2022</u></u>\n\n【8】通用间距删除-1:<u>Citation：</u>\n\n【9】Transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography are the gold standard in the diagnostics of infective endocarditis. Along with Echocardiographic investigation， the role of CT scan in localization of vegetation is highly appreciable. With the advancement in the CT-technology was recently Photon Counting CT system (PCCT) introduced. It is a form of X-ray Computed Tomography (CT) in which X-rays are detected using a Photon-Counting Detector (PCD). These photon-counting detectors have the potential to overcome the limitations of current CT detectors， by providing CT data at very high spatial resolution， less noise， improved contrast-to-noise ratio， low radiation dose and with intrinsic spectral information. They are much more dose efficient than other detectors， have smaller pixels， which can significantly increase the spatial resolution. Here， we can expect qualitative images that visualize very fine tissue structures with low radiation and less use of contrast agent. Photon-counting CT offers several significant advantages over other existing CT imaging techniques， which opens potential to scan cardiovascular patients， overcoming compromises in lung and bone imaging and imaging of other organs and systems 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，2]</u>\n\n【10】删除3:<u>Asif MY， Dillinger D， Waldeck S， Zielezinski T， Feyrer R.

Six months later， the patient was admitted again in the same hospital with progressive dyspnea(NYHA III)， general weakness and weight loss. The laboratory report presented with leukocytosis， thrombocytopenia， CRP elevation， raised transaminase and creatinine levels. The blood cultures were negative.

A full cardiac cycle CT-scan with a photon counting CT scanner (NAEOTOM Alpha， Siemens Healthineers， Forchheim， Germany) was performed， which showed vegetation on the RV-lead and multiple minor vegetations on the anterior leaflet of tricuspid valve.

Its accuracy depends on factors like size and localization of vegetations， calcifications， concomitant valvular defects and the experienceofechocardiographer通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>.\n\n【19】The photon counting CT have certain advantages over other preexisting CT-scan techniques. The metal artifacts， beam hardening artifacts and noise streaks are better mitigated. High contrast and high-resolution structures are also better visualized 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. The photon counting CT scan reduces radiation exposure， reconstructs images at a higher resolution， corrects beam hardening artifacts， optimizes the use of contrast agents and creates opportunities for quantitative imaging relative to other CT technology 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. A full cardiac cycle CT investigation enables the assessment of morphological and functional structures of heart and can also be used to analyze in depth the ventricular function 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>.\n\n【20】In our case， the vegetations on the tricuspid valve were in echocardiography not clearly visible， so we decided to perform CT-scan. A full cardiac cycle CT investigation with a photon counting CT scanner was done to explore the vegetations on tricuspid valve. The result was very convincing and helpful in making the decision for major surgical intervention.\n\n【21】There are also otherTaa.lternative methods，Ssuch as18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission1Tomography with Computed Tomography-based attenuation Tomography correction(18F-FDG PET/CT)， which has been increasingly used in the diagnosis of infective endocarditis. Its accuracy and sensitivity are reported to be better than echocardiographic investigations 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>.\n\n【22】Conclusion\n\n【23】Despite all echocardiography remains first choice and a great diagnostic tool in evaluation of infective valvular disease， but CT scan performed especially on photon counting CT scanner can play an additional important role in representation of cardiac structures as a whole. It should be considered as standard in some selective cases of infective endocarditis， where echocardiography cannot provide sufficient information.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

This modelhas recently been used frequently as part of best evidence medical education in framing the question for gathering and using evidence in medical education 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Hart and Harden， based on the best evidence in medical education recommended five steps in gathering and using evidence in medical education including framing the question， developing a search strategy， evaluating the evidence， implementing change and evaluating that change 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. The PICO model used in this article is an innovation of the five steps that incorporate developing a search strategy， evaluating the evidence， implementing change and evaluating that change intothe last two steps of comparison and outcome analysis. The innovative PICO model aims删除1换行to reflect the change of medical educational approach from opinion-based to evidence-based medical education 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. The aim of this article is to examine the effective use of this model in the senior medical students’ clinical placement learning through reflection of clinical cases on an elective exchange program. The literature on the clinical case will be reviewed to maximize the students learning with the use of innovative PICO model. An atypical case of metastatic malignant melanoma was selected for the PICO model discussion from medical educational perspective for both medical students and medical educators. Australia has the highest incidence (men 12% & women9%) of melanoma in the world with thirty Australians diagnosed with melanoma every day and more than 1，200 death from the disease each year (Understanding Melanoma-Melanoma Institute Australia，2019)通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. China has a much lower melanoma incidence rate of 0.17%with approximately eleven Chinese diagnosed with melanoma every day (International Agency for Research on Cancer China Globocan，2018) 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. The five equal first authors of this article are interns of the First Affiliated Hospital，Sun Yat-Sen University， Guangzhou， China. They visited Curtin Medical School， associated teaching hospitals in Perth and general practice clinics for four-week' supervised electives as medical observers. Their supervisor was the corresponding author and has identified this atypical case of malignant melanoma in general practice clinic for the learning of holistic and comprehensive care from the medical educational perspective. By reviewing the management course of this atypical case of metastatic amelanotic melanoma to brain， the innovative PICO model was used to review the updated treatment of metastatic melanoma with comparing various treatment modalities and the outcomes of treatment. The academic benefit for the Chinese students'learning is achieved in the management of melanoma， which is a relatively rare skin cancer in China， while management discussion in this case will certainly enrich management options and provide valuable input into future research direction with a relatively common skin cancer in Australia.\n\n【7】Case Presentation\n\n【8】John， a 39-year-old Caucasian man presented to his general practitioner with 2 years history of depression and treated with sertraline (SSRI) with minimal improvement， he also developed chronic low-grade headache for 4 months. In view of his depression and chronic headache， MRI brain was ordered with surprised finding of multiple ring-enhancing lesions with craniotomy biopsy confirming metastatic melanoma， subsequent skin check found an unpigmented mole 2 cm ×2 cm appearing like seborrheic keratosis to be nodular amelanotic melanoma.MDT discussion after review of the literatures indicated the best plan of treatment includes removal of primary lesion and monoclonal antibody treatment with ipilimumab with good effects initially， metastatic lesions reduction in size in 6months MRI review. The next 3 months’ ongoing treatment did not show any further improvement clinically and radiologically. He simply deteriorated with frequent seizures despite optimal doses of anti-epileptics， and was then referred to palliative care for symptom control and holistic care to ensure good quality of life care. A clinical geneticist was consulted as well for the benefit ofhis sister and brother in terms of melanoma screening and regular skin cancer check.\n\n【9】Methods and Results\n\n【10】Investigation and methods\n\n【11】In this article， we identify this atypical metastatic malignant melanoma for demonstration of the innovative PICO model for删除1换行the medical educational purpose of the five Chinese exchange senior medical students. The five students were required to use the innovative PICO model to analyze their daily cases load and identify one case for the daily group debrief with their supervisors. The average case load for each student is eight cases per whole day to apply the innovative PICO model for academic learning. The group has chosen the atypical metastatic melanoma case to demonstrate the PICO-style clinical placementlearning.\n\n【12】Salient leaning points and results of group feedback regarding the use of the PICO model\n\n【13】PICO is a relatively new term in both evidence-based medical research and evidence-based medical education in China. The five students have used the innovative PICO model for their daily case studies in symptom analysis， relevant investigation， diagnosis confirmation and treatment modality decision. The feedback from the PICO model use was that it was an excellent and most valuable tool for the busy schedule of clinical placements in hospital and general practice clinics. It has certainly improved the retention of academic knowledge and helped immensely in attaining the clinical reasoning skills to become a competent intern and clinician in future clinical training and practice.\n\n【14】Comparison and outcome with salient points and literature review\n\n【15】In this section of the article， we have used the innovative PICO model to demonstrate the learning of holistic and comprehensive care via evidence-based and individualized approaches by reviewing the management course of this atypical case of metastatic amelanotic melanoma to the brain. We use the opportunity to review the updated treatmentof metastatic melanoma with differenttreatment modalities from different perspectives. Through this case and the innovative PICO model， we have maximized the medical educational benefits for both medical students and medical educators about evidence-based and individualized clinical reasoning with personalized management approach. The perceived benefit will help medical students establish a universally holistic approach in their individual specialty career asa holistically competent clinician. The current concept of holistic approach is defined as optimal patient care in a biological-psychological-social-political-economical-spiritual way.\n\n【16】In the next few sections， we llbe discussing the differenttreatment modalities and its literature review on this atypical metastatic melanoma.\n\n【17】Surgery on the primary site of melanoma\n\n【18】Surgical excision with histologically negative margins is the recommended and first-line treatment for primary cutaneous melanoma of any thickness， as well as for melanoma in situ. Surgical margins should be based on tumor thickness 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>.\n\n【19】However， as for distant metastatic melanoma， surgery is generally not an option for first-line therapy. For one thing， surgery is rarely curative since the majority of patients with distant metastases have widespread micro-metastatic lesions even if clinical and imaging criteria suggest limited spread. For another， the application of some advanced systemic therapies， such as checkpoint inhibitors， has been proved to be highly effective for patients with metastatic melanoma. Therefore， surgery is mainly performed for limited， isolated soft tissue and nodal metastases that can be completely resected or for complications of metastatic disease in need of urgent palliation (e.g bleeding or obstructing gastrointestinal lesions).\n\n【20】Surgery is an attractive option for dermal metastases because patients are quickly rendered “disease-free” with relatively limited associated morbidity. In contrast，systemicallyadministered therapies require prolonged treatment courses to achieve relatively inferior local response rates 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. Besides， excision of systemic， particularly solitary lung melanoma metastases may also increase patient survival 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>. Wong et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u> reported a 5-year survival rate of 20%in 144 patients who underwent surgical resection of non-regional melanoma metastases and a phase II trial by the Southwest Oncology Group reported overall 3- year and 4-year survival rates of 36% and31%， respectively， in stage IV melanoma patients 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>.\n\n【21】In thecondition ofbrain metastatic melanoma like whatpresented in this article， resection is mainly limited to patients with a solitary or single brain metastasis and is often performed for symptomatic relief. Goldinger et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u> have demonstrated an overall survival benefit in all patients with single brain metastases who undergo resection compared with radiation therapy alone. There may also be a role for resection in oligometastatic disease of dominant， symptomatic lesions. As the field comes closer to achieving integrated histologic and genetic diagnoses for these patients， a secondary benefit of de bulking is the procurement of adequate tumor tissue for molecular characterization. Investigators in one study compared the genomics of matched brain metastases and primary tumors across multiple histologies and demonstrated that >50% of brain metastases harboured genetic alterations that were not detected in the clinically sampled primary tumor 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>.\n\n【22】When surgery is considered， careful patient selection is important and treatment must be individualized. Factors to be considered include the severity of symptoms， pace of disease progression， previous treatment and treatment response， patient age and medical condition， and the desires of the patient. Quality of life should be the principal goal of treatment for many patients.\n\n【23】In our case， the brain metastatic lesions are multiple， so resection is not considered as a feasible option. We only performed the removal of the primary lesion with the goal of durable local control as recommended in guidelines 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>.\n\n【24】Target Therapy\n\n【25】Molecular researches on progression of melanoma have led to drugs targeting specific mutated point of tumor cells.\n\nThe largest genomic subtype of melanoma is BRAF V600 mutant which takes up approximately 50% of all advanced melanoma (Cancer Genome Atlas Network，2015) Vemurafenib and dabrafenib are both potent BRAF inhibitor that significantly improved overall survival for patients with metastatic melanoma harboring BRAF mutant(vemurafenib vs.dacarbazine， OS 13.6 m vs. 9.7 m，P=0.03；dabrafenib vs. dacarbazine， median PFS 5.1 m vs. 2.7 m， P<0.0001)通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>. MEK also plays an important role in pathogenesis of melanoma with BRAF mutant. Trametinib is a highly specific inhibitor of MEK which is proved to significantly prolong PFS in patients with BRAF-mutation positive metastatic melanoma (Trametinib vs. chemotherapy， 4.8 m vs. 1.5 m，P<0.001). Cobimetinib and Binimetinib are the other two MEK inhibitors approved by the FDA in 2015 and 2018 respectively. Combination of BRAF inhibitor and MEK inhibitor is recommended as first line treatment for metastatic melanoma with BRAF mutation. In 2019， a randomized phase III clinical trial showed that patients receiving dabrafenib plus trametinib achieved PFS rates of 21% at4 years and 19% at 5 years as well as a complete response rate of|删除段之间换行|19% 通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u>. It is a dramatically improvement in patients with BRAF-mutation positive metastatic melanoma.\n\n【27】The other subtypes of metastatic melanoma include NRAS and KIT mutation. Interestingly， binimetinib has shown clinical activity in patients with metastatic melanoma harboring NRAS， who failed to response to immunotherapy. Imatinib is a non-specific c-kit inhibitor， which has also presented with significant clinical responses in patients with KIT alterations. However， these responses are more likely to be seen in tumors harboring KIT alterations of proven functional relevance 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>.\n\n【28】Next-generation sequencing has identified our patient as BRAF V600E mutation， which indicates combination treatment of BRAF inhibitor and MEK inhibitor. It is found that B-sitosterol could attenuate melanoma cell growth in vitro and inhibits brain metastasis in vivo， which represented as a promising adjuvant to BRAF inhibitor therapy in patients with， or at risk for， melanoma brain metastasis通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>. Combination targeted therapy plus B-sitosterol can be a reasonable choice.\n\n【29】Chemotherapy\n\n【30】Chemotherapy has become a secondary treatment option due to the advances of immunotherapy and targeted therapy. Systemic chemotherapy is considered an alternative therapy only in patients who are not candidates for immunotherapy or target therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>.\n\n【31】Dacarbazine， temozolomide， fotemustine and nab-paclitaxel are common singe-agent chemotherapy for metastatic melanoma. Dacarbazine and temozolomide are most widely used. Dacarbazine is an intravenous cell cycle nonspecific alkylating agent that is generally well tolerated， with most common side effects of nausea and vomiting. Temozolomide is an orally absorbed analog of dacarbazine. A randomized phase III study showed temozolomide demonstrates equal efficacy to dacarbazine in treating metastatic melanoma 通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u>. Temozolomide can penetrate the blood-brain barrier due to its lipophilic feature， which presents with better efficacy in patients with brain metastasis of melanoma 通用删除6(英):<u>[19，20]</u>. In 2015，aclinicalphase II study showed patients with BRAF mutation and low MGMT expressions had a better response to temozolomide based chemotherapy 通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u>. Fotemustine is a nitrourease agent that is considered as a second line chemotherapy after dacarbazine. Given its high lipophilicity， fotemustine also proved its efficacy in cerebral metastasis 通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u>. Nab-paclitaxel is nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel interfering with disassembly of microtubules to suppress tumor cell proliferation. A randomized controlled phase III trial in 2015 showed that nab-paclitaxel significantly improved PFS compared with dacarbazine in chemotherapy-naivepatients with metastatic melanoma(nab-paclitaxel vs. dacarbazine， 4.8 m vs. 2.5 m， P=0.044) 通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u>. Combination regimens including dacarbazine/temozolomide and carboplatin/paclitaxel are second or third line chemotherapy. There is no evidence to confirm superiority of combination regimens to single-agent chemotherapy.\n\n【32】Chemotherapy did not play a significant role in initial treatment forour patient who had multiplebrain metastases with only mild extra cranial cutaneous lesion. However， it could be applied after failure of response to immunotherapy or target therapy. In that situation， temozolomide or fotemustine could be an appropriate option.\n\n【33】Im munotherapy\n\n【34】options in an attempt to improve theprognosis ofadvanced melanoma通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u>， including special subsets like metastatic brain melanoma 通用删除6(英):<u>[25]</u>， mucosal melanoma 通用删除6(英):<u>[26]</u>， recurrent female genital tract melanoma通用删除6(英):<u>[27]</u>. It is critical to determine the timing of onset of immunotherapy， combining radiotherapy with immunotherapy or targeted therapy in metastases 通用删除6(英):<u>[28]</u>.\n\n【35】Immune checkpoint inhibitors，such asnivolumab(anti-programmed cell death.11，PD-1)，ipilimumab{anti-cytotoxic Tlymphocyte-associatedantigen 4， CTLA-4)， pembrolizumab(anti-PD-1) are monoclonal antibodies approved for treatment of unresectable metastatic melanomaa通用删除6(英):<u>[24</u>.While combining ipilimumab and nivolumab as first-line regimen， treatment-naive patients with unresectable stage IIIC/IV melanoma achieved higher overall objective response rate than those with failure prior BRAF/MEK targeted therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>[29]</u>. Furthermore， retreatment by nivolumab in challenging subgroups with progressed advanced melanoma on or after ipilimumab displayed safety and effective outcome in phase II clinical trials 通用删除6(英):<u>[30]</u>.\n\n【36】Despite of widely used， variant anatomical metastases illustrated different responsepatter ns as well as pseudo-progression and acquired resistance on ipilimumab and nivolumab therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>[31]</u>. Subsequently， a new strategyto realize personalized evaluation of individual patient before initiating anti-PD-1 antibodies is demanding 通用删除6(英):<u>[32]</u>. An updated algorithm， that analyses clinical parameters of tumor linked with the activation rate of CD8+ T cells as well as the net tumor growth rate， is potentially applicable for predicting the progressive time and making better clinical decisions 通用删除6(英):<u>[33]</u>.\n\n【37】If received nivolumab-plus-ipilimumab therapy， the patient with brain metastatic melanoma in this case were likely to achieved the progression-free survival of more than 60.0 months. As recently reported， significant immune-related adverse events of immunotherapyinclude cutaneous and neurocutaneous autoimmune or autoinflammatory diseases， e.g.scleroderma， psoriasis and dermatomyositis 通用删除6(英):<u>[34]</u>. Besides， symptomatic neurologic oedema for brain metastases is a remarkable complication which is a way to focus on in the future 通用删除6(英):<u>[25]</u>.\n\n【38】Additional immune-based drugs (cytokine) for metastatic or surgically resected ‘high-risk melanoma， composes of aldesleukin， interferon-a2b， PEGylated interferon-a2b 通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u>. As another evolving immunotherapy， an oncolytic virus therapy with intra-tumorally administrated Talimogene laherparepvec (T-VEC) also shows a benefit in survival of metastatic melanoma， whose mono therapy has been approved in the current National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines and combination therapy are undergoing clinical trials 通用删除6(英):<u>[35]</u>.\n\n【39】Interestingly， in combination with immune checkpoint therapy， PD-L1 antagonist， Dendritic Cell (DC)-targeted nano-vaccine is promising to boost anti-tumor effects against melanoma in future perspective 通用删除6(英):<u>[36]</u>.\n\n【40】Radiotherapy\n\n【41】Melanoma is a tumor relatively resistant to radiation， so it serves mainly as a palliative treatment to the symptomatic metastases to the organs like brain， bone， spinal cord， soft tissues and so on in cases with advanced melanoma as an adjuvant to systemic treatment， as chemotherapy plays a limited role in CNS due to inadequate penetration through the blood-brain barrier.\n\n【42】Brain metastases are common in cases with advanced melanoma and are an important cause of death. Surgical removal of masses is effective in symptom control，but there will be a high rate of recurrence通用删除6(英):<u>[37]</u>. So， for patients with brain metastases， they were treated with surgery followed by whole-brain radiotherapy traditionally to reduce or delay the occurrence of further brain macroscopic diseases. Although advances in radiotherapy techniques like Stereotactic Radio Surgery (SRS) has made great progress in the control of brain metastases adjuvant to systemic treatment， whole-brain radiotherapy is controversial now. As there are new drugs like ipilimumab effective in the brain metastases that cross the blood-brain barrier， and the advent of widespread MRI and screening MRI help discover brain metastases when asymptomatic and small， there's a greatly reduced need of whole-brain radiotherapy， which has late neurocognitive toxicity， in this radiation-resistant tumor 通用删除6(英):<u>[38]</u>. However， there are also many reports stating that combination of radiotherapy and immunotherapy will lead to a significant improvement in the clinical outcomes， as BRAF inhibitors have radio sensitization effect in melanoma cells 39，40.\n\n【43】Visceral metastases present a better radio sensitivity than brain metastases 通用删除6(英):<u>[41]</u>. However， radiotherapy is not applicable in the intestinal metastases because the intestines move in an irregular way. So the beam could be off-target， making radiotherapy ineffective. In contrast， metastases to the mobile organs like liver and lung can be treated with new techniques like Cyber knife. Besides， fixed foci are amenable to radiotherapy， like the duodenum， para-aortic lymph nodes and adrenal glands 通用删除6(英):<u>[42]</u>.\n\n【44】Bone metastases-Radiotherapy is very effective in the symptom control of bone metastases， with a documented rate of up to 96percent in the long-term pain improvement 通用删除6(英):<u>[43]</u>. For patients with symptomatic bone metastases， Stereotactic Body Radio Therapy(SBRT) may be preferred over External Beam Radio Therapy (EBRT).\n\n【45】Lymph nodes and skin metastases are also common in patients with advanced melanoma 通用删除6(英):<u>[44]</u>. Surgery is the first choice for the cases without extensive distant metastases. But radiotherapy is alternatives if surgery is not feasible. They provide symptomatic control including pain，bleeding and compression of surrounding structures.\n\n【46】As for the choice of total dose and fractions for each patient， there are many documented recommendations for different kind of situations， but each case must be individualized.\n\n【47】Palliative Care Management and Genetic Counseling\n\n【48】Palliative care is an interdisciplinary medical specialty， focusing on symptom management and involving psychosocial， spiritual， ethical， legal support both to patients and their family caregivers. We will focus on symptom management in this article. For advanced melanoma， palliative radiation therapy is an effective method of pain relief except pain-killers for skeletal metastases， cutaneous and lymph node metastases， cerebral melanoma 通用删除6(英):<u>[45]</u>. Besides pain control， treatments of brain oedema and seizure are also important for improving patients life quality. Systemic loading-dose glucocorticoids are initially for decreasing brain oedema surrounding metastases and relieving neurologic defects. And then minimum effective dose of steroids for long-term reduces steroid sequelae 通用删除6(英):<u>[46]</u>. If the patient has a seizure， antiepileptic medications are needed. But potential interactions with other anticancer agents should raise doctor's attention 通用删除6(英):<u>[47]</u>.\n\n【49】The etiology of all cancers involves the combined actions between environmental and genetic factor. Ultraviolet exposure is the most significant environmental risk factors for melanoma. Genetic factors， the most common of which are mutations of CDKN2A tumor suppressor gene in familial form of melanoma， also greatly modify the incidence of melanoma. So genetic testing may be indicated for the patients who have individually multiple primary melanomas， or multiple family members with melanoma， coexist with other primary tumors especially pancreatic cancer.However，even in the presence of these criteria， germline mutations in CDKN2A are uncommon， with the prevalence of 1% to 2%通用删除6(英):<u>[48]</u>.\n\n【50】Conclusion and Future Perspectives：Outcome and Outlook\n\n【51】Throughthis case duringthe students’four weeks electives， wehave demonstrated our innovative PICO model learning for all the cases. The treatment modality review on metastatic malignant melanoma provides us both a new insight and a deeper understanding into melanoma treatment in future. The perceived benefit will certainly see our medical students adopting a universally holistic approach in their individual specialty career as a competent clinician. The current concept of holistic approach is defined as optimal patient care in a biological-psychological-social-political-economical-spiritual way.\n\n【52】Final Discussion\n\n【53】The PICO model used by the students in this article is innovative and consolidates the students'learning and increase the retention of academic knowledge and clinical skills， especially in clinical placement setting. It is highly recommended by the authors of this article to introduce this innovative PICO model into the routine undergraduate clinical placement curriculum at both hospital and general practice teaching.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

Our aim is to suggest a management strategy in clinical practice for pediatricians and neurosurgeons.\n\n【3】Keywords： Pneumocephalus； Air compressor； IPneumocephalus management； Pediatric neurosurgery\n\n【4】Introduction\n\n【5】The term pneumocephalus defines the presence of gas within any of the intracranial compartments (intraventricular， intraparenchymal， subarachnoid， subdural， and epidural) and commonly is a consequence of skull base， sinus， or open skull fractures due to head traumas. Other causes could be post intrathecal procedure， congenital skull defect，neoplasm， gas-producing organism (meningitis， ventriculitis， chronic otitis media and sinusitis)， barotrauma， post invasive procedures (i.e.， lumbar puncture， ventriculostomy， spinal anesthesia)， mask or nasal continuous positive-airwaypressure and can rarely occur spontaneously 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Few case reports of air compressor-induced pneumocephalus are described in literature.\n\n【6】In this article， we present the case of a child with extended pneumocephalus caused by air compressor gun and review the available literature on this topic， with the aim to suggest a management strategy to apply in clinical practice.\n\n【7】Case Presentation\n\n【8】A previously healthy 7-year-old boy was admitted to our emergency department with chemosis of the left eye due to ocular trauma caused by an air compressor gun. The child hit his eye while he was trying to “brush his hair with the air\". On physical examination he was conscious (GCS15/15)， collaborating， afebrile and in good clinical condition. Painful left palpebral extensive oedema， proptosis and periorbital swelling with mild crepitations on palpation characterized his left eye. No neurological deficits or meningeal signs were detectable. Ophthalmological examination described intact ocular motility， visual acuity and pupillary light reflex. An orbital and brain Computed Tomography (CT) revealed air in the left frontal area， Willis polygonus， ponto-cerebellar and quadrigemina cisterns without midline cerebral shift . There were no detectable skull base or facial fractures. The child was admitted in the neurosurgical department for clinical observation. Topical antibiotic eye drops and endovenous antibiotics were started (vancomycin 15mg/kg TID plus ceftazidime 50 mg/kg TID). In addition，pneumococcal vaccine was recommended to complete the vaccination schedule. After 5 days， a brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) revealed resolution of endocrine pneumocephalus and reduction of the air component also in the orbital area and retrobulbar adipose tissue. Endovenous antibiotics were carried on until day 14from admission.\n\n【9】Table 1： Characteristics of reported cases of air compressor-induced pneumocephalus，including our case (NA： Not Available).\n\n| Date[referencel  | Age(Year)  | Associatedfracture  | Radiologicalinvestigation  | Conservative therapy  | Antibiotic prophylaxis  | Length ofhospitalization  | Neurological/ophthalmiccomplication  | Infectiouscomplication  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2006通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>  | 4  | No  | Skull X-ray andCT  | Yes  | Yes (topical and systemic)  | NA  | No  | No  |\n| 2014通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>  | 9  | No  | CT/Orbital MRI  | Yes  | Yes (topical and parental)  | 7 days  | No  | No  |\n| 2002通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>  | 16  | No  | CT  | Yes  | NA  | NA  | No  | No  |\n| 2020通用删除6(英):<u>[11  </u>| 18  | No  | CT  | Yes  | Yes (topical antibiotic)  | 24 hours  | No  | No  |\n| 2007 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>  | 22  | No  | CT  | Yes (Suture of conjunctival laceration)  | Yes (topical and systemic)  | NA  | No  | No  |\n| 1999通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>  | 47  | No  | CT  | Yes firrigation and debridement of conjunctival wound)  | Yes (topical and oral)  | NA  | No  | No  |\n| 2016通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>  | 62  | No  | CT  | Yes (closure on the evelid Lacerations and canalicular repair)  | Yes  | 4 days  | Yes (Optic nerveinjury)  | No  |\n| 2020 (Current case)  | 7  | No  | CT  | Yes  | Yes (topical and parental)  | 15 days  | No  | No  |\n\n【11】Discussion\n\n【12】Pneumocephalus (PN) is defined as the presence of air in the epidural， subdural， or subarachnoid space， within the brain parenchyma or ventricular cavities. It can be congenital， traumatic(the most common cause)， infectious， neoplastic， iatrogenic or spontaneous. It is classified as simple or， more rarely，tension PN 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>.\n\n【13】The CT is the gold standard investigation in the diagnosis of PN， as it can detect as little as 0.55 mL of air in the brain. MRI may also be useful， but not as sensitive as CT scan 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>.\n\n【14】There are few case reports of unusual facial injuries as a cause for PN， secondary to accidental air compressor injury 通用删除6(英):<u>[2-8]</u>. These data are summarized in Table 1. Interestingly， all the previous case reports included compressor tip injuries to one or both eyes without any documented skull fractures.\n\n【15】Given the lack of bony fractures， we agree that the most likely explanation is air entry to the cranial cavity via dissection beneath the Tenon fascia， around the optic nerve， and through the optic canal into the subarachnoid space， as firstly postulated by Williams and Frankel in通用删除6(英):<u> 19996]</u>.\n\n【16】High-pressure injury to the orbit could be responsible of direct contusion to the orbital contents (as in our case)， traumatic optic atrophy with subsequent poor vision， injection of foreign bodies inside the conjunctiva with risk of infection and inflammation， displacement of the orbital contents with proptosis and fractures通用删除6(英):<u>[2，3]</u>.\n\n【17】In the majority of cases PN is asymptomatic， because intracerebral air is generally well tolerated 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Similarly， to our patient， also in previous studies patients with air compressor-induced PN presented severe pain and swelling of the eyelids and face， without neurological deficits or meningeal signs.\n\n【18】Despite this， on rare occasions PN might result in tension PN， a neurosurgical emergency that might lead to brainstem herniation and death 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>.\n\n【19】Twenty cases of post-traumatic tension PN are reported in literature， mostly associated with severe craniofacial fractures. The imaging appearance of tension PN should be correlated with clinical signs of deterioration or visual symptoms and may require emergent treatment (decompression such as with a burr hole and/or with needle aspiration) 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>.\n\n【20】Seizures can sometimes occur by irritating the cerebral cortex； moreover， the risk of meningitis and brain abscesses deserves to be mentioned.\n\n【21】PN secondary to air compressor injury is a rare event and no guidelines on its management are currently available.\n\n【22】Our case， as well as the other similar ones reported in literature， has been treated conservatively. Conservative management includes bed rest， maintaining a supine position， the use of normobaric oxygenation， the avoidance of Valsalva maneuver (like nose-blowing， coughing， and sneezing)， analgesics， antipyretics and administration of prophylactic antibiotics. The use of hyperbaric oxygenation may be useful in the management of symptomatic persistent PN 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>.\n\n【23】It is important to report that， to date， there is no evidence supporting the prophylactic use of antibiotics in patients with basilar skull fractures， with or without PN 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>.\n\n【24】However， our concern was that， although we know that high pressure in the compressor could affect microorganisms gene expression and protein synthesis and could induce enzyme denaturation 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>， the air entered intracranially through a non-sterilepassage. Gram-positive bacteria are more resistant to删除1换行pressure than Gram-negative bacteria 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>. As we believed that early antibiotic prophylaxis should be started， we decided to use broad-spectrum antibiotics， particularly effective against Gram-positive microorganisms. Almost all previous reported patients received prophylactic antibiotics， but in the majority of cases authors did not specify which molecules and timing they choose. Even if our approach is not supported by specific literature， the significantly extended not sterile intracranial air allowed us to use aggressive antibiotic prophylaxis with centrally active antibiotics. We decided to continue this antibiotic treatment until the complete reabsorption of PN. No adverse reactions to antibiotics have developed as well as any infectious complications. Considering pneumococcus as one of the most common infecting organisms in PN secondary to trauma， we also suggest an anti-pneumococcal vaccine.\n\n【25】To the best of our knowledge， this is the first mini-review of air compressor-induced PN currently available. Despite this injury being rare， some cases have been reported， especially in the pediatric age.1LIN Prognosis is usually good， as in our case. Few simple steps should be followed to conservatively treat PN and prevent its possible complications.\n\n【26】Conclusion\n\n【27】Despite air compressor induced-pneumocephalus is usually a rare event， it could be useful for pediatricians and neurosurgeons to follow a few simple steps for better management.\n\n【28】We suggest conservative management including clinical observation， bed rest， maintaining a supine position and avoidance of Valsalva maneuver. Depending on clinical status， remember to consider normobaric or hyperbaric oxygenation； in the rare case of tension PN， urgent neurosurgery could be considered. We also recommend the use of broad-spectrum antibiotic prophylaxis in addition to anti-pneumococcal and anti-tetanic vaccine， in order to complete vaccination schedule. An infectious disease consultation could be indicated. Finally， not forget to remember to avoid diving and air travelling at the time of the discharge.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

Ackerman described it for the first time in the Otorhinolaryngology field in 1948 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Verrucous carcinoma occurs most frequently in the nasal cavity， esophagus， vulva， vagina， anorectal region， penis， and skin. It is very rare in the urinary tract 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，2]</u>. Very few cases of verrucous carcinoma have been reported in the bladder， mainly related to schistosomiasis infection. Renal verrucous carcinoma was first reported in a horseshoe kidney by Sheaff in 1996 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. To our knowledge， only six cases of verrucous carcinoma of the renal pelvis have been published previously； all of them were treated by radical nephrectomy or even nephroureterectomy通用删除6(英):<u>[1-5]</u>. In contrast， this case presents the first verrucous carcinoma in a renal calyceal diverticulum. Moreover， it was successfully treated by nephron-sparing surgery for the first time.\n\n【2】Case Presentation\n\n【3】A 60-year-old man with a clinical history of renal lithiasis was referred to our consultation of lithiasis due to small calculus located in the left kidney . He was operated on for small calculilocated in the lower calyceal diverticulum of the left kidney via Retrograde Intrarenal Surgery(RIRS) and micro-percutaneous (PNL). During the surgery， the calyceal diverticulum was accessed and multiple small calculi (2 mm to 3 mm) were removed. Methylene blue showed the existence of communication between the renal pelvis and the diverticulum， but direct endoscopic visualization was not possible. During the follow-up， a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan was performed. A well-defined cystic lesion measuring 4.2 cm x 6 cm x 4.6 cm was observed in the posterior valve. The cystic lesion was mainly intrarenal with small eccentric growth. The MRI report described that the lesion could be a complicated calyceal diverticulum， without ruling out the coexistence of urothelioma or squamous tumor. After all， surgical resection of the lesion was decided. Through a subcostal incision， the left kidney was freed from the upper pole to the lower pole. The cystic tumor was identified at the posterior valve of the interpolar region. The lesion was removed without ischemia time. During the surgery， an opening of the diverticulum to the urinary tract was identified. The opening appeared to be a tubular structure communicating with the lesion with abundant cesium material coming out. The urinary tract was successfully closed. The patient had a favorable evolution at the hospital， presenting febrile peaks with negative cultures during the immediate postoperative period. He was discharged on the fifth postoperative day after a full course of antibiotics was completed.\n\n【4】Thepathological study confirmed the existence ofan exo-endophytic，acantholytic，papillomatous neoplasm composed of keratinizing squamous epithelium with mild atypia and expansive growth. The tumor focally invaded the medullary renal parenchyma in the form of small nests with increased cellular atypia and keratinization. The pelvic-calyceal epithelium was completely replaced. The renal parenchyma adjacent to the tumor shows signs of atrophy. The pathological diagnosis was a verrucous carcinoma with a focus on well-differentiated infiltrating squamous cell carcinoma. The margins were free of tumor.\n\nSince the date of surgery， the patient has been followed up with imaging tests. A new Computed Tomography (CT) scan was performed every 3 months for the first 12 months. Then， a CT scan was done every 6 months and finally， an annual CT scan is being performed free of tumor recurrence in|删除段之间换行|Discussion\n\n【6】Verrucous carcinoma is a very rare subtype of squamous cell carcinoma. It is used to designate a specific histological appearance of well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. It also shows extensive keratinization with exophytic or papillomatous extension into the stroma and the absence of significant cellular atypia 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. Verrucous carcinoma occurs most frequently in the nasal cavity，\n\n【7】To our knowledge， only six cases of verrucous carcinoma of the renalpelvis have been previously reported in the literature. In all these six cases， lithiasis may have been the cause of chronic inflammation. The average age at diagnosis has been fifty-five years old. Reviewing the cases reported in the literature about verrucous carcinoma in the renal pelvis previously， a higher prevalence in men than women can be found. None of the patients with verrucous carcinoma presented urinary tract anomalies， apart from the first patient who had horseshoe kidney 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. In addition， in all cases published so far in the literature， the tumor was located in the renal pelvis 通用删除6(英):<u>[1-5]</u> and only one case in pelvis and ureter 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. The present case is the first one删除表格换行where a verrucous carcinoma was detected in a renal diverticulum. Moreover， the present case is the first one to be successfully treated with nephron-sparing surgery. All previously reported cases of verrucous carcinoma were treated by radical nephrectomy or even nephroureterectomy 通用删除6(英):<u>[1-5]</u>.\n\n【8】Table 1： Patients with verrucous carcinoma of the renal.\n\n|  | Age  | Sex  | Anomaly in tract urinary  | Location of lesion  | Treatment received  | Outcome  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Sheaff et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>  | 41  | M  | + (horseshoe kidney)  | Renal pelvis  | Heminephrectomy  | 6 months， NED  |\n| Sellami-Boudawara et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>  | 61  | M  |  | Renal pelvis  | Radical nephrectomy  | 5 years， NED  |\n| Sellami-Boudawara et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>  | 56  | M  | 删除8:<u>一 </u> | Renal pelvis  | Nephroureterectomy  | Died  |\n| Kansal et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>  | 64  | F  |  | Renal pelvis  | Radical nephrectomy  | 2 years， NED  |\n| Basekioglu et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>  | 56  | M  | 删除8:<u>一 </u> | Renal pelvis  | Radical nephrectomy+RT+CT  | 3 years， Died  |\n| Hung WH et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>  | 53  | M  |  | Renal pelvis and ureter  | Nephroureterectomy +RT  | 3 months， NED  |\n| Present case  | 60  | M  |  | Calyceal diverticulum  | Partial nephrectomy  | 5 years， NED  |\n\n【10】Partial nephrectomy surgery was revealed to be as effective as radical nephrectomy in patients with verrucous carcinoma without poor prognostic data (such as usual epidermoid carcinoma， poorly differentiated tumor， and affected surgical margins). In the cases of the previous studies where the patient died， positive surgical margins or poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma were present. These two features were related to the aggressiveness of the tumor. In spite of a radical nephrectomy being performed， both patients died of metastatic disease in the next few days after surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，2]</u>. None of the remaining cases presented any evidence of poor tumor prognosis， and a simple nephrectomy was performed successfully 通用删除6(英):<u>[3，4]</u>. The present study is included in this second group， where characteristics of poor tumor prognosis were notpresent. It shows that a partial nephrectomy can be performed rather than a radical nephrectomy if there is no evidence of verrucous carcinoma aggressiveness characteristics.\n\n【11】In summary， the present case is the first report of verrucous carcinoma located in a calyceal diverticulum. It is also the first report of nephron-sparing surgery performed on a patient with verrucous删除1换行carcinoma with no poor prognostic factors. The patient has been free of disease for 5 years. However，there is not enough evidence to affirm that a nephron-sparing surgery treatment can be done in patients with verrucous carcinoma and the absence of poor prognosis factors instead of radical nephrectomy. More experience is needed to affirm that.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

Clinical examination revealed the presence of a pulsating mass at the level of the middle third of the arm. Left radial and ulnar pulses were present.\n\n【16】Thepatient was a former smoker withhypertension and COPD. He also had a history of end-stage renal disease due to Post-Streptococcal Glomerulonephritis， for which he started hemodialysis by a left radio-cephalic Arteriovenous Fistula (AVF) 20 years previously. He subsequently underwent a successful renal transplant and surgical AVF's closure 11 years previously and had been administered immunosuppressive and steroid therapy to prevent renal rejection.\n\n【17】Duplex ultrasound showed a fusiform aneurysmal dilatation of the left brachial artery with turbulent flow. A Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) was then performed and documented a left brachial artery aneurysm of approximately 36 mm in maximum diameter with thrombotic apposition at the level of the middle third of the arm .\n\n【18】Considering clinical presentation and size of the aneurysm， decision was made to perform a surgical exclusion. Through an“S-shaped”incision at the level of the left antecubital fossa extended to the middle third of the arm， the median nerve was recognized and mobilized anteriorly， and the brachial artery was isolated proximally and distally to the aneurysm . The aneurysm was resected， and the brachial artery was reconstructed with a collagen-coated polyester graft interposition (Intergard Synergy Knitted Ultrathin 8mm，Maquet). An end-to-end anastomosis was performed proximaly and distally with a 5/0 polypropylene continuous suture(Prolene， Ethicon). At the end of the procedure radial and ulnar pulses were present. No neurological deficits were reported.\n\n【19】The postoperative course was uneventful， and the patient was discharged home on postoperative day 4， on single antiplatelet therapy.\n\n【20】A 1-month follow-up duplex ultrasound showed patency of the graft and normal perfusion of the radial and ulnar arteries.\n\n【21】At the 6-months follow-up visit the patient continued to be in good clinical conditions， with normal perfusion of the left upper limb and no neurological symptoms or pain.\n\n【22】Discussion\n\n【23】Brachial artery aneurysms represent a rare disease， with a prevalence of 0.5%通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>. They are usually false aneurysm secondary to traumatic， infectious or iatrogenic causes. True BAA have an even more rare presentation and many of the patients with these lesions have a history of intravenous drugs abuse or frequent arterial catheterizations. Other causes associated with BAA occurrence are atherosclerosis， vasculitis， and connective tissue disorders， such as Behcet disease， Takayasu disease， Kawasaki syndrome， Ehlers-Danlos syndrome， Buerger disease， Kaposi sarcoma or cystic adventitial disease.\n\n【24】Regarding our patient， he had no history of trauma， connective tissue disorders， iatrogenic punctures or drugs abuse.\n\n【25】However， one ofthe other causes that can be associated with true BAA is a history of AVF creation 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>.\n\nIn fact， it is described in literature how an AVF creation can increase blood flow in proximal brachial artery and lead to its expansion 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>. In addition to this， some collateral factors， like steroids and immunosuppressants’ use after renal transplantation， might contribute to the formation and enlargement of arterial aneurysms 11|.\n\n【27】The presentation of BAA is similar to that of other peripheral arteries aneurysms. They can present as an asymptomatic pulsating mass or can cause pain or paresthesia's from nerve compression. Less commonly， patients can report symptoms of distal ischemia due to thrombosis or distal embolization.\n\n【28】A proper diagnosis should be made with physical examination and duplex ultrasound， which allows to determine the size ofthe mass and the perfusion of the downstream area. CTA may be performed for operative planning.\n\nBecause of its low incidence， the management of a brachial artery aneurysm is not well defined， with conventional surgical repair being the main treatment option， although in some cases the endovascular approach may be considered. The interposition of an autologous venous graft is preferred， with the Great Saphenous Vein (GSV) used in most cases 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>. The ipsilateral cephalic or basilic vein is also used in order to preserve the veins of the lower limbs for possible future|删除段之间换行|3D reconstruction (B).\n\n【30】In our case report， prior to the intervention， a vein mapping was performed to the patient： Ipsilateral cephalic vein was not feasible due to the previous AVF，and great saphenous vein was incompetent and ectasia bilaterally. Therefore， a prosthetic graft was considered.\n\n【31】A goodd outcome wwaass achieved using a collagen-coated polyester graft， as demonstrated by a duplex ultrasound following the intervention that showed the patency of the graft and the good perfusion of the distal arteries. A long-term follow up is necessary to better evaluate the results.\n\n【32】Relationships between AVF creation with immunosuppressive and steroids therapy after renaltransplantation and the occurrence of true BAA are not yet well defined. More dedicated studies are needed for better understand causes， evolutions and correct management of aneurysms of the brachial artery.\n\n【33】Conclusion\n\n【34】True aneurysms of the brachial artery are an extremely rare disease， duetoa variety of causes.

Aging in the population certainly affects various aspects of life， such as social， economic， and health. Aging also causes the function of the body’s organs to decrease due to natural factors or due to disease. When a person reaches old age， and the children have formed their own family， the responsibility to them is relinquished. She/he returned to being as accessible and independent as she/he had been in the early days ofher/his marriage. The obligation to care for， finance，educate and supervise children is no longer carried out. But by the time freedom was obtained， she/he was already in a state of physical， biological， and psychological decline， and had lost her/his children from home.\n\n【2】Today's society has entered the era of modernization which naturally changes people's mindsets and attitudes. As a result of this change in mindset， many individuals have grown up with an individualistic perspective. Of course， this has a negative impact because it causes humans to feel content with themselves and do not need other people in their lives， even though humans were created as social beings who must actually interact with one another. But in this era， many people tend to compete to achieve their personal goals. When the younger generation brings perspectives， subconsciously they will focus more on themselves than their families. So that many older generations are getting less and less attention from their children and grandchildren. Families who删除1换行are unable to care for them end up placing their seniors in a nursing home. Of course， this makes seniors feel left out when they have to be placed in a place with makeshift buildings and facilities. Sometimes， makeshift buildings and facilities make seniors feel uncomfortable and uncomfortable. However， often because there is no choice， the elderly feels compelled and unhappy， which can then cause health problems.\n\n【3】Based on statistical data for 2021， Taiwan has at least 3.8 million people aged over 65 years， and this number continues to increase every year. Some people perceive the existence of the elderly negatively and incorrectly. They consider the elderly as a burden to the family and the surrounding community. This may be caused by several cases that discuss cases of elderly people whose lives are very dependent on other people. Because of the dependency and helplessness of the elderly， it is concluded as a burden and a reason for certain families to send them to a nursing home， even being abandoned.\n\n【4】Chi Lau Lin Aged Care Co. Ltd.， instead of calling itself a nursing home， Chi Lau Lin prefers to be called aged care located in central Taiwan. In contrast to the nursing home， Chi Lau Lin is a facility for parents whose families are still able to care for the elderly at home. Chi Lu Lin provides classes， activities， events， and delicious food for the elderly to enrich their knowledge and not stop learning.\n\n【5】In addition， Chi Lau Lin also prioritizes safety and environmental design in their facilities. That way， families can entrust their parents to Chi Lau Lin when they are at work or not at home. Of course， on certain sides， there are unavoidable places that might threaten the safety of the elderly. That place is the emergency staircase on one side of Chi Lau Lin. This will be discussed further in the next section.\n\n【6】Literature Review Quality Improvement and Patient Safety (QIPS)\n\n【7】The theory of improving quality and patient safety， in general， is to encourage the implementation of service activities to patients that meet service standards， and safety and provide satisfaction to patients. In particular， to ensure that services are provided in accordance with medical and nursing service standards， as well as that services are provided in accordance with standard service standards， and patient safety and are carried out in an integrated manner according to patient needs. As well as seeking to improve service quality， patient safety and performance through increasing the ability to provide health services to develop a better monitoring system in service quality indicators.\n\n【8】Patient safety is an important element to improve the quality of health services， especially in hospitals as a form of implementation and reflection of the results of the competence of health workers， the availability of service facilities and infrastructure as well as management and administration systems in the service cycle for patients 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. To ensure patient safety，healthcare organizations must be able to build systems that make the patient care process safer， both for patients， health workers， and the surrounding community(family， visitors)， as well as hospital management. The patient safety system is intended to reduce risk， prevent the occurrence of injuries due to the patient care process， and prevent the recurrence of patient safety incidents by creating a patient safety culture.\n\n【9】Patient safety should be a culture in health services in health facilities. However， several cases still show that patient safety has not become a culture in their work environment. This can be seen in cases of malpractice， discrimination or other cases. Every health删除1换行profession should have a code of ethics which must be an aspect of implementing patient safety culture in their work environment. By adopting a good patient safety culture， you can minimize incidents related to patient safety. Harvard School of Public Health (HSPH) research 通用删除7(英):<u>(2011)</u> states that of the 421 million patients treated annually worldwide， 43 million people are harmed annually due to treatment with side effects 通用删除6(英):<u>[21</u>.\n\n【10】Currently， the issue of patient safety is one of the main issies in health services. Patient safety has become something far more important than just service efficiency. Various risks due to medical action can occur as part of service to patients. It turns out that the quality of service alone is not enough.\n\n【11】Health care facilities should always maintain the security of the service process for patients so that medical errors do not occur which affect the quality and service of these health care facilities. Patient safety is an effort to ensure that actions and activities in health care facilities carried out by health workers for patients are safe and do not cause adverse effects or impacts on patients that have been regulated in regulations. Patient safety is an important point in every medical action， both minor and serious medical actions. Based on research by Maghfiroh & Rochmah 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>， patient safety has a major influence on the image， social responsibility， morals， and performance of health workers so patient safety is related to quality issues and the image of a health service， including nursing home or even aged care facility\n\n【12】The aspects of implementing successful patient safety are as follows：删除1换行a. External environment\n\nHughes stated that the external environment is something that is needed for agencies to have a high commitment to implementing the quality of patient safety. Strengths that are biased and can make changes to the orientation ofthe agency， one ofwhich is the motivation that comes from the external environment. External pressure in health agencies can come from the provisions in implementing the quality of patient safety， and competition in providing services， then ones awareness and lawsuits will increase 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>.删除1换行b.Leadership|删除段之间换行|Hughes gives the opinion that a nurse who can play a role in changing leadership to implement patient safety will have an effect on changing the organizational structure which is expected to be more effective in implementing safety. Leaders are required to be able to understand that external pressure is an opportunity to make changes for the better. In institutional leadership without strong encouragement， patient safety will only become a motto 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. Leaders can bring success or failure of quality management in the health care facilities they lead. Leadership must be one of the abilities that must be possessed by leaders to lead their organizations to continue to progress better and have positive improvements. It is important for leaders to develop their skills and demonstrate their commitment to quality and build the organization with their board， as well as set a clear direction for the organization. Leaders must also change their organization's value systems and ultimately organizational culture， policies， and structures to meet the needs of their employees and customers5|.\n\n【14】c. Organizational culture\n\nPatient safety culture is the foundation of patient safety. Keywords删除1换行in improving quality and patient safety provide a change in patient culture from a blame culture to a safety culture. One of the strategies to develop a safety culture is to involve employees in planning and developing a safety culture.删除1换行d. Management practice|删除段之间换行|Lower， middle， and upper-level managers have the responsibility to implement policies and procedures that have been made and agreed upon together. Managers support for the implementation of patient safety is a good thing and supports the success of the quality assurance program 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>.\n\n【16】Person-Environment-Occupation (PEO) model\n\n【17】删除3:<u>The Person， Environment， Occupation Model， is also known as PEO Model. The PEO Model was created by Mary Law et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u> in1996. It is a transactional Model since it depicts the interrelationship between the Person， The Environment， and The Occupation. The PEO Model has 3 key concepts， Person， Environment， and Occupation. Their interaction results in Occupational Performance. The person is unique and has specific skills， experience， knowledge， interest， and roles. The person who is continuously developing is intrinsically motivated. The environment can be socioeconomic， cultural， institutional， social， and physical. Occupations are divided into three main categories： Self-care， productivity， and leisure. We participate in daily occupations for self-maintenance， expression， and life satisfaction 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>. As Occupational Therapists we a the characteristics， duration， structure， and complexity of each occupation 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>. According to the PEO Model， function results from a good fit between the three key concepts. Law et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u> suggested that PEO should be interdependent upon one another， and created optimal performances for the individual in whichever contact they are performing their occupation.</u>\n\n【18】The PEO Model was developed to provide a framework for delivering services that focuses on a client-centered approach. Previous research notedthatthePEO model can beused to understand and develop person-centered interventions for people with dementia通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>. PEO factors reflect participation ability among residents and dementia. When the environment and occupation are adjusted to the skills of the person，participation is assumed to be successful.\n\n【19】In a previous study， Green and Cooper 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u> indicated that thelevel function of residents was greatly influenced by the number and type of activities offered. Green and Cooper 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u> succeeded in recognizing how PEO interactions play an essential role in the engagement of meaningful activities. The PEO Model can accommodate the limitations of residents， and staff， and be more flexible and creative when designing individual activities.\n\n【20】Method\n\n【21】This study uses the theory of Quality Improvement and Patient Safety (QIPS) education 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u> which has a vital role in developing healthcare professionals with the knowledge， abilities， and attitudes to improve healthcare systems. In addition， by using the PEO Model， this study aims to explore and observe the situation in Chi Lau Lin using the three elements of people， environment， and occupation models to promote a better healthcare system that can be applied in its management system.\n\n【22】Case Study： Chi Lau Lin\n\n【23】the third age group and the implementation of local aging， hoping that all people can have a dynamic， independent， and dignified old age.\n\nWith one-stop overall service (the concept of three stages and five levels of publichealth)， Chi Lau Lin plans five major career directions， including colleges， associations， clubs， long-term care services， and|删除段之间换行|restaurants， also links all stages of services to provide services for the third age group. People of all ethnic groups (or planning to prepare for the third age group)， whether they are healthy， sub-healthy， demented， or disabled， can regain their enthusiasm for life and save their lives. Implement the vision of developing a corporate model of people-oriented， love-based， and practice a happy life and holistic care. Below are features that promoting by Chi Lau Lin：\n\n【25】Diverse courses\n\n【26】Because knowledge is constantly updated and infinitely changing， if we don't have a new understanding of ourselves and the space to surpass our own limitations， it will be difficult for us to have the ability and ability to regenerate learning. The most important thing in self-transcendence is to establish a good habit of lifelong learning.\n\n【27】The intervention of multiple courses can effectively encourage the elderly to participate in society and provide learning motivation. It is also helpful for the development of the elderly with dementia， and it删除1换行can also reduce the care pressure of the main caregiver.\n\n【28】One-stop integrated care\n\n【29】Through one-stop integratedcare services andsystematic resource links in the elderly industry， the difficulties and burdens faced by cases and their families can be solved.\n\n【30】Faculty lineup\n\n【31】Teachers in professional fields can provide continuous and effective guidance and services in dementia care， which can not only enhance the sense of achievement of seniors participating in the courses but also stabilize the emotions of the patients.\n\n【32】Chi Lau Lin creates a \"dementia\" home care service model and uses the professional training of program training in care practice， according to the care needs of individual cases and their individuality， the characteristic content of dementia care is summarized one by one from the visit process， including physical assessment， needs assessment. Assessment， case spiritual care， primary caregiver(including family members)care support， cognitive training， rehabilitation training， life story， and life course exploration， risk factor assessment， home environment risk， multi-drug assessment， and other interventional care.\n\n【33】Conclusion\n\n【34】This study resulted in a better understanding of how to care for the elderly， maintain an aged care environment to support quality and safety for residents， and also a sustainable system for aged care. In the future， it is hoped that other aged care homes or nursing homes can put forward the quality of patient safety and implement a good PEO model in an elderly care environment. Turning threats into opportunities， and changing the environment to be healthier for its inhabitants. That way， health facilities such as aged care and nursing homes will be able to become sustainable businesses.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

It had to allow ablation nail to allow aligning the limb. It had to preserve the bone capital to allow a secondary osteosynthesis. We decided to perform an anteromedial approach with a distal tibial corticotomy flap respecting the tibio-talar joint and an economical corticotomy at its proximal part. This is to extract the nail retrograde way.\n\n【19】With regard to osteosynthesis， we have been able to perform a conventional osteosynthesis by medial distal tibial plate LCP 3.5.\n\n【20】Discussion\n\n【21】The deformation of osteosynthesis material is frequent in cases of nonunion due to a progressive and irreversible embrittlement of the metal. In the vast majority of cases， the diagnosis is made at the time of the rupture of the latter and the extraction of this material is carried out in semi emergency. There are many methods of extraction通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. The authors focus mainly on tactics with proximal anterograde extraction and distal percutaneous or retrograde extraction. In all clinical cases reported， there is no simple deformation but a complete rupture ofthe metallic material 通用删除6(英):<u>[4，7]</u>.\n\n【22】The deformation of material in traumatic cases is much less frequent 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. The extraction of the material is made very complicated by this deformation. Yip et al. reported extraction of two tibial nails删除1换行by standard route 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>. By carefully studying the deformations， one realizes that these were not important and finally allowed a classic extraction of the nail. One case reported by these authors had 13° of删除1换行anterior flexion and 20° of valgus. Our clinical case had a much larger deformity.\n\n【23】The idea of deforming the tibia by an external force to obtain a realignment allowing the conventional extraction of the nail has not been seriously considered. Some authors have tried with total failure7.\n\n【24】Some authors propose a minimal approach on the deformation focus 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>. The goal is to cut the nail with a plier or saw. Thus， one can realign the limb and proceed to the extraction as in the case of a rupture on a nonunion. Some authors believe that the use of a saw is not advisable because of metal chips and the risk of bone burns 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>.\n\n【25】We decided preoperatively to perform a distal corticotomy. We were then able to seize the nail to carry out a retrograde extraction. All the proximal diaphysis was intact. The bonyhood was then rested and fixed by a provisional strapping and a very long bone plate was placed 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>.\n\n【26】In conclusion， the presence of osteosynthesis equipment may expose to complications in case of trauma as illustrated by our clinical case.

Developing countries including Africa are at risks of getting more infected due to less awareness and ill-equipped health facilities. For such countries， accurate prediction of the COVID-19 cases could help the policy makers in decision making and proper utilization of the available resources. Machine Learning (ML) approaches are excellent tools for making predictions especially for an uncertain and stochastic phenomenon such as COVID-19. Therefore， Artificial Neural Network (ANN) as ML tool was employed to predict cumulative COVID-19 cases in Nigeria. In this way， data including daily and cumulative cases as well as daily and cumulative mortality rate were collected from February 2020 till December 2021. Five different models were developed using varied input combinations. Determination Coefficient (DC) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) were employed as performance metrics. The results showed all the developed models produced good prediction skill but M4 with DC=0.9996 and RMSE=0.0017 in the validation step led to better performance. The general results of this study emphasize the importance of using ANN for the prediction of COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria.\n\n【2】Keywords： COVID-19；Machine learning； Pandemic； Nigeria； Africa\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】The total confirmed cases of COVID-19 have reached 396，558，014 as of February 9hh， 2022according to the World Health Organization. The pandemic has become a serious health challenge worldwide. The call for artificial intelligence integration in the fight against the deadly virus was made by the White House in collaboration with tech companies and research institute as well. Personalized preventive measures can significantly help from precise characterization of the population based on classified COVID-19 vulnerability. The initial examination that elderly populace has an elevated risk to coronavirus disease 2019 is challenged by a different study that more and more youthful adults experienced chronic COVID-19 signs， showing an emergency need of abroad risk assessment based on physiological features and personalized genetic.\n\n【5】Machine Learning (ML) algorithms have the capacity to integrate and analyze huge-scale data of coronavirus disease 2019 patients， which can help in understanding the viral spread pattern， develop new efficient therapeutics strategies， further improve testing/diagnostic accuracy and speed and potentially explore the most susceptible persons based on personalized genetic as well as physiological features 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Interestingly， within a limited time period since the pandemic started， ML methods have been utilized in taxonomic categorization of coronavirus disease 2019 genomes， survival projection of chronic COVID-19 patients 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. Namasudra et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u> employed Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict COVID-19 cases. Nabi et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u> employed ANN and other ML tools for the prediction of COVID-19 diseases outbreak. De Araijo Morais and da Silva Gomes 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u> applied ANN and other prediction model for the forecasting of daily COVID-19 cases in the world.\n\n【6】Despite been amongst the highest recorded number of cases and death in Africa， studies of COVID-19 cases in Nigeria are very limited. Therefore， owing to its robustness in dealing with the uncertain aspect of COVID-19， Artificial Neural Network (ANN) was employed to predict cumulative COVID-19 cases in Nigeria using several input combinations.\n\n【7】Materials and Methods\n\n【8】Study country\n\n【9】Nigeria is a tropical zone region located in west Africa with 923，770km’ oftotal area. A distance删除1换行of 1，050 km separated southern Nigeria from northern Nigeria while1，150 km is the west to east optimum distance. Benin， Cameroon， Niger and Chad are some of the African countries that share border with Nigeria 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. Figure 1 shows the study country.\n\n【10】The data used in this study were obtained and can be downloaded from https：//github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data/.Table 1 shows statistical description of the data.\n\n【11】It can be seen from Table 1 that the COVID-19 cases in Nigeria within the selected period were up to a maximum 6，158 in a single day and cumulatively， the cases were up to 241，513 (as of February 28h，2020 to December 315，2021). A maximum of 93 daily death can also be seen while cumulative death stands at 3，030.\n\n【12】Data normalization and performance criteria\n\n【13】To ensure all variables have the same treatment and to eliminate their dimensional discrepancy， data Normalization is usually applied for AI-based modeling 通用删除6(英):<u>[7，8]</u>. Therefore， the data were normalized to fall between 0 and 1 as：\n\n【14】Where D，D，D. and D are the normalized data， ith data value， minimum and maximum data values， respectively.\n\n【15】To determine the performance of the developed models， Determination Coefficient (DC) and Root Mean Square Error(RMSE) were employed 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>， given by：\n\n【16】Where CC is cumulative case of the ith value， N， cc， and CC are the number of observations， predicted values and mean of the observed values， respectively. The DC ranges between - o to 1 and RMSE between 0 to o with DC towards 1 and RMSE close to 0 imply high efficiency.\n\n【17】Artificial neural network (ANN)\n\n【18】ANN provides a determined approach in dealing with non-linear， noisy， and dynamic data， more specifically when the physical删除1换行fundamental relationships are not completely known. Detail information regarding ANN can be found in study 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>.\n\n【19】Results and Discussion\n\n【20】In this study， the potential of ANN in predicting cumulative COVID-19 cases in Nigeria was investigated. For machine learning applications， selection of the most appropriate inputs are significant in determining the most efficient prediction performance， as incorrect inputs may results in error and performance deficiency. Recent studies including Ibrahim et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u> show that using COVID-19 cases at previous time step may lead to accurate prediction. However， the daily COVID-19 cases as well as the daily and cumulative death could have a significant impact on cumulative cases. Therefore， in this study，5 different models were developed using different input combination to determine the highest performance. Table 2 shows the developed models and their training and validation percentages.\n\n【21】For the ANN model in both stations， FFBP was used for the model training using Levenberg Marquardt (LM) algorithm. Single hidden layer was used and via trial and error， the best number of hidden laver neurons was selected. Table 3 shows the results of the developed models. The structure x-y-z implies number of inputs， hidden layer neurons and output layer， respectively.\n\n【22】As shown in Table 3， different inputs combination led to different performance. These results show that using COVID-19 cumulative cases at previous time and other data could be employed sufficiently for COVID-19 case prediction. In the training phase， it can be seen that M2 (CCCCCCCC )，M4 (New case， new death， CCp CC2) and M5 (New case， new death，CCr.3p CC a) provided the best prediction performance in terms of DC with 0.9999 value. However， with respect to RMSE，M4 (New case， new death， CC CC) produced better skill than all other models with 0.0004 value. Therefore，this demonstrated the rationality of combining daily cases and death with previous cumulative cases to enhance prediction performance.\n\n【23】In the validation phase in Table 3， it can be seen that despite the nonlinear aspect of ANN and its ability to deal with uncertain stochastic phenomena， the performance of ANN decreases in the validation phase. Similar to the training phase， M4 in the validation phase led to best performance with lowest error RMSE=0.0017 and highest goodness of fit DC=0.9996. Comparing the results of this study with that of Ibrahim et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u> it can be seen that despite having删除表格换行same study location (Nigeria)，performance of the ANN model in this study is superior. Many issues could lead to the discrepancy in the results. (i) The duration of the data could play a major role in the performance as this study covered entire period from the day of first cases in Nigeria 通用删除7(英):<u>(28-02-2020)</u> to where decline in number of cases started. This implies that the study covered both the peak and least periods of the pandemic which might results in proper simulation of the uncertainty surrounding the system. (ii) The study by Ibrahim et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u> employed only the previous time step for their prediction while this study shows that addition of the cases and death input data could enhance prediction of the pandemic. Figure 2 shows the graphical comparison of the developed models.\n\n【24】Table 1： Statistical description of the used data.\n\n| Data  | Period  | Minimum  | Maximum  | St. deviation  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| New case  | 28-02-2020-31-12-2021  | 0  | 6158  | 460.17  |\n| Cumulative case  | 28-02-2020-31-12-2021  | 1  | 241513  | 75734.58  |\n| New death  | 28-02-2020-31-12-2021  | 0  | 93  | 6.97  |\n| Cumulative death  | 28-02-2020-31-12-2021  | 0  | 3030  | 914.75  |\n\n【26】Table 2： Models development with their training and validation subsamples.\n\n| Model  | Inputs  | Training subsample  | Validation subsample  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| M1  | CCi-1gCCn-2pCCrapCC删除8:<u>似 </u> | 75%通用删除7(英):<u>(471)</u>  | 25%通用删除7(英):<u>(202)</u>  |\n| M2  | CC-spCC1-5pCCf6FCC471  | 75%通用删除7(英):<u>(471)</u>  | 25%通用删除7(英):<u>(202)</u>  |\n| M3  | New case， new death， cum. death  | 75%通用删除7(英):<u>(471)</u>  | 25%通用删除7(英):<u>(202)</u>  |\n| M4  | New case， new death， CCerjCCnt2)  | 75%通用删除7(英):<u>(471)</u>  | 25%通用删除7(英):<u>(202)</u>  |\n| M5  | New case， new death，CCfneaja CCvc)  | 75%通用删除7(英):<u>(471)</u>  | 25%通用删除7(英):<u>(202)</u>  |\n\n| Table 3： Results of the developed models.  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Model  | Structure  | DC  | RMSE  | DC  | RMSE  |\n| M1  | 4-10-1  | 0.9978  | 0.004  | 0.9637  | 0.0473  |\n| M2  | 4-7-1  | 0.9999  | 0.0014  | 0.9993  | 0.0023  |\n| M3  | 3-8-1  | 0.9998  | 0.0035  | 0.9836  | 0.0109  |\n| M4  | 4-11-1  | 0.9999  | 0.0004  | 0.9996  | 0.0017  |\n| M5  | 4-9-1  | 0.9999  | 0.0011  | 0.9991  | 0.0026  |\n\n【29】The radar chart shown in Figure 2 compares the performance of the 5 developed models based on DC and RMSE. From the chart， as goodness of fit measure， the more open and wider the chart is， the better performance based on DC. While narrower chart signifies the most efficient performance with respect to RMSE. It can be seen from Figure 2 that all models led to performance close to 1. Similarly， the models performed excellent with a relatively small error for RMSE. This is an indication that once ANN model is well developed， the performance indicators irrespective of whether graphical or tabular approach is used the results would be accurate. Figure 3 compares the performances ofthe developed models against the observed data.\n\n【30】For violin plots shown in Figure 3， the internal line represents the range of the values while the white central dot signifies mean of the data values. The more similarity and resemblance a model have with the observed data， the more efficient COVID-19 prediction， thus， as seen in Figure 3， all the models have a close resemblance with the observed data， which indicates the accurate performance by all models.\n\n【31】Conclusion\n\n【32】In this study， Machine Learning (ML) approach was employed to predict cumulative COVID-19 cases in Nigeria. For this purpose， cumulative data at previous time step (up to 7-day period) as well as daily cases， daily death and cumulative death were used as inputs for 5different models based on Artificial Neural Network (ANN).\n\n【33】The results showed that with unique inputs of the applied models， different results were achieved. The obtained results demonstrated that M4 (New case， new death， CCCC) provided the most efficient performance in terms of DC and RMSE. This emphasizes the need of combining both cases at previous step and other COVID-19data for successful prediction of cumulative cases in Nigeria. The results indicated that provided an efficient input selection approach and sufficient quality data are achieved， a successful prediction of COVID-19 cases in Nigeria could be achieved using ANN.

(Velpanat composed of velpatasvir 100 mg plus sofosbuvir 400 mg) The patient’s virological response was achieved at week 7， but his peripheral eosinophils rose from normalbaseline to 2.79×10/L . Since the patient was asymptomatic， the dual therapy was continued. On September 24，2017 (about at week 8)， the man was hospitalized due to sudden severe right upper abdominal pain， abdominal distention and a fever of 38.9℃.

In this case， acute duodenal perforation stopped endoscopists from conducting endoscopy. However， abdominal pain， thickened gastric and duodenal walls in CT images with peripheral eosinophilia and no evidence of parasitic or extra intestinal disease met all of the three criteria established by Talley et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u> in addition， fast healing and no history and symptoms of peptic ulcer excluded the perforation secondary to peptic ulcer or cancer. Concordantly， a case with EGE presenting with gastric perforation has been reported.\n\n【7】EGE is speculated to be induced by some allergens in the diet or air. In this case， daclatasvir or sofosbuvir was highly suspected since peripheral eosinophilia occurred at week 2 during their exposure and disappeared within five days after their with drawl without corticoid or anti allergic therapy. Although EGE induced by DAAs has not been reported in the literature so far， drug-induced EGE correlated with minocycline and celecoxib has been reported. Compared with daclatasvir， sofosbuvir with much better safety profile constituted the“backbone” of most combination treatments 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. Thus， EGE in this case was perhaps related to daclatasvir. It is well known that additional cautions are needed in dealing with special patient populations {e.g. with end-stage renal disease or decompensated cirrhosis) 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>.

{"seq_id": "04d79bcf-eccf-41b4-a683-e4abbf1c8f98", "title": null, "text": "【0】Abstract\n\n【1】Telemedicine can provide adequate medical assistance for physically distant patients utilizing the joint adoption of Information and Communication Technologies. Telemedicine is the set of techniques and tools for health monitoring and cares implemented through systems providing rapid access to both specialists and patients， regardless of where they are located respectively. We live in the age of communication， and we have long had the problem of how to improve health in health systems. Telemedicine seems to be a viable alternative in order to eliminate the gap between human and economic resources. Due to its characteristics， it can contribute to improving access to specialized healthcare and the quality of life of people， especially in populations lacking qualified personnel， in remote or difficult access areas or patients with chronic diseases， by reducing long waiting lists and high costs for the health systems. While the telemedicine projects between different countries are developing more and more， the inherent ethical and legal problems are emerging at the same time. This article refers to telemedicine as a broad concept， including several types of distance medicine， thus identifying its strengths and weaknesses that will be the primary purpose of the medical-legal aspects. We will also describe its application in the ophthalmological field and the main issues raised by its implementation.\n\n【2】Keywords： Telemedicine； Ophthalmology； Medical Ethics； E-Health； Telecare\n\n【3】Telemedicine\n\n【4】Telemedicine is， according to the Commission of the European Communities， the provision of welfare services by using Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) in situations where the health professional and the patient (or two professionals) are not in the same location. It involves the reliable transmission of medical information and data thanks to texts， sounds， and images necessary for the prevention， diagnosis， treatment， and subsequent monitoring of patients通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Telemedicine has numerous benefits for doctors， medical institutions， and patients 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. In this way， it plays a pivotal role in the development of medicine and the provision of health care in the world. Telemedicine allows remote group collaboration between health professionals in different places， even from different countries. It is useful for real-time interaction among the participants without a time interval between interventions. Professionals in distant positions can communicate， thus improving the quality of health services. The continuous flow of communication among health professionals is necessary due to the increasing complexity of medicine that prompts the doctors to consult with colleagues or experts in a particular issue or to need a second opinion. All thesebehaviors are considered good medical practice (considering that they will not delay an urgent procedure nor constitute a defensive medicine)， and the absence of such contacts may be considered as lack of interest and attention by the doctor. On the otherhand， today patients， who are aware of their rights and attentive to the risk of medical errors， also seek a second opinion， sometimes from doctors who have never really met， by using the telephone， the mail or even a website. In the perspective ofhealth institutions， telemedicine opens up the possibility of expanding the spectrum of available medical services， thus increasing the chances of earning and saving. Furthermore， it can be quite convenient for the patients themselves. Telemedicine facilitates direct patient access to a distant doctor， without requiring the movement of any of the participants and allowing access to some forms of medical care that would otherwise not be available. Telemedicine can be an important tool in cases where geographical distance hinders access to health care， in particular， specialized healthcare， such as in many rural areas or in developing countries with the lack of health infrastructures 通用删除6(英):<u>[3-6]</u>. Medical treatment in these scenarios would require long journeys， not always possible and usually rather删除1换行expensive， time-consuming and exhausting both for doctors and patients. Therefore，patients in this situation do not access to adequate health care. Telemedicine can also be a potentially very useful tool in preventive medicine， providing patients with useful information on their health conditions. It can be used for the monitoring of chronic conditions such as diabetic retinopathy， glaucoma， age-related macular degeneration， etc. that are growing public health problems due to the increasing life expectancy and elderly population. These diseases are also increasing in the young population. By means of telemedicine， we do not need to visit the patient in the hospital setting， but we use a telemonitoring 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u> thus avoiding long waiting lists. Moreover， it is convenient to reduce hospitalization and health care costs. Telemedicine also has enormous potential as regards the electronic prescription in order to avoid errors， such as mistakes in the tax code， the patient's age or the dosage， consequently to incomprehensible calligraphy of the doctor 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>. The improvement of healthcare is the advantage of telemedicine. This goal materializes by means of the patient health education， the technical education of health workers by using the new e-learning technologies， and the ease of accessing a second opinion from a specialist， particularly important for people in rural areas or those who suffer from rare diseases. Notwithstanding all these advantages， telemedicine is not present in Europe. The difficulties of application are the huge costs of a telemedicine service， the difficult interoperability of technical infrastructures across countries， the privacy of health data， the lack of specific ethical standards and regulations for telemedicine， the doubts for healthcare professionals about their responsibility， and the uncertainties of the legal framework all over the world 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>.\n\n【5】Telemedicine and Ophthalm ology\n\n【6】Telemedicinehas multipleapplications in ophthalmology because it needs visual images for the screening， diagnosis， therapy， and monitoring of the diseases. It is not surprising that ophthalmology has been so quickly adapted to changes in the cybernetic world and that it uses the telemedicine technologic system in order to access to advanced healthcare. Its practical use has shown clinical， economic， and public health benefits 通用删除6(英):<u>[10，11]</u>. For example， its use in two important pathologies， such as Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) and Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP)， shows how telemedicine can improve access to high-quality health care in these and other ophthalmological diseases. Although effective treatments for high-risk DR exist for over four decades， DR remains a major cause of blindness among adults of working age. The telemonitoring of DR is now one of the helpful specific applications of the telemedicine.\n\n【7】On the other hand， the inability of half of the population to timely access the exams has contributed to the increase of diabetes. The telemedicine programs provide access to the annual screening of DR patients through patient imaging in a setting of primary assistance. These programs have improved clinical outcomes 通用删除6(英):<u>[12，13]</u>.\n\n【8】Consequently， the spreading of the ophthalmological programs into the medical system would probably result in a suitable timing in eye care in the proportion of patients who did not access to retinal screening or eye tests with the appropriate frequency 通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u>. Image-based diagnosis and telemedicine have proven to be reliable， accurate， and cost-effective for ROP and improve access to eye care for premature babies at high risk for ROP 通用删除6(英):<u>[15，16]</u>. The diagnosis and treatment ofROP are essential for successful results. There are doctors experienced in indirect ophthalmoscopy and trained in screening for ROP that can provide care for low birth weight infants. Telemedicine删除1换行offers an interesting alternative， especially in the most remote areas.\n\n【9】Furthermore， imaging could improve the documentation of the retinal fundus. In this sense， telemedicine can successfully improve and extend ophthalmologic care using imaging technology. Other areas of telemedicine in ophthalmology are intraocular pressure monitoring， optic nerve analysis， macular disease monitoring， visual field analysis， and anterior segment diagnosis. Furthermore， the ability to perform remote consultations and examinations， instead of face-to-face， is gaining ground thanks to improved two-way communication technologies in emerging clinical institutions 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>.\n\n【10】The Legal Framework of Telemedicine\n\n【11】As a health service， telemedicine is included in the scope of articles 56 and 57 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU)； therefore， it is a service， and it is subject to the general freedom concerning the free movement of services. Nonetheless， this is not the only set of rules applicable to telemedicine within the European legal system. In fact， within the framework of European law， telemedicine is both a health service and an information service(a service normally provided for a fee， at a distance and electronically at individual request). Therefore， both regulations are applicable：those relating to health care and those relating to information society services 通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u>.\n\n【12】As far as information and telecommunications are concerned， we must take into consideration the following documents： Directive95/46/EU 通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u>， the Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) 通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u>， Directive 98/34/EC， the Information Society Services Directive通用删除6(英):<u>[21，22]</u>， Directive 2000/31/EC， directive on electronic commerce 通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u>， Directive 2002/58/EC and the directive on privacy and electronic communication 通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u>. About health services， the most relevant result for regulating this sector is Directive 2011/24/EU on the so-called cross-border directive 通用删除6(英):<u>[25]</u>. Furthermore， the European Union (EU) has developed an important series of initiatives over the years in order to increase the use of telemedicine in Europe. These initiatives aim to transform telemedicine into a standard medical service， accessible to all European patients and fully covered bythe respective social security system 通用删除6(英):<u>[26]</u>. The EU's efforts are also quite economically significant， as the EU has invested over E 500 million in research funding on the development of eHealth instruments. However， the undeniable value of telemedicine should not hide its many difficulties， some of which are also present in traditional medicine， but which assume a new complexity within telemedicine. For example， when health workers from different countries and different languages collaborate， there is no consensus on language to use for data recording in the patient's medical record or who is responsible for providing technical training (the so-called e-literacy) to health professionals using new communication technologies. All electronic health records (EHRs) need to integrate into a global eHealth infrastructure that is accessible from every point in the EU. Despite several working documents and position papers issued by the European institutions， we still lack a uniform set of rules to regulate telemedicine in Europe. Most of the regulatory competences in these areas still depend on the Member States， retaining the best skills in health care and medicine. However， the problem is that the approach to telemedicine varies immensely among European countries， including the perspective chosen to regulate telemedicine： some states have approached telemedicine from the point of view of the laws in the field of ICT technologies， while other laws regard the health care domain or even the social security field. Therefore， even at the national level， there are legal删除1换行voids that threaten the practice of telemedicine，leaving unprotected patients and health workers 271.\n\n【13】The General Data Protection Regulation(GDPR)：Privacy in Health\n\n【14】Published in the European Official Journal on 4 May 2016， it entered into force on 24 May 2016， but its implementation took place after two years， therefore starting from 25 May 2018. Regulation2016/679 is European legislation about data protection. Since it is a regulation， it does not need for transposition by the Member States of the Union and will spread in the same way in all the States of the Union without margins of freedom in adaptation. Its purpose is the definitive harmonization of the regulation on the protection of personal data within the EU. With the Lisbon treaty， the protection of personal data has become a fundamental right of citizens， and therefore to be guaranteed in the same way throughout the territory of the union. By increasing citizens trust in the digital society， thanks to the more stringent protection， the regulation is functional to the digital development of the EU and safeguards the free movement of personal data. With the European regulation， we move from a proprietary vision of the datum (not treatable without consent) to a vision of control of the data that favors the free circulation， at the same time strengthening the rights of the interested party. There is a fundamental right of patients to the confidentiality of their information and medical records. Patient privacy should be observed unless it is revoked (i.e.， informed， non-coercive) in rare cases in which it neutralizes the public interest. The information disclosed should be limited to such information or part of the medical record. Telemedicine creates specialproblems due to the involvement ofnon-clinical staff in teleconsultations，and the vulnerability oftransmission lines to security breaches. Legislation and guidelines do not apply to anonymous information stripped of all attributes that can identify the owner. This simple distinction between the two types of information apparently is not so clear in practice. The processing of health data is subject to a specific discipline. It is carried out by healthcare professionals (excluding orthopedists， dental hygienists， nurses， obstetricians， physiotherapists， and speech therapists)， and public health organizations 通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u>. The confidentiality needs to guarantee for citizens in health facilities， and the health data relating to them. Health data are data subject to special treatment， as it can reveal very intimate details ofthe person，and，for this reason，there is a generalprohibition of dissemination， as well as enhanced protection， of such data (Article4 GDPR) 通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u>. Health data is all that personal information suitable to reveal a person's state of health and body and mental conditions. Genetic data and photographs taken for surgical interventions or controls are also health data. Furthermore， as established by the Court of Cassation (Civil Cassation， United Sections， judgment 12.27.2017， number 30981)， sensitive data suitable to reveal the state of health must be treated with organizational methods to protect them， such as encryption thus making the data subject unidentifiable. The European regulation provides that health data can be used only for purposes related to health (treatment purposes)， for the supervision of the National Health System and research in the public interest. These purposes allow the possibility to introduce special conditions or additional limits for treatment. In this sense， the Italian legislator has provided， with the new Privacy Code， further measures to protect health dataset by the national control authority and reviewed every two years. The article 9 (letter h) of the GDPR does not provide the consent of data processing for purposes of preventive medicine or occupational medicine， such as assessment of the employees ability删除1换行to work， diagnosis， assistance， management of health， on the basis of Union or Member State law or in accordance with the health professional contract. However， the rule allows the Member States to maintain or introduce additional conditions， including limitations concerning the processing of genetic data， biometric data， or health data. The Italian legislator， with the decree to update the Privacy Code， has introduced the possibility that the Guarantor imposes specific guarantee measures (additional to the normal security measures) for the treatment of health data 通用删除6(英):<u>[28]</u>. The directive 680of 2016 is similar to the GDPR. Many of the rules contained are similar or equivalent to those of the new European regulation on privacy and personal data. They have a specific scope of application and concern the processing carried out by the competent authorities for prevention， investigation，detection，and prosecution of offenses， execution of criminal penalties， safeguarding and preventing threats to public security. This directive expresses the need to keep the data for the time necessary to achieve the purposes and to review the data to verify the need for storage or deletion after the deadline. About the safety of the treatment， the appointment of the data protection officer is also obligatory for the judicial authority thanks to the assistance that this figure can provide in the management of complex treatments and sensitive data. As regards the violation of the new rules， the text provides for administrative sanctions against violations concerning the methods of processing and introduces penal sanctions for the treatment operated with illegitimate purposes 通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u>.\n\n【15】The Informed Consent\n\n【16】Before proceeding with data collection， it is necessary to provide the information to the patient (if necessary， it is possible to provide orally even if it is preferably written). The document indicates the subject collecting data， the purposes of the treatment， the methods of treatment， the mandatory or optional nature of the provision of data， the subjects or the categories of subjects to whom the data can be communicated， the identification details of the holder， and the methods for exercising the rights to protect your data. The Italian Ophthalmological Society has elaborated， in addition to the Guidelines， the Informed Consent Forms that regulate and define the criteria for the development of the main activities of the ophthalmologist. Informed consent is the tool through which information is disposable for the patient about the intervention and is gathered his consent to proceed. Therefore，it presupposes two distinct moments： information and then the actual consent. The Informed Consent consists of documentation： the specific information sheet of the intervention about the execution procedure， the post-treatment， advantages， disadvantages， risks， and complications. The Act of Consent remains the same for all the information sheets and does not need any specificity linked to the treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>[29]</u>. The article 1， in compliance with the principles， set out in articles 2， 13 and 32 of the Law 219/2017 of the Constitution， states that no medical treatment starts or continues without the free and informed consent of the interested person， except in cases expressly provided by law 通用删除6(英):<u>[30]</u>. However， the possibility of carrying out the treatment according to the public interest remains (for example， data processed to allow the study of a disease in order to treat other people). The Italian legal system provides for the freedom of choice of the place of care (article32 ofthe Constitution and Legislative Decree 502/92) and the freedom to undergo treatment or not (Article 1 of Law 219/2017). According to the GDPR， once the city has decided to undergo treatment， they cannot refuse consent to the processing of data for treatment and diagnosis purposes. The digital preservation process aims to make删除1换行a document usable over time in all its integrity and authenticity， in its \"digital essence\" and in full compliance with the new privacy regulation (European Regulation 679 on protecting personal data)通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u>. The Digital Administration Code asserts that the Information Technology (IT) document and its processing are valid and relevant for the law and recognizes the equivalence between a computerized and paper document. Decree of the President of the Council of Ministers of the Italian Republic (DPCM) of 13 November 2014 sets the technical rules for the formation of the IT document. DPCM of 3 December 2013 preceded it， published in the Official Gazette number 59 of 12 March 2014 and related to managing IT documents and their preservation. The technical rules on preservation introduce adaptation to international standards and national standards 通用删除6(英):<u>[31，32]</u>.\n\n【17】The Electronic Sanitary File (ESF)\n\n【18】The ESF， provided by article 12 oflegislative decree 179/2012， is an IT tool that combines data and documents (digital or digitized) of health and social-health type related to the patients. Its function is to share such data and the patient's medical history among various doctors or health organizations. In addition to the patient (with safe modes， e.g.， smart card)， the ESF can access doctors and authorized healthcare personnel. Since the article 12 of Decree-Law 179/2012 is active， the inclusion of data within the ESF depends on the consent of the patient (article 3 bis). In this regard， you know about who has access to your data and how these data are used. The consent to the formation of the ESF is of course， quite distinct from the treatment. The lack of consent to the establishment of the ESF or the insertion of some data in the file cannot preclude the possibility of using the treatment. The patient has the right to revoke the consent and to obscure some specific data from the ESF. Although mobile electronic medical records are beneficial， several factors contribute to their not full potential use. Training in functionality and reliable infrastructures might foster tablet implementation 通用删除6(英):<u>[33]</u>. The European Union of Medical Specialists (EUMS) has published a document that contains the \"European Definition of Medical Act.\" This definition， adopted for the first time in 2005， was later amended in 2006 and finally in the Brussels meeting of 25 April 2009. This is the approved version： \"The medical act covers all professional activities， for example of scientific， teaching， training， educational， organizational， clinical and medical technology，carried out in order to promote health， prevent diseases， make diagnoses and prescribe therapeutic treatments or rehabilitative treatments for patients， individuals， groups or communities， in the framework of ethical and deontological rules. The medical act is a responsibility of the qualified physician； it must be performed by the doctor or under his direct supervision andprescription.\" Patients who disclosepersonal information to their physicians must be able to trust them in order to protect the same information against other incidents to the treatment process. In this sense， there is no distinction between traditional medicine and telemedicine. The duty of confidentiality applies to all information provided to a tele-consulting doctor by a third party that may be a healthcare professional， aware ofthe patient-doctor relationship and under the same obligation of confidentiality通用删除6(英):<u>[34</u>.\n\n【19】The Information Disclosure Consent\n\n【20】Most patients understand that the primary physician responsible for their case will need to ensure that all team members have the information to fulfill their professional roles in the care process. When patients consent to the disclosure of information about them， it is necessary to ensure that they understand the reasons for删除1换行disclosure. It is necessary to ensure that the patients are informed whenever information about them is likely to be disclosed to others involved in their health care and that they have the opportunity to retain information. If the doctor decides to divulge confidential information， he must be ready to explain and justify his decision. Because of the need to inform members of the support team， the law assumes the patient's implicit consent to disclose information to them. A final point concerns the circumstances in which the doctor or other authorities can cancel the patient's refusal to disclose. These circumstances arise when medical conditions ofa patient pose a severe threat to the community in general. Health status data are visible to third parties， such as relatives， family members， voluntary personnel， after the patient， if conscious， has been informed and allowed. In any case， it is necessary to respect the request of the person hospitalized to not make known even to the legitimate third parties his presence in the health facility or information on his health conditions 通用删除6(英):<u>[35]</u>. The issue of the access right to the patient's medical record obviously binds to the more general right of access to administrative documents(governed by the article 22 and following Law 241/1990) and to the treatment of personal health data according to the code about personal data protection referred to legislative decree number 196/2003. The public medical record is subject to the productivity of incident effects on subjective legal situations of public relevance . Theprevailing doctrine attributes juridical relevance to the medical record， as it is the only instrument capable of processing patient care information to allow communication between the various health care workers. The doctor， in charge of compilation， is a public official pursuant to article357 of the penal code， while the person responsible for the storage and good keeping is always the head of the department where the patient is undergoing treatment. The doctor has required a particular accuracy in writing all elements in the medical record： diagnosis， therapy，outcomes， etc. according to the article 24 of the Decree of the Minister of Health of 5 August 1977 and arranged according to the procedures set forth in article 26 ofthe Code of Medical Deontology. The medical record together with the related reports needs indefinite preservation， as it is an official act essential to ensure the certainty of clinical data， as well as being a valuable source of documentation for research of historical health data. In this panorama， the question of limits on access to third parties to the information contained in the medical record belonging to another subject has legal importance通用删除6(英):<u>[36]</u>.\n\n【21】The Network and Inform ation Security(NIS) Directive for Health Data Protection\n\n【22】Several devices are useful for remote communication， such as video conferencing unit， e-mail， webcam， Smartphone， etc. The channel to allow communication is variable (broadband， network， wireless). The legal perspective of confidentiality focuses on the relationship between the subjects involved rather than on the systems by which they communicate， but we must pay attention to this last aspect. We consider the NIS directive as the first step in the European cyber security strategy. Approved by the EU Parliament on 6 July 2016， the directive aims to reinforce the security and IT resilience within the Old Continent. The need for NIS directive starts from a consideration： networks， systems， and information services play a vital role in today society. Without them， the internal market could not work， so it is essential for their reliability and security for economic and social activities. The NIS applies to two categories： the operators of essential services that are necessary to the maintenance删除1换行of basic social and economic activities (such as health， transport and energy companies)， and the digital service operators such as search engines， e-commerce platforms， etc. Both of them need to adopt appropriate technical and organizational measures to manage risks and prevent IT incidents. In the event of default， very severe penalties will be present， ranging from a minimum of 12 thousand up to 150thousand Euros. In this regard， it is necessary， at the national level，the designation of an intervention group for cyber security in the event of an accident and national authority responsible for the security of networks and information systems. Furthermore， the NIS establishes the cooperation group composed of representatives of the Member States， the Commission and the European Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA)， a team to promote collaboration between the countries of the Union in relation to the security of networks and information systems in order to facilitate the information exchange. The two regulations， i.e.， the GDPR and the NIS directive， overlap when an IT security incident involves violation of personal data 通用删除6(英):<u>[37]</u>.\n\n【23】ElectronicIdentification Authentication and trust Services (eIDAS)\n\n【24】The eIDAS is the European regulation governing electronic signatures， moneyytransfers，andotherrtypes of electronic transactions in the European single market. It has allowed the creation of standards for electronic signatures， digital certificates and other forms of electronic authentication， thus allowing for the replacement of paper documents with digital equivalents that have the same legal value and official recognition in all EU countries. The member countries of the EU are required to recognize electronic signatures that meet the standards set by eIDAS. In particular， it distinguishes three types of signatures inherent sensitive data. The director adheres with local， state， federal and international guidelines for the acquisition of health information， transmission and storage of data by interfacing with electronic medical records and widely available archiving and communication systems， preferably using standards-based interoperability protocols. Imaging performance and diagnostic acquisition devices in ophthalmology should follow periodic manufacturer's recommendations. Diagnostic displays need for periodic checking and recalibration for normal function. The security， integrity， and availability of data (including backup and archiving) are the tasks ofthe IT staff. The setting， i.e.， a medical office， urgent care， emergency or community health care center， should be able to monitor the vital parameters of the test， to make a detailed medical history review， to conduct and transmit telemedicine for ophthalmological examination and to organize appropriate follow-up and care. Telemedicine exams will have different space requirements based on their use of synchronous technology or asynchronous technology. Synchronous visits require space for the patient， the local provider， and the remote provider to conduct the exam in private and discuss the results. Synchronous visits typically require audio and video equipment， a computer to transmit the necessary information about the exam and the devices and technologies to conduct a remote eye examination. Asynchronous visits require space for the necessary imaging equipment， other devices used， and space for the preparation and presentation of images and data. Generally， a small space within an existing clinical space is adequate for telemedicine examinations and consultations. There are few normative indications concerning the personnel who acquire， transmit， and interpret the data of telemedicine.\n\n【25】Each member of the team has the necessary qualifications删除1换行established by the program. An activity-based (or \"function-based\") assessment of staff requirements is necessary. The reading method for image analysis should be transparent to the applicant. The reading center is responsible for reading errors. The basic requirements for staff involved in ophthalmology telemedicine in a remote imaging site are diagnostic equipment， the awareness of the risks and the clinical estimation of ocular complications due to pupillary dilatation(if imaging is under the mydriatic eyewash)， universal precautions， antiseptic technique， and informed consent. Training for safe and correct contact with patients in a clinical setting， as indicated by applicable hospital and facility standards， is necessary. They are training on specific devices and equipment to obtain the necessary certifications and adherenceto the quality control for the instruments are essential. The ophthalmologists who work as a distant doctor should receive initial training and periodic re-evaluation to meet quality standards for the activities performed. The doctor who reads the test must confirm the coverage of responsibility for medical negligence for this activity by the insurer. An expert reader， under the supervision of the physician， bases the current ophthalmology telemedicine on a store-and-forward model with image acquisition for subsequent evaluation. The most recent applications may involve home-based tests with transmission and web-based interactions by the patient通用删除6(英):<u> 37]</u>.\n\n【26】删除3:<u>Network Access，Data Transmission，Health Internet (Hi)-Ethics in Telemedicine</u>\n\n【27】Telemedicine relies heavily on the video and audio transmission of data through telecommunications networks. Secure accesses to the network and data transmission are essential for the confidentiality of personal and medical data. The promise of this network is that patient information will be electronically available to authorized personnel wherever the patient is， or information is necessary. The access needs of at least one authentication check (password). The checks ensure that access is available only for authorized users. An appointed individual is responsible for the security of a connected system. All network workers are aware of their responsibilities. All the incidents threating the security are under control. The most obvious way to reduce the risk of unauthorized access to computer data on the Internet is to control traffic through the interface between the local network and the external Internet. This is a function of a firewall. It is important to know that they cannot protect themselves from the traffic that does not cross them. There are different types of firewalls such as the network-wide firewall using a router to make decisions， i.e. what to pass or block based on network protocols， usually Internet Protocol (IP) addresses， an application layer that is a system including a Personal Computer (PC) with two ports (one for entry and the other one for outgoing traffic). A firewall is a mean of ensuring that only the right traffic passes through.\n\n【28】Telemedicine includes four main areas：\n\n【29】Live Drsynchronous aaudio-video telemedicine，一i.e bi-directional real time communication between a patient and a healthcareproviderusinggaudiovisual telecommunication technologies and data collection.\n\n【30】Store-and-forward or asynchronous telemedicine (freely translatable as \"store and return\")， i.e. electronic transmission of health data (images， text or other digital data) to a healthcare provider for the evaluation and provision of the service using methods other than real-time interaction with the patient； it is a technique in which删除1换行an information， subdivided into packets in its path between the single stations (or nodes) of the network， must be totally received， before it can be retransmitted.\n\n【31】Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM)， i.e. collection of health data directly from the patient， usually during the normal activities of daily life， transmitted to a healthcare provider for analysis and possible actions.\n\n【32】Mobile Health： health care， patient communication and training based on mobile communication platforms， e.g. mobile phones， tablets， PCs，etc.\n\n【33】Encryption is， therefore， a great help to protect telemedicine transmission. There are two types of encryption algorithms. With secret key encryption， the sender and recipient both use the same key to lock and unlock the message. On the contrary， with public-key cryptography， each user has two unique keys， i.e.， a public key and a private key. In private， the key is useful to encrypt any message sent as a digital signature. The recipient can decrypt the signature with the public key to verify the identity and authenticity of the message. The power of digital signatures is that they also detect very slight changes in a message. Informed users naturally expect that the clinical information on the internet is high quality， accurate， timely， and evidence-based. Digital native users have less critical faculties. They are readily aware of the validity of what they read on the internet. Several organizations have tried to establish these principles in guidelines or codes of ethical practice for the construction of Internet sites. The Hi-Ethics consortium is a voluntary group aiming to join the websites and the most used health information providers whose goal is to gain consumer confidence in internet health services. The goals of Hi-Ethics are to offer internet services that reflect ethical and high-quality standards， to provide reliable and up-to-date health information， to keep private and secure personal information and to take special precautions for personal health information. The Hi-Ethics allows consumers to distinguish online health services following these principles from those that do not 通用删除6(英):<u>[38]</u>.\n\n【34】TelemedicalEquipmentand Operational Risks\n\nThere are two broad categories of equipment used in telemedicine for the ophthalmology program： information acquisition devices(camera，coherent optical tomography，tonometer，auto refractometer， campimeter， etc.)， image communication devices (computers， servers， network devices， etc.) to send data. The remarkable technological development of biomedical equipment for therapeutic， rehabilitative and diagnostic use has certainly brought great benefits， but it has created， in the health structures， particular problems for the protection ofpersonnel， patients and health workers， mostly from electronic risks. Before using any biomedical equipment， make sure it has undergone regular acceptance testing and that the operators have received adequate and specific training on its correct use. For a long time， the CEI EN 60601-1 standard has been the reference for manufacturers and users of electro-medical devices for the diagnosis and treatment of patients. The international work of adaptation of the norm in these last years， after some modifications published in1991 and 1995， has led to the publication of the third edition in 2006in which the concept of safety has been expanded to include the aspect of the essential performance of electromedical equipment. The experience also extends to the legal aspects of telemedical equipment. The basis of this legislative framework is the Consumer Protection|删除段之间换行|Act of 1987 dealing with the general responsibility for artisanal products and applied to the teleconsultations equipment 通用删除6(英):<u>[39]</u>. The regulations apply to Computed Tomography (CT) scanners， X-rays， ultrasounds， etc. All these devices (including new videoconferences and related equipment) must show the European Conformity (CE) mark indicating that they comply with the appropriate safety， quality， and performance standards. The Medical Devices Agency (MDA) is also responsible for registering the manufacturer and reporting incidents， as well as for the general implementation and promotion of European directives. MDA has identified the repeated causes of adverse incidents with medical devices such as poor quality， outdated or worn-out devices， and incompatibility with auxiliary equipment， poor documentation， inappropriate use， inadequate training， maintenance errors or lack of assistance. These comments mainly refer to the malfunctions of the operational equipment 通用删除6(英):<u>[40]</u>. Several devices are useful to communicate remotely， such as a video conferencing unit， e-mail， webcam， or Smartphone. The channel allowing communication can be broadband， network， or wireless. The operational risks are those identified by the MDA as the main causes of adverse accidents. The analysis of these cases shows that they fall into two categories： inadequacies due to technology and those due to insufficient staff. We can distinguish four main technological risks involving：\n\n【36】The image quality： a patient has the right to expect that a consultant can draw the same correct conclusions from an image on a telemedicine screen as from a conventional face-to-face visit， particularly important for Ophthalmology surveys.\n\n【37】The lack of suitable equipment for a health service.\n\n【38】Malfunctioning equipment：thebreakdown of the computer or video equipment is unfortunately one of the most common features of telemedicine.\n\n【39】Inadequate guidelines： Guidelines are as a bridge between technology and participants in teleconsulting. The guidelines determine the teleconsultation process and the documentation provides an archive of therapy， prescriptions， dosages of drugs， plans，etc. This combination of protocol and recording of the action provides a powerful audit trail that can have considerable value in any legal dispute.\n\n【40】In Italy， the Directorate General for Medical Devices and the Pharmaceutical Service is responsible for the completion and implementation of the regulation of medical devices， including tasks related to market surveillance， accident monitoring， clinical investigations， and evaluation of technologies and address of Health Technology Assessment (HTA) activities 通用删除6(英):<u>[41]</u>. As regards the operational risks due to the staff， the Commission refers to the definition of \"healthcare professionals\" as defined in the article 3/f of the Directive 2011/24/EU 通用删除6(英):<u>[38]</u>. Healthcare professional is the doctor， the nurse responsible for the general care， the dentist， the midwife， or the pharmacist according to the Directive 2005/36/EC. We have principles to ensure that each team member is aware of his responsibilities and those of the other members. The patient should alsoknow who is responsible forhis care. These are simpleprecautions to avoid complaints of negligence. Telemedicine has sensitizedpeople on issues that underline legislative discrepancy about the problem of accreditation and qualifications of health staff to protect the patient from incompetent professionals 通用删除6(英):<u>[41，42]</u>.\n\n【41】Discussion\n\n【42】The benefits of telemedicine are promising and， mainly， in ophthalmology， that is a specialization based on diagnostic imaging. The application of telemedicine is useful for patients， for ophthalmologists and health institutions as it allows access to medical care，it avoids unnecessarylong movements，and it increasestheprofits by reaching patients， by expanding the spectrum of available services and by reducing health care costs and waiting lists. Telemedicine in ophthalmology allows collaboration between professionals from different locations， sometimes even from different countries. It simplifies， through different telecommunications channels and mobile technologies， direct patient access to ophthalmologists who practice in another city or country without requiring any of the participants to travel. However， some characteristics of telemedicine can become problematic， such as the violation of privacy， the physical distance， the inclusion of new technological methods， the purchase of expensive equipment， the weakening of the doctor/patient relationship， the involuntary increase in opportunities for incorrect behavior， the delegation of functions due to the remote nature of the treatment process， etc. Health professionals should consider that telemedicine could lead them to face further potential medical errors within a substantially more challenging standard of care. The EU has not yet issued specific rules on medical liability， despite its specific features， and this gap can jeopardize the development of telemedicine inEurope， thus denying all its benefits to European patients. However， the EU will not be able to create a uniform regulation covering all aspects of telemedicine， but it has already taken a step forward in terms of technology and privacy， which are already well-defined topics under European law. As regards the rights of patients in the field of telemedicine， the EU will be able to create some basic guidelines in the context of cross-border healthcare patients rights. The rights of European patients still lack a set of uniform rules and the standardization in such a complex area as telemedicine； perhaps it would not be the best choice. We cannot expect harmonized rules for the medical responsibility deriving from telemedicine. Member States have very different national laws to address these issues because the EU brings together models of continental law and common law models. Because of this intrinsic difference， the attempt to harmonize civil liability， especially criminal liability， will be doomed to fail. It would be the scope for each Member State to provide a legal framework for telemedicine， while the role of the EU would be limited to requiring the Member States to regulate it. Most of the legal issues we have considered so fartend to fall into two well-defined categories：problems that have a frequent basis with conventional medicine and those that are specific to telemedicine.\n\n【43】When telemedicine takes place across national borders， or in Europe， there is likely to be even more opportunity for legal discord on which laws to apply； i.e.， the laws of the country where the telepatient is present or of the country where the teleconsultation took place. What happens if telemedicine is legal to practice in one country but is not in another? We need to confirm a telemedicine task force in ophthalmology involving the academic and research world by using excellent resources， and collaboration between the Italian Ophthalmology Society， the Italian Association of Doctors Ophthalmologists and the Society of Legal Medicine in Ophthalmology to establish the legislation and guidelines of the telemedicine. Thehealth manager or health director oftelemedicine is necessary to avoid the delegation of care to less qualified subordinates and to establish their competences and responsibilities. Telemedicine删除1换行is not a defined discipline to justify the professional accreditation of \"Ophthalmologist Specialist in Telemedicine.\" Tele-education or eLearning should become a standardized process with certification requirement as well as continuous courses are necessary to spread the current European legislation in telemedicine both at the Ministry of Health and Medical Orders levels in all Italian regions. In conclusion， it is a good investment of efforts and resources because the worldwide future oftelemedicine in ophthalmology undoubtedly promises well.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

It is characterized by a highly aggressive clinical course with a median survival of 15 months. PCGDTCL involves the subcutaneous fat and can often mimic both clinically and histologically other more indolent conditions such as Cytophagic Histiocytic Phagocytosis (CHP) and Subcutaneous Panniculitic T-Cell Lymphomas (SPTCL). In addition， diagnosis of PCGDTCL can be challenging due to aberrant expression of surface markers in the neoplastic cells and varied histologic presentation and multiple biopsies are required to make a correct diagnosis. This is a case report that the initial histopathologic findings were most consistent with CHP but with a very aggressive and uncommon clinical course and with extreme subcutaneous ulcerations.\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Cytophagic Histiocytic Panniculitis (CHP) lesions show histiocytic infiltration of adipose tissue with hemophagocytosis and lymphocytic invasion 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，2]</u>. The clinical course of CHP may be indolent with intermittent exacerbations or rapidly fatal heralded by fevers， hepatosplenomegaly， pancytopenia， coagulopathy， and transaminitis 通用删除6(英):<u>[2，3]</u>. Non-fatal， indolent CHP is responsive to immunosuppressive therapy whereas fatal CHP often requires cytotoxic therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>[2，3]</u>. The presentation of fatal CHP is similar to Subcutaneous Panniculitis-like T-Cell Lymphoma (SPTL) with differentiation made by the presence of malignant lymphocytes on histologic review of lesions 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. However， initial biopsies of SPTL are often consistent with CHP suggesting that CHP represents an indolent lymphoid malignancy 通用删除6(英):<u>[3，4]</u>. The following case illustrates an extreme clinical presentation of SPTL initially diagnosed as CHP.\n\n【4】Case Presentation\n\n【5】A 63-year-old Caucasian female presented with a month history of daily fevers up to 39.4C， night sweats， increasing fatigue， bilateral lower extremity edema and multiple erythematous lesions on her extremities and back. The patient reported she had similar symptoms of a milder nature one year prior， that had resolved spontaneously after six weeks without a diagnosis. At the time of presentation， the patient was a febrile and vitally stable. Multiple erythematous， patchy lesions with associated deep ulceration， necrosis， and subcutaneous nodular lesions were noted on the bilateral upper and lower extremities， left breast， and back . Cardiovascular， respiratory， and abdominal examinations were normal and without hepatosplenomegaly. Her course progressed rapidly over the next several months with aggressive， deep ulcerative lesions throughout her extremities， breast， and abdomen with ongoing intermittent fevers and progressive fatigue.\n\n【6】Initial blood work reported normal hemoglobin of 11.6 with giemsa smear showing microcytic hypochromic red blood cells and normal white blood cell and differential and platelet count. Iron studies were indicative of anemia of inflammation (Ferritin 1，188； Iron 44； TIBC 298 and Iron Saturation 15%). Markers of inflammation were elevated including CRP 7.9 and ESR 55. The patient had a mild transaminitis (AST 106， ALT 77) that spontaneously normalized on repeat laboratory work up.\n\n【7】Skin punch biopsy oflesions on upper and lower extremities were obtained from outside facility. Outside pathology of all three biopsies were read as squamous cell carcinoma with a co-existent lobular panniculitis. Second review of the original pathology was read as ulcer and atypical squamous proliferation with lobular panniculitis and interface dermatitis. Repeat biopsies were completed due to high suspicion of possible SPTL， but the pathology confirmed a lobular panniculitis composed predominantly of epithelioid histiocytes with phagocytosis of red blood cells. There were also small lymphocytes and karvorrhectic cells. Normal CD4：CD8 ratio with histiocyvtic predominance did not support a typical lymphoma diagnosis. Overall， these findings were reported suspicious for Cytophagic Histiocytic Panniculitis (CHP). No malignant or infectious processes were appreciated on complete pathologic stains.删除1换行cardiolipin antibody， C-ANCA， P-ANCA， smooth muscle antibody， alpha-1-antitrypsin enzyme， angiotensin converting enzyme， and interleukin-2 receptor. However， mitochondrial antibodies were elevated at 1.31 with normal index value <0.91 and lipase was only mildly increased at 196. D-dimer was elevated at 1，214 ng/mL and fibrinogen was 556 ng/dL. Infectious disease and rheumatologic consults were obtained， both felt that an infectious or rheumatologic underlying process were unlikely.\n\n【8】Work-up for an underlying neoplastic process was performed. Computed Tomography (CT) of the chest， abdomen， and pelvis with contrast was obtained which noted mildly enlarged lymph nodes throughout the abdomen， pelvis， lower neck， mediastinum， and left axilla. Fat stranding of the subcutaneous soft tissues of the abdomen and pelvis and left breast were also reported. Mammography was reported as negative for malignancy.\n\n【9】Work-up for underlying causes ofCHP was performed. Infectious etiologies including HIV， EBV， CMV， Hepatitis B， Hepatitis C， Syphilis， andTuberculosis were excluded. Autoimmune and Vasculitis work-up was negative including Anti-Nuclear Antibodies(ANA)， SS-A/Ro and SS-B/La antibodies， Beta-2-Glycoprotein，\n\n【10】While evaluating for underlying etiologies，the patient was actively being treated for aggressive CHP as she continued to have progressive删除1换行deep cutaneous ulceration/panniculitis and systemic symptoms. She was started on prednisone 40 mg per day and hydroxychloroquine200 mg twice daily for treatment of CHP. While this treatment course initially achieved mild improvement of skin lesions and edema， the patient developed progression of symptoms with visual disturbance， ptosis， and left eye discomfort. CT scan of the orbits showed an enlarged heterogeneous lacrimal gland without bony erosion or fat stranding. The patient was changed to prednisone 60 mg per day with cyclosporine 500 mg per day. The patient experienced disease progression on this regimen， and then she was initiated on Anakinra100 mg subcutaneously daily.\n\n【11】Due to a worsening disease course despite immune suppression and concern that CHP may be masking and underlying SPTL， repeat multiple skin biopsies were obtained. The previous biopsies did not show abnormal T cells and PCR studies for TCR gene rearrangement were inconclusive. A final set of skin biopsies were then obtained. Pathology confirmed lymphocytes positive for CD3， TCR delta， CD56， and TIA positive， CD4， and CD8 negative. PCR identified a clonal TCR gamma gene rearrangement. These findings were consistent with Subcutaneous Panniculitis T-Cell Lymphoma(SPTL) gamma/delta type (Primary Cutaneous Gamma/Delta T-Cell Lymphoma (PCGDTCL)) presenting as cytophagic histiocytic panniculitis. Anakinra was discontinued and patient was referred to bone marrow transplant for further management. She received six cycles of EPOCH regimen with excellent response and healing of the large， deep cutaneous ulcers . She is currently receiving Pentostatin and being prepared for allogenic stem cell transplantation.\n\n【12】Discussion\n\n【13】Cytophagic Histiocytic Panniculitis (CHP) presents as ulcerating nodules or plaques based in the subcutaneous fat without antecedent infection 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，2]</u>. CHP is defined histologically by infiltration of subcutaneous adipose tissue by benign appearing cytophagic macrophages and T-cell lymphocytes 通用删除6(英):<u>[1-3]</u>. The course of CHP may be indolent or aggressive with a fatal hemophagocytic disorder 通用删除6(英):<u>[3，5]</u>. As in this case， an initial benign course can progress to a fatal hemophagocytosis 通用删除6(英):<u>[2，3]</u>. This progression is often heralded by systemic findings including recurrent pyrexia， pancytopenia， consumptive coagulopathy and hemodynamic instability 通用删除6(英):<u>[2，3，5]</u>. This patient did not have any cytopenias， liver or spleen abnormalities or a consumptive coagulopathy. Her clinical course was unusual in that she had a mild form of the disease one year prior that became latent.\n\n【14】Then， she developed progression of symptoms starting with cycling of fevers， fatigue， and multiple， large deep subcutaneous ulcers are not commonly seen to this extent in panniculitis. In addition， she developed orbital involvement that is also a rare finding in primary cutaneous gamma/delta T-cell lymphoma.\n\n【15】The systemic symptoms of aggressive CHP are also noted in SPTL通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. Differentiation of CHP and SPTL is classically based on histologic findings， with SPTL displaying neoplastic T cell infiltrate into subcutaneous tissue involving fat septate and lobules 通用删除6(英):<u>[2，6]</u>. However， a dominant benign inflammatory cell population accompanies neoplastic lymphocytes in SPTL， potentially obscuring them 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. Furthermore， as documented in this case， initial biopsies of SPTL may be more consistent with CHP通用删除6(英):<u>[3，6]</u>. Thus， an indolent course of CHP with histology interpreted as benign cannot be assumed non-fatal， as neoplastic transformation or a missed diagnosis may occur 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>.In addition， the heterogeneity of the lymphoma can make this diagnosis more difficult to confirm.\n\n【16】T-cell gene rearrangements have been examined in an attempt to definitely differentiate CHP from SPTL. Though T-cell monoclonal rearrangements are more frequently associated with SPTL， they have also been noted in CHP 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. Furthermore， T-cell clonality is sometimes observed in benign conditions， and therefore is a poor diagnostic marker 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. EBV positivity has also been studied with latent infection noted in both CHP and SPTL 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>.\n\n【17】Given the similarity of clinical presentation， the lack of definitive molecular tests， and the transition of presentation， CHP and SPTL may be better characterized as a clinical spectrum rather than separate entities. This case provides excellent illustration of such disease progression and heterogeneity in the pathologic specimens. Maintaining a high suspicion of the development or an underlying cutaneous lymphoma is warranted in these rare cases. In addition， this case provides a reminder that patients with initial diagnoses of indolent CHP should be carefully monitored for neoplastic disease. Patients with aggressive CHP or SPTL would benefit from early aggressive therapy to prevent a fatal course.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

The client came to the LGBRIMH， Tezpur outpatient department with the chief complaint of bedwetting (since childhood)， along with social shyness， poor appetite， and a pessimistic view of the future for 2 years. The mode of onset was insidious，continuous course of illness and deteriorating progress of the illness. The client’s mother as a primary caregiver mentioned that the client always preferred to stay at home in dark rooms， and had deteriorated a lot in studies and other physical activities. He was diagnosed with F41.2 (mixed anxiety and depressive disorder) with R32 (unspecified urinary incontinence)， according to the International Classification of Diseases  .\n\n【23】Family history\n\n【24】According to the informant (mother)， till 16 years of age， she had a history suggestive of nocturnal enuresis. The client's younger brother has a schizophrenia-like illness， with ongoing treatmer from LGBRIMH， Tezpur. The client's two paternal aunts have some non-affective mental illness. The client’s maternal grandmother has a history suggestive of cardiac ailment， diabetes mellitus， and hypertension.\n\n【25】Family dynamics\n\n【26】Based on the assessment scales and cross-sectional psychosocial interview， it was found that both internal and external family boundaries were semi-open. Father was the nominal head of the family， whereas， the mother was the functional head of the family. Decision-making was democratic style， but the father used to take the major decision of the family and tries to brief other members. A dysfunctional pattern of non-verbal communication was presented from children toward their father. The family failed to distribute their roles and responsibilities appropriately among all members. Coping and problem-solving were inadequate in the family.\n\n【27】Psychiatric social work intervention\n\n【28】Psychosocial assessment and intervention were provided to the删除1换行client and the family (the mother was the primary caregiver) in the psychosocial unit of LGBRIMH， Tezpur. Altogether 14 sessions(seven individual sessions， three family primary caregiver sessions， and three follow-ups) were provided.\n\n【29】At individual level\n\n【30】1. Establishing rapport and therapeutic alliance (session1)： In the introductory session， a trustworthy objective relationship was developed between the client and the therapist. The client has explained the nature of the treatment. He has explained the nature of the treatment， the process of the intervention， and the expected outcome. Confidentiality assurance was given to him.\n\n【31】2. Dry bed training (session 2)： In this training， the client facilitated mandatory waking up at a sort interval at night for urination. Changing clothes， if urine spots are present for better hygiene. This intermittent wake-up at night helps the bladder to remain lightly weighted 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>.\n\n【32】3. Behaviormodification1(session 3， 4)： Behavior modification is seen as the planned systematic application of the experimentally established principle of learning to the modification of maladaptive behavior especially to decrease undesired behavior and increase desired behavior. Here， techniques like reinforcement， punishment， shaping， Channing， fading， and prompting were used.\n\n【33】4. Alarm therapy/Enuresis alarm (session 5， 6)： It is one of the advanced treatment techniques， which is found to be an effective treatment of nocturnal enuresis. In this technique， an alarm with a sensor is kept nearby the client's bed. At midnight， whenever， a small amount of urine is passed in the bed， the alarm is activated， and the client can urinate properly in the bathroom. On repeated conditioning of this technique， the client develops a habit of waking up at night for urination 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>.\n\n【34】5. Cognitive behavior therapy (session 7-8)： This therapy was planned to target automatic negative thoughts that can contribute to and worsen emotional difficulties， depression， and anxiety. The objective was to identify the negative thoughts， generate a list of删除表格换行possible solutions， and evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of each possible solution， to choose a solution and implementation. The ultimate goal of this therapy was to shift the client from an emotional focus coping to problem focus coping 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>.\n\n【35】Table 1： Pre and post-test score of Family Assessment Device (FAD).\n\n|  | Pre-test Scores  |  | Post-test Scores  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Domains  | Obtained score/cut-otts  | Impression  | Obtained score/cut-offs  | Impression  |\n| Problem Solving  | 2.4/2.2  | Dysfunctional  | 1.9/2.2  | Normal  |\n| Communication  | 2.3/2.2  | Dysfunctional  | 2.1/2.2  | Normal  |\n| Roles  | 2.4/2.3  | Dysfunctional  | 1.9/2.3  | Normal  |\n| Affective Responsiveness  | 2.1/2.2  | Normal  | 2.1/2.2  | No change  |\n| Affective Involvement  | 2.2/2.1  | Dysfunctional  | 2.2/2.1  | No change  |\n| Behavioral Control  | 2.4/1.9  | Dysfunctional  | 1.7/1.9  | Normal  |\n| General Functioning  | 2.3/2.0  | Dysfunctional  | 1.9/2.0  | Normal  |\n\n【37】Table 2： Pre and post-test score of Family Attitude Scale (FAS).\n\n|  |  | Pre-test Scores  |  | Post-test Scores  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Domains  | Maximum Score  | Score Obtained  | Impression  | Score Obtained  | Impression  |\n| Critical Comment  | 10  | 2  | Mild  | 0  | Nil  |\n| Hostility  | 12  | 3  | Mild  | 删除8:<u>门 </u> | Nil  |\n| Warmth  | 12  | 6  | Moderate  | No change  |  |\n| Dissatisfaction  | 12  | 4  | Mild  | No change  |  |\n| Emotional over-involvement  | 14  | 10  | Severe  | 6  | Mild  |\n\n【39】At family level\n\n【40】1.

A study conducted by Akhouri et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u> also showed a shift from moderate to mild depression after the successful application of cognitive behavior therapy. Alarm therapy was found to be a very effective non-pharmacological treatment in adults. During the follow-up sessions， the client reported 3 to 4 days of dry nights per week. Studies conducted in past have also mentioned alarm therapy as the first-line non-pharmacological treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>[9-11]</u>. The post-test score of the work behavior inventory showed that there were significant changes in social skills， cooperation， and work habits， quality of work， personal presentation，and global assessment of work behavior. Family psychoeducation is important in NE cases， as it develops an insight in the family members about the illness so that they are no more clueless about the illness its etiology.\n\n【48】Table 3： Pre and post-test score of Depression， Anxiety and Stress Scale-21(DASS 21).\n\n| Domains  | Pre-test  | Post-test  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Stress  | Moderate  | Mild  |\n| Anxiety  | Severe  | Mild  |\n| Depression  | Moderate  | Mild  |\n\n【50】Conclusion\n\n【51】NE in adults has a direct impact on the emotional and behavioral aspects of client personality. It may lead to poor self-esteem， social isolation， depression， anxiety， stress， poor coping. It also leads to care burden on the family primary caregivers of the client. So， a proper psychosocial assessment and management both at the individual and family level is the need of the hour.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

One-fifth of all gallbladder cancer cases are reported only from northern part of India. The cases are more prominent in females than males. There were many risk factors associated with gallbladder cancer， but the heavy metals are play crucial roles in induction of gallbladder cancer. Heavy metal may interfere with molecular mechanism and activate mTOR，MAPK，and transcription factor. Hyper activation of cysteine due to arsenic exposure interfere with the function of the mTOR signaling pathway and taurine pathway that causes activation of c-fos，c-myc， and ELK-1leading to enhance cell division causing gallbladder cancer. Lead， Nickel， Zinc， and chromium activate cholic acid which causes formation of gallstones through activated taurine pathway leading to inflammatory gallbladder disease and formation of gall stones. Prolonged inflammation and stones formation in gall bladder may cause loss of contact inhibition in gall bladder cells leading to gall bladder cancer. The combined mechanism of heavy metals activates different pathway leading to gallbladder cancer through activating cell cycle and angiogenesis， it also inhibits tumor- suppressing genes. It was evident that gallbladder cancer is associated with high levels of heavy metal exposure. Differential mechanism associated with different heavy metal leads to gall bladder cancer.\n\n【2】Keywords： mTOR； MAPK； Taurine； Gall stone； Inflammation\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】GBC (Gallbladder Cancer) is the sixth most frequent cancer among all gastrointestinal tract malignancies 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. GBC have high mortality rate； it accounts for 20h position for death rate among all type of cancers. Mortality rate are very high for gall bladder cancer. In 2020， 115，949 new cases of GBC were reported worldwide， which was 0.6% of overall cancer incidence rate 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. Differences in GBC incidence rate have been observed in different geographical areas 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. Asia represents 70.8% of the total gallbladder cancer incidence followed by Europe 10.8%， Latin America and the Caribbean8.6%， Africa 4.7%， and Northern America 4.5% from. 10% of the global burden of GBC contributed by only India 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. The 10% to 22% of India’s total GBC burden has been contributed by north-east region 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. In 2020 because of GBC total of 84，695 deaths were reported worldwide including73.6% of the total mortality from Asia， 10.3% from Europe， 7.6% from Latin America and 5% from Caribbean， and 3.1% from Northern America 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. These variations observed due to dissimilarity in genetic propensity and environmental exposure as well as other conditions such as gallstones， obesity， gender， bacterial infection associated with chronic inflammation that increase the potential for carcinogenesis， as known risk factors 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>.\n\n【5】Heavy metal and gallbladder cancer incidence\n\n【6】Heavy metal as well as trace metal was observed in bile of gall bladder cancer patients 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. The amount of some heavy metals like Lead (Pb)， Chromium (Cr)， and Cadmium (Cd) was found significantlyhigher in patients diagnosed with GBC 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>. The study conducted in the Gangetic plains of Bihar by Kumar et al.， 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u> found a remarkably high concentration of arsenic (>15 ugL) in the blood of 53.6% of patients with gallbladder cancer. High concentration of Copper (Cu) and Nickel(Ni) were found in serum， Cd and Ni were found in bile and high concentration of Cr was found in gallbladder tissues. While Zinc (Zn) and Selenium (Se) have also been detected in low concentration in gall bladder tissues 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>. Role of heavy metal in induction of biological pathways were shown in Figure 1. It gives detailed idea about tumorigenesis in gall bladder and heavy metal incidence.\n\n【7】Molecular mechanism involved in gallbladder cancer due to heavy metals\n\n【8】Mondal et al.， 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u> conducted a study that provides concrete pieces of evidence in support of heavy metals-induced premalignant and malignant development in gallbladder. It has been reported that the deregulation in antioxidant system plays a major role in carcinogenesis 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>. Heavy metals induce cancer through the generation of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS)， which leads to DNA damage through redox imbalance and by interrupting the repair pathway of damaged DNA 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>. The strong affinity of heavy metals for free sulfhydryl group makes it capable to disturb the metabolism and physiological function of several proteins 通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u>. Heavy metal exposure such as As， Hg， Cd and Pb compromises with cysteine status， which significantly took a part in the inducible endogenous detoxification system of body 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u> and heavy metal also associated with alteration in function of enzyme involved in antioxidant system， lead to malignancy by DNA damage 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>.\n\n【9】Heavy metal binding with cysteine & its metabolites leading to gallbladder cancer： The semi-essential sulfur-containing amino acid cysteine is carried from extracellular space by a catalytic subunit of the transport system called xCT in exchange for glutamate 通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>. In the liver， cysteine decomposed into GSH (glutathione)by hepatic enzyme Y-Glutamyl Cysteine Synthetase (GCS) and disintegrates to cysteine sulfate by another hepatic enzyme Cysteine Dioxygenase (CDO)， cysteine sulfate further catabolized to hypo taurine by the action of enzyme Cysteine Sulfinate Decarboxylase (CSDC)， which later on oxidized to taurine 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>. The free sulfhydryl group of Cysteine binds with heavy metal such as arenite resulting in metabolic alteration and decrease cysteine concentration in intercellular space 通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u>. Cysteine transportation could also limit by phosphorylation of serine26 present on the cytosolic N terminus of the cystine-glutamate antiporter xCT by mTOR signaling 通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u>. Decreased level of cysteine leads to disturbance in its physiological role such as protection against inflammatory response and oxidative stress by deregulating GSH synthesis 通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u>. According to Lewerenz et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u>， the SLC7A11transporter is expressed in the number of malignancies where transporter-assisteddglutathione production decreases oxidative damage and protect cancer cell from death .\n\n【10】Role of GSH and its contribution to GBC due to heavy metal exposure： GSH protects the intracellular environment from oxidative stress and detoxifies cells by acting as a scavenger 通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u>. GSH reduces the oxidative level through binding its thiol group directly with free radicals， it also functions as a cofactor for enzyme peroxidase， which metabolized H，O， and lipid peroxide 通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u>. The high affinity of heavy metal for GSH leads to a reduction in intracellular concentration of glutathione by suppressing the action of essential enzyme Y-glutamyl cysteine synthetase required for GSH synthesis 通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u>. Decreased levels of glutathione lead to elevation in redox imbalance which increases the frequency of damaged DNA 通用删除6(英):<u>[25]</u> by modifying methylation of DNA or by interfering in the mechanism of DNA repair . Mutated DNA gets accumulated and eventually causes cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>[26]</u>. It has been observed that when ROS generation is high， the antioxidant system loses its ability to maintain equilibrium and results in oxidative stress通用删除6(英):<u> 27]</u>.\n\nEffect of heavy metal induced oxidative tension on DNA：High oxidative stress could induce either through mitochondrial dysfunction or malfunctioning of the ROS elimination system，heavy metal limits the function of MRCC1 and MRCC2 mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes which enhance the oxidative stress通用删除6(英):<u>[28]</u>. Free radicals also produced either by stimulation of H.O， production through heavy metal toxicity or feedback inhibition of amino-levulinic acid synthase， which leads to an elevated level of heme precursor Amino-Levulinic Acid (ALA)， enolization of ALA followed by autoxidation generated free radicals 通用删除6(英):<u>[29]</u>. Increased level of free radical by inhibition of antioxidant system has been observed in fishes when exposed to metal toxicity by Zheng et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[30]</u>. Effects of increased oxidative stress on DNA impairment is complex and pleomorphic. Increased oxidative stress caused by heavy metal leads to DNA damage and it can initiate cancer processes as well as participate in its progression 通用删除6(英):<u>[31]</u>. Oxidative DNA damage has also been identified in the lymphocytes of the person exposed to the heavy metal environment 通用删除6(英):<u>[32]</u>. Chromosomal aberration and DNA strand break has been well demonstrated in cultured mammalian cells even at the minute deposition of heavy metal 通用删除6(英):<u>[33]</u>. Simultaneously ROS causes DNA damage by oxidizing nucleoside bases such as8-oxoguanine， which if left unpaired， it may cause G-T and G-A transversion 通用删除6(英):<u>[34]</u>. Moreover， heavy metal exposure can produce|删除段之间换行|Suppression of DNA repair mechanism and genotoxicity due to oxidative stress caused by heavy metal： Giaginis et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[36]</u> has reported about suppression of mismatch repair， nucleotide excision， and base excision DNA repairs mechanisms due to heavy metal toxicity， either by binding to residues of negatively charged surface on DNA repair protein or by replacing Zn-atom in their Zn finger motif. Inhibition of repair mechanism result into conformational changes and disturbance in DNA protein interaction required for DNA repair process and preservation of genomic integrity. Substantiation of aberration in chromosome， micronuclei， and high sister chromatids exchange due to heavy metal has observed by Valverde et al.， 通用删除6(英):<u>[37]</u> in person exposed to heavy metal environment. Heavy metal compounds alter expression of tumor suppressor gene and oncogene through deregulation in DNA methylation pattern 通用删除6(英):<u>[38]</u>. Which may be cause hypomethylation leading to oncogene activation through suppression of DNA methyl transferase 通用删除6(英):<u>[39]</u> or transcriptional inactivation due to删除1换行hypermethylation of the p53 gene at the promoter region by heavy metal 通用删除6(英):<u>[40]</u>. Heavy metal also reduces the levels of S-Adenosyl-L-Methionine (SAM) and methyltransferase gene which encode for enzyme that transfer a methyl group to nucleotides residue of DNA. Dysregulation in methylation processes due to heavy metal exposure has also observed in rats model 通用删除6(英):<u>[41]</u>. Methylation at promoter region of tumors suppressor gene family CDH1，CDKN2A， p16 and REpRIMO is responsible for apoptosis and inhibition of angiogenesis in gallbladder malignancy. Methylation of p73， MGMT， DCL1 were also observed in cell of gallbladder malignancy 通用删除6(英):<u>[42]</u>. Modification in promoter region and remodeling in process of methylation of DNA have a tumor-encouraging effect and enhance the up regulation of the proto-oncogene pool out-turn into mutation and accumulated mutation with time results in tumor formation.\n\n【12】Role of heavy metals on the physiological role of taurine responsible for galbladdertumorigenesis： Cysteine derived Taurine(2-aminoethane sulphonic acid) freely present in intracellular space play a key role in the reduction of oxidative tension induced by heavy metal toxicity 通用删除6(英):<u>[43]</u>. It has been observed that taurine reduces\n\n【13】Signaling expressed in gallbladder carcinoma\n\n【14】Cell signaling is necessary for sustaining critical cellular functions like development， differentiation， migration， and cell growth. Activation of ERK/MAPK 通用删除6(英):<u>[53]</u> and mTOR signaling pathways 通用删除6(英):<u>[54]</u> due to heavy metal toxicityhas been reported in gallbladder cell lines， which incite circumstances that fuel cancer progression .\n\n【15】MAPK signaling pathway activation in gall bladder cancer due to heavy metal exposure： Activation of the MAPK signaling pathway in presence of excess heavy metal through generation of ROS was extensively studied 通用删除6(英):<u>[55]</u>. Nanomolar concentration of Cd删除1换行also activates MAPK signaling 通用删除6(英):<u>[56]</u>. MAP kinase activates different downstream substrate such as transcription factors Elk-1， c-jun， c-fos， c-myc， stress-activated protein kinase (MSK) and Ribosomal S6 Kinase 1 (RSK1) in gallbladder carcinoma 通用删除6(英):<u>[57]</u>. Which stimulate cancer regulatory processes： Angiogenesis， cell proliferation 通用删除6(英):<u>[58]</u>， cell differentiation 通用删除6(英):<u>[59]</u>， cell cycle progression 通用删除6(英):<u>[60]</u>， growth， metastasis通用删除6(英):<u>[61]</u>， invasiveness 通用删除6(英):<u>[62]</u> in GBC celllines 通用删除6(英):<u>[63]</u>.\n\n【16】Role of heavy metals in mTOR activation leading to gallbladder cancer： mTOR activation occurs early in the development of GBC通用删除6(英):<u>[64]</u>. Activation of PI3K kinase， which stimulate mTOR pathway and phosphorylation of mTOR， S6K1 and 4E-BP1 by heavy metal has reported in GBC 通用删除6(英):<u>[48]</u>.

Parental consanguinity was present. Presence of giant granules in leucocytes and melanocytes of the hair confirmed the diagnosis. Though most patients undergo a variable period of recurrent infections before going into the accelerated phase， this case was unusual in that her primary presentation was in the accelerated phase.\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Chediak-Higashi Syndrome (CHS) is a rare autosomal recessive multisystem disease， characterized by partial oculocutaneous albinism， blond hair， severe immunodeficiency and presence of abnormal large cytoplasmic granules in leukocytes and other granule containing cells. The accelerated phase of CHS consisting of a lymphoproliferative syndrome manifested by hepatosplenomegaly， lymphadenopathy and pancytopenia may occur shortly after birth or several years later 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Morbidity results from frequent cutaneous and respiratory pyogenic infections or from an accelerated phase. Most patients undergo a variable period of recurrent infections before going into the accelerated phase. Therefore， primary presentation in the accelerated phase is unusual通用删除6(英):<u>[21</u>.\n\n【4】Case Presentation\n\n【5】Our patient was born at full term to consanguineous parents after normal pregnancy and labor. She was normal at birth and her symptoms began at the age of two years when she started having progressive abdominal distension， associated with fever and loss of appetite for about 1 month before seeking medical advice. Parents and siblings； 2 sisters and 4 brothers are healthy； they have neither fair skin nor blond hair. One sibling with fair skin and silvery hair was died due to similar disease. The onset of his illness was started at 3 months of age with recurrent chest infections， developed accelerated phase and died at the age of 1.5 year.\n\n【6】On examination she had fair skin and blond hair with photophobia and nystagmus. Her weight and height were at 3d percentile. Chest was clear. Abdominal examination revealed hepatosplenomegaly. Ophthalmic examination showed pale retina and papilledema bilaterally. Lab investigations results were anemia (HB=6)， platelet =27， WBC=6 with neutropenia， ESR=40，\n\n【7】删除10:<u>cited.</u>\n\n【8】Discussion\n\n【9】CHS is a lysosomal disease in which there is aberrant fusion of primary lysosomes with gross enlargement oflysosomes in all tissues. The mutated gene for CHS， lysosomal trafficking regulator is located at chromosome 1q2-q44 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. The exact incidence of CHS is unknown， less than 500 cases have been reported worldwide in the past 20 years通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>.\n\n【10】The pathologic hallmark of CHS is the presence of giant lysosomal granules in the myeloblasts and promyelocytes of the bone marrow and in white blood cells of peripheral blood. The inclusions in melanocytes and keratinocytes consist of clumped melanosomes 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>.\n\n【11】CHS can be diagnosed prenatally by examining a sample of hair from a fetal scalp biopsy or testing leukocytes from a fetal blood sample 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>.\n\n【12】Patients with CHS exhibit hypopigmentation of the skin， hair and eyes， possibly secondary a feedback inhibition of melanin synthesis， which results from accumulation and clumping of melanosomes(Destruction of the giant melanosomes may dilute skin color. However， abnormal packing of normal-sized melanosomes into large lysosome-like structures in the epidermal cells may provide a more likely basis for the hypopigmentation 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. Other features include photophobia and nystagmus， easy bruisability and peripheral neuropathy 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>.\n\n【13】Our casehad fair skin andblondhair sincebirth unlikeherrelative parents and siblings but similar to her died brother， bone marrow and peripheral blood smears showed giant granules in leukocyte precursor cells and leukocyte respectively. Hair examination under light microscope showed large clumped melanosome. She had no bleeding history but had photophobia， nystagmus， pale retina and papilledema most probably is due to infiltration of the optic nerve by lymphocytic cells.\n\n【14】Cell-mediated defect including deficient natural killer cell activity， humoral immune response abnormalities as well as impaired neutrophil chemotaxis and neutropenia in CHS leads to increased susceptibility to infections. Infections are most commonly due to Staphylococcus aureus and B-hemolytic streptococci. Approximately85% of patients develop an accelerated phase which is usually fatal. The widespread visceral infiltration of lymphohistiocytic cells gives rise to fever， jaundice， hepatosplenomegaly， lymphadenopathy， pancytopenia， a tendency to bleed and neurologic changes. Viral infections， especially with Epstein-Barr virus， could be the cause of this lymphomatous phase 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. Most patients undergo a variable period of recurrent infections before going into the accelerated phase通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. Therefore， primary presentation in the accelerated phase in our patient was unuisual.\n\n【15】CHS is considered a fatal disease， death often occurs in the first decade of life as a result of overwhelming infections， hemorrhage or development of the accelerated lymphoma-like phase 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. The treatment of CHS is difficult， and has limited to bone marrow transplantation 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u> although the accelerated phase may respond to etoposide plus systemic steroids and intrathecal methotrexate but the disease relapses invariably 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>.\n\n【16】Conclusion\n\n【17】We report a rare case of CHS， to the best of our knowledge， she is the first case reported from Libya. It is unusual case in that the first presentation was in the accelerated phase at 2 years of age. As bone marrow transplantation is the only solution to the disease， early diagnosis is required before the accelerated phase has developed.

{"seq_id": "add843fd-438f-4d92-a684-c695aaf546b1", "title": null, "text": "【0】Abstract\n\n【1】Giant Phyllodes tumors are fibroepithelial breast neoplasms that pose unique challenges for breast and reconstructive surgeons due to their size and propensity for recurrence. We present a case of a47-year-old female with a rapidly growing giant Phyllodes tumor managed successfully with breast conservation and extreme oncoplastic reconstruction as an alternative to simple mastectomy which is typically recommended for lesions this size. The surgical approach utilized a split Wise pattern reduction on the affected side and standard Wise pattern on the contralateral side for symmetry. Ultimately， a complete resection with negative margins was achieved， along with satisfactory cosmesis and preserved nipple sensation for the patient. This case demonstrates the efficacy of using oncoplastic techniques in the management of a benign giant Phyllodes tumor.\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Phyllodes tumors， which derive their name from their leaf-like appearance on cross-sectional histology (from Greek Phyllon [\"leaf\"])， are fibroepithelial tumors that account for less than 1% of all breast cancers. Though Phyllodes tumors are typically benign， they boast a high recurrence rate with affected margins as an independent risk factor 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Tumor diameter varies widely in size， with12% of them larger than 10 cm and called “giant Phyllodes”通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. These tumors present the surgeon with unique challenges， as wide excision with negative margins is critical to minimize the risk of reoccurrence 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. Oftentimes， mastectomy and immediate reconstruction are the only options， due to tumor size-breast ratio， to ensure negative margins and with favorable aesthetic outcomes.\n\n【4】However， when preservation of native breast tissue is desired， creative surgical strategies must be utilized to achieve curability and cosmesis that is acceptable to the patient. Oncoplastic surgery is a well-established oncologic technique to reshape the remaining breast tissue following wide excisions， to allow a more acceptable cosmetic result. While this technique is routinely used in malignant breast cancers， its application in benign tumors is infrequently reported. We present the case of a 47-year-old female with rapidly enlarging right breast giant Phyllodes tumor managed with wide tumor excision and split Wise reduction with combined contralateral standard reduction for symmetry. To our knowledge， this oncoplastic technique has not previously been reported in the literature for surgical management of a giant Phyllodes tumor.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 47-year-old female with previous diagnosis of right breast fibroadenoma (2.5 cm)， presented with a growing right breast mass that had doubled in size over 6 months.\n\n【7】The examination revealed a multilobulated and mobile right breast mass， occupying entirely the lateral quadrants of the breast， without direct skin involvement or nipple retraction.Diagnostic studies showed a 12 cm right biphasic mass with cyst-like components， in the area of the previously biopsied fibroadenoma， favoring Phyllodes tumor . Due to the patient's strong desire to pursue breast and nipple preservation， a consultation with plastic surgery was recommended， to further discuss reconstructive options.\n\n【8】Patient was ultimately managed with wide local excision of the right breast mass with oncoplastic\n\n【9】Histopathology analysis confirmed the diagnosis of benign Phyllodes tumor， exhibiting elongated epithelial-lined clefts in a largely well-circumscribed mass with focally ill-defined edges， scattered stromal mitoses (<2/10 hpf) and negative margins .\n\n【10】At one week follow up the patient reported preserved nipple sensation bilaterally and a satisfactory cosmetic outcome . Patient remains currently disease-free at 7-month follow up， as confirmed by diagnostic imaging. Patient will be closely monitored with diagnostic imaging every six months for 3 years， to account for the elevated risk of recurrence of the disease.\n\n【11】Discussion\n\n【12】Phyllodes tumors are breast tumors primarily diagnosed in females in the fourth and fifth decades of life， and may be classified as benign， malignant， or borderline 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. With an incidence of 1 in100，000， they account for less than 1% of breast neoplasms 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. Clinical presentation of the Phyllodes tumor includes insidious onset and slow progression of a painless， round， and mobile mass. Positive surgical margins remain the primary risk factor for Phyllodes tumor recurrence， thus NCCN guidelines recommends wide excision with at least 1 cm margins. However， despite the association between narrower surgical margins and heightened local recurrence risk， this is not are not an absolute indication for mastectomy when partial mastectomy fails to achieve a margin width≥1 cm 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. The surgical approach depends largely on the size and location of the mass. Breast cosmesis is inversely proportional to the volume of breast tissue removed， and local deformity results in poorer cosmesis when over10% of the gland is excised 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. Studies have suggested that there is no statistical significance in recurrence rate between conservation and mastectomy so long as excision margins are adequate 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>.\n\n【13】Oncoplastic breast surgery techniques are defined as tumor-specific breast reconstruction methods that apply aesthetically derived breast reduction techniques to the field of breast cancer surgery， allowing for higher volume excision with no aesthetic compromise通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. Preoperative planning is crucial to determine which surgical approach is appropriate， as volume of the initial breast tissue， extent， and location of tissue resection and volume of remaining available glandular tissue will equally weigh into applicability of the techniques通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>.\n\n【14】Breast reduction and mastopexy requires additional meticulous planning to determine the appropriate resection pattern according to tumor size and location. The tumor must be included within the resection pattern. Massetti et al. outline the reduction/mastopexy oncoplastic approach as a four-step procedure consisting of parenchymal excision， parenchymal reshaping， repositioning of the Nipple-Areolar Complex (NAC)， and correction of the contralateral breast for symmetry 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>. The most common pattern used for wide excision with reduction mammoplasty is the wise pattern， which consists of the creation of three triangles with the inferior border删除1换行along the inframammary fold. When the tumors are in areas that do not normally fall within a standard-wise pattern， the pattern can be reconfigured to include the tumor， termed the “split wise”pattern. The lateral and medial triangles are then advanced upward to overlay the tumor， with the medial or lateral vertical limb of the inverted T being“split\"to accommodate the higher position of the triangle 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>.\n\n【15】Extreme oncoplastic techniques (defined as oncoplastic surgery used in women with malignant breast cancers who otherwise require mastectomy) were employed to achieve successful resection and reconstruction. Silverstein was first to utilize the concept of extreme oncoplastic as an alternative to the more radical surgical approaches for breast cancers 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>. Since then， recent studies have demonstrated success in extreme oncoplasty， with a low rate of recurrence， acceptable local-regional control， and higher patient satisfaction 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>. To our knowledge， this is the first case presented in which extreme oncoplastic technique such as split wise reduction，has been employed for the resection and reconstruction of a giant Phyllodes tumor.\n\n【16】In the present report， the technique was the ideal option due to the ability to achieve tumor resection with safe margins， suitable cosmesis and patient desire for breast and nipple preservation. In cases of patients with larger and more ptotic breasts that also require a large volume of tissue replacement， such as the one presented here， techniques such as therapeutic mammoplasties or mastopexy can be employed to remove the area in question and concomitantly reshape the breast 通用删除6(英):<u>[12，13]</u>. When large volume tissue resection is required， care must be taken to reduce the risk of wound healing complications to prevent delay of possible adjuvant treatment， especially in case of malignant Phyllodes. This case demonstrates that， with close collaboration between the breast surgery and plastic surgery teams， oncoplastic techniques can be utilized to achieve completed resection and excellent cosmetic outcomes in patients with giant Phyllodes tumors requiring complex reconstruction.\n\n【17】Conclusion\n\n【18】The giant Phyllodes breast tumors require unique considerations due to challenges in diagnosis and treatment. A high frequency of recurrence makes wide excision margins necessary， resulting in large volume defects and deformities of the breast. Oncoplastic techniques， such as a split wise pattern， should be considered as an alternative to mastectomy as proven to be oncological safe， and with improved cosmetic outcome affecting positive self-image and quality oflife.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

In January 2017， a patient quarreled with the neighbor over a land issue. After a few days， the patient started telling caregivers that the neighbor was tryingtoharm him and was following him. Additionally， the patient also claimed that the co-workers at his workplace were talking badly about him and discussing him， which he used to cross-check with his friends. Despite the friends telling him that it was not true， the patient argued and believed that they were talking about him and plotting against him. Patient had a physical fight with them as well， following which he took leave from work and went to his hometown. After a few days， when parents inquired about his job， he got angry and assaulted them. Subsequently， when the patient went back to work， he fought again with co-workers for trying to harm him due to their suspicion， left the job， and went back home. When he was at home， he was abusive and quarreled with family upon enquiring about his job. The patient’s father’s friends informed the family that the sudden behavioral changes in the patient were probably the result of black magic by the neighbors， secondary to theland issues. Hence， it was advised to take him to the temple and the faith healer in the village. The patient's family took him to various faith healers， and he was less disturbing for a few days after such visits. Symptoms were reported to have worsened close to the full moon days. When the patient became unmanageable， his parents took him to different temples suggested by his relatives. They also involved him in religious ceremonies for a year. Though they spent around 1.5lakhs， the patient’s symptoms were fluctuating and unmanageable. During the symptomatic phase， the patient also demanded to get married because his friends got married. A few neighbors' families pushed this idea to get him married. After a few days of marriage in May 2019， the patient and his wife moved to Bengaluru for employment. Though marriage was consummated， after 3 months， there were frequent quarrels with his wife， including physical abuse. A few days later， the patient suspected his wife of having extramarital affairs. Accusing her of having extramarital affairs. Secondary to this， he used to be physically abusive to the wife. Due to this， the wife went back to her family of origin. Patient biological， social， and occupational functioning was also impaired. With these complaints， he was brought to the hospital and admitted on 8/26/2019.\n\n【14】Family environment before the onset of illness： Family routine usually starts at 6 a.m. in the morning. Mother did all household chores，including preparing meals. Father did outside household work- cleaning the ground and feeding the cattle- and after that he went to the field. All family members used to attend functions together. Every week， the family went to the temple and ate together. Father took the decisions in consultation with the rest of the family， and the family followed them. The interaction among them was cordial. The删除1换行patient was contributing financially as well as in the day-to-day affairs of the family.\n\n【15】Family environment after the illness： The family routine was disrupted. Family stopped attending functions that used to happen in extended family. Routines were disrupted， and everyone appeared confused. The family environment became disorganized， with fights， disagreements， stress， and a high noise level. The brother stopped coming home regularly， the wife went back to her home， and communication within the family became need-based. The patient used to wake up late and did not engage in any family activities， except watching TV， eating， and sleeping. He also stopped going out and said nothing about his life.\n\n【16】Family dynamics\n\n【17】Boundaries： Since there were a lot of arguments， family members involved less as family. Relatives reduced visiting them. There were a lot of talks about his mental illness and that made the family to withdraw from social gatherings. However， there were a very few good neighbors and relatives who supported them. Family tried to keep the fights less and hence spoke less， and accommodated the demands of the patient. Father also started preferring to take support from extended relatives during the crisis and when the patient was unmanageable. Family had to listen to the influencing neighbors and relatives. The decision making was taken over by others. The family took all the suggestions given by others. Family got the patient married because of the influence of the neighbors and relatives.\n\n【18】Leadership and decision making-everybody took their own decisions： More confused and chaotic as the family environment kept changing with the symptoms of the patient. Majority of the decisions were taken by the younger brother and father supported it.\n\n【19】Role structure andfunctioning： Fatherperformedthe instrumental role while mother performed expressive role. Father and younger brother were the primary bread winners of the family. Father accompanied patient for the treatment everywhere and hence his role to contribute financially was affected. Nobody else took the charge of caregiving and he was tired of being with the patient. The younger brother took charge of the situation and started contributing more， mother continued to take care of the household affairs.\n\n【20】Communication： Conversation among the family members decreased. Patient communicated his needs through the mother to father. Brother and patient did not communicate at all. Patient spoke only to the mother. Both parents communicated to each other. The quarrels and arguments of the patient increased the noise level at home.\n\n【21】Reinforcement： Thetfamilyyexercised variousformI：SCof reinforcement when the family had young children. However， father used praise and support with patient to maintain self-care and hygiene. Though many times， appreciations were not said and given， acknowledgements of roles were evident.\n\n【22】Family rituals： Meeting together， talking to each other at home， visiting relatives together， eating together， celebrating festivals at home， and going for fair， were almost stopped. They also stopped visiting the temple as a family but they continued individually.\n\n【23】Cohesiveness： Wife separated from him. There were no efforts initiated to work with the marriage. Though the brother took charge of financially supporting the family， he reduced visiting them because of the fights.\n\n【24】Table 1： Psychiatric and psychosocial diagnosis.\n\n| F & Z Category  | Diagnosis  |\n| --- | --- |\n| F.20  | Schizophrenia  |\n| Z65  | Problem related to employment  |\n| Z60  | Problem related to social environment  |\n| Z60.4  | Social exclusion and rejection  |\n| Z63.0  | Problems in relation spouse with partner  |\n\n【26】Family development stage six： Family with lunching young adults 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>.\n\n【27】Adaptive patterns and coping strategies： The whole family was not able to deal with the crisis well. They though， sought help from others， it did not help them. They had difficulties to selecting the best care for the patient. They were carried away with the demands of the patient and encouragement of neighbors in getting the patient married. They did not disclose about the mental illness to the wife’s family. Only during the admission of the patient， wife was contacted.\n\n【28】Social support system： Family had adequate primary and Tertiary support； however， secondary support was inadequate.\n\n【29】Social analysis and diagnosis\n\n【30】Patient is hailing from a family that is rooted in religious beliefs， rural background and healthy parental and sibling subsystems. Members had healthy interaction among them； they were supportive to each other， shared healthy communication and was a cohesive unit. Family had adequate rituals to be together. However， changes started seen after the patient became mentally ill. History reveals that， the interaction of family members affected， family members involved less as family and withdrawal from socializing. Family followed magico-religious beliefs and practices its hindered early treatment of the patient it's impacted the family functioning. Father started preferring to take support from extended relatives. During the crisis and when the patient was unmanageable， the family system started changing especially，the boundary system becoming diffused， leadership changing， communication pattern becoming need based， and involvement of several others in the family affairs. Family environment became， more confused， stressful， conflictual and chaotic. Illness also affected the decision-making role of the patient and the younger brother became more powerful in decision making. Father had Care giver burden role in the family. Patient also went through a marriage without disclosing about his illness that has also contributed in aggravating his condition as well as affecting the wife and marriage. The whole family was not able to deal with the crisis well， and they did not receive adequate guidance which prolonged the psychiatric consultation，impact of mental illness of the patient. The pathological family situations or disorganizations could be attributed to the impact of mental illness .\n\n【31】Psychosocial interventions\n\n【32】Goals and interyentions：\n\n【33】To establish rapport with the patient and family\n\n【34】Psychoeducation\n\n【35】Supportive psychotherapy\n\n【36】Family Intervention\n\n【37】Normalizing the family routine\n\n【38】Expressed Emotions\n\n【39】Addressed Caregiver burden\n\n【40】Pre discharge counselling\n\n【41】Intervention Offered\n\n【42】Psychoeducation： Assessed the knowledge of the patient and caregivers about etiology， treatment， and prognosis and provided information about etiology， symptoms of schizophrenia， the importance of medication， and treatment compliance. Discussed relapse and early signs of relapse. Dealing with stress today while managing a person with schizophrenia improving insight into illness handling expressed emotions and improving communication enhancing adaptive coping to deal with persistent or residual symptoms.\n\n【43】Supportive psychotherapy\n\n【44】Supportive psychotherapeutic work initiated with father who was the primary care giver.\n\n【45】Alowed ventilation enhanced his psychological strength by addressing his worries and concerns. Guidance is given about the available treatments and the patient’s recovery process. Provided a strong foundation for him. The therapist appreciated his efforts in accompanying the patient. Validated his emotional experiences brought other family members for therapy and made their roles clear in caregiving. Gave him time away from caregiving. Discussed his need for his space and routines to be normalized.\n\n【46】Family interventions\n\n【47】Normalize the family routine： discussed with and facilitated insights with the family about the disadvantages of focusing on the patient's illness as the center of their lives. The long duration of illness and its potential effect on members potential stress-related issues in family's potential perception by the patient as a burden to his family encouraged them to resume the daily routines that were present before the illness； helped them to make a daily routine that included time for leisure； celebration of festivals； birthdays； marriage ceremonies； family time and advised them to attend to the needs of other family members.\n\n【48】Addressed expressed emotions： identified criticality from the brother and father 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>.\n\n【49】Explained the effect ofexpressed emotions on mental illness. There was discussion about the father's and brothers emotional reactions to the patient's symptoms. Validated their emotional responses and educated them about the role they play in relapses. Helped them understand these reactions as normal for such experiences. However， they needed handling because it speeds the recovery. Once they were able to relate to the patient as a person with illness， their attitude and behavior changed. We appreciated their understanding and changes.\n\n【50】Addressing the family caregiver burden： As the family belongs to a lower socioeconomic class and faces lots of financial issues， it adds to the family’s caregiver burden issues， which adds to the family’s burden. They followed the magico-religious practices and spent more than one lakh rupees on these practices. The patient's father was staying with the patient in the hospital， while other family members were less involved due to other commitments. The caregiver burden was addressed with the father， and the therapist encouraged the other family members to get involved in the patients treatment， which reduced the caregiver burden in the family.\n\n【51】Pre-discharge counselling： The emphasis was given to improving删除1换行the client's treatment adherence. Previous sessions were summarized. Points on identifying signs of relapse and seeking immediate help were discussed. Support was assured to the patient and wife from the hospital through follow-up sessions. Emergency care locations were given locally. Refers to DMHP Tumkur Karnataka. Questions related to discharge were addressed.\n\n【52】Follow up (Telephonic)\n\n【53】On regular medication under supervision.\n\n【54】Patient is helping father in agriculture work\n\n【55】family is very supportive and no expressed emotions reported\n\n【56】Wife is living with him and in laws.

The patient presented a long time， velvety pigmentation on the neck and armpits that had been classified as acanthosis nigricans related to her genetic disease . However， on her annual clinical assessment， she complained about the appearance of new asymptomatic， hyperpigmented， confluent skin lesions with reticulated edges.

No response to any topical depigmentation was observed.\n\n【11】Wood's light examination and direct Potassium Hydroxide (KOH) examination were negative. A biopsy of the cervical region was performed， which revealed epidermal papillomatosis with orthokeratosishyperkeratosiswithout acantholysis， associated withbasal melaninhyperpigmentation.

Evaluation of pancreatic enzymes did not show a constant trend， and had 3 times microscopic hematuria， an obvious pancreatic inflammation was observed in CT scans. Patient was diagnosed with acute necrotizing pancreatitis. There was no definite cause for patient’s pancreatitis， except for the recent use of herbal drug (containing Ginsengcompounds) for weight gain that taking it 10 days before the onset of symptoms has started and then stopped. Since the patient's symptom gradually decreased by stopping the drug， probably drug-induced pancreatitis is to be present.\n\n【2】Keywords： Acute Necrotizing Pancreatitis； Ginseng Compounds； Hematuria\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Pancreatitis is a pancreatic inflammation that including two types， acute and chronic 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Acute Pancreatitis (AP) includes a wide range of diseases， from its low-risk symptoms to a fulminant process with multiple organ damage and high mortality 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>.\n\n【5】The incidence of AP has increased over the past 20 years 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. Common symptoms of AP include nausea and vomiting， and the abdominal pain that mostly spreads to the back. AP has different causes， some of which include： gallstones， alcohol consumption， hypercalcemia， hyperlipidemia， idiopathic， autoimmune， and anatomic (pancreas divisum)， infection， tumors and drug-induced. AP can be recurrent. Multiple and recurrent attacks of AP can lead to chronic pancreatitis， which can ultimatelylead to pancreatic insufficiency. AP has various complications， one of the most severe complications is necrotizing pancreatitis， which is due to tissue ischemic and necrosis and has high mortality 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Here we describe the case of a young woman with acute necrotizing pancreatitis induced by Ginseng compounds administration. Necrotizing pancreatitis has a very poor prognosis and is associated with high mortality (15%)， which， if infected， can reach up to 30% to 39%， which is the major cause of mortality 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. Intervention is generally required for infected pancreatic necrosis and less commonly in patients with sterile necrosis who are symptomatic (gastric or duodenal outlet or biliary obstruction). Fever， elevated white blood cell count， and abdominal pain suggest infection of this fluid， and percutaneous aspiration is confirmatory. Percutaneous drainage and IV administration of antibiotics should be instituted if infection is present.\n\n【6】Case Presentation\n\n【7】The patient is a 29-year-old Iranian woman that sent to Sina Hospital， Tehran University for further evaluation and treatment from Ilam. The patient’s problems began with the fever and chills intermittently， and then 2 days later， suddenly suffered abdominal pain in the epigastrium， which was persistent and progressive， gradually spreading to the entire abdomen and not radiating anywhere. The patient’s pain was worse with eating and it was not associated with defecation and2 days later， the patient developed another symptom. The symptoms included： non-bloody watery diarrhea， nausea and vomiting， and anorexia， and during the last 通用删除7(英):<u>(3-9)</u> months weight loss was 15kg. There is no history of this problem in the past.\n\n【8】Her past medical history was otherwise negative and she had no allergies. She denied alcohol intake or tobacco use. She has a two-time history of cesarean section， which was last two years ago.\n\n【9】The only drug used recently was weight gain that contains Ginseng compounds that only consume 10 of them and discontinued with the onset of symptoms.\n\n【10】In the family history， cousin's aunt， he has pulmonary tuberculosis.\n\n【11】On examination she was febrile (T=39.5)， with a heart rate of 140beats/min， blood pressure was 100/70 mmHg and respiratory rate of18/min.\n\n【12】Abdominal examination revealed tenderness and generalized rebound tenderness in epigastrium. There were non-palpable masses and bowel sounds were normal. Lung examination had bilateral rales.\n\n【13】In Ilam， a CT scan is performed for the patient， in which the free fluid in the abdomen was reported， with a suspicion of perforated appendicitis，patient was under laparotomy that there was an obvious as cites and seeding that the drain was embedded and the omentum and the multiple point sampling that has been examined twice by the pathologist， which has not been malignancy， also， the sample was examined once by a pathologist in Tehran， which was not been malignancy .\n\n【14】After surgery， 2 days were treated with Imipenem， the patient's leukocytosis was 25000， and bilateral pleural effusion was found and the respiratory distress was found， so transferred to the ICU， and in consultation with the professor of Surgery in Sina Hospital in Tehran has provided double-sided chest tube and has been sent to Tehran by Intubation.\n\n【15】The patient was admitted to Tehran for about 17 days in ICU， who had 10 days of intubation and had 5 days of C-pap， and was extubated and transferred to the ward after 2 days， during which time she was treated with antibiotics. The patient's leukocytosis was from25000 to 13000， and transferred to the ward.\n\n【16】According to the history and physical examination findings， differential diagnosis was made for the patient， which was done to achieve the final diagnosis of paraclinical measures； including， complete lab tests， abdominopelvic ultrasound， CXR， CT scan， endoscopy， colonoscopy， and EUS were performed.\n\n【17】Complete Blood Count (CBC diff) was at its onset of 24000leukocytosis with 80% PMN， rising progressively in the course of the disease，and the highest level of 25000， which was found to belowered删除1换行with antibiotic therapy and reached 6160 on the day of discharge.\n\n【18】Patient's differential diagnosis including：Rheumatologic disorders， TB， brucellosis， malaria and in general infectious diseases， lymphoma，Imalignancy， pancreatic dysfunction (necrotizing pancreatitis， pancreatic cancer， andautoimmune P pancreatitis)， thyroid disorders.\n\n【19】For rheumatologic disorders， rheumatology tests were performed completely， all of which were negative. Also， rheumatologic examinations (lymphadenopathy， hair pull test) were performed， which was negative. The patient has no symptoms such as arthritis， arthralgia， oral ulcer and malar rash， hair loss， rash， dry eye， dry mouth， photophobia，psychosis， seizure， and the history of abortion.\n\n【20】PPD test was performed for tuberculosis according to positive ADA 通用删除7(英):<u>(7，4，32)</u>， which was negative and the patient was treated with anti-TB drugs (INH， Ethambutol) for 14 days with an infectious professor's advice， with no change in the patient's symptoms. The patient had no symptoms including： coughing， hemoptysis， night sweats.\n\n【21】Brucellosis tests were negative. For malaria PBS， it was normal. Viral markers were negative.\n\n【22】Forlymphoma and malignancy， tumor markers were checked to be negative， did not have lymphadenopathy and night sweats， and also with suspicion of gastrointestinal cancers， inflammatory bowel disease， endoscopy and colonoscopy were performed. Colonoscopy was normal. Endoscopy was highly suggestive for gastric cancer which was taken biopsy， was chronic gastritis and ulceration， and malignancy was rejected， due to in consistency of endoscopic findings with pathological outcomes， endoscopy was performed again， which， as before， was suspected of stomach cancer， and biopsy， showed only删除1换行a ulceration .\n\n【23】About pancreatic dysfunction， amylase and lipase， liver tests， albumin， and urine analysis were checked several times， the procedure was as follows， and the microscopic hematuria was present in three examinations. Other study performed for the evaluation of the pancreas was CT scan ， which included pancreatic inflammation that CT scan with pancreatic cut was performed for a more accurate evaluation which revealed a pancreatic tail and body inflammation and brief duct dilatation. According to the patient’s CT scan results， EUS was performed， with a normal pancreas reported， and an emphasis on the atypical Crohn’s disease . Thyroid and renal tests were normal.\n\n【24】Discussion\n\n【25】The most common causes of AP are gallstones alcohol and hyperlipidemia respectively， however， nearly 20% of cases it is idiopathic 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. The patient described in this report did not drink alcohol and did not have gallstone and had normal liver function test， and normal lipid profile. Thus excluding other etiologies for the AP that in this case was drug-induced (Ginseng compounds).\n\n【26】The diagnosis of AP requires the patient to present with abdominal pain consistent with AP (acute onset of a severe constant epigastric pain which often radiates through to the mid back) and the elevation of serum amylase or lipase (>3 times upper limit of normal). Imaging (usually by contrast enhanced CT scanning) is only required for the diagnosis of AP when these diagnostic criteria are not met 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>.\n\n【27】Recovery from AP is now expected， with mortalityless than 10%， which reflects improvements in the treatment of complications and intensive care management.\n\n【28】A third of patients with AP develop complications and a quarter of these will die of them. Severe acute pancreatitis is associated with删除1换行fluid collections and tissue necrosis in and around the pancreas. In this case complication of acute pancreatitis was necrosis.\n\n【29】Necrosis increases the morbidity and mortality risk of AP because of its association with organ failure and infectious complications.\n\n【30】As such， patients with necrotizing pancreatitis may need admission to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU)， nutritional support， antibiotics， and radiologic， endoscopic， or surgical interventions.\n\n【31】Nearly 20% of patients with AP develop necrotizing pancreatitis， ofwhich approximately 25% to 70% will develop to infected necrosis通用删除6(英):<u>[7，8]</u>.\n\n【32】Necrotizing pancreatitis is a complication of AP. It may happen when AP is untreated， or treatment is ineffective.\n\n【33】No predisposing factors have been validated to increase the risk of development of pancreatic necrosis， however， the most common etiology of necrotizing pancreatitis is gallstones (40% to 48%)， followed by alcohol consumption (24% to 27%).\n\n【34】Two thirds of necrotic pancreatic collections are sterile and will resolve with conservative management， while the remainder will become infected and will require further intervention.\n\n【35】Initial management of necrotizing pancreatitis is a supportive treatment that includes： fluid resuscitation， pain control， resting the gastrointestinaltract 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>.\n\n【36】In the setting of necrotizing pancreatitis， the necrosis most commonly involves both pancreatic and peripancreatic fat tissue(75% to 80%).\n\n【37】An early contrast-enhanced Computed Tomography (CT) may fail to reveal necrosis within the first few days； however， a contrast enhanced CT after the first week revealing non enhancing pancreatic parenchyma is considered to be pancreatic necrosis.\n\n【38】Effectiveness of prophylactic antibiotic and antifungal therapy， which prevents infected necrosis， has been questionable. Recent studies， conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of this therapy，have， almost， proven its weaknesses. This therapy is no more recommended by the American College of Gastroenterology and the Infectious Diseases Society of America no longer recommends it. In patients with concomitant cholangitis or extra pancreatic infection， this therapy， is the only case that can be is recommended to be given 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>.\n\n【39】If a patient is predicted to have severe pancreatitis or not expected to resume oral intake within 5 to 7 days， early enteral nutrition is recommended. Enteral nutrition most commonly involves bedside or endoscopic placement of a nasojejunal feeding tube and collaboration with a nutritionist to determine protein caloric requirements 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>.\n\n【40】However， for patients with higher rates of infection， multi organ dysfunction and failure， and death， total parenteral nutrition is suggested instead of enteral nutrition 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>.\n\n【41】The first-line intervention for acute necrotizing pancreatitis is intravenous hydration with isotonic and pH-balanced crystalloid solution such as Lactated Ringer's 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>.\n\n【42】Having provided no supportive data， recent studies have proven that the use of prophylactic antibiotics in cases of severe AP cannot be an effective solution. For patients with severe AP complications， organ failure， and mortality， early enteral nutrition should be the supplanted medication 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>.\n\n【43】This case is an atypical presentation of AP with a severe attack leadingtopancreatic necrosis. We experienced a case of AP associated with normal serum enzyme levels. Patient was diagnosed based on clinical and radiological evidence. She was successfully treated with intravenous fluids， antibiotic therapy， and radiologic external percutaneous drainage with clinical and laboratory improvement. The importance of this case report is the unlikely presentation of AP. We believe that more research is needed to determine the exact proportion of AP patients who first present with normal serum lipase， since similar cases have been seen in case reports.\n\n【44】Conclusion\n\n【45】Patients with AP are susceptible to a wide spectrum of diseases：alcoholabuse，cholelithiasis， infection，lesions，tumors，hypercalcemia，删除1换行hyperlipidemia， and drug-induced. These diseases range from mild self-limiting symptoms to a fulminant process with multiple organ failure and high mortality. The etiologic factors contributing to AP include a wide range with some being rare. Cholelithiasis or sustained alcohol abuse is the factor which attributes to， approximately， 80% of cases12-14.\n\n【46】Having stopped the drugs， the symptoms resolved in this patient； this shows that the drug-induced pancreatitis is probably present in her 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>.

Therefore， there is a need to objectively assess gait performance in daily-life conditions in order to complement CGA， thus enhancing therapeutic choices for children with CP based on real-life data 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>.\n\n【16】The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the related changes in the gait pattern of the child after orthopedic surgery， providing quantitative data on gait parameters in the most appropriate set-up (outside the laboratory environment) for gait assessment of children with CP. Wearable inertial sensor was used to fulfill this need.\n\n【17】Methods\n\n【18】This study was carried out in compliance with the regulating guidelines and norms regulating research involving human subjects stipulated by the National Health Board in October 1996， and it received approval from the Human Research Ethics Committee of University under process number 2.424.085. The patient signed a statement of informed consent declaring that he was aware that the procedure to which he would receive was experimental and free of charge.\n\n【19】A male child diagnosed with spastic cerebral palsy aged 12 years(weight： 48 kg， height： 1.64 m)， functionally classified with level GMFCS II， was referred to surgical procedure of bilateral tenotomy of tendon of gastronomies muscles due to increased spasticity in the plantar flexor muscles， causing the child to walk on tiptoes. After the surgical procedure， by medical recommendation， the patient used plaster in the distal lower limbs for one month. The patient删除1换行performed physiotherapy after the removal of the plaster， by his own physiotherapist， by twelve sessions， three times a week， for four weeks. Each session lasted 60 minutes and the treatment applied to the child was based on conventional techniques， such as stretching， strengthening and proprioceptive training and gait.\n\n【20】The spatio-temporal parameters were obtained with a wireless inertial detection device (G-Sensor， BTS Bioengineering s.p.a， Italy). This new wearable system based on inertial sensors and a dedicated algorithm for precise and accurate assessment of spatiotemporal gait parameters has been described and validated for gait analysis in children with CP通用删除6(英):<u>[11，12]</u>.\n\n【21】The portable G sensor is a wireless system of inertial sensors for human motion analysis. The sensors are controlledbya data recording unit (up to 16 elements) by a zigbee type radio communication. Each sensor has 62 mmx36mmx 16 mm dimensions， weighing 60 g，and consists of a three-axis accelerometer (maximum scale ±6g)， a 3-axis gyroscope (full scale ±300°/s)， and a magnetometer of 3 axes (full scale ±6 Gauss). This device is calibrated with acceleration of gravity immediately after manufacture. For this work， only one device was used that collected the data at a sampling frequency of 50 Hz.\n\nThegait analysisS WaIsSperformedinhospitaal a and 1 clinic environment， pre and postoperative (after 1 month) and after 4weeks of physiotherapy， with the child walking a single time along a 15 m corridor at a self-selected speed and way more natural. In order for the device to acquire gait values it was necessary for the patient to perform 5 full gait cycles of gait on each leg to be recorded. The distinction of the right and left legs was recorded through the oscillations of accelerometers， gyroscopes and magnetometers during the gait analysis. The inertial sensor was attached in the lower lumbar level (covering the L4-L5 inter-vertebral space) with a semi-elastic neoprene belt. The device acquired acceleration values (along three删除1换行orthogonal axes： anteroposterior，mid-lateral and super-inferior) that were transmitted in real time by bluetooth to a PC and processed with dedicated software (BTS Bioengineering G-Studio) to derive the following parameters：|删除段之间换行|1.

Cadence： number of steps per minute (min-1 steps)；\n\n4. Position and duration of the balance phase： expressed as a percentage of the gait cycle， representing the ratio of a gait cycle involving foot support (from the heel to the foot with the same foot) and balance of the lower limb；|删除段之间换行|5. Duration of the double support： the duration of the support phase in both feet， expressed as a percentage of the walking cycle.\n\n【26】6. Pelvic angulation (inclination， obliquity and rotation).\n\n【27】Results\n\n【28】The results of the experimental tests are summarized in Tables 1and 2\n\n【29】Discussion\n\n【30】In this study， we investigated the related changes in the gait pattern of the child after orthopedic surgery using an inertial sensor. The spatio-temporal parameters found in pre-surgical and post-physiotherapeutic wasn’t well within normal ranges for their age and sex 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>. The small variation between the left and right mean values probably occurred due to the asymmetry of the lower limbs found in the patient during his inspection (left leg 89 cm， right leg 86 cm). However， this may lead to further investigation of each experiment on foot to find out the source of variation. The spatio-temporal parameters found immediately after the surgicalintervention indicate a decrease in gait quality， which is already expected in the postoperative surgical period 通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u>.\n\n【31】The displacements for tilt， obliquity and pelvic rotation and range of motion were maintained with minimal variations in relation to pelvic obliquity. The greatest variations were found in the pelvic tilt and rotation displacements .\n\n【32】The treatment ofthe child with cerebral palsy should be performed by a multidisciplinary team. The orthopedist and physiotherapist are responsible for preventing and correcting lower limb deformities， contributing to the patient being as independent as possible in his Activities of Daily Living (ADL) and in his locomotion. The results showed that walking ability was not improved after surgery and rehabilitation compared to the preoperative situation. From our point of view， this study may demonstrate the need for the follow-up of physical therapy after the orthopedic surgical procedure for a long term period. Assisting the patient in establishing motor control in the new biomechanical alignment provided by the surgical procedure and promoting better physical fitness are major goals of postoperative physical therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>.\n\n【33】The inertial sensor gait analysis has been shown to be a useful tool for rehabilitation and treatment interventions， detecting some删除1换行measures of relevant results， such as kinematic parameters and functional alterations， which are insufficient at conventional physical examination. Some limitations of this study should be recognized：since we wanted to replicate a realistic use of the inertial sensor in a outside the laboratory environment setting， and extend the possibility of using portable and user-friendly solutions， obtaining different types of data acquisition， we recruited only one patient before，during and after their surgical intervention and physiotherapeutic. Second， the study evaluated only general gait parameters. It would have been interesting to discuss kinematics of the knee and ankle (since the surgery was a tenotomy of the gastronomies tendon)， but it was not possible to detect these kinematic parameters with the device used by this study. Future studies should investigate larger groups of patients with the same disability， providing more detailed information on kinematic gait parameters in these individuals.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

Some cases are also associated with erosions， crusting， hair， and nail changes 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. Most commonly， it is due to generalization of pre-existing dermatoses (such as psoriasis or atopic dermatitis)， drug reactions， or cutaneous T-cell lymphoma， but identification of the underlying disease process represents one of the most complex challenges in dermatology 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. We present the case of a patient affected by multiple myeloma who developed erythroderma.\n\n【6】Case Presentation\n\n【7】A 66-year-old male with a medical history of multiple myeloma developed an erythematous rash spread over the entire skin surface， with scaling and itching. Dermatologic examination revealed extensive pink patches with feathering edges and large scaling on head， neck， trunk， and limbs . He did not report previous dermatoses or known allergies， but a history of xerosis. Regarding multiple myeloma， he achieved Very Good Partial Response (VGPR) after four cycles of Bortezomib-Thalidomide-Dexamethasone (VTD) induction therapy followed by Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation (ASCT). Laboratory tests showed eosinophilia (5500/mm)， which has progressively increased for two months， until reaching a peak concomitantly with erythroderma. The previous month， acyclovir was replaced by valganciclovir for a cytomegalovirus reactivation (28000 copies/mL). Current blood tests found the presence of cytomegalovirus (481copies/mL)andhuman herpesvirus-7(90 copies/mL). Thepatient was started on oralprednisone and hydroxyzine， associated with topical steroids and emollients， but one month later erythroderma with lamellar scaling， intense itching and eosinophilia persisted， and thus a skin biopsy was performed. A week later， the patient developed fever， and blood cultures resulted positive for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus casseliflavus， therefore he received intravenous daptomycin in combination with piperacillin-tazobactam. Following the resolution of symptoms， all unnecessary drugs were suspended and intravenous 1 mg/kg/day dose of methylprednisolone was started， resulting in gradual improvement of erythroderma and eosinophilia. On the third day，\n\n【8】Discussion\n\n【9】Erythroderma is a condition caused by several etiologies that result\n\n【10】The color of the skin can vary from pink-red to red-brown to deep red-purple， and pruritus is observed in up to 90% of patients 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. The onset of scaling is typically seen 2 to 6 days after the onset of the erythema 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，2]</u>. It varies in size and color， depending upon the stage of the erythroderma and nature of the underlying disease： In more acute phases scales are usually large and crusted， whereas in chronic states they tend to be smaller and drier 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. In cases of pre-existing dermatoses， nail changes may precede the erythroderma (e.g. pits in psoriasis or horizontal ridging in atopic dermatitis)， whereas others develop subsequently， for example they can become thick， dry， and brittle 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，2]</u>. Colonization of the skin with Staphylococcus aureus is common and can lead to secondary cutaneous infections as well as删除1换行bacteremia 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>.\n\n【11】A detailed history is crucial for diagnosing the underlying etiology： Patients must be asked about pre-existing medical conditions， allergies， medications， and skin diseases (atopic or other dermatitis， psoriasis， etc) 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. The presentation of erythroderma in individuals without a pre-existing skin disease is more common with drug-induced erythroderma or malignancy； compared with other causes， the onset of erythroderma secondary to medication is typically more sudden and rapidly progressing， the resolution is often quicker， and additional manifestations may be observed， like fever and peripheral eosinophilia， along with facial swelling， hepatitis， myocarditis， and allergic interstitial nephritis： This constellation of findings is referred to as DRESS (Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms) 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. Our patient reported no pre-existing dermatoses or allergies； he was recently started on valganciclovir， but there was no improvement despite its suspension， and eosinophilia already existed before. Furthermore， mites could not be identified from skin scraping examined microscopically， and a screening test panel for associated auto antibodies was negative， thus we performed a 4-mm punch biopsy. Histological examination showed parakeratosis， spongiosis， vacuolization in the basal layer， exocytosis1of lymphocytes and granulocytes， inflammatory infiltrate in the dermis (with predominantly CD4+ T lymphocytes， histiocytes and granulocytes， but a moderate amounts of ezsinophils) and edema of the dermis.\n\n【12】Histological findings were compatible with1paraneoplastic erythroderma， idiopathic erythroderma and atopic dermatitis 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Tests for multiple myeloma showed no evidence of disease activity， so we excluded this possibility. Erythroderma is labeled as idiopathic in9% to 47% of cases (this group is composed mainly of older adult men with a chronic and relapsing course of pruritic erythroderma) and longitudinal monitoring of patients with idiopathic erythroderma may reveal undiagnosed cutaneous T-celllymphoma 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>，therefore we performed a second biopsy to enhance the accuracy ofhistopathologic diagnoses， but it excluded again a lymphoproliferative disease and showed a non-specific inflammatory pattern. Acute lesions of atopic dermatitis show spongiosis， intracellular edema in the lower epidermis， exocytosis of lymphocytes， a perivascular infiltrate of lymphocytes and macrophages around vessels of the superficial plexus， mast cells in different stages of degranulation， and occasional eosinophils 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. The presence of dermal eosinophilic infiltrates is a characteristic histological feature observed in skin biopsies from patients with erythrodermic atopic dermatitis 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. The diagnosis of atopic dermatitis remains clinical， as there is currently no reliable biomarker that can distinguish the disease from other entities： An elevated total and/or allergen-specific serum IgE level is not present in about 20% of affected individuals 通用删除6(英):<u>[5，6]</u> as well as in our patient. Of all the existing diagnostic criteria， none are considered wholly or mutually exclusive in the diagnosis of atopic dermatitis， which remains prerogative of the clinician 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. According to the 2-Plus-1model  proposed by Reynolds et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>， our patient had two essential features (acute eczema and pruritus) and one important feature (xerosis)， without any exclusionary features of atopic dermatitis.\n\n【13】Furthermore， the onset of erythroderma was associated with a Cytomegalovirus reactivation twice， and the second time antiviral therapy resulted in improvement of erythema and itching. We删除1换行believe that cytomegalovirus might have been a trigger of the cell-mediated immune response that unleashed an erythrodermic onset of atopic dermatitis. Triggers (e.g. viral infections， food allergens， cosmetics， fragrance， weather， and other causes) are the leading cause of an atopic dermatitis exacerbation， and avoidance of triggers is an important mechanism patients can use to control disease activity通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. Hafez et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u> found that active subclinical cytomegalovirus infection is more frequent in patients with atopic dermatitis and may have possible immunomodulatory role in the etiopathogenesis， even if it is not related to disease severity. Docke et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u> suggest that active， subclinical cytomegalovirus infection is more frequent in patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis and may have immunopathological relevance 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>. In-spite of the high prevalence of cytomegalovirus infection and its potent immunomodulatory activities， the relation of cytomegalovirus to atopic dermatitis is still poorly understood 通用删除6(英):<u>[8，10]</u>.\n\n【14】Conclusion\n\n【15】Erythroderma is a dermatologic emergency that could necessitate hospital admission， therefore determining the underlying etiology is crucial， and any external aggravating factors must be eliminated. Specifically， any potential drugs inducing erythroderma must be stopped. Early diagnosis is paramount as it allows early treatment and prevention oferythroderma-associated morbidity and mortality. It is very important to recognize atopic dermatitis as a cause of erythroderma， especially in a patient with late onset of the disease and no personal or familial history of allergic diseases. Further studies are necessary to clarify the relationship between atopic dermatitis and cytomegalovirus infection.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

The rate of and associated factors for psychosocial problems among child with meningitis was assessed in this study 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>.\n\n【17】Comparable to other childhood illnesses， the impact of meningitis is not limited to the child删除1换行cited.删除2换行experiencing it， but affects all family members. The primary caregiver， caregivers of sick children lost half their daily productivity for an outpatient visit and a full day's productivity for each day a child was hospitalized. According to studies， a caregiver’s daily productivity was assumed to equal the daily minimum wage 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>.\n\n【18】The child meningitis had long-term effects on family members'health， particularly affecting the likelihood of family members reporting anxiety and depression. These effects extended beyond a single close family member. These findings suggest that vaccinating against meningitis will bring significant health benefits not just to those that might have contracted the illness but also to their family networks 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>.\n\n【19】In comparable to other literature，in this case studythe mother was very concerned about her child's current situation and future health. She also very worried about costs of hospitalization，medication costs and her lost income as she spent more of her time with the children.\n\n【20】The family members experience at least one after-effect from meningitis in the survivor. The most commonly reported after-effects were behavioral or emotional problems (28%)， mild/moderate learning disabilities (16%)， scarring or tissue damage (14%)， balance problems (13%)， and speech or language problems (11%) that needs intervention as comprehensive care for caregivers 通用删除6(英):<u>[4，5]</u>.\n\n【21】In addition， bacterial meningitis often causes hearing loss and is fatal in 5% to 40% of children and 20% to 50% of adults despite treatment with adequate antibiotics. This increases burdens on the caregiver， which mayadversely affect their mental health. In contrast， the family's mental health may affect the development or outcomes of the long-term sequels of meningitis. The main meningeal sequels were hearing loss which accounts about 22% in child after survivors of meningitis 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>.\n\n【22】Some literature recommends rehabilitative care for the child with severe hearing impairment was defined as the absence of an observable response at ≥ 70 dBnHL (decibel above normal adults Hearing Level) and moderate impairment was defined as no response at 50 dBnHL to 60 dBnHL hearing aids throughout their life 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>.\n\n【23】In addition to this hearing loss， Neurological sequela occurs in a substantial amount of patients following bacterial meningitis. Most frequently reported sequela are focal neurological deficits， cognitive impairment and epilepsy which were more associated with pneumococcal and meningococcal meningitis 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>.\n\n【24】Similar to the literature， the child in this case study also has the clinical manifestation of neurological sequels like hemiparesis， deviation of face to the right side and unable to close her eye lids.\n\n【25】According to some literature reveals that children with meningitis caused by P. pneumonae that persist to adolescent also develops or has a greater risk to develop intellectual impairment as compared with normal children 通用删除6(英):<u>[9，10]</u>.\n\n【26】Similar to other literature in this case study the mother was more feels anxious for her child future and burden encountered. The mother was very concerned about the child's future health， the burden of giving care along of her life and as her child still didn’t walk by herself after 1 month hospitalization.\n\n【27】Nursing Implication\n\n【28】Most of reviewed literatures applaud that， the assessment and删除1换行care of the children with bacterial meningitis was not only focused on physical aspects but also psychosocial aspects of the child & family as it has positive impact on the child's outcome. Because meningitis after Pneurnococcus preurnonae and HIB bacteria were has enormous after effect. Even though several studies recommend holistic approach of nursing care， the psychosocial aspects of the patient care of a patient with meningitis & other acute illness with chronic sequels was not commonly practiced in this set up. Due to this， many patients with meningitis were suffering from psychosocial problems. As a nurse， it important to understand such problems， I have tried to implement psychosocial interventions such as reassurance， counseling about how the patient lives with disease sequels， for the family and managing acute and chronic complication by regular exercise， adherence to medication， preventing infection， promoting positive self-image， helping child and mother to cope with social anxiety and stigmatization. Finally as recommendation， all staff members and caregivers should incorporate psychosocial aspect of meningitis patients on the assessment and care activities in order to improve the wellbeing of the patient.\n\n【29】Reflection\n\n【30】From this case study I was very notable & get new knowledge. As bacterial meningitis has a significant effect on individual's psychology， social & financially as well. In addition as a nurse we need to know &react on psychosocial influences of meningitis on the patient & his/her family and should intervene as early as possible.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

Thoracoabdominal flap was chosen as a method of closing the defect with consideration of its effectiveness and good results.\n\n【8】Case Presentation\n\n【9】通用间距删除-1:<u>Citation：</u>\n\n【10】A 42-years-old woman came to our clinic with complains of a lump that reappeared in the right chest for 1 month ago. The lump appeared on the surgical scar initially measured 1 cm ×1 cmx1cm and rapidly growing in 1 month to 10 cmx10 cmx8 cm. The lump is painful， ulcerated， and bleeds.\n\n【11】From her history， the patient complained of a right breast lump appearing initially four years ago. The lump was located under the skin with enlarged veins on its surface， slowly growing and there were no ulcers on the surface. The patient underwent a simple right-sided mastectomy 1 year ago at district hospital and the histopathological examination revealed as a Malignant Phyllodes Tumor. The patient was advised to undergo postoperative radiotherapy， but she refused to do it because of financial problem. Four months after surgery， a lump reappeared on the right chest. It was stated that the tumor has been recidive. Regional lymph node examination， thoracic radiology and abdominal ultrasonography did not show any metastatic process .\n\nThe patient underwent wide excision with a free margin of 2 cm from the recidive tumor by|删除段之间换行|after operation. There were no complaints of fever， pain， or surgical infection. The flap was assessed as viable and there was no necrotic area on the wound. The results of histopathological examination revealed a Malignant Phyllodes Tumor of the breast and the tumor cells were no longer found in all excision margin. The patient was educated and scheduled to undergo radiotherapy.\n\n【13】Discussion\n\n【14】A Phyllodes Tumor is a tumor that is quite rare in the community. These tumors are classified histopathologically into 3 groups： Benign， borderline， and malignant. Anderson Cancer Center in 2012 reported the incidence of Phyllodes Tumor based on histopathology was58% for benign tumors， 12% for borderline tumors， and 30% for malignant tumors. Benign and borderline Phyllodes tumors never recur once the tumor has been completely excised (with tumor-free incision margin). Meanwhile， Malignant Phyllodes Tumors require more aggressive treatment because of the high risk of recurrence and metastasis. The recurrence rate of this tumor was recorded at 14% to21%通用删除6(英):<u>[1，4，5]</u>. Surgery is the main treatment for Malignant Phyllodes Tumor. Surgeon can decide between wide excision with safety margin1 cm or simple mastectomy in manage this tumor. Those treatments will leave wide surgical defect which become a surgeon's attention after excision.\n\n【15】Broad and radical excision of the breast will leave a large defect so that primary closure usually cannot be performed. Various methods have become the surgeon's choice to reconstruct this wide defect， such as Skin Graft technique， Cutaneous flaps (ex： Thoracoabdominal Flap， Thoracoepigastric Flap， Bilateral Advancement Flap)， and Myocutaneous flaps (ex： Latissimus Dorsi Flap and Transverse Rectus Abdominis Myocutaneous Flap). The Thoracoabdominal flap (TA flap) was originally introduced by Brown in 1975. However， this flap becameless popular after the Myocutaneous flap has been introduced in 1985通用删除6(英):<u>[3，6，7]</u>.\n\n【16】In principle， the TA flap is a rotational-advancement flap of skin and fascia. This flap has two bases of pivot point： The medial base and the lateral base. The medial base blood flow comes from the superior deep epigastric perforating artery， whereas the lateral base blood flow comes from branches of superficial lumbar，subcostal， intercostal and thoracic arteries. The TA flap with a medial base is also known as the Thoracoepigastric Flap (TE Flap). The two flap bases are mirrors of each other， as shown in Figure 4 通用删除6(英):<u>[3，7-9]</u>.\n\n【17】Srinivasa 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u> stated that the TA Flap procedure in post-mastectomy defects in case of locally advanced breast cancer will give satisfactory results. The TA flap is considered easy to perform for surgeons who are not familiar with myocutaneous flap procedures. This flap is not only easier but also faster healing than skin graft删除1换行technique. Patients can immediately undergo radiotherapy for local control after the TA flap wound has healed. This flap is also useful in developing countries with limited resources because surgeon needs no expensive equipment 通用删除6(英):<u>[3，7-9]</u>.\n\n【18】Das and Choudhury 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u> in 2013 reported that 1 in 20 patients(5%) who underwent TA flap surgery in cases of locally advanced breast cancer experienced complications such as wound dehiscence. These complications can be managed directlywith secondary suturing and wound closure. The study explained that the majority of patients were able to go home from the hospital on 3 to 4 postoperative days and underwent radiotherapy with good results. There was no recurrence in 18 months after surgery. It can be concluded that the TA flap procedure is simple，low-cost， and provides good tolerance for radiotherapy 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>.\n\n【19】Deo et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u> in 2003 has conducted research comparing TA flaps to Myocutaneous flaps (LD and TRAM flaps) in breast cancer cases. The TA flap requires a shorter operating time， shorter hospital stay， and significantly minimal risk of blood loss compared to the Myocutaneous flap. The morbidity and risk of local recurrence were not significantly different. The study concluded that the TA flap may be the first choice in patients with extensive post-mastectomy defects 通用删除6(英):<u>[8，9]</u>. Joo Seok's study stated that the TA flap had a faster recovery time than the TE flap. Baroudi et al. wrote that TE flap was hemodynamically weak and fragile because of tissue tension on vascular. The risk of necrosis at the end of the flap is high. If this morbidity occurs， the patient must be re-debrided and followed by a skin graft to close the defect. However， this was disputed by Burattini et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u> who conducted a study on the safety and viability of the TE flap. In this study， it was found that the risk of dehiscence was only 7%. Persichetti stated that the TA flap is very useful in post-mastectomy breast defects with an area of less than 600 cm 通用删除6(英):<u>[2，3，7，10，11]</u>.\n\n【20】In our patient， we modified the TA flap by dividing the flap into2 sides at the inferior defect. This flap is a combination of the TA flap on the lateral side and the TE flap on the medial side. We made this modification to provide free skin mobility and to minimize necrotic risk of tissue. Both of the TA Flap base will gain vascular supply maximally with minimal tissue traction.Nowadays， there is no consensus about surgical technique to close post-mastectomy defect. It depends on the experience of the surgeon， patient preferences， facilities， and the size of the defect. However， it is universally recognized that myocutaneous flaps are still better than cutaneous flaps in terms of reducing the risk of necrosis 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>.\n\n【21】Conclusion\n\n【22】Closure of the breast excision defect using a Thoracoabdominal flap may be an option for a surgeon who is not familiar with删除1换行performing myocutaneous flaps in chest wall reconstruction. This technique has ability to minimize duration of operation， cost， has rapid healing time， and simple to do by a general surgeon.

The spectrum of symptoms and organ involvements - in the acute， subacute phase and in post-COVID-19 syndrome-are still evolving and not fully known. Infected patients may be asymptomatic or they may present mild to severe multi-organ complications 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Among neurological manifestations of COVID-19 infection， an altered sense of smell or taste was early recognized as one of the most characteristic symptoms. Data from a multicenter European study reported olfactory and gustatory dysfunction among 85.6% and 88.0% of patients， respectively通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. Recently， there has been a growing evidence of otoneurological symptoms such as tinnitus， hearing loss and balance disorders 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. Several authors， however， remarked on the need of studies with follow-up assessments using standard objective tests 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>.\n\n【9】Herein we reviewed the international literature of COVID-19-related vestibular disorders including only detailed cases with clinical confirmed diagnosis. Additionally， we reported two cases ofobjective vertigo with nausea and vomiting， experienced during COVID-19 infection and in post-COVID-19 period， referred to our hospital.\n\n【10】A structured search of the English literature published on PubMed， from December 01，2019 to January 22nd， 2022， was performed by searching the terms “vestibular neuritis” and“COVID-19”.Only inherent reports with SARS-CoV-2-positive patients， as confirmed by molecular nasopharyngeal swab and with detailed clinical and diagnostic data were considered. Survey-based studies and papers clearly not related to the object were excluded.\n\n【11】A description of two consecutive cases of COVID-19-induced vestibular impairment evaluated at the Audiology and Phoniatrics Unit of Treviso Hospital between January 01， 2021 and January22m，2022 is reported. The study was conducted in accordance with the principles of the Helsinki Declaration. Patients gave their written consent for clinical case publication. Data were examined删除1换行in accordance with Italian privacy and sensitive data laws， and the in-house regulations of our Institution.\n\n【12】Results\n\n【13】Literature review\n\n【14】The review process is shown in Figure 1. After applying the above mentioned criteria， 15 papers were retrieved and 6 were included： 1retrospective通用删除6(英):<u> 5]</u> study and 5 case reports 6-10J.\n\n【15】Four patients were excluded from the article by Malayala et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u> due to repetition of previously published cases 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>， and to the presence of unconfirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We found5 case reports which overall described 6 patients who were given the diagnosis of VN related to COVID-19. Five patients were female and one patient was a young male (age ranging from 13 to 63). They all were given the diagnosis of mild or moderate COVID-19 according to the international guidelines 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Table 1 summarizes characteristics of included patients.\n\n【16】All the patients experienced typical symptoms of VN： Rotatory vertigo and unsteadygait with associated nausea and vomit. Diagnosis was obtained through physical examination， instrumental tests and exclusion ofother possible disorders .\n\n【17】In three cases 通用删除6(英):<u>[6，8，9]</u> the VN symptoms emerged at onset of COVID-19. In the other three patients the vestibular symptoms occurred after 13 days of COVID-19通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>， after 32 days 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u> and after2 months 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u> from the beginning of infection. Notably two cases described by Vanaparthyet al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u> and Aasfara et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u> alsopresented unilateral facial palsy. All patients were treated with corticosteroids and/or vestibular rehabilitation. In the cases who performed a follow-up 通用删除6(英):<u>[6，8-10]</u>， a resolution of symptoms was noticed after one month.\n\n【18】Case report 1\n\n【19】A 31-year-old woman referred to our department. According to her history， in August 2020 she complained of cough， fever， rhinitis， headache， fatigue， muscular pain， and loss of smell and taste. The patient underwent nasopharyngeal swab and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection， as confirmed with Real-Time PCR test.\n\n【20】After three days since symptoms onset， she had sudden objective24-h-lasting vertigo， with nausea and vomiting. She did not have any associated cochlear symptoms (e.g.， tinnitus， hearing loss or ear fullness) or central nervous system symptoms (e.g.， diplopia or loss of consciousness). Accordingtohergeneralpractitioner'sadvice，shetook symptom-relief medications and rested. During the following days her vertigo and dizziness progressively improved. One month later， she tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 infection (PCR test on repeated nasopharyngeal swab). During the following months she complained of recurrent episodes of dizziness， therefore she underwent clinical evaluations in our department. At physical examination no relevant clinical signs were present： No postural sway， external auditory canals and tympanic membranes were normal， spontaneous nystagmus was absent， and bed-side examination (Rose position， Dix-Hallpike and Pagnini-McClure maneuvers) were negative. Bithermal caloric test was performed at 50°C for warm air and 24C for cold air， 60sec of stimulation per year under direct visualization of tympanic membrane. It showed a left side hyporeflexia (40% left hypofunction with 15% right side directional preponderance). Dizziness handicap inventory resulted in 30/100 (mild handicap). All other instrumental tests were negative： ocular motility tests were normal， pure-tone audiometryand ABR revealed bilateral normal hearing，and Distorted Product Otoacoustic Emissions (DPOAE) were present.\n\n【21】The patient had not suffered from any pre-existent audiovestibular disorder before infection. According to the symptoms described during SARS-CoV-2 infection and reported findings， a diagnosis of COVID-19-related Vestibular Neuritis (VN) in compensatory phase at the moment of our evaluation was hypothesized， therefore vestibular rehabilitation exercises were prescribed. One month later， on a telephone follow-up interview， the patient stated that her dizziness episodes had resolved.\n\n【22】Case report 2\n\n【23】A 44-year-old man was evaluated at our unit complaining of sudden onset， 4 h before， of objective rotatory vertigo， nausea and vomiting.

A neurologic examination showed no abnormalities， a CT scan of the brain was negative for acute ischemic-hemorrhagic events； blood tests were within normallimits.\n\n【29】The patient had not suffered from any audiovestibular disorder previously. Recent medical history was relevant for mild COVID-19disease one month before. The infection that was confirmed by a positive PCR nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 lasted 2 weeks and was characterized by anosmia and dysgeusia.\n\n【30】A right side VN of probable viral origin was then diagnosed. At discharge a counseling， including reassurance on benignity of symptoms， was performed， oral steroid therapy was prescribed (50删除1换行mg prednisolone daily for 5 days and subsequent tapering of the drug for 5 days) followed by vestibular rehabilitation exercises after therapy.\n\n【31】A follow-up appointment was set for one month after. At the second evaluation， the patient denied any rotatory vertigo. Romberg's and Unterberger's tests were normal， spontaneous and positional nystagmuses were absent. Bithermal caloric test was performed， as previously described， and the exams showed right side hyporeflexia (29% right hypofunction with 21% left side directional preponderance). Ocular motility was within normal limits， pure tone-audiometry， tympanometry DPOAE and ABR revealed normal hearing functions， dizziness handicap inventory resulted in 6/100 (no handicap).\n\n【32】Discussion\n\n【33】VN is an inflammatory inner ear disorder that involves the vestibular portion of the 84h cranial nerve 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>. Current findings about etiology mainly support the role of viruses (first infection and viral reactivation) and dysregulated immunological responses. VN is usually a benign and self-limiting condition， but in some cases can lead to residual imbalance. Diagnosis is typically based on clinical history and symptoms， ear nose and throat evaluation including vestibular test， videonystagmography with caloric test， and audiometry 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>. Application of the HINTS protocol (Head Impulse， Nystagmus， test of Skew) in the emergency room is essential to rule out a cerebellar stroke， with a sensitivity of 96.7% and a specificity of94.8%通用删除6(英):<u>[131</u>. The presence ofunidirectional nystagmus， a positive head impulse test in the opposite side than the fast phase of nystagmus and the absence of vertical eye misalignment and other neurologic symptoms can be highly diagnosed of acute peripheral vestibulopathy通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u>. In doubtful cases， a neurological evaluation - eventually including neuro-radiological images - is required in order to exclude any central causes of vertigo. In recent years， a growing interest was put in cervical and ocular Vestibular Evoked Myogenic Potentials(cVEMPS and oVEMPS) and in the video Head Impulse Test (vHIT) as useful tools for the diagnostic work-up of VN. In particular vHIT， by analyzing the distribution of semicircular canals involvement， allows identification of selective vestibular structures alterations 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>. Definition of the site of vestibular damage and distinction between upper and/or lower branch of vestibular nerve involvement may correlate with the underlying cause of acute peripheral vestibular deficit， but does not change the initial treatment. The management of VN typically includes symptomatic relief medications， such as antiemetic drugs. Corticosteroids are prescribed with the aim of reducing vestibular inflammation. Vestibular rehabilitation has the role of enhancing the mechanism of central balance compensation that usually occurs within 2 to 8 months 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>.\n\n【34】The incidence of vestibular disorders in COVID-19 patients is still unknown and varies across different studies. Data based upon an Italian multicenter study questionnaire administration 通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u> showed that 18.4% ofpatients reported equilibrium disorders after COVID-19diagnosis (dizziness in 94.1% and acute vertigo episodes in 5.9%). A recent investigation about possible residual vestibular impairment in48 recovered patients found dizziness in 8.3% of subjects， spinning vertigo in 2%， dynamic and static imbalance in 2% and 6.3%respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. These symptoms were mostly transitory and there was no evidence of clinically relevant persistent vestibular damage. Preliminary meta-analysis showed a pooled prevalence of 7.2% for rotatory vertigo， but the authors reported a possible overestimation删除1换行because it was not always clear whether the included studies report a new onset vertigo or change in preexisting symptom 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>.\n\n【35】The retrospective study by Charpiot et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u> is a quantification of the numberofhospitaladmissions forAcute PeripheralVestibulopathy(APV) in 5 French Hospitals over the period February-May 2020 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. A comparison with 2018 and 2019 showed no significant increase in admission for APV， no significant difference among hospitals located in COVID-19high-and low-risk zones and no significant increase in the severity ofthe APV cases 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. In accordance， a retrospective review of acute cochleo-vestibular disorders after and before pandemic conducted at our department found no significant changes regarding incidence of APV.\n\n【36】Our review retrieved only 5 case reports， in which overall6different ppatients with COVID-19 related acute vestibular impairment were included. Moreover we reported clinical and instrumental findings of two cases of vestibular impairment possibly associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Other main differential diagnoses of acute peripheral vestibulopathy have to be considered. A first episode of Meniere’s disease 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u> or vestibular migraine attack18could have occurred 通用删除6(英):<u>[18，191</u>. Nevertheless， the literature review we have presented may support our clinical hypothesis. According to our review， in three cases VN was present at the onset of COVID-19通用删除6(英):<u>[6，8，9]</u>. The mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 can cause VN is unclear and speculative. Given its neurotrophic potential， a direct effect on the cochleo-vestibular nerve can be postulated， similarly to its pathogenesis in hypo/anosmia and optic neuritis. In this respect， the cellular receptor Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2(ACE2)， that mediates the intracellular entry of SARS-CoV-2， has been found in nasal tissues in murine and human model and in Eustachian tube， middle ear and cochlear tissues in murine model 通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u>. A relationship with vasculitis or vasculopathy has also been suggested 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. Another possibility is that the physical and emotional stress that people with SARS-CoV-2 infection experienced could have played a role in the expression ofvestibular symptoms-as occurred for headache patients通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u>-or could have triggered the reactivation ofpossiblelatent viruses(e.g.， HSV-1) 通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u>. This latter mechanism could be hypothesized especially in patients in which VN was not present at COVID-19symptoms onset but later during the course of the disease 通用删除6(英):<u>[6，7，10]</u>. Our second case， as well as the cases of Vanaparthy et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>， due to the temporal delay between PCR negativity and onset of vertigo， suggests the possibility of VN occurrence in the subacute phase of infection. To date， the post-COVID-19 syndrome is characterized by neurological symptoms such as headache， anxiety/depression， sleep and cognitive disturbances 通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u>. Finally， a SARS-CoV-2 neuro-invasive disease，leading to a COVID-19-related meningoencephalitis， may be implicated， as described for audiovestibular impairment in other neurotrophic viruses 通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u>. The latter situation does not certainly regard our patients， as oculomotor testing was accurate and ruled out any functional change in the central vestibular pathways.\n\n【37】The data we found in literature could be underestimated because many patients may not have undergone medical evaluation 通用删除6(英):<u>[25]</u>. Therefore， many diagnoses of possible COVID-19-related VNs may have been missed and only disclosed in later assessments， as occurred in our first described case. In general， a decrease in the number of vertigo/dizziness outpatients during the pandemic outbreak has been observed， due to visit cancellations and government restrictive measures 通用删除6(英):<u>[26]</u>. Therefore， to give support to patients in diagnosis and therapy，the role oftelemedicine was enhanced and a specific guideline of virtual management of vestibular disorders was recently published\n\n【38】通用删除6(英):<u>[27]</u>. Preliminary data have shown the role and utility， during the pandemic， of telemedicine in the management of dizziness patients通用删除6(英):<u>[28]</u>， but further studies are necessary to better define possibilities and limits of these methods.\n\n【39】Conclusion\n\n【40】According to the present review，only a few cases ofinstrumentally diagnosed COVID-19-related VN have been reported so far. Since hearing and balance disorders are rarely reported among patients with COVID-19， it would be appropriate to routinely test for SARS-CoV-2 infection patients with diagnosed VN. Moreover，prospective studies on a large series of COVID-19 patients should try to better define the epidemiology of cochlear-vestibular involvement and elucidate the SARS-CoV-2-related prognosis on peripheral and central audiovestibular functions. Among patients that can’t be easily visited due to quarantine regimen， a telemedicine evaluation could be helpful， as performed in accordance with standards of recent guidelines.

The cardiovascular risk factors and cardiotoxicity control remains challenging， since drug interactions may result in significant clinical events.\n\n【2】Methods： This study describes a cardiotoxicevent causedby syncope-related sinus pause，exacerbated or resulting from the use of thalidomide in a patient during multiple myeloma treatment.\n\n【3】Results/Discussion： A 63-year-old male submitted to VAD (vincristine， doxorubicin and dexamethasone) chemotherapy for multiple myeloma. After six months， the patient underwent a Bone Marrow Transplant (BMT)， first with thalidomide，evolving with successive syncopal episodes(Stokes-Adams syndrome)， one of which resulted in traumatic brain injury， with a fracture in the left temporoparietal region. A 24-h Holter showed 2 pause episodes of more than 2 sec， the longest being 18.5 sec，not associated with symptoms. It is known that patients submitted to chemotherapy are at risk of developing cardiotoxicity. Preventive measures should be part of clinical management， in order to prevent ventricular damage and the occurrence of other phenomena.\n\n【4】Conclusion： The use of thalidomide requires monitoring bradyarrhythmia's and syncope. Medication with greater tolerability， such as lenalidomide，should beincreasingly prescribed，thereby avoiding undesirable clinical situations that may directly affect patient morbidity and mortality.\n\n【5】Introduction\n\n【6】The demographic and epidemiological transition process that occurred in Brazil and the world in the last century changed the profile of the most prevalent diseases. Increased life expectancy and improvement in certain aspects of the health-disease process led to a reduction in infectious and parasitic diseases， with a rise in the incidence of neoplastic diseases. Thus， neoplasm's that accounted for around 3% of overall deaths in 1930， increased proportionally to 12% in the mid-1980s 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>.\n\n【7】There have been important advances in the area of medicine， with new drugs and treatments to manage these diseases. On the other hand， new drug interactions may result in a significant clinical event in the follow-up of this population 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. This can be particularly relevant given the need to control cardiovascular comorbidities prevalent in survivors.\n\n【8】One of the concerns with the use of antineoplastic agents is the potential for cardiotoxicity. This clinical entity is defined by confirmation of new clinical cardiovascular alterations during or after antineoplastic treatment and/or change in biomarkers and/or cardiac imaging tests， provided other etiologies have been excluded 通用删除6(英):<u>[3，4]</u>.\n\n【9】Multiple myeloma， a malignant disease of the hematopoietic system， was one of the neoplasm's whose natural history was modified. Despite still being incurable， the therapeutic arsenal has been broadened.\n\n【10】The aim of this study was to describe a cardiotoxic event caused by syncope-related sinus pause， exacerbated or caused by the use of thalidomide in a patient being treated for multiple myeloma.\n\n【11】Case Presentation\n\n【12】A 63-year-old male was referred to the cardio-oncology outpatient facility due to hypertension after the onset of VAD (vincristine， doxorubicin and dexamethasone) chemotherapy to treat multiple myeloma. There were no cardiovascular symptoms at that time. The patient was using10 mg/d of amlodipine and 50 mg/d of metoprolol tartrate. Physical examination showed a good overall state， pallor， FC I with BP= 44 mmHg x 86 mmHg， HR= 84 bpm， and RR=22 ipm. CMR\n\n【13】ComplementaryEexaminations atfollow-upshowed an electrocardiogram with siniis rhythm，left-axis deviation， electrically inactive lower wall area， and QTc of 426 msec . Transthoracic echocardiogram revealed grade I diastolic dysfunction， with preserved systolic function (LVEF=69%)， and no change in segmental contraction. Due to the high risk of cardiotoxicity， the anti-hypertensives were replaced by 20 mg/d of enalapril and 6.25mg/d of carvedilol. There was good tolerance to increasing doses of carvedilol up to 50 mg/day.\n\n【14】After six months， the patient was submitted to a Bone Marrow Transplant (BMT)， with thalidomide as part of the BMT hematology protocol， evolving with successive syncopal episodes (Stokes-Adams syndrome)， one associated with traumatic brain injury and a fracture in the left temporoparietal region. At this time， the physical examination was similar to that of the first consultation， with controlled blood pressure， no postural hypotension or other disorders， and CMR with 4S. The electrocardiogram exhibited the same pattern as those previously obtained .\n\n【15】The 24-h Holter showed 2 pause episodes of more than 2 sec， the longest being 18.5 sec， not associated with any symptoms . After joint assessment with an Arrhythmologist， the following删除1换行diagnostic hypotheses were considered：Thalidomide-induced bradycardia， ventricular arrhythmias caused by cardiotoxicity due to the previous use of doxorubicin or vasovagal syncope resulting from a change in the antihypertensive scheme. The use of 25mcg/d of fludrocortisone was prescribed， associated with non-pharmacological measures， and the beta blocker was discontinued， while complementary diagnosis assessment progressed. Syncopal episodes persisted with similar characteristics to those previously observed.\n\n【16】The electrophysiological study to assess sinus node dysfunction was normal， as was cardiac catheterization， which demonstrated only epicardial coronaries with irregularities. The tilt test was negative.\n\n【17】Thyroidlffunctionandeelectrolyte doses remainednormal throughout follow-up. Due to the persistent syncopal episodes and the impossibility of suspending thalidomide， a definitive atrial-ventricular pacemaker was implanted， with successful episode resolution.\n\n【18】Discussion\n\n【19】Syncope occurred in the patient due to a confluence of factors， including base pathology， since cancer leads to a proinflammatory state that may culminate in fibrosis and altered cardiac physiology， the side effects of his medication. The use ofthalidomide seems to be the main factor for the origin of syncope.\n\n【20】Thalidomide， an antineoplastic drug， is part of the therapeutic scheme for multiple myeloma. Its most important cardiotoxicity-related side effects are thromboembolicphenomena and arrhythmias， mainly bradyarrhythmia’s 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. Some studies found that thalidomide 05 could induce mild bradycardia in up to 55% ofpatients， irrespective of an association with corticosteroids 通用删除6(英):<u>[6，7]</u>. The most severe bradycardia symptoms occur in only 1% to 3% of cases 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. Numerous mechanisms are involved in1 the hemodynamic determination of cardiac arrhythmias， such as hypotension and pulmonaryhypertension 通用删除6(英):<u>[7，8]</u>.\n\nFahdi et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u> reported topics that deserve attention. More than 90 patients with multiple mveloma treated with thalidomide were compared with the control group. Their concomitant use with negative chronotropic drugs， such as adrenergic beta calcium channel blockers， and antiarrhythmic drugs showed no statistically significant difference in relation to the occurrence of bradyarrhythmia's in the study patients 通用删除6(英):<u>[9，10]</u>. However， along with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide， these drugs are part of the group that pose a risk for the occurrence of bradycardia 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>. An important factor that seems to be associated with greater sinus bradycardia occurrence is the existence of concomitant hypothyroidism， which should be closely monitored 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. In the patient in question， all thyroid hormone contents were normal|删除段之间换行|Electrocardiographically， bradycardia is expressedIwith no change in intracardiac conduction intervals， such as the PR， QRS and QT interval. The physiopathological mechanism remains unknown通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. Fahdi et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u> suggested that the basis for the occurrence of this event is the imbalance caused by thalidomide in the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. Thalidomide inhibits TNF alpha expression and activity， leading to complete inhibition of the dorsal motor neuron in the vagus nerve nucleus， resulting in parasympathetic hyperactivity and culminating in sinus bradycardia and other conduction disorders， such as third-degree atrioventricular block 通用删除6(英):<u>[7，9，12]</u>.\n\n【22】It was later suggested that the harmful effect of this chemotherapy drug is dose dependent， as reported by Tamargo et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>， such that in patients where it could not be reduced or suspended， when severe bradycardia occurs， the typical therapeutic alternative is implanting a definitive pacemaker 通用删除6(英):<u>[7，9]</u>. This device has increased in patients exhibiting syncopal episodes. Thangaraju et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u> reported the occurrence of sinus bradycardia in young patients being treated for erythema nodosum leprosum， and no association with other drugs. This resulted in regression and return to basal heart rate after the drug was suspended， demonstrating that the effects are associated with higher serum concentration of the drug and suggesting the reversibility of the effects of thalidomide in sinus node function7，9，13-15.\n\n【23】In a study of patients diagnosed with stage 1 multiple myeloma， Rajikumar et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u> found that at an average of 400 mg/day of thalidomide (varying from 200 mg/day to 800 mg/day)， around 26%of the patients exhibited bradycardia， showing an association with a lower heart rate. The same phenomenon was observed by Menghui通用删除6(英):<u>[171， </u>where sinus bradycardia was one of the most important side effects of thalidomide in terms of morbidity in the treatment of Crohn's disease， reinforcing the need to monitor cardiotoxicity.\n\n【24】There are now drugs with a more tolerable cardiovascular toxicity profile， including second-generation immune modulators such as lenalidomide， a thalidomide analog 通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u>. However， this drug is not available in the Brazilian public health system， since it was not included in the National List of Essential Drugs (RENAME)， last updated in 2022通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u>.\n\n【25】It is known that patients submitted to chemotherapy are at risk of developing cardiotoxicity. Preventive measures should be part of clinical management， in order to prevent ventricular dysfunction and other phenomena. Although not statistically significant， according to the latest Brazilian Cardio-Oncology Guidelines， the use of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and prophylactic beta blockers is indicated， irrespective of symptomatic删除1换行or asymptomatic cardiac injury 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. In the largest randomized clinical trial conducted to prevent cardiotoxicity using adrenergic beta blockers， specifically carvedilol， Avila et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u> found no difference between the control group and placebo in relation to left ventricular ejection fraction and placebo， since there was a decline in troponin levels and diastolic dysfunction in the carvedilol group. It is important to note that in addition to their side effects， these drugs may interact with the chemotherapy drugs themselves.\n\n【26】Conclusion\n\n【27】The use of thalidomide requires carefulmonitoring of bradyarrhythmia's and syncope， in addition to other cardiotoxicities. Drugs such as lenalidomide exhibit better tolerability and less interaction with therapies to control comorbidities and reduce cardiotoxicity. As such， they should be preferred to lower the risk of undesirable clinical situations and increased morbidity and mortality in this population.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

This case reports reflects upon a healthy 46 year old female who presented with subtype of true neoplasm called a neural fibrolipoma arising from the plantar nerve. The patient was referred by her GP for an evaluation of an unknown painful soft tissue mass present in the right plantar aspect of the mid foot. The mass had been present for approximately 2 to 3 years and had recently increased in size in the last 4 months. This 17 mmx7 mm x11 mm painful soft tissue swelling was detected by USS and showed it extended deep to the plantar fascia not arising from it hence ruling out the common misconception of plantar fibromatosis.\n\n【2】When reviewing such patients， it is imperative to rule out any malignancy before excising the mass which is why referring this patient to a Sarcoma MDT was essential. Other infectious differentials including septic arthritis and osteomyelitis were ruled out early since Blood counts showed CRP -1.2 mg/L， White cell count - 5.1×10/L，Neutrophils -3.47×10/L. Arthritic differentials such as Gout were also ruled out based on blood parameters which revealed Urate -287.\n\n【3】The patient opted for surgical excision biopsy of the lesion. Post operative period was uneventful with good healing of the wound She was followed up 2 months and at with the histology findings results revealed a rare soft tissue neural neoplasm in keeping of a neurofibrolipoma. The patient was happy with the overall outcome and discharged. This case report highlights the need to consider the neural fibrolipoma as a rare case of plantar/heel pain and excision of the lesion would provide an excellent outcome.\n\n【4】Keywords： Plantar nerve； Neural fibrolipoma； Neuroma\n\n【5】Introduction\n\n【6】A neuroma can be defined as benign tumour of nerve tissue. Neuromas can be differentiated into 3 categories. Firstly a true neuroma， secondly neuromas associated with trauma and finally neuromas as part of a syndrome such as neurofibromatosis or MEN2b. Neuromas are overlooked as a differential diagnosis for heel pain， and they are diagnosed by a combination of physical examination， history taking， and radiological imaging and by histopathological findings following excision.\n\n【7】A Neural fibrolipoma， also known as a lipofibromatous hamartoma is a benign， soft-tissue neoplasm generated by the proliferation of mature nerve sheet fibroblast and adipocytes leading to the formation of a palpable subcutaneous mass. The exact pathogenesis of a neural fibrolipoma is unknown however chronic irritation and trauma have known to play a precipitating factor. Often seen in nerves with high risk of compression such as the median nerve， it is very rare to present in the plantar nerve.\n\n【8】Case Presentation\n\nA healthy 46-year-old female who was referred by her GP for an evaluation of a painful soft tissue mass present in the right plantar aspect of the mid foot. The mass had been present for approximately 2 to 3 years and had recently increased in size in the last 4 months. The patient described the feeling as walking on a hard stone. There was no history of trauma or significant familyhistory. Upon inspection there was no apparent infection or skin changes. Upon examination the patient had bilateral planovalgus feet with bilateral hallux valgus worse on the right side. This swelling had led to chronic pain with some sensitivity and numbness over that area. Following|删除段之间换行|USS described this swelling in the plantar aspect of the mid-foot as well defined， hypoechoic tender lesion within the plantar subcutaneous tissue measuring approximately 17 mm x7 mm×11mm. More importantly the lesion extended deep to the plantar fascia删除1换行not arising from it hence ruling out plantar fibromatosis . In order to rule out any aggressive pathology an MRI with contrast was arranged which revealed a 2 cm by 5 mm tubular oblique lesion in the plantar subcutaneous fat. MR imaging was also able to rule out sinus tarsi syndrome and any internal derangements . She was referred to orthotics for a medial support arch to help with pain. Since the exact characteristics of this lesion were still unknown the case was referred to the Yorkshire Sarcoma MDT. The outcome of this meeting concluded that there were no radiological features of a sarcoma. She still experienced excruciating， sharp stabbing pain in her right foot. Pain score was 10/10. She opted for surgical excision biopsy of the lesion. The post operative period was uneventful with good healing of the wound. She was followed up 2 months and at with the histology findings results revealed a rare soft tissue neural neoplasm in keeping of a neurofibrolipoma. The patient was happy with the overall outcome and discharged. She was reviewed again after 2 years for a further foot and ankle problem in the other foot and at the time of review she was completely pain free in the right foot with an excellent outcome.\n\n【10】Discussion\n\n【11】A.true neuroma can come in various sizes andlocations including a vestibular schwannoma， acoustic neuroma， ganglioneuroma， neurothekeoma， nerve sheath myxoma. These neuromas have their own unique characteristics and origin. The true incidence of many these neuromas vary in different literature as often neuromas go undetected until they become symptomatic. In the cases ofan acoustic neuroma or vestibular schwannoma patients can present with tinnitus hearing loss and vertigo. In this case the patient presented with chronic pain in her right foot.\n\n【12】When reviewing such patients， it is imperative to rule out any malignancy before excising the mass which is why referring this patient to a Sarcoma MDT was essential.Other infectious differentials including septic arthritis and osteomyelitis were ruled out early since Blood counts showed CRP - 1.2 mg/L， White cell count - 5.1×10/L， Neutrophils -3.47 10/L. Arthritic differentials such as Gout were also ruled out based on blood parameters which revealed Urate -287. Given that the pain was focused on the plantar aspect of the heel and not primarily in the posterior heel conditions such as Achilles tendonitis，retroachiles bursitis or retrocalcaneal bursitis were ruled out. Furthermore， given the age of the patient was not an adolescent Severs disease (calcaneal apophysitis) was also excluded 通用删除6(英):<u>[1-6]</u>.\n\n【13】It is important to recognize that this true neuroma originated from aperipheral nerve such as the medial plantar nerve and not from the inter-digital nerve as that would make it a Morton's neuroma.\n\n【14】During excision the medial plantar nerve was preserved ensuring the patient preserved motor function of the abductor hallucis， flexor digitorum brevis， the flexor hallucis brevis and the first lumbrical muscle.\n\n【15】Conclusion\n\n【16】This case report highlights the need to consider the neural fibrolipoma as a rare case of plantar/heel pain and excision of the lesion would provide an excellent outcome.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

This would further reduce the power of a maybe already underpowered study.\n\n【57】Implication\n\n【58】Pregnancy is a unique health experience. Unlike other health and illness contexts studied by health psychologists， such as cancer or heart disease， pregnancy is not an illness and is commonlyassociated with positive psychological experiences 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>. However， different maternal or fetal conditions， and high risk pregnancies， may have a significant impact on maternal satisfaction 通用删除6(英):<u>[2，3，6，12-16]</u>.\n\n【59】Many women may be coping with an unintended pregnancy， bothersome physical symptoms， medical risk conditions or other chronic life strains. Pregnancy， which typically spans 40 weeks， is also time-limited in nature. The finite nature may influence how women appraise and cope with at least some pregnancy-specific stressors. By its very nature， pregnancy is also embedded within a broader interpersonal context and therefore， it is particularly important to understand the influence of an expecting mother’s close personal relationships on her coping effectiveness. A recent study by Stapleton et al. examined the maternal relationship with a baby’s father in detail and found that paternal support during pregnancy predicted maternal prepartum and postpartum distress， as did the quality of their relationship 通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>.

We also reported a non-significant higher score for social support in women with preeclampsia and IUGR. This may reflect a tendency for these classes of patients to research\"social support\" more than others， since they are often long-term patients and therefore more exposed to social distancing imposed by prolonged hospitalization and social exclusion induced from the CODIV-19 pandemic.\n\n【65】Conclusion\n\n【66】In summary， women with high risk pregnancies admitted for antenatal inpatient monitoring have a high score at coping strategies.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

Associated injuries includedtraumatic aortic dissection and an acute subdural hematoma.We proceeded with posterior spinal decompression and fusion on the same day as the injury. His breathing status improved with postural drainage that was possible due to early spinal stabilization. The patient was discharged three months after surgery. As injuries to the thoracic spine result from high-energy trauma， patients are generally in poor health and surgical treatment is usually delayed. However， if a patient is medically stable， early surgical treatment should be considered despite other major injuries to reduce the risk of further spinal damage and facilitate post-injury care.\n\n【2】Keywords： Spine damage control surgery； Poor general condition； Thoracic fracture-dislocation\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Thoracic dislocation fracture often occurs due to high energy trauma， frequently complicating head injury， respiratory injury， and vascular injury. As a result， there are many cases in which surgery cannot be performed early after injury， and a consensus on optimal surgery timing has not been obtained. We undertook reconstruction and fixation of a thoracic dislocation fracture accompanying multiple trauma on the same day as the injury， which was useful for systemic management after surgery.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 74-year-old man was transported to our emergency department following a fall from a height of 6 m. Neurological examination revealed complete motor paralysis and sensory loss below thoracic level seven (T7)， with absent anal-bulbocavernosus reflexes. Radiographic and computed tomography imaging identified： Burst fracture of T4 (AO classification， 52-B2.3； load sharing classification， 7 points) 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，2]</u>； fracture-dislocation of T5 (AO classification， 52-C1.3； load sharing classification， 9 points)； and spinal cord function， Frankel grade A . Associated injuries included acute subdural hematoma，traumatic aortic dissection， bilateral hemithorax， and bilateral clavicular fracture .\n\n【7】Emergency medical treatment comprised blood transfusion and thoracic drainage. After drain placement， cessation of bleeding into the chest cavity was confirmed via angiography； the patient underwent surgery for his spinal injuries 6 hours after sustaining the trauma.\n\n【8】Surgical Procedure\n\n【9】Following an incision along the thoracic spine， free bone fragments were excised. The T5vertebral arch was resected to decompress the spinal cord， and the damaged dura mater was repaired. Pedicle screws were inserted at the levels of T2 to T3 and T6 to T8 . The surgical time was 158 min， with an intraoperative blood loss volume of 748 mL.\n\n【10】Post-surgery， the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit for medical management. As the spinal injury had been stabilized early， postural drainage was possible and the patient's respiratory status and overall medical status improved. Three months post-surgery， the patient no longer complained of back pain. His motor paralysis and sensory loss had recovered to a Frankel classification grade B. He could maintain static sitting and could transfer into and out of a wheelchair with assistance.\n\n【11】Discussion\n\n【12】Thoracic spine injury usually results from high-energy trauma， such as a fall from a height or motor vehicle accident. For our patient， all three columns had been disrupted by the fracture-dislocation， with compression of the spinal canal. Early decompression and stabilization was performed to allow early mobilization and rehabilitation. Several factors must be considered when determining the timing of surgical treatment of thoracic spine fractures： Patients’age， clinical symptoms， neurological injury and impairment， status of accompanying injuries， and type of stabilization required (anterior， posterior or combined stabilization) 通用删除6(英):<u>[3-7]</u>. An anterior approach allows decompression under direct vision， rigid reconstruction of删除1换行the anterior column， and sufficient correction of the spinal kyphosis. There is， however， a risk for increased bleeding from the vertebral bodies and epidural bleeding. A posterior approach is technically simpler than an anterior approach； the surgical stress on the patient is relatively lower. However， a posterior approach carries the risk for loss of the kyphosis correction and insufficient decompression. Although decompression of the spinal canal and stabilization should be performed as soon as possible， timing of the surgical treatment must be balanced with a patient's medical status. In trauma care of a patient with multiple fractures involving long bones， treatment is guided by the concept of Damage Control Orthopedic (DCO) surgery通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>. Similarly， the concept of Spine Damage Control (SDC) surgery删除1换行has recently been proposed for the management of patients presenting with multiple injuries including the spine， due to high energy trauma通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>， the priorities being hemodynamic and spinal stabilization and improving respiratory status. As a majority of patients with thoracic spine injury are in a poor general condition， it is often required to wait until the surgery. However， even in a case with poor general condition such as our patient， from the point of view of damage control surgery， surgery early after injury is useful.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

Used in Morocco for its cosmetic food and therapeutic properties in particularly anemia and all blood diseases. It can be toxic if it is incorrectly dosed. We report 3 cases of nephrotoxicity collected in the nephrology and hemodialysis service of the IBNROCHD university hospital center in Casablanca： 3 women aged 15， 39 and 47 years， following the ingestion of infusion of this plant at doses indeterminate， presented with acute tubule-interstitial nephritis. These new cases of nephrotoxicity at Rubia tinctorum must challenge the need to know how to evoke the diagnosis， to inform， to fight against the trivialization of its consumption， to encourage research on the traditional pharmacopoeia allowing to identify their therapeutic properties in order to formalize， rationalize and codify their prescriptions.\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Rubia tinctorum (El FOUA) is a plant widely used for thousands of years as a source of red color with its variants for dyeing textiles ， in cosmetology， in food as an additive but also as a drug with many therapeutic properties. It is very widespread in the world and particularly in Europe， Asia and North Africa.\n\n【4】In Morocco and in the Mediterranean basin， it is a ubiquitous plant. It is used for dyeing purposes by obtaining a red dye intended for dyeing， painting and even food. Added to this is its medicinal use in many fields. Indeed it is very popular with Moroccan women， as a purgative， after childbirth. A decoction of the whole plant is prescribed in anemia and all diseases of the blood. Its daily intake is recommended to increase blood volume and improve the complexion.\n\n【5】However， Rubia tinctorum is very rich in anthraquinone derivatives. It is considered according to the World Health Organization (WHO) and some other health and food organizations (such as Health Canada or the French Ministry of Agriculture) as involving risks for the consumer. Recent studies have shown a certain toxicity especially on the kidney with a mutagenic or even carcinogenic power of certain anthraquinone derivatives 通用删除6(英):<u>[11</u>.\n\n【6】Patients and Methods\n\n【7】We report 3 cases of nephrotoxicity collected in the nephrology and hemodialysis service of the IBNROCHD hospital center in Casablanca： Women aged 15 39 years and 47 years following the ingestion of infusion of this plant in undetermined doses to treat anemia.\n\n【8】Results\n\n【9】Observation 1\n\n【10】HE aged 15， with no particular pathological history， admitted to the nephrology department for a glomerular syndrome with renal insufficiency at 66 mg/L of plasma creatinine and 24-h proteinuria at 1 g/24 h and aseptic leukocyturia after taking Rubia tinctorum for ten days， infused several times a day for iron deficiency anemia.\n\n【11】On examination， the patient is apyretic， normo tensioned to 130/70 mmHg， presence of a protein cross with urinary strips without traces of blood， diuresis is calculated at 300 ml per day.\n\n【12】The assessment revealed an acute renal failure at 66 mg/L of creatinine， 24-h proteinuria at 1g/24 h without impact on the protidogram， sterile ECBU with leukocyturia at 200，000 e/ml.

The assessment revealed an acute renal failure at 73mg/L of creatinine， 24 h protein at 1 g/24 h without impact on the protidogram， ECBU sterile with leukocyturia at 100 000 e/ml. The renal ultrasound was without abnormality， patients underwent renal biopsy punctures which showed acute tubulointerstitial nephritis. Therapeutically all our patients were put on corticosteroid therapy with a good improvement in creatinine.\n\n【18】Discussion\n\n【19】Despite progress in pharmacology， the therapeutic use of plants is very present in certain countries of the world， especially those developing notwithstanding a medical system modern. Morocco by the richness and diversity of its flora constitutes a true phytogenetic reservoir with around 4500 plant species and subspecies， including Rubia Tinctorum  通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. In the literature， the data concerning intoxication in madder are rare and few documented. Use for food， curative or aesthetic purposes of certain plants possibly toxic， or at least a part ， can induce serious poisoning， even fatal.\n\n【20】These poisoning is a frequent accident in most regions of the world通用删除6(英):<u>[21</u>.\n\n【21】Rubia Tinctorum has been used for thousands of years. The properties most cited in the literature for this plant are 通用删除6(英):<u>[3，4]</u>： Its diuretic activity and especially as a hypotensive， its emmenagogue activity， its activity in obstructions of the spleen， its purgative/laxative activity and its activity cholagogue.\n\n【22】The study of the chemical composition of the roots of Rubia tinctorum has shown its richness in anthraquinones in its two free and combined forms 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. Free anthraquinone forms have no marked pharmacological activity. These free genins present in the drug or formed by the beginning of gastric hydrolysis and which reach the intestine are absorbed at the level of the small intestine， are glucurono-conjugated at the hepatic level and largely eliminated by the urinary route. We also note the existence of an enterohepatic cycle.\n\n【23】The combined forms are neither absorbed nor hydrolyzed in the small intestine. When they reach the colon， they are hydrolyzed by B-glucosidases from the intestinal flora and the anthraquinones released are reduced and will act on intestinal motility 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. Action on the Na-K-ATPase pump in the cell membrane of enterocytes： By inhibiting the pump， sodium in the colon cells is increased， which leads to a decrease in the reabsorption of water and sodium. This explains the laxative effect. The excessive use of anthraquinones can lead to recto-colic melanoses 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>， by a cytotoxic effect 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>.\n\n【24】As part of the assessment of the madder root safety ， used as food coloring， toxicity tests were carried out on mice. An acute toxicity test was carried out by administration for 14 madder root days at doses of 0， 500， 2000， 3500， and 5000 mg/kg of body weight. A male mouse receiving 5000 mg/kg body weight died before the end of the study， indicating that the maximum tolerated dose of GR was between 3500 and 5000 mg/kg body weight. A subacute GR toxicity test was also carried out with 62 mice of each sex， with a diet containing madder root at concentrations of 0.3； 0.6； 1.25； 2.5 and 5% for 90删除1换行days. All mice tolerated these doses. None of the mice treated with RG showed clinical signs of toxicity. Histopathological examination showed retention cysts in the kidneys and vaginal epidermal cysts in some of the treated or control mice. No hyperplastic， pre-neoplastic and neoplastic lesions and no pathological signs of toxicity were found. These results suggest that dietary exposure to GR at these doses has no acute or subacute toxic effects on mice 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>.\n\n【25】Another study of chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity was carried out. For 90 days repeated doses of 0； 0.6； 1.2； 2.5 and 5.0% of the test substance. The results demonstrate toxic effects of madder root on the liver，kidneys and on the hematopoietic system 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>.\n\n【26】Histopathological changes were mainly observed in the proximal renal tubules， such as vacuolar microvesicular degeneration in the cortex and caryomegaly in the external medulla， the lesions being evident even with 0.6%. In the external medulla， the increase in cell proliferation activity， appreciated by the proliferation of nuclear antigen cells， has been observed. The Severity of focal hepatocyte necrosis increased only in females， to 5.0%， while the increase in the relative weight of the liver but also that of conjugated bilirubin was evident in both sexes， at the dose 1.2%通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>.\n\n【27】A more recent study of the carcinogenicity was conducted to elucidate the long-term effects of Rubia tinctorum and its target organs. Histologically， the frequency of caryomegaly and atypical hyperplasia of the tubules， as well as adenomas and carcinomas in the renal cells， increased significantly in the groups treated in both sexes. These results show that RG exerts an unequivocal carcinogenic power on the cells of the renal tubules and hepatocytes in rats 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>.\n\n【28】Regarding toxicity in humans， an analysis of 11 studies treating colorectal cancers and the use of laxatives has shown that the use of laxatives has increased risk of colorectal cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>.\n\n【29】Other studies have mentioned anthraquinones specifically in evaluating the use of laxatives as a risk factor for cancer.

In short， anthraquinones should not be used long term and improperly because of the risk of melanosis coli 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>.\n\n【30】Conclusion\n\n【31】In the literature， renal toxicity linked to the consumption of elfoua has not been described in humans， but studies done in rats have shown that the administration of this plant can cause tubular necrosis， with nephritis interstitial. These effects have been observed删除1换行following chronic ingestion of large doses.

{"seq_id": "7c7bbf43-4330-4048-ab2c-b169e9e701e6", "title": null, "text": "【0】Abstract\n\n【1】We present the case of a thirteen-year-old male albino who had a one-year history of an ulcer on the scalp. The ulcer started as a nodule which ruptured and formed an ulcer. The latter enlarged gradually with mild pain and occasional foul-smelling discharge. We prepared him for excision biopsy and split thickness skin grafting. The histology result showed squamous cell carcinoma. The photomicrograph is shown on figure two.\n\n【2】Aim： To show that skin cancers may be occurring in younger people in recent years.\n\n【3】Keywords： Albino； Skin cancer； Solar damage\n\n【4】Introduction\n\n【5】Albinism is an autosomal recessive condition that results in inadequate or absence of melanin in the skin and other tissues. The melanocytes， the cells that produce melanin， though present， fail to produce the pigment because an enzyme， tyrosinase， is either absent or does not produce enough melanin. Therefore， there is variable absence of melanin depending on the degree of activity of the enzyme. Besides， focal failure of the enzyme in different parts of the body gives rise to conditions such as ocular albinism or isolated absence of melanin in the hair or any other part of the body.\n\n【6】The main culprit in the aetiology of skin cancers is ultraviolet radiation 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，2]</u>. On the electromagnetic spectrum the ultraviolet radiation occupies the wave lengths between 400 nm and200 nm， 400 nm to 700 nm being the visible spectrum. Ultraviolet radiation- A， B and C presently have health significance. Ultraviolet radiation A was initially thought to affect mainly the aging process by causing wrinkles but it has recently been implicated as a cofactor to UVB 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. The latter is known to cause most of the skin cancers because it gets to the earth in significant amounts Ultraviolet radiation C does not get to the earth in significant amounts because the ozone layer filters it out. However， production of fluorocarbons by human activity is making the ozone layer thinner and this will make UVC to steadily increase its appearance on the earth. It has been shown that the shorter the wavelength of ultraviolet radiation， the more the carcinogenic effect on the skin. Therefore UVC， having the shortest wave length among the ultraviolet rays， will cause more skin cancers if it gets to the earth in significant amount. Carcinogenicity of UV radiation is caused by mutation on the DNA 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. Photochemical damage by UV radiation is repaired by P gene products and the repair mechanism is impaired with aging giving rise to skin cancers 通用删除6(英):<u>[5-7]</u>.\n\n【7】Case History\n\n【8】This is the case of a thirteen-year-old male albino who presented to us with a scalp ulcer of one-year duration. The ulcer started as a nodule which continued to increase in size and ruptured spontaneously to discharge a foul-smelling fluid. There was mild continuous pain and occasional fever. Dressing of the ulcer with honey and administration of tablets purchased over the counter did not heal it. Neither the patient nor his parents had education on sun protection for albinos 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>.\n\nOn examination the patient was chronically ill looking， mildly pale， anicteric and afebrile. The vital signs were a temperature of 36.8C， pulse rate of 86 beats/minute and respiratory rate of 20cycles/minute. There was extensive solar keratosis over the head， neck and upper limbs. The trunk and lower limbs had fewer solar keratosis. A fungating ulcer that measured 6 cm by 6 cm was located on the scalp，superior and lateral to the right ear. The posterior auricular， occipital， submandibular， submental and cervical lymph nodes were not palpable. The other regions of the body were grossly normal. We made a clinical diagnosis of basal cell carcinoma. The investigations done and their|删除段之间换行|Discussion\n\n【10】Our index patient is 13 years old and presented one year after the lesion started. Therefore， the cancer started at twelve years of age. This is an early age for albinos to develop skin cancer even in our tropical climate where the full impact of the sun is felt. It is believed that although a lot of the damage is done in childhood， skin cancers develop later in life. Indeed， one source quotes fifty percent of skin damage to have occurred at 15 years 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. There is increase in the global incidence of skin cancers and now we are beginning to see these cancers in younger age groups. Therefore， the question to be answered by research is whether more UV radiation， especially UVC， is reaching the earth due to human activity. A retrospective study of skin cancers in our hospital for the last two decades will show the age profile the patients and younger people may be having skin cancers. However， the records of patients in the last 20 years are unreliable in our hospital. Most of the skin cancers are cause by UVB but UVC is known to be more carcinogenic if significant amount of the latter gets to the earth.\n\n【11】The finding of squamous cell carcinoma in our patient is not surprising because Asuquo et al. have shown that skin cancers删除1换行in albinos in our community are more commonly squamous cell carcinoma and not basal cell carcinoma as seen in Caucasians 通用删除6(英):<u>[9-111</u>.\n\n【12】The management of skin cancers in our community is a challenge for many reasons namely ignorance， late presentation， and poverty. Ignorance and late presentation can be addressed by education of the people on radio， television and health talk in different institutions. Albino parents and the affected children， when they are old enough to understand， should cover the body with the right color that does not absorb UV radiation (e.g. white)， use a hat with a wide brim or umbrella in the sun， do outdoor activities when UV radiation is least(between 6 am and 10 am and after 4 pm)， use sunscreen with a sun protection factor of 15 and report early to hospital for treatment of solar keratosis and ulcers 通用删除6(英):<u>[12，13]</u>.

Diagnosis is straight forward in individuals with bone fragility and a positive family history or several extra skeletal manifestations (hearing loss， dark or bluish sclera). OI is classified into a number of major subtypes based on genetic， radiographic，and clinical characteristics， but more useful is the clinical classification， based upon the typical problems that manifest in infants， children， and adults with mild， moderate to severe and lethal disease.\n\n【2】This case report describes a 53-year old female patient with an unknown genetic disorder， but with medical history of bone fragility， currently presented with spontaneous ace tabular fracture that led to the diagnosis of osteogenesis imperfect a type I. OI is associated with multiple perioperative complications， thus the patients require extensive preoperative evaluation and an individualized surgical and anesthetic management.\n\n【3】Keywords： Osteogenesis imperfecta； COVID-19； Periarticular\n\n【4】Introduction\n\n【5】Osteogenesis imperfecta is rare inherited connective tissue disorder， being characterized by bone brittleness and increased fracture risk. Its incidence is described at 1：10.000-20.000 live births通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Clinical diagnosis includes fractures from the mildest oftrauma， short stature， bone deformities， blue sclera， dentinogenesis imperfecta and deafness 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. Clinical severity varies from mild forms with only premature osteoporosis or severe postmenopausal bone mineral loss determining normal life expectancy in OI type I， to perinatal death in OI type II. Almost 90% of cases are caused by mutations in the genes encoding type I collagen 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. Perioperative management can be challenging due to difficult airway， respiratory failure due to scoliosis or abnormal platelet function with easy bruisability. It is essential to predict these risks and implement a high-quality management for trauma in such patients. Treatment ofOI depends on the severity and age， the main objectives being to maintain autonomy and prevent long term complications 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. This current case report describes a patient with an unknown genetic disorder and her medical history that led to the diagnosis of osteogenesis imperfecta.\n\n【6】Materials and Methods\n\n【7】In September 2021， a 53 year-old female (body mass 78 kg， height 157 cm， body mass index31.6 kg/m²) was admitted for a minor trauma (same height fall)， which resulted in a complex left acetabular fracture and protrusio acetabuli .\n\n【8】Clinical examination revealed blue sclera ， moderate scoliosis， and mild skeletal deformities of the forearms， dentinogenesis imperfecta and deafness.\n\n【9】Twenty years prior she developed early onset deafness and underwent a stapedectomy for presumably right ear otosclerosis. Her hearing worsen in both ears over the next six years and needed hearing aid. That’s when she was first told she had a genetic disorder， but at the present time she did not possess any medical history， nor remembered any details. Family history revealed the patient’s mother also had blue-gray colored sclera. The patient had multiple rheumatology admissions for osteoporosis， tendinitis and bilateral chronic hip and knee articular pain requiring treatment with analgesics and bisphosphonates (alendronic acid). She also had a history of essential arterial hypertension， gastro esophageal reflux disease and smoking. She required immediate plate osteosynthesis of the posterior column of acetabulum  with normal perioperative evolution， being discharged in good clinical condition.\n\n【10】通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. Corticosteroids induce fat mobilization and may promote fat emboli occlusion of blood vessels， disrupt calcium metabolism and increase osteoclasts activity and bone resorption 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. In January 2022， on a follow up visit the patient had recurrence of acute， severe， left hip articular pain. Although all her previous follow-up visits shown progressive healing of the fracture， this time her radiology report showed aseptic necrosis of the left femoral head ， requiring total hip arthroplasty .\n\n【11】During recovery， in November 2021 she develops respiratory signs of SARS-CoV-2 infection (fever， cough， muscle aches and sore throat) and is diagnosed with a positive RT-PCR test through her family doctor. She had a mild to moderate form and received inpatient low-flow supplemental oxygen therapy via nasal cannula and 8 mg daily dexamethasone for 5 days.\n\n【12】The patient received general anesthesia combined with an ultrasound-guided fascia iliaca block to ensure adequate perioperative analgesia， with good outcome. General anesthesia was preferred over neuroaxial anesthetic procedures due to the coagulopathy found in OI patients which includes reduced platelet aggregation， reduced factor VIII activity and an increased capillary fragility. Difficult airway must be anticipated in these patients and video laryngoscopic or fiber optic endotracheal intubation should be readily available. The moderate scoliosis with restrictive lung disease and long-term effects of COVID-19 like lung fibrosis can impede perioperative respiratory function.\n\n【13】The approach to management of COVID-19 evolves rapidly as clinical data emerge， but corticosteroids are almost a constant in treatment protocols for moderate to severe cases 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. The use of high doses of dexamethasone was lifesaving in many cases，but one adverse effect is corticosteroid induced a vascular necrosis of the femoral head\n\n【14】Results and Discussion\n\n【15】A vascular necrosis of the femoral head can be a consequence of the trauma， it can be corticosteroid-induced， but OI can also删除1换行associate periarticular bone dysplasia and lesions of ischemic origin. Taking that into account， the differential diagnosis can prove difficult in a patient with history of osteoporosis， chronic hip pain and corticosteroid treatment. Considering all of the above， a clinical diagnosis of osteogenesis imperfecta type I was formulated.\n\n【16】OI is also known as “brittle bone disease\" because of high risk of fractures after mild trauma， or ever from transporting or mobilization of patients. Diagnosis of OI on the basis of clinical and radiological findings is straightforward in most cases， but bone mineral density measurements， bone metabolic markers and morphological bone studies may aid the process. Genetic testing can be useful in differentiating between quantitative and qualitative collagen I defects. Bone fragility， osteoporosis and coagulopathy can complicate or prolong surgical interventions. OI is associated with multiple complications， thus the patients require extensive preoperative evaluation and an individualized orthopedic and anesthetic management.\n\n【17】Conclusion\n\n【18】Currently， only symptomatic therapy is available， such as growth hormone or bisphosphonates and surgical treatment is necessary for decreasing the rate of complication. Most of the literature focuses on diagnosis and management of OI in the pediatric population， but the manifestations are lifelong and some cases can be first diagnosed throughout adulthood. In this case the new onset of aseptic necrosis of the femoral head was pluri factorial， corticotherapy-induced， a complication of bone brittleness and ischemic lesions found in OI， as well as the recent history of acetabular fracture. The approach to such a heterogeneous disease should be multidisciplinary in order to assure adequate long-term quality oflife and decreasing complication rates，", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

She was jumping up and down， when a windstorm has raised the jumping mat causing her fall to the ground.\n\nThe patient complained of right shoulder pain with loss of motion， she was conscious and|删除段之间换行|There were associated conservative fractures of left sacral wing， both ischiopubic branches with diastasis of pubic symphysis and a cervical curve inversion at C4-C5.\n\n【27】After the pre-operative preparations had been completed， the patient was taken to the operating room. Considering the age and the grade of displacement， a decision for percutaneous reduction ad fixation with Kirschner wires was taken. In supine position， fluoroscopy guided， closed and percutaneous reduction under general anesthesia and interscalene block， was not suiccessful due to the angulation of fracture stumps； open surgery was therefore necessary. Minimal trans-deltoid access was performed， reduced the fracture and fixed with three K-wires of 1.8 mm .\n\n【28】In post-operative time was placed a shoulder abduction tutor\n\n【29】The patient was postoperatively followed-up for 4 weeks in abduction tutor. Fracture union was identified on the radiographs taken at the end of the postoperative 3r week and 5th week. At the 20-day X-rays check were visible osteo-repairs sign， with indication to starting commuter movements of the right shoulder . At the45-days clinical check  were removed the k-wires ， with indication to the gradual weaning from shoulder tutor during daytime. The night wearing was preserved for the following 15days. The patient was commenced on an exercise program in order to increase the range of motion of her shoulder joint. After an exercise program of 2 weeks， the range of motion of the patient’s joint was almost fully restored. In the postoperative 124h week， it was observed that the range of motion of her joint was comparable to her healthy side. Agonistic activity and weight lifting were not recommended for删除1换行the following 3 months. At the 3-month clinical check the right side shows partial obliteration of the physis with no signs of avascular necrosis ，the ROM of shoulder has been restored，allowing her to resume riding .\n\n【30】At 12 months， the patient showed a complete restoration of the function and full range of motion with neither pain， nor Disabilities of the Arm， Shoulder， and Hand (DASH) score of 1.7/100 .\n\n【31】Discussion\n\n【32】Proximal humerus fractures in children comprise approximately2% of all pediatric fractures， and between 4% to 7% of all epiphyseal fractures 1，5，8，11.\n\n【33】They are usually caused by sport injuries， motor vehicle accidents， or birth trauma， while the usual mechanism of injury is hyperextension combined with external rotation of the shoulder in high-energy trauma 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>.\n\n【34】The diagnosis of these fractures is typically done recurring to radiography. So overall， indications for a CT scan for proximal humerus fractures in children are limited， due to the risk of ionizing radiation on the developing body. In cases with difficulty obtaining orthogonal radiography or in complex fracture pattern or dislocation， CT may be indicated 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>.\n\n【35】A CT-scan total body was performed in our patient because she had suffered a high-energy trauma involving the cervical spine， humerus， pelvis and her abdomen. In our patient anteroposterior radiographs revealed a proximal humerus fracture involving the physis (S-H type II). CT scan and radiographs showed fractures of left sacral wing， both ischiopubic branches with diastasis of pubic symphysis and a cervical curve inversion at C4-C5.\n\nFractures involving the growth plate are classified with the S-H fracture classification 11|.\n\n【37】In literature isolated physeal separation (Salter-Harris I) is seen in new-born and toddlers， with a second peak of physeal separation seen in the young adolescent thrower. In Children from5 to 11 years， the majority of fractures involving the proximal humerus are metaphyseal，whereas Salter-Harris type II fractures are predominantly seen in children 11 years and up. Salter-Harris type III and IV injuries are rarely seen and are usually associated with high-energy trauma 通用删除6(英):<u>[3，9，11]</u>.\n\n【38】About 80% of the longitudinal growth of the humerus occurs at the proximal humeral physis. This high activity level explains the awful remodeling of proximal humerus fractures in the pediatric population. Younger is the patient， higher the remodeling potential\n\n【39】通用删除6(英):<u>[1，8]</u>.\n\n【40】Bone healing and spontaneous remodeling of proximal humerus fractures in children are usually good and non-operative treatment is preferred.\n\n【41】Surgical fixation has traditionally been recommended in proximal humerus fractures when closed reduction is unsatisfactory due to interposed long head of biceps tendon， deltoid muscle or capsule， and in cases of nerve or artery injuries 通用删除6(英):<u>[12，13]</u>.\n\n【42】Percutaneous Kirschner wire pinning is the most usual fixation in children， often combined with closed reduction 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>.\n\n【43】In our patient a closed reduction and synthesis with k-wires was attempted， but ineffective making it necessary resort to reduction with small trans deltoid access. The fixation using k-wires for the Salter-Harris type II humerus fracture had satisfactory outcome.\n\n【44】Although the k-wire fixation was successful， routine use in complex fractures cannot be recommended due to the risk of avascular necrosis. In our study as also reported in that of Umesh at al.， immobilization was maintained for a longer duration and the patient was closely monitored for avascular necrosis 通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u>. In our patient the good outcome may be the combination of intact blood supply and periosteum， intact rotator cuff mechanism， patient’s young age with healthy bone metabolism and achievement of good reduction with restoration of the articular surface and calcar.\n\n【45】Wang et al. reported epiphyseal devascularization in a 10-year-old boy with fracture-dislocation of the shoulder 通用删除6(英):<u>[15，16]</u>， whereas Lee et al. reported avascular necrosis on the humeral head in a 16-year-old boy 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>. In both cases， open reduction was performed 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>.\n\n【46】Dobbs at al. in their study described an 8-year-old boy presented after falling off his bicycle and sustaining a Neer grade IV proximal humeral epiphyseal fractur and a 14-year-old boy sustained a Neer grade IV proximal humeral epiphyseal fracture while playing football. They were treated in the operating room with a successful closed reduction followed by percutaneous pinning with two K-wires. Instead， a 15-year-old boy sustained a Neer grade III proximal humeral epiphyseal fracture from a fall on the basketball， attempted closed reduction of the fracture in the operating room failed. The patient underwent an open reduction through a deltopectoral approach and k-wires fixation.\n\n【47】Treatment protocol for severely displaced fractures of the proximal humeral epiphysis was designed to minimize residual fracture deformityandsubsequentloss of normal shoulder mechanics. Proximal humeral fractures in children， that require management in the operating room， typically are successfully reduced closed and then percutaneously pinned 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>.\n\n【48】In those rare cases in which an acceptable reduction is not obtained closed， an open reduction and internal fixation as in our patient treated with a mini trans-deltoid approach is performed.\n\n【49】Conclusion\n\n【50】Proximal humerus fractures in children commonly occur after a traumatic fall and high-energy trauma. Treatment depends on patient age， fracture displacement and remodeling capacity. Nonoperative management is successful in younger patients or less displaced fractures， instead operative management is usually considered in older patients with more displaced fractures.

Median age at diagnosis is 45 years； there is a small male predominance (58%) 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. ALM appears histologically as a well-circumscribed capsulated tumor； alpha-Smooth Muscle Actin (SMA) positivity on immunohistochemistry is considered a good diagnostic marker 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. Treatment is by surgical excision. Recurrence is uncommon， unless the tumor was not removed completely，and prognosis is good. Malignant transformation has not been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>.\n\n【5】ALM rarely occurs in the oropharynx and oral cavity， especially the tongue base. This report describes a case of tongue-base ALM and the first use of TransOral Robotic Surgery (TORS) for the treatment of ALM in this location.\n\n【6】Case Presentation\n\n【7】A 72-year-old man presented with hoarseness， muffled voice， stridor， and mild dyspnea that appeared during minor physical activity， in addition to unintentional weight loss of 4 kg in the last vear. His medical history was remarkable.\n\n【8】Clinical examination revealed an oropharyngeal tongue-base lesion and an offensive smell from the oral cavity. Laryngoscopy exposed a vascular 2.6 cm mass pushing the epiglottis posteriorly and filling the vallecula inferiorly . Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) revealed an oval well-circumscribed space-occupying lesion located between the tongue base and epiglottis，hyperintense throughout and strongly enhanced on T2-weighted scans. The lesion caused partial obstruction of the oropharyngeal airways with slight asymmetry to the left . No metastases were identified.\n\nConsidering the benign appearance of the tumor and its high vascularity， a preoperative biopsy was not taken to avoid the risk of excessive bleeding which could lead to airway obstruction. Accordingly， concerns of intraoperative bleeding prompted the use of preoperative endovascular embolization， which was performed by an invasive neuroradiologist under general anesthesia. Diagnostic catheter angiography demonstrated that the left lingual artery was the sole supply source to the lesion. Therapeutic catheterization was followed by endovascular embolization using a coaxial catheter system.

He was treated with antibiotics (cefamezin and metronidazole) and decannulated prior to discharge within 5 days. At the 1-year follow-up， there were no signs of local recurrence， and the stoma was closed.\n\n【11】Postoperative histopathologic examination revealed a well-circumscribed 2.3-cm ALM composed of myocytes and vascular spaces， with no nuclear atypia and low mitotic activity. Immunohistochemistry staining was negative for HMB45， S100， and desmin， and positive for SMA. Ki67 proliferation index was 4% to 5%， indicating a benign neoplasm .\n\n【12】Discussion\n\n【13】We presented a case of ALM in the tongue base. To our knowledge， a few cases of tongue ALM have been described， and only several specifically in the tongue base 通用删除6(英):<u>[4-6]</u>.\n\n【14】The clinical differential diagnosis of ALM of the tongue includes hemangioma， lymphangioma， vascular malformation， abscess， lingual thyroid， and other benign mesenchymal tumors such as fibroma， neurofibroma， and granular cell lesion. In our case， the intense enhancement of the lesion on T2-weighted images and T1-weighted images with gadolinium pointed to a hypervascular pattern， narrowing the differential diagnosis to a vascular mass.\n\n【15】Surgical approaches to tongue-base tumors include transoral excision， submandibular approach， suprahyoid OT lateral pharyngotomy， and lip split with mandibulotomy. For small and well-encapsulated lesions， transoral excision is preferred.

The technique yielded good outcomes with minimum complications but was limited by lack of depth perception and low visualization ofthe surgical field with inadequate lesion exposure 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>.\n\n【16】More recently， Danic et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u> and Kim et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u> described two cases of tongue-base ALM， in a 76-year-old man and a 2-month-old infant， respectively， who underwent endoscopic surgery with a harmonic scalpel. Additionally， Marden et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u> managed a tongue-base ALM that bled vigorously during diagnostic biopsy with endovascularembolization followed one daylater byhemiglossectomy with mass resection.\n\n【17】In the present case， the vascularity of the tumor prompted our decision to perform preoperative endovascular embolization of the selective tumor-feeding branch (left lingual artery)， as described by Marden et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>， followed by surgical excision. However， unlike the previous cases 通用删除6(英):<u>[4-6]</u>， we used a TORS approach. TORS has been reported to overcome the limitations of traditional surgical methods andto improve surgeon dexterity，precision， and depthperception 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>. By providing three-dimensional visualization， it allows for complete tumor removal with fewer complications while preserving important structures and nerves. We found the procedure to be safe and efficient for excision of a tongue-base ALM. The main disadvantages of TORS are the relatively high operating costs and absence of tactile feedback. However， the advantages seem to outweigh the disadvantages. This report supports the use of a robotic minimal invasive technique for excision and partial glossectomy of benign lesions at the tongue base， especially vascular lesions like ALM.\n\n【18】In conclusion， we report a rare case of a tongue-base ALM that posed treatment challenges owing to its vascularity and difficult location. Treatment consisted of embolization and tracheostomy followed by TORS excision. To our knowledge， this is the first report documenting treatment of tongue-base ALM using TORS.

Traditional linear system could underestimate orthopedic effects and overestimate dentoalveolar side effects. Angular measurements should be preferred.\n\n【5】Introduction\n\n【6】Rapid Palatal Expansion (RPE) was first described by E.C. Angell in 1860 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Since then， many types of RPE appliances have been developed 通用删除6(英):<u>[2-4]</u> with different rates of expansion， but the principles are essentially the same 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. Palatal expanders separate the midpalatal suture， leading to skeletal orthopedic expansion 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. RPE also opens the circum-maxillary sutural systems depending on their anatomic location and degree of interdigitation 通用删除6(英):<u>[7，8]</u>.\n\n【7】Because conventional RPE appliances by design transmit the expansion forces through the teeth， alveolar bone bending and dental tipping are inevitable， particularly in older patients 通用删除6(英):<u>[9，10]</u>. To ensure expansion of the basal bone without surgical intervention while attempting to minimize dental side effects， micro-implants have been utilized in conjunction with RPE devices， known as Microimplant-Assisted Rapid Palatal Expanders (MARPE) 通用删除6(英):<u>[11-14]</u>.\n\n【8】Although MARPE appliances have been designed to enhance the orthopedic effect of maxillary expansion， dental tipping and alveolar bone bending has been reported in previous studies from RPE/MARPE appliances 通用删除6(英):<u>[9，10，13-16]</u>. Additionally， past studies have relied solely on linear measurements with no consideration to the rotational nature of the maxillary expansion 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>.\n\n【9】There is no consensus regarding the fulcrum anatomic location of the maxillary bone during删除1换行maxillary expansion. Some studies have reported this center of rotation to be localized at the frontomaxillary suture 通用删除6(英):<u>[6，18-20]</u> while others point it close to the superior orbital fissure 通用删除6(英):<u>[21，22]</u>. A recent Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) study with Midfacial Skeletal Expander (MSE) has established that the zygomatic bone and maxilla move as a unit consistently， with its fulcrum slightly above the frontozygomatic suture in the coronal plane 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>. Since the expansion with MSE is Archial in nature and the fulcrum location can be defined， perhaps an angular measurement system should be used to assess the expansion pattern ofthis appliance.\n\n【10】This methodological paper aims to present a novel angular measurement systemthat can accurately represent the MSE expansion outcomes having as a reference the precise localization of the rotational fulcrum of the zygomaticomaxillary complex in the coronal plane.\n\n【11】Materialand Methods\n\n【12】Institutional review board approval (IRB number 16-001662) was granted by the University of California， Los Angeles (UCLA). Two cases are presented， consisting of pre-treatment and post-expansion CBCT records of a 20 years old male and an 18 years old female， who were treated with MSE (Biomaterials Korea， Seoul，Korea) appliance. The patients were diagnosed with maxillary transverse deficit and posterior crossbite， without craniofacial irregularity nor previous orthodontic treatment. Treatment was performed at the Section of Orthodontics， UCLA School of Dentistry， under supervision of one clinician.\n\n【13】MSE was indicated in lieu of traditional tooth-borne expanders， based on patients’ maturity and cervical vertebral maturation stage higher than CS4 通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u>. An MSE device  consists of a jackscrew unit with four holes， housing the palatal micro-implants which engage the palatal bone bicortically. Additionally， two删除1换行supporting arms extend from the jackscrew and are soldered to the molar bands. The rate of expansion was 2 turns per day (0.25 mm per turn) until a significant diastema of 2 mm to 3 mm. appeared； then the rate changed to 1 turn per day. MSE activation was stopped when the maxillary skeletal width， defined in Figure 1， matched or was greater than the mandibular width. The MSE was maintained in place with no further activation for at least 6 months during the restructuring of the suture.\n\n【14】The CBCT scans were taken before expansion and within 3weeks after completion of the expansion. The time between the scans was 3 months for both patients. In order to assess the outcomes induced purely by MSE， the post-expansion scans were obtained before patient received any other orthodontic appliances. A CBCT scanner (5G； NewTom， Verona， Italy) was used， with an 18 cmx16cm field of view， 14-bit gray scale， and a standard voxel size of 0.3mm. Configuration of the CBCT included scan time of 18 sec (3.6sec emission time)， with 110 kV. An automated exposure control system was used to detect the patient s anatomic density， to properly adjust the milliamperes. On demand 3D (Cybermed， Daejeon，Korea) software was used for superimposing the pre-expansion and post-expansion CBCT images 通用删除6(英):<u>[25]</u>.\n\n【15】Localization of fulcrum\n\n【16】After superimposition of CBCT images， the following steps were taken to localize the fulcrum of the zygomaticomaxillary complex. The maxillary sagittal plane was identified 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>， passing through the anterior nasal spine， posterior nasal spine， and nasion on the pre-expansion CBCT image . Then the coronal zygomatic section  was selected. This section passes through the uppermost point of the frontozygomatic sutures and the lowermost point of the zygomaticomaxillary sutures. The previous study by Cantarella 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u> indicated that fulcrum is near the external surface of the frontozygomatic suture because the suture is the weakest point during the Archial movement of midfacial structure. The most external and inferior points of the zygomatic processes of the frontal bones were chosen as initial reference points. The interfrontal distance between these two reference points were measured on both pre-and post-expansion CBCT images . If these two measurements were different， the correct fulcrum points must be more superiorly located. A parallel line slightly above the initial interfrontal line was used to identify the true fulcrums by incrementally moving this line upwards until both pre- and post-expansion distances were equal. This newly established line with no width changes was named the modified interfrontal distance， and the most external points of this line were denoted as the right and left rotational fulcrum respectively(Case 1， ). If the initial interfrontal distances (pre- and删除1换行post-expansion) were the same， the most external points of this\n\n【17】Novel angular measurement system\n\nFrom the rotational fulcrum， three angular measurements were selected to differentiate the skeletal， alveolar and dental components of the expansion. The following angular measurements were selected： The Frontozygomatic Angle (FZA) is an angle between the interfrontal line and the line extending from fulcrum to the most external point of the zygomaticomaxillary suture， the Fronto-Alveolar Angle (FAA) is an angle between the interfrontal line and the line extending from fulcrum to the alveolar bone surface at the level of distobuccal root tip ofthe upper first molars， and the Fronto-Dental Angle (FDA) is an angle between the interfrontal line and|删除段之间换行|With the same coronal zygomatic section， a set of traditional linear distance measurements were employed . The Zygomaticomaxillary Line (ZML)， the Alveolar Bone Line (ABL)， and the Dental Line (DL) are perpendicular lines connecting the three landmarks used for the above angular measurements to the intersecting points on the maxillary sagittal plane. The changes in the three sets of linear measurements， before and after the MSE treatment， were calculated for both sides in order to determine the treatment change of each component. The ZML changes describes删除1换行the Zygomaticomaxillary skeletal changes (ZML changes)； the ABL changes as the sum of the skeletal change (ZML change) and the alveolar bone bending (ZML changes-ABL changes)； and the DL changes as the sum of the skeletal change (ZML change)， alveolar bone bending (ZML changes-ABL changes) and the dental tipping(DL changes-ABL changes).\n\n【19】Statistical analysis\n\n【20】All measurements were obtained three times by 2 raters， to assess method reliability. Measurements were then repeated after 2 weeks by the same operators. Additionally， to compare linear and angular measurements for the two selected cases， both linear and angular measurements of the three components were transformed to relative percentages from the total expansion， the fronto-dental changes.\n\n【21】Results\n\n【22】The amounts of activation of the MSE expansion jackscrew were11.5 for the male patient and 7.5 for the female patient. The duration of maxillary expansion was 23 and 15 days respectively.\n\n【23】For the male case selected， the treatment change with linear measurements at the zygomaticomaxillary level was 4 mm and 3.95mm (right and left sides)， at the alveolar bone level was 0.77 mm and0.49 mm. (right and left sides)， and at the dental level was 1.61 mm and 1.7 mm. (right and left sides). These values suggest 62.7% and64.33% (right and left sides) skeletal expansion， 12.06% and 7.98%(right and left sides) alveolar bone bending， and 25.24% and 27.69%(right and left sides) dental tipping. In contrast， the treatment change with angular measurements at the zygomaticomaxillary level was 4.3and 4.4 (right and left sides)， at the alveolar bone level was 0 (both right and left sides)， and at the dental level was 0° (both right and left sides). These values represent 100% skeletal expansion for the right and left sides， 0% alveolar bone bending and dental tipping for the right and left sides .\n\n【24】For the female case selected， the treatment change with linear measurements at the zygomaticomaxillary level was 1.61 mm and1.97 mm (right and left sides)， at the alveolar bone level was 0.37 mm删除1换行and 0.78 mm. (right and left sides)， and at the dental level was 1.41mm and 1.06 mm. (right and left sides). These values suggest 47.79%and 51.7% (right and left sides) skeletal expansion， 10.91% and20.47% (right and left sides) alveolar bone bending， and 41.6% and27.83%(right and left sides) dental tipping. In contrast， the treatment change with angular measurements at the zygomaticomaxillary level was 2° and 2.1 (right and left sides)， at the alveolar bone level was 0o(both right and left sides)， and at the dental level was 0.3° and 0.4(both right and left sides). These values represent 89.96% and 84%of skeletal expansion for the right and left sides， 0% alveolar bone bending for right and left sides and dental tipping of 13.04% and 16%for the right and left sides respectively . For the considered parameters， the ICC value was 0.95.\n\n【25】Discussion\n\n【26】Each expansion device produces expansion force directed at different parts of craniofacial structure， depending on its design and the means of anchorage. The expansion pattern can greatly vary from one appliance to another. MacGinnis 通用删除6(英):<u>[26]</u> illustrated the difference between MSE and Hyrax using FEM simulation. A study on FEM located the fulcrum around the upper border of the orbit 通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u>， while others stated that is placed near the frontomaxillary suture 通用删除6(英):<u>[18，20，26]</u>. Other studies on FEM mention that the maxillary center of rotation is located near the superior orbital fissure 通用删除6(英):<u>[22，27]</u>； that in agreement with the results of Gardner and Kronman 通用删除6(英):<u>[28]</u> in a study with rhesus monkeys. Even micro-implant supported expanders exhibit various pattern of expansion 通用删除6(英):<u>[11，17]</u>， based on the anchor placement， depth of implant engagement， expansion protocol， etc. 通用删除6(英):<u>[11，28]</u>. The MSE has a unique feature， promoting skeletal movement in Archial Imanner， around the fulcrum located near the frontozygomatic sutures. Cantarella 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u> has illustrated this effect but the precise location of the fulcrum was not clearly defined， only indicating that it is near the frontozygomatic suture. In the current study， additional steps were taken to further define the true points of rotation. The interfrontal distance which connects two fulcrums should not change with the expansion.

By applying these concepts， the fulcrum positions were identified. Arbitrarily， the most external and inferior points of the right and left zygomatic processes of the frontal bone were used for initial interfrontal distance measurements. If the distance changed with expansion， the line was moved upward until the distance was删除1换行stable (Case 1). If this initial interfrontal distance did not change， the line was moved downward and verified that the distance increased below the initial reference points (Case 2). Once these fulcrum points were established， one additional step was taken， in order to ensure that these were truly the points of rotation. According to the Reuleaux technique 通用删除6(英):<u>[29]</u>， at least two corresponding landmarks\n\n| Table 2： Linear and angular measurements for female case.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  | Skeletal expansion  | Alveolar bone bending  | Dental tipping  |\n|  | Right linear measurements  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Unit  | ▲a  | Ab  | Ac  | ▲a  | Ab-Aa  | Ac-Ab  |\n| mm.  | 1.61 mm.  | 1.98mm.  | 3.39 mm.  | 1.61  | 0.37  | 1.41  |\n| %  |  |  |  | 47.49%  | 10.91%  | 41.60%  |\n|  | Right angular measurements  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | ▲a  | Ab  | Ac  | ▲a  | Ab-Aa  | Ac-Ab  |\n| mm.  | 20  | 20  | 2.3°  | 2°  | 0°  | 0.3°  |\n| %  |  |  |  | 86.96%  | 0%  | 13.04%  |\n|  | Left linear measurements  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | ▲a  | Ab  | AC  | ▲a  | Ab-Aa  | Ac-Ab  |\n| mm.  | 1.97 mm.  | 2.75 mm.  | 3.81 mm.  | 1.97  | 0.78  | 1.06  |\n| %  |  |  |  | 51.70%  | 20.47%  | 27.83%  |\n|  | Left angular measurements  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | ▲a  | Ab  | Ac  | ▲a  | Ab-▲a  | Ac-Ab  |\n| mm.  | 2.1°  | 2.1°  | 2.5°  | 2.1°  | 0°  | 0.4°  |\n| %  |  |  |  | 84%  | 0%  | 16%  |\n\n【30】Aa： Skeletal expansion， Ab： Skeletal expansion + Alvealar bone bending， Ac： Skeletal expansion + Alvealar bone bending +Dental tipping删除1换行must show uniform displacement around a single point， to be able to pinpoint a center of rotation. The displacement of two separate landmarks within a zygomatic process around the proposed fulcrum were measured， and they showed uniform displacements， indicating the fulcrum position was accurate .\n\n【31】The fulcrum positions for these two individuals were identified by the findings from previous studies of MSE and by applying additional measurements； however， the fulcrum position may vary greatly with other expansion devices because of the design differences described above. Since most of the expansion devices lack fulcrum information， the pattern of expansion was customarily described by linear width changes of various points within the structures. If the skeletal movement was Archial in nature as seen in MSE cases， the differential movements measured by these linear distances introduce inherent error. The linear distance changes were greater for the landmarks further away from the fulcrum， falsely exaggerating the magnitude of alveolar bone bending and dental tipping . This effect was examined by applying both linear measurements often used traditionally and novel angular measurements stemming from the fulcrum points.\n\n【32】Two MSE cases were selected to illustrate the difference between the angular andlinear measurements. The first case was a male patient who had received MSE treatment with optimal quality expansion. When the angular measurements were employed ， the results clearly indicated that there was no alveolar bone bending or dental tipping， but the entire movement was a skeletal rotation from the fulcrum， identified from the first part of this study. On the other hand， the linear measurements  yielded different results with exaggeration of the dentoalveolar components： 12% R and 8% L bone bending， and 25% R and 28%L dental tipping . Because the movement was in Archial configuration， the structures further away from the fulcrum were displaced more . These discrepancies inlinearlength change can be misinterpreted as the alveolar bone bending and the dental tipping were significant components of the expansion. However， the angular measurements indicated that the expansion was purely删除1换行skeletal， with midfacial rotation and with no additional bone bending or dental tipping. With MSE， both zygomatic bone and maxilla were rotating around the fulcrum， without significant bone bending or dental tipping 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>. The MSE is placed at the palatal vault， close to the center of resistance， and the micro-implants were engaged bicortically promoting superior expansion. The MSE produced an orthopedic response， causing the fulcrum to be near the weaker frontozygomatic suture 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>. The best way to differentiate the percentage of skeletal expansion， alveolar bone bending and dental tipping for MSE is to use the angular measurements from this fulcrum. This novel measurement system can eliminate the inherent error associated with the linear distant measurements discussed above.\n\n【33】The second case was a female patient who has a successful split of midpalatal suture but with difficulties， yielding some tipping of the implants during the expansion . Some bone bending and dental tipping was anticipated with this patient， and this case was chosen to prove that the novel angular measurements can illustrate these changes. The angular measurements  indicated that most of the expansion was skeletal (87%R and 84%L). There was no alveolar bone bending but some dental tipping (13% R and 16% L). As the implants tipped during the expansion， the molars experienced some buccal tipping， but the alveolar process did not move further away from the zygoma as the midfacial complex was rotating from the fulcrum . On the other hand， the linear measurements yielded very different results with exaggeration of the dentoalveolar components 11% R and 20% L bone bending， and42% R and 28% L dental tipping . These sets of numbers indicate entirely different expansion pattern， emphasizing that linear measurements are severely inaccurate in assessing Archial movement， as seen in MSE.\n\n【34】In the past， many studies 通用删除6(英):<u>[10，13-16，20，30]</u> have evaluated the maxillary expansion outcomes with linear measurements. Assuming that the fulcrums of these changes were above the landmarks they have chosen for the distance measurements， the linear distance changes for the alveolar bending and dental expansion were probably exaggerated， simply by the fact that these landmarks were further删除1换行away from the fulcrum. If we assume that the skeletal expansion is Archial in nature， the intermolar distance will increase more than the skeletal components， even with pure skeletal rotation. The actual dental tipping may be much less than the reported values. However， the angular measurements can also have inherent errors if they are measured from the wrong fulcrum. The fulcrum location may vary with each appliance， and the origin of the angular measurements must be identified.\n\n【35】Obtaining the accurate measurements differentiating skeletal， dentoalveolar and dental expansion is a difficult task， as illustrated above. Two conditions must be met in order to produce accurate valuation： The identification of the true fulcrum and the designing of the angular measurements from this fulcrum. Each appliance presumably has different fulcrum location， and it is important to identifythe accurate position. With MSE， the fulcrum waslocated near the frontozygomatic suture 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>. In this study， this area was further explored， in order to define the precise fulcrum position， utilizing the superimposed CBCT images，acquired before and after the expansion. Subsequently， the three angular measurements from this fulcrum were used to differentiate skeletal， alveolar and dental components of the expansion. By using these angular measurements radiating from the fulcrum， the above-mentioned problems with linear distance measurements can be eliminated. This new mathematical approach illustrated that commonly used linear analysis may not be the best way to assess the differential components of maxillary expansion.\n\n【36】Tn thiIsSstudythe precise rotational fulcrumof the zygomaticomaxillary complex after MSE treatment was determined， and a novel angular measurement system that accurately assesses the expansion outcomes has been developed. The results obtain from the cases in this study are not representative for all the MSE cases. These cases were selected to illustrate a novel methodology that can accurately assess expansion of MSE. A further study will be conducted in order to assess the overall impact of MSE treatment，by applyingthe method developed in this study to all MSE cases. Further studies in defining the fulcrum locations for other expansion appliances would be beneficial in accurately determining the expansion outcomes.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

He received 8 cycles of AC-T chemotherapy in the early stage of triple negative invasive ductal carcinoma， followed by local radiotherapy. Follow up until Tune 2022 showed no tumor recurrence or metastasis.\n\n【15】Discussion\n\n【16】Adenoid cystic carcinoma of breast is a rare and special type of breast cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>， the incidence of which accounts for about 0.1% of all breast malignancies 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>， and the patients are mostly elderly women通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. In 2012， WHO classification of breast tumors was defined as breast cancer with low malignant potential， morphologically similar to adenoid cystic carcinoma occurring in salivary glands， which can be cured by simple mastectomy 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. Adenoid cystic carcinoma was classified into rare tumors and salivary gland tumors in the fift edition of WHO classification of breast tumors published in 2019， and its diagnosis was consistent with that of adenoid cystic carcinoma of the salivary gland 通用删除6(英):<u>[5-7]</u>. Invasive ductal carcinoma is the most common type of invasive breast cancer without specific types通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. It is extremely rare for both of them to be independently and originally from unilateral breast cancer. In the process of domestic literature review， only a case of bilateral primary breast cancer with unilateral adenoid cystic carcinoma reported by Xiao Xuewen et al. was found 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>， and a case of mixed adenoid cystic carcinoma and ductal carcinoma of breast cancer reported by Kontos et al. was found in foreign literature search 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>. In addition， individual cases of adenoid cystic carcinoma mixed with small cell carcinoma 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u> and spindle cell melanoma 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u> were reviewed and analyzed. Independent primary adenoid cystic carcinoma and invasive ductal carcinoma of the same breast were rarely reported.\n\n【17】Thehistological characteristics ofbreast adenoid cystic carcinoma in frozen sections are often not obvious， and due to the limitations of frozen material extraction and production， it is often difficul to distinguish it from other benign and malignant breast tumors，leading to misdiagnosis. Among the 8 cases of adenoid cystic carcinoma of the breast reported by Liu Yufei et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>， 5 cases underwent intraoperative rapid freezing examination，and only 1 case was clearly diagnosed. This case of intraoperative freezing was also a tumor with a descriptive cribriform and trabecular tubular arrangement， which was not clearly diagnosed； when the tumor mainlypresents as a sieve-like structure， the following types need to be identified： 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> Invasive sieve-like carcinoma： An invasive carcinoma with a significant sieve-like structure， often accompanied by tubular carcinoma components， with mucoprotein secretions and dead bodies visible in the sieve pores. The tumor cells lack neoplastic myoepithelial cells， mainly glandular epithelial cells， with immunohistochemical ER and PR positive， and CD117 and myoepithelial markers negative. Adenoid删除1换行cystic carcinoma exhibits invasive growth and heterogeneous tissue structure. Tubular， trabecular， and ethmoidal structures， as well as basement membrane like or mucoid substances in the lumen， are important clues for diagnosis. Morphological glandular epithelial cells are mixed with myoepithelial and basal like cells， with typical immunohistochemical ER and PR negative， and positive staining for CD117， myoepithelial Calponin， and p63 are helpful for differential diagnosis； 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> Sieve shaped ductal carcinoma in situ： Intraductal lesions in which the glandular epithelium exhibits a sieve shaped neoplastic proliferation. The tumor cells are relatively consistent and both ER and PR are diffusely positive. Myoepithelial cells exist around the duct， and myoepithelial cells such as p63，Calponin， and SMA are positive， while CD117 is negative， which is helpful for differential diagnosis.\n\n【18】The main diseases that need to be differentiated from invasive ductal carcinoma include 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> sclerosing adenopathy： A tubular adenopathy with lobular hyperplasia accompanied by fibrosis and sclerotic interstitial hyperplasia that constitutes a pathological change in the conscience， but its gland/tubule compression is obvious， making it difficul to identify the double layer cellular structure， and its growth pattern is similar to nerve invasion， especially in intraoperative rapid freezing and biopsy of small specimens， which is difficul to distinguish. Diagnosis needs to be very careful， and can be made with the help of calponin immunohistochemical staining of muscle epithelium such as p63 was used to label the remaining lobular structures on the muscle epithelia to assist in diagnosis. 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> Invasive lobular carcinoma： The classic type often presents a private like or target circular arrangement， and the atypical morphology of the two often overlaps， making it difficul to distinguish. Immunohistochemistry P120 and E-cadherin can be used to assist in the differential diagnosis： Both invasive ductal carcinomas are positive for cell membrane； the cytoplasm of lobular carcinoma P120was positive， while E-cadherin was negative.\n\n【19】In differential diagnosis， it can be seen that immunohistochemical CD117 can be specifically expressed in adenoid cystic carcinoma， mainly related to regulatory genes. Research has found that C-KIT is one of the downstream genes regulated by MYB， and C-KIT mutations can be detected in adenoid cystic carcinoma at different sites such as salivary gland and breast， and their protein products express CD117 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>. At the same time， the literature suggests that about half of adenoid cystic carcinoma is accompanied by the MYB-NFIB fusion gene， but the use of the C-KIT targeted drug imatinib has poor efficac in treating adenoid cystic carcinoma 通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u>， So the treatment is still primarily surgical. The treatment of invasive ductal carcinoma has shifted from surgery+hormone+neoadjuvant treatment to neoadjuvant treatment+surgical treatment， provided that HER2 testing is positive and trastuzumab can be used for targeted treatment.\n\n【20】In summary， simultaneous independent primary adenoid cystic carcinoma and invasive ductal carcinoma of the unilateral breast are extremely rare， with unique histomorphology，immunohistochemical characteristics， and biological behavior. It is necessary to accumulate case summary diagnosis and treatment experience.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

The most prevalent tumors occurring in pregnant females are malignant melanoma(2.8/1000)， followed by carcinoma of the cervix (1/2200) and breast (1/3000). A review of the literature didn't find any convincing evidence that pregnancy has a deleterious impact on the incidence of clinical profile of malignancy as compared to non-pregnant women of reproductive age， except in the case of malignant melanoma.\n\n【2】Urological malignancy in pregnancy is rare and poses a diagnostic and treatment challenge. Here， we report a case of non-muscle invasive bladder carcinoma in the pregnant female， successfully managed by TURBT (Transurethral Resection of Bladder Tumor)，resulting in good maternal and fetal outcomes.\n\n【3】Keywords： TURBT； Non-muscle invasive bladder cancer； Pregnancy\n\n【4】Introduction\n\n【5】Urological malignancies are very uncommon in pregnancy， with an overall incidence ofaround1/1000 pregnancies 通用删除6(英):<u>[1-3]</u>. Though rare， they can impose particular problems in diagnosis and management during pregnancy as fetal wellbeing has to be kept in mind too.\n\n【6】Case Presentation\n\n【7】A 25-year-old pregnant woman in the 36th week of gestation was presented to the hospital owing to painless gross intermittent hematuria with clots for the last four months. She denied any history suggestive ofurinary tract infections， renal calculus， or other genitourinary complaints. Herprenatal course had been otherwise uneventful， and she had no history of such urological complaints. She was a nonsmoker， nonalcoholic， and had no history of occupational or chemical exposure. On examination， the patient was pallor， normotensive， afebrile， and had stable vitals and voiding of wine-colored urine with blood clots. The fetus was active and the fetal heart sounds were strong. There was no evidence of vaginal bleeding. Her complete blood count was within normal limits except for normocytic normochromic anemia (Hemoglobin 9.2 gm/dl). Blood urea nitrogen，serum creatinine， viral markers， and coagulation survey were non-contributory. Her urine analysis showed numerous red blood cells with no casts or crystals and her urine culture was negative. Ultrasound examination revealed mild pregnancy-related hydronephrosis without any calculus and single space-occupying， papillarylesion of size approximately 2 cm x2 cm with high vascularity was noted at the right anterior wall of the bladder， suggestive of bladder tumor. The kidneys were normal in appearance. A single live fetus without any uterine abnormalities was noted.\n\n【8】She was being followed conservatively but in meantime， she started to have severe gross hematuria with clots retention leading to a fall in hemoglobin (6.2 gm/dl). She was managed by cystoscopy and clots evacuation followed by two units of blood transfusion. On cystoscopy， a growth of 2 cm x2 cm in size was noted at the anterior bladder wall that was bleeding profusely.\n\n【9】A decision was taken to fulgurate and bipolar Transurethral Resection of Bladder Tumor(TURBT) in the same sitting under spinal anesthesia. The procedure was uneventful. On 2nd postoperative day， severe fetal distress was noted， the cause of which was unknown. A decision of Lower Section Cesarean Section (LSCS) was taken by a treating obstetrician and was performed.\n\n【10】The postoperative periods were uneventful， with mother and baby both being healthy and recovering. The patient and the baby were discharged on postoperative day 8.\n\n【11】The TURBT tissue specimen sent for histopathological evaluation revealed transitional cell carcinoma of the urinary bladder of TaG 1 grade. Follow-up cystoscopy on 3r-month follow-up was unremarkable.己\n\n【12】Discussion\n\n【13】In men， bladder carcinoma is one of the most common malignancies，but its occurrence in women is quiet less， with a male to female ratio of 3-4：1通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. It usually presents in the 6h and 74 decades of life. In young pregnant women， chances of the bladder carcinoma are very low. Pregnancy and malignancy are among the biological conditions in which antigen tissue is tolerated by a competent immune system 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>.\n\n【14】The majority of these cases usually present in the second or third trimester with painless hematuria. Hematuria presenting during pregnancy always warrants prompt evaluation， keeping bladder cancer as a differential diagnosis in mind. Diagnosis of bladder carcinoma during pregnancy can pose a dilemma， as symptoms are often misleading， i.e. frequency and nocturia are usually mistaken as they can arise throughout pregnancy in healthy females too， thus delaying the diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. It is further complicated as for the patient， identification of the source of bleeding is often difficult and is frequently mistaken for obstetric hemorrhage or more common benign lesions such as cystitis. Although cystitis is the commonest cause of hematuria during pregnancy 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>， complete work-up is needed if a response to treatment is not satisfactory but firstly， painless vaginal bleeding due to placenta previa must be excluded since this needs prompt obstetrical intervention. Although bladder carcinoma is quite rare in pregnant women， gross hematuria should be managed with a high index of suspicion to rule out the possibility and timely management of bladder malignancy. Flexible cystoscopy is considered safe and the most useful test in the evaluation ofhematuria pregnancy. Transurethral IResection of the Bladder Tumor(TURBT) under regional or general anesthesia is considered safe to perform irrespective of the gestational period 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. If the malignant potential of the tumor is high， then termination of pregnancy is considered during the early gestational period for maternal survival， followed by management of malignancy. There are only 27 cases reported of bladder mass with pregnancy out of which eight cases were managed with TURBT during the intrapartum period followed by an uneventful continuation of pregnancy till term or near term， thus ensuing fetal well-being simultaneously通用删除6(英):<u>[6-9]</u>.\n\n【15】In this case， as the patient was having profuse bleeding from bladder growth， so we decided to go for fulguration and TURBT.\n\n【16】Unfortunately， the fetal distress of unknown cause resulted in emergencyLSCS. The current casehighlights the successfulprocedural outcome of TURBT for the mother but the risk remains for the fetus although TURBT is considered safe generally. In our case， though we couldn't ascertain the exact cause of fetal distress， still the procedure can be considered as one of the culprits. The authors want to shed light on the TURBT in pregnancy as a not-so-safe procedure but it remains a choice to perform in a patient with persistent hematuria where conservative treatment fails to continue pregnancy till term. Close and proper monitoring of both the maternaland fetal conditions remains crucial during the postoperative follow-up period.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

Here， we present a patient with isolated neutropenia from decreased production secondary to Vitamin B12(VitB12) deficiency due to Pernicious Anemia (PA).\n\n【2】Case Study\n\n【3】A 31-year-old Hispanic male with a history oftreated gonorrhea six months prior， presented to the ED with neutropenic fever， malaise， flank pain and was found to have severe neutropenia.On admission， he was hypotensive and febrile. Complete blood count demonstrated leukopenia at 1.02×10/uL with severe neutropenia， absolute neutrophil count of 0.02×10/uL，and elevated myelocyte precursors and blasts. Red blood cells were normocytic， and the blood smear did not demonstrate hyper-segmented neutrophils. A comprehensive metabolic panel demonstrated an elevated protein gap at 5.2. Human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis virus testing were negative， and protein electrophoresis was within normal limits. VitB12 level was <146 pg/mL， methylmalonic acid was126 nmol/L， and Intrinsic Factor (IF) antibody was positive. CT abdomen/pelvis and Chest X-ray showed no acute findings. He was started on 1，000 micrograms daily VitB12 injections with prompt symptomatic improvement and improvement of lab values. Over the course of hospitalization， WBC count increased from a low of 0.58 ×10/uL to a high of 1.88 ×10/uL prior to discharge， and absolute neutrophil count showed an 1，100% increase from 0.02×10/uL to 0.24×10/uL. The patient was discharged with instructions to continue daily Vit B12 injections for one week， followed by weekly， then monthly injections.\n\n【4】Discussion\n\n【5】Vitamin B12 (VitB12) aids in the synthesis of Deoxyribonucleic Acids (DNA) and myelin and is naturally found in animal products 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>.

A positive IF antibody consistent with PA， and prompt resolution of symptoms as well as normalization of neutrophil count following Vit B12 treatment confirms the diagnosis. Clinicians should be aware of the multiple etiologies associated with neutropenia and should consider the evaluation of VitB12 levels in the absence of other diagnostic findings.\n\n【6】1.

The chest x-ray suggested cardiomegaly and bilateral pleural effusions both of which were new compared to 2 years ago. Inflammatory markers were raised. Sepsis 6 protocols were followed including treatment with broad spectrum antibiotics. A CTPA was performed and showed bilateral pleural effusions and a moderate globalpericardialeffusion. Bedside echocardiographythe next morning confirmed a moderate global pericardial effusion. No clear echocardiographic features of tamponade were present and no pulsus paradoxus elicited but in view of her resistant hypotension requiring inotropes despite adequate filling a decision was made to perform urgent pericardiocentesis. An urgent pericardiocentesis was performed and an immediate improvement in blood pressure was observed. The pericardial fluid had an unusual creamy color and slightly viscous consistency. Pericardial fluid cultures later confirmed the presence of Haemophilus Influenzae. A Mirena coil was inserted one month prior to admission. A high vaginal swab from the intrauterine mirena coil revealed H. Influenzae infection and prompted removal of the device and full recovery of the patient. We have reviewed PubMed and found 10 cases of H. Influenzae pericardial effusion and tamponade in adults. This appears to be the first reported case where the primary focus of Haemophilus Influenzae appears to have been related to an intrauterine device. It also illustrates the importance of considering tamponade where classical physical and echocardiographic signs are not present.\n\n【2】Keywords： Haemophilus influenzae； Pericarditis\n\n【3】Patient Presentation\n\n【4】通用间距删除-1:<u>OPEN ACCESS</u>\n\n【5】通用间距删除-1:<u>Correspondence：Evangelos Tzolos， Department of Cardiology Royal infirmary Edinburgh，51 Little France Cres， Edinburgh， Scotland， EH16 4SA， UK，</u>\n\n【6】An otherwise healthy 47 year old lady was admitted to the medical admissions unit of our District General Hospital with a one week history ofpericarditis chest pain， followed by collapse.

In this group， the frequency of increasing the content of T-helpers and decreasing the content of cytotoxic T-cells in patients with severe asthma without concomitant diseases was 1.3 times more frequent than in patients with comorbid pathology. No pathological changes in the T-system were detected in patients with controlled asthma. In partially controlled asthma， these changes were registered 1.5 times more often than in controlled asthma， and in its uncontrolled course， the prevalence of pathological changes in the T-system of immunity was much higher than in the two previous groups. In patients with concomitant diseases， these changes， as a rule， had a higher frequency than in patients without comorbid pathology.\n\n【4】Keywords：Comorbid pathology； Immunity； Exacerbation of asthma\n\n【5】Introduction\n\n【6】In the last two decades， researchers have paid considerable attention to the problem of comorbidity in bronchial asthma BA 通用删除6(英):<u>[1-4]</u>. Comorbidity is a combination of several chronic diseases in one patient， which mutually affect each other. It has been proven that the interaction of diseases， their pathomorphosis and age significantly changes the course of the main disease， the nature and severity of complications， worsens the patient's quality of life， limits or complicates the treatment and diagnostic process. It is known that patients with comorbid pathology， including the gastrointestinal tract， which is very common among this category of patients，have an increased risk of developing asthma exacerbations and a greater severity of their course. Comorbidity negatively affects the prognosis of the disease and significantly increases the probability of a fatal outcome. The presence of comorbid diseases leads to an increase in the length of hospitalization， causes disability，删除1换行and prevents the implementation of rehabilitation measures 通用删除6(英):<u>[5-12]</u>. Discrepancies in the data of different authors regarding the prevalence of comorbid pathology in patients with asthma， in particular the digestive organs， and its influence on the course of asthma and the features of immunological changes determined the purpose of the work - to investigate immunological changes in patients with exacerbation of bronchial asthma with different severity and controllability depending on the presence comorbid pathology.\n\n【7】Materials and Methods\n\n【8】The work is based on the analysis of the anamnesis data and comprehensive clinical examination of 337 patients with exacerbation of BA and 255 patients who underwent immunological research in the laboratory of clinical immunology. The distribution of patients with exacerbation of BA with different severity and controllability by gender and age is presented in the . The analysis of these data showed that in all groups the majority of patients were women， which corresponds to the gender characteristics of this disease. Most of the examined patients with moderate and severe asthma were ofworking age (86.3% and 87.2%， respectively)， while with mild BA - only 46.7%(p<0.05).\n\n【9】There was no statistical difference between the fates of patients of different age categories with controlled and partially controlled asthma； however， in the group of patients with an uncontrolled course of the disease， there was a 2.4-fold decrease in the percentage of young and middle-aged patients and a 1.3-fold increase in the number of people elderly (p<0.05)， which corresponds to the well-known features of BA. Concomitant diseases were recorded in 252of 337 (74.8%) people， 144 (42.7%) of them had pathology of the digestive organs， and the absence of comorbidity was observed in85 (25.2%) patients. Among this group， there were 15.4% more men than among the group of patients with concomitant diseases (40.0%and 24.6%， respectively； p<0.05). There was no difference in the age composition between the groups .\n\nTo assess the severity and controllability of asthma， we used criteria based on international recommendations (GINA， 2014) and given in the unified clinical protocol of primary， secondary(specialized) medical care \"Bronchial asthma and adapted clinical guidelines for bronchial asthma 通用删除6(英):<u>[13-15]</u>.Average severity of asthma exacerbation was determined in 125 (65.8%) patients， severe - in 65(34.2%).18(9.5%) patients had a controlled course of the disease，|删除段之间换行|131 (68.9%) partially controlled， uncontrolled 41 (21.6%) patients. Comorbid pathology of digestive organs was recorded in 83 (43.7%) patients with exacerbation of BA. The most common diagnosis was cholecysto-cholangitis， which was present in 63 (75.9 %) patients， gastritis， duodenitis and reflux esophagitis were noted in 31 (37.3%)， pancreatitis in 12 (14.5%)， hepatitis in 6 (7.2%)， gastric or duodenal ulcer - in 4 cases (4.8%)， intestinal candidacies was established in 2cases. It should be noted that almost a third of these.\n\n【11】Patients had a combined pathology of the digestive organs. The remaining 107 (56.3%) persons with exacerbation of asthma had no comorbid diseases. They were included in the comparison group.The relative content of T-lymphocytes and their main subpopulations was determined on a flow cytofluorimeter FACSCalibur(Canada) by phenotyping lymphocytes with monoclonal antibodies (BECKMAN COULTER， USA) to surface membrane differentiation antigens(CD)： CD3+19-(pan T-cells)， CD4+8-(T-helpers/inducers)， CD4-8+ (cytotoxic T lymphocytes)， CD3-16+ (natural killers). To identify the imbalance of immunoregulatory subpopulations of T cells， the Immunoregulatory Index (IRI) was calculated - the ratio of the number of CD4+8- Lf and CD4-8+ Lf. To calculate the absolute content in the Peripheral blood (PC) of individual populations of Lf， leukogram indicators determined on the hematological analyzer ABH-micros 60， France were used.

This infection can be acquired intrauterine when the first infection of pregnant woman occurs and the Toxoplasma gondii reaches the fetus by transplacental via. The damage to the fetus can compromise the pregnancy and life quality of the infected individual. Early diagnosis of infection allows emergency therapeutic intervention with reduction of the transmission rate and also the severity of the sequelae. Different methodologies are available for the diagnosis of acute gestational toxoplasmosis with detection of IgG and IgM anti-T. gondii antibodies. The methodologies differ mainly by specificity and sensitivity values reached， as well as execution facility and time required. These parameters can decisively influence the choice of the most appropriate technique by the municipal health polices， in public health strategies. The main ofthe present review is to synthesize the major characteristics of serological tests for congenital toxoplasmosis.\n\n【2】Keywords： Congenital toxoplasmosis； Gestational toxoplasmosis； Public health； Serology\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Toxoplasmosis is a protozoonosis worldwide distributed； its etiologic agent is Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondit)， a protozoan belonging to the phylum Apicomplexa， class Sporozoasida， order Eucoccidiorida， family Sarcocystidae， genus Toxoplasma and single species， T. gondii 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. The parasite exhibits a heteroxene cycle， with sexual reproduction in the intestines of felids， and asexual reproduction in all warm-blooded animals， such as birds and mammals， which act as intermediate hosts 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>.\n\n【5】The asexual cycle begins with the ingestion of oocysts that have been eliminated by the feces of the infected cats or tissue cysts containing bradyzoites present in the raw or uncooked meat of the intermediate hosts 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. After ingestion， the external wall of the oocysts or tissue cysts is ruptured by enzymatic degradation and the infective， sporozoite and bradyzoite evolutionary forms (slow-growing forms)， respectively， are released into the intestinal lumen where they rapidly invade the host cells and differentiate in tachyzoites (forms of rapid multiplication) by asexual division 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. The tachyzoites can invade any nucleated cell and form a parasitoid vacuole， where they undergo rapid and successive divisions by endodiogenia， originating new tachyzoites， which break the parasitized cell and invade healthy cells， which characterizes this phase as proliferative 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>.\n\n【6】The dissemination ofthis parasite in the organism occurs through freeor intracellular tachyzoites through the lymph， or blood， and can give rise to a polysymptomatic picture， with varying severity according to the parasite load， the parasite strain and the susceptibility of the host 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>.\n\n【7】The frequency of infection may vary according to age， eating habits， cultural patterns and the urban or rural origin of the individual. The prevalence can vary between parts worldwide， with higher taxes in Latin America， parts of Eastern/Central Europe， the Middle East， South-East Asia and Africa 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. The infection can occur by the ingestion of food or water contaminated with oocysts， or ingestion of undercooked or raw meat with cysts bradyzoites， or the tachyzoites bytransplacental删除1换行via， nevertheless， the human toxoplasmosis has been associated with low socioeconomic conditions 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>.\n\n【8】This increased risk may be due to changes in the placenta. In early pregnancy， the placental barrier reaches a thickness of 50 to 100um and progressively decreases to 2.5-5 um at the end of pregnancy， allowing parasites to more easily invade trophoblasts.\n\n【9】According to the gestational age on the first infection with T. gondii， the damage to the fetus can vary due to the morphogenesis phase when affected by the parasite， therefore， in 80.0% to 90.0%of infections in immunocompetent individuals there is no clinical manifestation； however， when there is the infection in the first trimester of gestation， fetal death is common， and when in the second and third trimesters of gestation it may lead to prematurity and Sabin's tetrad， which associates microcephaly，retinocoriditis，cerebral calcifications and mental deficiency 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>. In 50.0% of congenital infections， fetal alterations such as hydrocephalus and periventricular necrosis with macro or microcephaly are reported. In 90.0% of patients there is marked retinal destruction and retinocoriditis， in69.0% cerebral calcifications are developed and in 60.0% of the cases are generated mental retardation or neurological disorders with signs of encephalitis and with seizures 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>.\n\n【10】The chance of congenital in fection is estimated between 4.5% and15.0% when there is toxoplasmosis in the first trimester， followed by 17.3% to 30.0% in the second third， and 60.0% to 75.0% in the last period 通用删除6(英):<u>[10，11]</u>. This increase in the rate of infection according to gestational age is due to the morphological changes of the placenta， because in the first trimester of pregnancy， the placenta has reduced dimensions and the chance of the parasite reaching the fetus is small， in contrast， as in this phase happens the organogenesis， when there is differentiation of the germinative leaflets， ectoderm， mesoderm and endoderm giving rise to the internal organs of the organism， aggravating the infection， that can lead to fetal death 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>.\n\n【11】In the second trimester， increased placenta reflects a greater chance of infection， however， in this period， the infection becomes less severe， since almost all organogenesis has already occurred， meantime， it can result in important damages such as Sabin's Tetrad， in which the fetus presents retinocoriditis， cerebral calcifications， mental retardation or neurological disorders and hydrocephalus， with macro or microcephaly 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>. In the third trimester， the placenta presents the largest dimensions of the period， consequently， the chance ofinfection is higher and， in contrast， the chance of developing serious damage at birth is remote， with manifestations of the disease such as fever， body spots， blindness， in a few days， weeks or months after birth 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>.\n\n【12】The reduction in incidence， as well as morbidity and mortality rates associated with congenital toxoplasmosis can be achieved in the presence ofcollaborative efforts among pregnant women， researchers， doctors and health policy managers， on the adoption of primary and secondary health preventive measures in the gestation 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>.\n\n【13】The diagnosis of acute T. gondii infection in the gestationalperiod is crucial to define the risk of fetal involvement 通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u>. For this，prenatal care should be carried out continuously from the gestational diagnosis， in order to avoid congenital toxoplasmosis and also the other risks associated with the life of the pregnant woman and the fetus 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>. In Brazil，health professionals who work in the care ofpregnant women who perform prenatal care through the Unified Health System (SUS)， comply with the protocols established by the Ministry of Health，删除1换行which guide the serological monitoring for primary infection by T. gondii 通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>. Confirmation of toxoplasmosis is based on indirect or immunological methods， since the direct demonstration of the protozoan by culture， inoculation， immunohistochemistry and pathology is in frequent 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>.\n\n【14】The molecular techniques with direct detection of T. gondii tachyzoite is possible during the acute phase of infection and can confirm fetal infection from different body fluids such as blood， amniotic fluid， cerebrospinal fluid， aqueous humor，bronchial lavage fluid alveolar and even urine by PCR technique with a sensitivity of up to 92.0%， which makes this the method of choice in cases of low parasitemic， on the other hand， in the chronic phase of infection， as in cases of cysts in brain or pulmonary tissue， the technique will not be useful 通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u>.\n\n【15】Indirect or serological techniques， through the detection of antibodies of the IgM， IgG， IgE and IgA classes， do not require invasive procedures that pose a risk to the fetus such as amniocentesis and can be performed at any time during pregnancy. Several methods are available for the serological diagnosis of gestational toxoplasmosis such as the Sabin-Feldman technique， Immunofluorescence antibody test (IFAT)， Hemagglutination (HA)， complement fixation (FC)， enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)， immunoblotting and Imunosorbent Agglutination Assay (ISAGA)， with differences between the values of sensitivity and specificity reached 通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u>.\n\n【16】It is important that the serological tests for specific anti-T.gondii antibodies are performed at the first prenatal visit with serial analysis in the second and third trimester of gestation and the pregnant woman should receive guidance on the preventive measures of infection 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>.\n\n【17】In the serological diagnosis， specific IgM class antibodies are usually the first to be detected， whereas IgG antibodies appear later， with high titers during the acute phase and gradual reduction with persistence of low titers in the majority of cases， throughout the individual's life， both in the latency phase and in the chronic phase. IgM antibodies may be detectable for long periods， months to years after the acute phase of infection only by highly sensitive diagnostic methods. However， when this antibody is not detected by traditional techniques， or inability to observe IgG seroconversion during pregnancy， the expression of increased IgG titers in serial samples obtained at least three weeks apart， and in tests may suggest the diagnosis of the acute phase of T. gondii infection. Among the techniques for identification of recent T. gondii infection in pregnant women is the IgG and IgM capture ELISA 通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u>.\n\n【18】In immunocompetent individuals， serological tests with IgG and IgM screening are sufficient for diagnosis because they are sensitive， specific and easy to perform 通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u>.\n\n【19】Serological screening has several advantages， such as the identification of seronegative pregnant women， which provides the opportunity for health professionals to act in the preventive education of gestational and congenital toxoplasmosis， since eating habits and personal hygiene practices are identified as factors associated with the risk of infection. On the other hand， the identification of asymptomatic patients allows the establishment of adequate therapeutic measures， while the early detection of maternal seroconversion during pregnancy makes it possible to monitor and treat fetal infection and newborns 通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u>.\n\n【20】The mechanisms by which parasites overpass the maternal-fetus interface remains poorly understood and may reinforce the删除1换行importance of the screening serological tests to a successful gestation and to minimize the outcomes in the pregnancy due to congenital or gestational toxoplasmosis通用删除6(英):<u> 23]</u>.\n\n【21】The main characteristics of the techniques used to diagnose T. gondii infection in prenatal care were the object of our study and are summarized in this mini review of qualitative literature， made up of scientific articles and books， available online， on the theme\"serological diagnosis for gestational and congenital toxoplasmosis\".\n\n【22】Major characteristics of the methods for anti-T. gondii antibodies detection\n\n【23】Sabin-feldman dye test： The Sabin-Feldman reaction or dye test was described by Sabin & Feldman， in 1948 and is a differential serological test， where there is specific neutralization of the viable parasite in the presence of antibodies and complement. This method is considered excellent for the diagnosis of individual toxoplasmosis in the acute or chronic phase and also for epidemiological surveys， on account of its high sensitivity， indicating IgG antibodies in serum dilutions up to 1：16000 and specificity with little cross-reaction with other diseases， however， due to the need to manipulate the parasite in its infecting form， is not used as first option for routine diagnosis. Currently， for biological safety， the technique has been replaced by Indirect Immunofluorescence which also has lower cost and also detects IgG and IgM antibodies 通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u>. Besides the conventional Sabin-Feldman dye test are the gold stand for human toxoplasmosis， the conventional test using in vivo tachyzoites is the highest percent of toxoplasmosis detection in human serum when compared the results when using cell culture-derived T. gondii tachyzoites and when test indirect immunofluorescent antibody tests (IFAT) using in vivo and in vitro tachyzoites.\n\n【24】The Microparticle Enzymelmmunoassay(MEIA)technique\n\n【25】The MEIA1Imakes quantitative determination of IgG and IgM anti-T. gondii antibodies in human serum or plasma. The immunoassay works on a random and continuous way in an Abbott company machine (AXSYM)， and for the IgM antibodies detection a rheumatoid factor neutralization solution is required to remove no specific antibodies avoiding false positive results. At the end of the reaction， the immune complex bound to the alkaline phosphatase-labeled conjugate reacts with the substrate to generate fluorescence of intensity proportional to the antibody concentration of the analyzed sample 通用删除6(英):<u>[25]</u>.\n\n【26】The Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELFA)\n\n【27】The ELFA is an automated test in the VIDAS system of the company Bio-Mérieux， used for IgG and IgM antibodies anti-T. gondii detection， through the immunoenzymatic method with a final fluorescence detection as the main reaction， named immunocapture， where the IgM antibodies present in the immunocomplexare labeled with alkaline phosphatase. This method， when compared to the ISAGA (Immunosorbent Agglutination Assay)， demonstrated agreement of 98.9%， sensitivity of 93.5% and specificity of 99.3%通用删除6(英):<u>[26]</u>.\n\n【28】The Indirect Fluorescent Antibody Test (IFAT)\n\n【29】IFAT is indicated for serological surveys and diagnosis ofacquired infection， because it can reach sensitivity up to 95.0%， however， false positive reactions with antinuclear factor (FAN) and false negative in the presence of low IgG titers can occurs 通用删除6(英):<u>[27]</u>.\n\n【30】Enzimed Link Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA\n\n【31】The ELISA is an immunoenzymatic assay can reach up to 80.0%删除1换行of positivity and identifies early infection， with special importance for the diagnosis of congenital toxoplasmosis. The technique eliminates the interference of IgG and rheumatoid factor that are present in IFAT and can be standardized for detection of different classes of antibodies.

Briefly， the serum-specific IgG against the parasite is linked to T. gondii coated antigen on the surface of reagent wells， forming an antigen-antibody complex The goat anti-human IgG labeled with horse radish peroxidase can be used as the secondary antibody to the antigen-antibody complex and after incubation and wash， as a chromogenic substrate is added to each well. The process should be stopped using a stop solution of 1N of H，SO . The Optical Density (OD) is recorded at 450 nm in the analyzer equipment. Calibrator and positive/negative control sera are used in each test set and the immune status ratio value of each sample is calculated by dividing OD of the sample by the cutoff value (cutoff is the mean OD of the calibrators x correction factor). Results were interpreted based on the manufacturer's recommendations as non-reactive， equivocal， or reactive 通用删除6(英):<u>[31]</u>.\n\n【34】The ELISA (for the qualitative determination of specific IgM antibodies anti T. gondii in dry blood samples collected on filter paper for in vitro diagnostic use only)， MEIA and ELFA have been used to improve the diagnosis of toxoplasmosis， which has demonstrated to be useful for the diagnosis of toxoplasmosis， as they show greater sensitivity and specificity 通用删除6(英):<u>[32]</u>.\n\n【35】The lgG avidity test\n\n【36】IgG Avidity concerns on the observation that， in most patients， during acute T. gondii infection， IgG antibodies bind poorly to the antigen that is low avidity， whereas in the chronification of the infection， the bond strength increases and high avidity can develop. These antibodies with high avidity reflect the fact that the primary infection occurred in the distant past， estimated about more than three months， although this method cannot determine if the infection was recent， since eventually low titers can persist for long periods， such as after antiparasitic treatment， which can maintain low avidity for more than four months. Thus， the test is especially indicated for the first trimester of gestation in IgG and IgM reagent women for screening serology， when it was shown to be the best marker ofacute infection in patients with positive IgM 通用删除6(英):<u>[27]</u>.\n\n【37】The Immunobloting Test\n\n【38】Immunoblotting is performed by segregation of the protein antigens components through the polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis The proteins are transferred to a nitrocellulose paper and processed against the serum to be tested， which， in the presence of reaction， can be visualized. The test is used to determine antigens involved in the删除1换行different stages of infection，however， it is not a routine test 通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u>.\n\n【39】Conclusion\n\n【40】The serological screening for gestational toxoplasmosis is essential for the identification of susceptible pregnant women and fast detection of IgM seroconversion， with monitoring since the first trimester of pregnancy for the efficient prevention of congenital toxoplasmosis. Among the techniques for detection of anti-T. gondii antibodies in pregnant women， the sensitivity and specificity of antibodies， verified by MEIA， ELFA and ELISA techniques were higher when compared to IFAT detection. The recent infection in the first trimester of gestation should be confirmed by the avidity test.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

They can reach enormous sizes and cause varied complications. Kasabach-Merritt syndrome is a constellation of a hemangioma inclusive of endothelial abnormalities， which lead to a consumptive coagulopathy and subsequent thrombocytopenia. Although rare， serious complications are present yielding a mortality rate of10% to 37%.80% of cases occur in the first year of life with 0.3% of infants with hemangiomas affected. The treatment aims to control the coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia as well as eradicate the hemangioma. Different treatment approaches are present inclusive of surgical and non-surgical techniques of which systemic corticosteroids， irradiation and immune-suppressors are an option. Surgery is limited to cases of symptomatic and complicated presentations. Although not simple， enucleation is curative usually. Here， we present a 53-year-old man with giant hemangiomas causing KMS.\n\n【2】Keywords： Hemangiomas； Liver； Kasabach-Merritt Syndrome (KMS)\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Being first diagnosed in 1940 by Haig Haigouni Kasabach and Katharine Krom Merritt， who had been taking care of an infant with a giant hemangioma and thrombocytopenia purpura， Kasabach Merritt Syndrome (KMS) is a rare， but serious constellation of a hemangioma within which exist endothelial malformations that cause a consumptive coagulopathy leading to a thrombocytopenia通用删除6(英):<u>[1-3]</u>. Such lesions exist typically superficial and solitary in a male infant， which represent 80% of cases while adult KMS exists in 20% of cases where the hemangioma exists in internal organs such as the liver 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. It is well documented that the most common benign tumors of the liver are cavernous hemangiomas. Those larger than 4 cm are termed giant hemangiomas. With the advantage of reduced blood loss and virtually ability to preserve all viable liver tissue， surgical resection is the typical usually curative treatment approach， which is preserved for complicated and symptomatic cases 通用删除6(英):<u>[5-7]</u>. Here， we present a 53-year-old man with giant hemangiomas causing KMS.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 53-year-old Iraqi man， previously diagnosed with ITP (Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura) in 1990 treated irregularly by prednisone without sustained response， and DVT (Deep Vein Thrombosis) in 1992 treated by anti-vitamin K， presented in April 2018 for second opinion about his asymptomatic persistent thrombocytopenia. For 5 months before presentation， despite treatment with prednisone (50 mg) and azathioprine (100 mg)， the patient had platelet count ranging between 5000/mm to 20000/mmwith no clinical symptoms.\n\n【7】The patient is a non-smoker， non-alcoholic with negative history of diabetes mellitus， hypertension and coronary artery disease. The clinical exam was normal with no signs of bleeding. The patient was afebrile， conscious， oriented and cooperative.\n\n【8】At presentation， the complete blood count revealed 27，000 platelets/mm’， normal white blood cell count (6700/mm’) and hematocrit of 41%. Bone marrow aspirate showed hyper cellularity and normality in the three cell lineages. The physical examination was normal.\n\nAn abdominal US performed at presentation showed a very heterogeneous poorly limited hypo-echoic nodule formation diffuse through the liver . Abdominal MRI  revealed two large liver masses both showing peripheral enhancement after gadolinium injection. The first is a well-defined 13.5 cm mass of right hepatic lobe involving segments VII and VI. The 2n is a sub-capsular mass of segment VIII and IV of 10 cm size with adjacent smaller 2.5 cm nodular lesions of|删除段之间换行|segment IV and III.\n\n【10】As part of complete laboratory workup， anticardiolipin antibodies were quantified and revealed positive suggestive of antiphospholipid syndrome while liver findings are typically suggestive of adult KMS. In addition， PCR was done for CMV nucleic acids that have proved2.96-log copies/ml. No treatment was held as the patient returned back to Iraq with the diagnosis ofKMS and recommendation for CMV treatment (probably secondary the ongoing immunosppressive treatment)， and consideration of surgical approach.\n\n【11】Discussion\n\n【12】Kasabach-Merritt results in a consumptive coagulopathy 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，3]</u> secondary to platelet trapping and aggregation within a specific type of hemangioma， and can have a high mortality rate ranging between1% to 37% 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>. In infants， the hemangiomas are typical confined to删除1换行the skin， yet they can present in retroperitoneal organs such as the mediastinum， the pelvis， visceral organs， or the mesentery. This patient presented with a giant liver hemangioma and asymptomatic thrombocytopenia. Although anticardiolipin antibodies proved positive giving indication of antiphospholipid syndrome， without repeated laboratory testing of anti-b2 glycoprotein-I antibody of IgG and/or IgM isotype and/or IgG or IgM subtype of anticardiolipin antibodies， it is recommended to avoid APLS diagnosis. The positive result of these antibodies does not certify ultimate diagnosis of APLS. In the presence of a giant hemangioma in the liver correlating with laboratory result of thrombocytopenia， and absence of other clinical symptoms including rash， skin patches， repeated episodes of DVT and PE， Kasabach Merritt syndrome is more probable. In addition， treatment with prednisone， anti-vitamin-k and azathioprine has not proved effective which verifies suggestions ofKMS over APLS.\n\n【13】Management of this case of KMS mandates non-surgical approach. First line treatments are vincristine and corticosteroid therapy. The angiogenic character of Kasabach-Merritt syndrome indicates that chemotherapy is a logical treatment which has been proven effective in a multicenter study in the United States 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>.

Immune checkpoints are signal pathways that regulate the activation of T-cells in order to protect the tissues from damage triggered by pathogens and to prevent autoimmunity.

The target of these new therapies is to develop specificity and long-term memory of immune adapted response to achieve tumor regression.

He had an irrelevant remote history and one first relative affected by type 2 diabetes； the patient and nobody in his family had any autoimmune disease. Nine months earlier he had been diagnosed with non-small cell lung carcinoma with already evidence of repetitive nodal and vertebral disease (L1-L2). Oncologist started with conventional therapy with cisplatin but patient showed poor response and the disease progressed. The patient was candidate for treatment with Pembrolizumab. This therapy was started with absence of mutations for Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) and with presence of PD L1 expression in 26% of tumoral cell (PD-L1 IHC 28-8 Dako). Ten weeks after the beginning of treatment with PD1/PDL1 checkpoint inhibitor compared hyperglycemia (234 mg/dl) with ketosis and mild increase of lipase (333 U/L， normal value 140 U/L-200 U/L) in the absence of suggestive radiological pancreatitis. At the same time basal C-Peptide was severely reduced (0.2 ng/ml， normal value 0.78 ng/ml to 1.89 ng/ml)； anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies were positive (299U/ml， normal value 0 U/ml to 5 U/ml)， anti-insulin antibodies were negative.

Once diagnosed， the splenic aneurysms should be treated properly. The majority of patients receive interventional therapy， which is difficult to preserve the spleen. We presented a case of splenic aneurysm resection and splenic artery anastomosis performed completely by laparoscopic surgery. The operation went smoothly with the spleen successfully preserved. The patient reported no discomfort or complications after the surgery. A review of intensive CT at 3 months post-operation revealed a normal spleen size and shape as well as patent blood flow at the anastomosis. Laparoscopic surgery have the advantage of exploring the entire abdominal cavity， clearly observing the situation around the aneurysm， and peeling the tumour from the splenic artery for ligation without damaging the spleen； however， laparoscopic surgery requires a skilful laparoscopic technique.\n\n【2】Keywords： Splenic aneurysm； Laparoscopy； Splenic aneurysm resection； Splenic artery reconstruction\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】The patient， a 37-year-old man， was admitted to the hospital with a left adrenal adenoma discovered by a health examination 6 weeks prior and a splenic aneurysm demonstrated by a Computed Tomography (CT) scan at the same time. He had a history of hypertension for 18 years， withthehighestbloodpressurereaching180/120mmHg(1mmHg=0.133kPa).After administration of controlled-release nifedipine tablets， the blood pressure was stabilized at 140/90 mmHg. He was diagnosed with diabetes for 3 years without systematic treatment， and the blood glucose level varied in the range of 8 mmol/L to 10 mmol/L. Physical examination： General condition with no obvious abnormalities of the heart， lungs or abdomen； bilateral kidneys were not palpated； and no sacral pain in the kidney areas， no bulges in the suprapubic bladder area， and no abnormalities in the external genitalia. Preoperative contrast-enhanced urinary MRI ： There was a left adrenal nodule with a size of 2.3 cmx 1.9 cm， T1WI low signal intensity， in-phase/anti-phase decreased signal intensity，T2WI slightly high signal intensity， and DWI high signal intensity. The post-contrast arterial phase image showed significant enhancement， and the delay phase showed circular enhancement， considered as sebaceous adenoma； local nodular enlargement of the splenic artery near the inside of the spleen was identified， approximately 1.9 cm x1.4 cm in size. The plain scan indicated a flow-shadow signal， and the post-contrast image showed a prominent highlight signal， similar to the splenic artery signal， considered a splenic aneurysm. Preoperative blood tests， blood biochemical tests， and cardiopulmonary function examinations were performed routinely. No obvious abnormalities were reported with a normal level of adrenalin. After the patient was admitted to the hospital， a Multidisciplinary Team (MDT) discussion was organized by the urinary department， interventional department， vascular surgery department， imaging department， and anesthesia department after patient admission. Based on the patient's medical history and auxiliary examination results， the diagnosis of left adrenal adenoma and splenic aneurysm was confirmed， with indications for surgery. Given that the splenic aneurysm was a benign lesion and was on the same side as the left adrenal tumor， a decision was made to perform a surgical operation at the same time， and a spleen-preserving surgical scheme was adopted.\n\n【5】Materials and Methods\n\n【6】A 3D laparoscopic resection of the left adrenal tumour and splenic aneurysm + splenic artery anastomosis was performed under general anesthesia. The patient took a right 70° inclined supine\n\n【7】Results\n\n【8】Postoperative pathological examination showed 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u> macroscopic observation ： Adrenal glands and surrounding fat， nodular masses within the adrenal gland， approximately 2.3 cm×2.0cm×1.5cm in size； a section of blood vessel， 2.0 cm in length and 0.5 cm in diameter， with a tumour-like bulge on the vessel wall， approximately1.7 cm x0.5 cm x 0.5 cm in size 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. The tumor cell cytoplasm was mostly transparent with no mitotic images or local protrusion of the capsule observed. There was no necrosis or vascular invasion， which was consistent with the adrenal adenoma； the local blood vessel wall budged locally， considering the gross morphology， which was consistent with the aneurysm. The patient reported no discomfort， no complications， and a normal body temperature. He resumed walking and eating on the first postoperative day and was discharged on the fourth postoperative day. The treatment cost was no more than30，000 Yuan. A review of intensive CT at 3 months post-operation revealed patent blood flow at the anastomosis and a normal spleen size and shape .\n\n【9】Discussion\n\nIn August 2019， a case of splenic aneurysm resection with splenic artery anastomosis and reconstruction was completed under laparoscopy in the urology department of our hospital. The spleen was preserved， and the operation was a success. After a literature|删除段之间换行|Splenic artery aneurysms are the third most prevalent type of visceral aneurysms， only after abdominal aortic aneurysms and iliac aneurysms. The female： male incidence of splenic artery aneurysms is approximately 4：11. In recent years， the incidence of splenic aneurysms has increased substantially， with asymptomatic splenic aneurysms mostly discovered on health examination. However， symptomatic aneurysms are more life-threatening， among which hemorrhagic shock caused by the sudden rupture of the splenic artery is most common and most severe， especially for pregnant patients， with a mortality rate reaching as high as 70% 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. Once a splenic aneurysm is diagnosed， it should be treated promptly. Indications for the surgical treatment of splenic aneurysms include 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> acute rupture or threaten of rupture； 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> a tumor larger than 2 cm in diameter or a progressive increase in tumor volume (reviewed every 2 months)；通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> intentioned pregnancy or has been pregnant； 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> the diameter is less than 2 cm with a good general condition， while the patient requires treatment； 通用删除7(英):<u>(5)</u> the tumor compresses adjacent anatomical structures， causing pathophysiological changes and resulting in symptoms； and通用删除7(英):<u>(6)</u> portal hypertension and regional portal hypertension 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>.\n\n【11】It was the France surgeon Beaussier who first reported splenic aneurysms in 1770 and performed the first open splenic aneurysm resection worldwide 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. Originally， splenic aneurysms were mostly treated by surgery. Because surgery corrects the hemodynamic abnormality caused by splenic aneurysms and avoids furthertortuous and enlarged consequences， it has a relatively good long-term effect. Although traditional surgery can completely remove the lesion and achieve anastomosis under direct vision， reducing the risk of splenectomy due to the secluded position of the spleen artery and the complex surroundings such as the pancreas， stomach， colon， and adrenal glands， the incision has to be large enough for better exposure， which often leads to problems such as large trauma， a high incidence of complications， and slow recovery after surgery.\n\n【12】With the advancement of science and technology， most splenic aneurysms can currently be treated effectively with interventional embolism. Although interventional surgery is less invasive and the patient recovers quickly， this technique also has certain defects. 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> Patients undergoing embolization will suffer from different degrees of embolism syndrome， such as low fever， abdominal pain， lower back pain， and gastrointestinal symptoms. 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> Whether simple tumor lumen coil embolization or stent covering is performed， there is a possibility of insufficient blood supply to the spleen. In severe cases， this technique may even cause a large-scale acute spleen infarction， spleen abscess and major bleeding. 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> Potential aneurysm neck expansion and postoperative endoleak can lead to stent displacement， followed by failure of vascular lumen isolation and continuous pressure on the tumor wall to increase the risk of rupture. 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> If the spring coil fails to fulfill the tumor cavity during the operation， blood will enter the tumor cavity constantly， and the effect of complete isolation can hardly be achieved. 通用删除7(英):<u>(5)</u> For patients with stent implantation， the risk of stent displacement and stent stenosis cannot be ignored， so the long-term application of aspirin and clopidogrel for antiplatelet therapy is essential， which results in higher costs， increased risk of bleeding and reduced quality oflife 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>.\n\n【13】Duringthe last two decades， laparoscopic surgery has gradually become a mature minimally invasive surgical approach， demonstrating advantages such as limited trauma， reduced pain， fast删除1换行postoperative recovery， few complications， and short hospitalization. Compared with traditional open surgery， it can more clearly and intuitively display the tissue relationship around the aneurysm， with a higher degree of refinement. However， there are few reports on the laparoscopic treatment of splenic aneurysms， which is mainly due to the higher requirements ofthelaparoscopic technique and experience of the surgeon. In 1997， Kawasaik et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u> reported the first case of successful laparoscopic aneurysm repair 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. Under laparoscopy， a flake intestinal clamp was placed on the base of the splenic aneurysm， and an endovascular stapler was used for repair. The nails were arranged parallel to the longitudinal axis of the splenic artery without tumor incision， as a result of which the cystic cavity was completely separated from the splenic artery. This case was the first domestic and foreign 3D laparoscopic splenic aneurysm resection and splenic artery reconstruction reported. The treatment was precisely the same as that of open surgery， which removed the lesion integrally under the premise of blocking the normal distal splenic artery and then anatomized and reconstructed the splenic arteries under laparoscopy to restore the integrity of the vascular cavity. Finally， the vascular blocking clip was released， and the patency of anastomotic blood flow was assessed directly. Compared with the method reported by Kawasaik， the treatment in this case had more accurate anastomosis of blood vessels under direct vision while avoiding the retention of metal foreign bodies and reducing the cost of surgery. This surgical method is safe and reliable， with the advantages of limited trauma and rapid postoperative recovery， but it has certain challenges. The requirements for the laparoscopic vascular anastomosis technique and the surgical experience of the operator are relatively high， so it should be carried out prudently.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

Given the clinical deterioration and suspicion of septic shock， initial stabilization was performed， requiring volume expansion. Blood tests and blood culture were requested and intravenous cefotaxime was started. Blood analysis showed a leukocyte count of 4，900/microliter， with 40.3% neutrophils， 9.8%lymphocytes and 2% monocytes， hypertransaminasemia (ALT 894 U/L， AST 553 UI/L， alkaline phosphatase 213 UI/L， LDH 961 UI/L). An elevation of acute phase reactants (C-reactive protein23.7 mg/dl and procalcitonin 59 ng/ml) was detected， as well as altered coagulation with INR of 1.68. Blood gas analysis showed metabolic acidosis with hyperlactatemia.\n\n【9】Due to the lack of improvement， the patient was transferred to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU)， suspecting meningoencephalitis with associated septic shock. On arrival at the PICU， she was unstable with a neurological examination compatible with intracranial hypertension. A decortication posture with anisocoria was observed， as well as generalized seizures refractory to anticonvulsant therapy. In following blood tests， values were consistent with multiorgan failure maintaining leukopenia (up to 3，300/microliter) with thrombocytopenia (16，000/microliter)， NT-proBNP 15，021 pg/ml and D-dimer of 18，243 ng/ml.\n\n【10】Brain computed axial tomography (CT) was consistent with hypoxic-ischemic encephalitis. A lumbar puncture was performed in which Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) showed bacterial meningitis(4000 red blood cells/mL， 26 cells/microliter with 52% polymorphonuclear， 628 mg/dl protein and glucose <10 mg/dl). After obtaining microbiological samples， antimicrobial treatment was changed to vancomycin， meropenem and acyclovir. Given the persistence of intracranial hypertension删除1换行refractory to medical treatment， surgical intervention was decided， in which an external ventricular drainage was placed.\n\n【11】Streptococcus preumonia and Enterovirus B were detected in CSF by molecular biology technique (PCR). Despite high-dose antimicrobial treatment and optimization of supportive care， there was fulminant progression， confirming encephalic death by neurological examination，EEG and CT less than 24 h after admission.\n\n【12】After the patient’s passing， the presence of Streptococcus preuronia was confirmed in CSF culture and blood culture. Serotype determination was performed， being reported as type19A.The antibiogram showed multi-resistance to antibiotics， specifically， high level of resistance to penicillin and cefotaxime (MIC to penicillin 4 micrograms/ml and cefotaxime： 6 micrograms/dl). Immunologic work up showed immunoglobulin values within the normal range (IgG 582 mg/dl； IgA 96 mg/dl and IgM 111 mg/dl)， and a complement study indicated a discrete hypocomplementemia C4 5.1 mg/dl (normal values 11.2 mg/dl to 39.1 mg/dl)， with C3 99.5mg/dl (normal values 98.6 mg/dl to 207.9 mg/dl). A genetic panel for immunodeficiencies and necropsy could not be performed.\n\n【13】Discussion\n\n【14】Although less and less frequent， pneumococcal meningitis continues to be a major health issue in children in our environment. Both primary care and hospital pediatricians should be familiar with the clinical manifestations in order to establish an early diagnosis that allows treatment to be initiated as quickly as possible.\n\n【15】With respect to invasive pneumococcal disease， its incidence in children is higher in the group under 5 years of age， and the most frequent serotypes are 8，3，9N，19A and 22F (3 and 19A are included in the 13-valent vaccine). Although the incidence of pneumococcal meningitis has decreased over time， it is still associated with a morbidity of around 20% to 25% with a mortality of 5% to 10% at present.\n\n【16】Currently， there are two types of vaccines against S. pneumonia； polysaccharide and conjugated vaccines with a carrier protein. There are two types of conjugated vaccines marketed： tridecavalent and decavalent. Thanks to the high vaccination coverage， and to the improvement of hygienic measures， the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease has markedly decreased in Spain. Although in our setting most of the infant population has received the 13-valent conjugate vaccine， in migrant or transient population， other vaccination patterns can be found， as in the case of our patient.\n\n【17】The available polysaccharide vaccine， known as 23-valent. The polysaccharides of the pneumococcal capsule are not bound to proteins， which makes the immune less robust than with the conjugate vaccine 通用删除6(英):<u>[7，9]</u>. It causes an immune tolerance phenomenon and does not impact on nasopharyngeal colonization. It can be administered from 2 years ofage. In children， it should be reserved always after the conjugate vaccine， for patients at high risk of invasive pneumococcal disease.\n\n【18】The Fpneumococcal1conjugatevaccineecontainLsScapsular polysaccharides ofthe 13 most prevalent pneumococcal serotypes (1，3， 4，5，6A， 6B，7F，9V， 14， 18C， 19A， 19F and 23F) which， together删除1换行with a carrier protein， generate an adequate and long-lasting immune response， with long-term protection. This vaccine has been included in the Spanish children's vaccination schedule since 2016， being therefore free of charge， with a 3-dose.\n\n【19】It has proven to be effective in the prevention of invasive pneumococcal disease (97% for meningitis and sepsis)， preventing infection from 80% of the circulating serotypes. Among them， serotype 19A stands out， which is characterized by its association with mastoiditis and meningitis， as well as by its high prevalence of resistance to penicillin 通用删除6(英):<u>[101</u>.\n\n【20】Likewise， it is useful to rule out primary immunodeficiencies in fulminant pneumococcal infections.\n\n【21】The aim of this case is to draw attention on the still present pneumococcal meningitis in a highly immunized population of children that can have a fulminant outcome， particularly with aggressive serotypes like 19A， that may be highly resistant to penicillin and cefotaxime. It is necessary to emphasize the importance of adapting and completing the vaccination schedules of patients born outside Spain and achieving optimal immunization of the infant population.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

Except for a history of cervical syndrome and chronic lower back pain， not requiring medication， the patient was previously fit and well. Upon arrival of the emergency physician a 12-channel ECG was recorded ， which showed atrial fibrillation with inferior and antero lateral ST-segment elevation (II， III， aVF & V4-V6) on top of hyper-acute T-waves in the antero lateral leads (V4-V6). Accordingly， the physician contacted our coronary care unit for emergency coronary catherization based on the tentative diagnosis of acute ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI). The patient was loaded with 250 mg of intravenous Acetylsalicylic Acid (ASA) and 60 mg of oral prasugrel. Additionally， 5000 IE of unfractionated heparin and 80 mg of atorvastatin were administered on site. The transport to our hospital byhelicopter was uneventful and according to protocol. The fulminant ST-segment changes in the initial ECG， however， were nolonger visible on follow-up ECG . Instead， inverted T-waves were recorded in leads V2-V5 without evidence of significant ischemia in the inferior leads.\n\n【11】Investigations\n\n【12】Emergency coronary angiography   revealed non-significant coronary artery disease with 20% proximal Right Coronary Artery (RCA)stenosis and 10% distal Left Anterior Descending (LAD) stenosis after the origin of the second diagonal branch. Hence， excluding a type I myocardial infarction. Left ventriculography was unremarkable with preserved ejection fraction and no signs ofregional wall motion abnormalities or a Takotsubo-like pattern.\n\nThe findings of left ventriculography were confirmed by transthoracic echocardiography， which showed a virtually normal echocardiogram. The thickness of the Intra Ventricular Septum (IVS) was measured at 11 mm alongside a regular Left Ventricular End Diastolic Diameter|删除段之间换行|(LVEDD=46 mm)]anddpreserved ejection fraction. The only pathological findings were a left ventricular diastolic relaxation abnormality (E/A=0.81，E/e'=9.67) and a slightly enlarged left atrium(Left atrium =40 mm). Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) revealed a structurally and functionally normal heart without evidence of fibrosis， edema or late gadolinium enhancement on T1- and T2-mapping. In-hospital ECG monitoring showed stable sinus rhythm without episodes of atrial or ventricular arrhythmias. The isolated episode of atrial fibrillation on admission had no recurrence and was hence interpreted within the scope of the acute myocardial event without a need for long-term oral anticoagulation. Ambulatory七twenty-four-hour electrocardiographic (Holter) monitoring confirmed normal sinus rhythm without any arrhythmic events.\n\n【14】Management\n\nThe case at hand presents a typical example of MINOCA of|删除段之间换行|Discussion\n\n【16】MINOCA is a growing entity in the differential diagnosis of acute chest pain. At present， it occurs in approximately 5% to 6%of cases with acute myocardial infarction 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. However， there is a large variability in its reported prevalence (up to 15% in selected studies)， which may be attributed to the lack of a universal definition of the disease. The introduction of the Fourth Universal Definition of myocardial infarction finally offered specific diagnostic criteria删除1换行for MINOCA， which were revisited by a scientific statement paper from the American Heart Association (AHA) in 2019 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. The three key diagnostic criteria for MINOCA include the presence of acute myocardial infarction (a rise and fall pattern of troponin and clinical evidence of ischemia)， non obstructive coronary arteries (including moderate coronary atherosclerotic stenosis of up to 50%) and the absence of an alternate diagnosis for the clinical presentation， such as sepsis， pulmonary embolism or myocarditis 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>.\n\n【17】Coronary angiography is the main diagnostic tool in the initial workup of patients with chest pain and myocardial infarction. After exclusion of significant coronary artery stenosis， coronary vascular imaging and coronary function assessment should be performed. Intra Vascular Ultra Sound (IVUS) and Optical Coherence Tomography(OCT) allow visualization of plaque disruption， coronary thrombi or emboli and coronary artery dissection. Provocation testing with intracoronary acetylcholine may help to facilitate the diagnosis of coronary vasospasm 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. While an acceptable level of safety has been reported recently for provocativetesting，significant arrhythmicevents occur in up to 6% of cases (including 3% ventricular arrhythmias) 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. If coronary angiography remains inconclusive， left ventriculography should be performed to assess left ventricular function and look for wall motion abnormalities，resembling Takotsubo Syndrome or other cardiomyopathies 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>.\n\n【18】The following non-invasive diagnostic work-up should include echo cardio graphic assessment as well as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) in most cases. While availability is still a concern in some regions，cardiac MRI has emerged as a key diagnostic tool in the evaluation of patients with MINOCA. Myocarditis and Takotsubo syndrome， which is rather its own entity than a part of MINOCA， are the most frequent conditions mimicking MINOCA and can be diagnosed by MRI based on specific late gadolinium enhancement patterns and imaging findings 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>.\n\n【19】Management of MINOCA is diverse and should be individualized based on the specific etiology， such as calcium channel blockers for vasospastic angina， antianginal therapies for micro vascular dysfunction， anticoagulation for coronary embolism and cardio protective therapy in accordance with current AMI guidelines for plaque disruptions 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>.\n\n【20】Conclusion\n\n【21】MINOCA is an important differential diagnosis in the work-up of patients with acute myocardial infarction.

Patient was admitted to our clinic with dizziness， headache， night sweating， dry mouth， fatigue， and worsening in kidney function (SCr： 7.6 mg/dl) at 1-year follow-up. Some laboratory findings at admission were hemoglobin 5.7 g/dl， albumin 2.7 g/dL， CRP 79.9 mg/L， and BUN 54mg/dl. Kidney biopsy was performed with the preliminary diagnosis ofacute or chronic renal failure and biopsy revealed immune complex focal segmental necrotizing glomerulonephritis. And patient received corticosteroid and rituximab therapy. On that visit Brucella (capture) was >1/5250 positive. Doxycycline (2 mg/day x100 mg/day)+rifampicin (1 mg/dayx 600 mg/day) + ceftriaxone (2 g/dayx2g/day) treatment was planned by the infectious disease department. CLI Bone marrow biopsy was performed regarding the possibility of bone marrow aplasia in response to immunosuppressive treatment， though， no pathological finding had been determined. Patient was discharged after symptomatic relief and improvement in kidney function (SCr：4.8 mg/dl) . Two months later the patient presented to clinic for routine outpatient follow-up. He had no complaints and his kidney functions were improved (SCr： 1.44 mg/dl). Follow-up of the patient for 6 months was uneventful.\n\n【9】Discussion\n\n【10】Brucellosis is the most common zoonotic infection in Turkey， primarily affects bones， lymphatic tissies， and the heart. The genitourinary involvement rate of brucellosis is around 2% to 20%. Orchitisand epididymitis are the most common types of genitourinary involvement 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>. Symptomatic renal involvement is especially rare with limited number of cases including membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis， tubulointerstitial nephritis， IgA nephropathy， and a single case of RPGN 通用删除6(英):<u>[4-8]</u>. Only one case of RPGN associated with Brucellosis reported by Ardalan and SShoja [通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>which demonstrated RPGN in a young male patient which responded to rifampicin + doxycycline+ corticosteroid treatment dramatically in 2weeks 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>， while we report RPGN case in an elderly male patient who required multiple hospitalizations during the course of treatment and became difficult to manage. Decline in kidney functions， hematuria， weight loss， requirement for RBC transfusions， multiple hospitalizations， morbidity and mortality are possible in the course of Brucellosis-associated RPGN especially， if it is not considered in the differential diagnosis or inappropriately treated. In addition， Brucellosis-associated kidney involvement may occur at any age despite most reported cases include young patients.\n\n【11】Furthermore， our case is significant by illustrating immune complex depositions which may be the primary mechanism of kidney involvement in the course of Brucellosis. Since immune complex depositions are frequently observed on kidney biopsies performed with the preliminary diagnosis of RPGN， it is important to consider Brucellosis， an infection， as a differential diagnosis of immune complex deposits especially in areas where it is endemic along with predominant causes， including systemic lupus erythematosus and删除1换行other immune complex ANCA-positive vasculitis.\n\n【12】Even though renal involvement rates are low and most cases report good prognosis and general status， it is important to point out the possibility of RPGN as a manifestation in which emergency cases may develop. Low rates of Brucellosis-associated kidney involvement may also be a consequence of not being considered in the differential diagnosis in most instances. Therefore， we recommend consideration of Brucellosis in the differential diagnosis of glomerulonephritis especially in the areas where Brucellosis is endemic or in patients with specific environmental or other risk factors. Also， it may be beneficial to evaluate Brucella serology in RPGN patients with unknown etiology after elimination ofpredominant causes which could become a cost-effective approach for patient evaluation.\n\n【13】通用结尾删除-1:<u>1.

Cyanides blood concentrations were <0.2 ug mL，which allowed to exclude an intoxication.\n\n【39】No traumatic lesions related to the road accident were observed. We concluded that this autopsy report was consistent with a death resulting from burn injuries and possible smoke intoxication.\n\n【40】Regarding identification， the corpse was a leukodermal subject of删除1换行female sex， of medium build (measuring approximately 166 cm and weighing 69 kg)， of adult age， with no detectable surgical stigma. The victim was wearing a yellow metal necklace with a pendant set with eight translucent stones and a ring set with a translucent stone on a finger of the right hand. The anatomopathological expertise did not show an immediate microscopic cause of death.\n\n【41】There was diffuse vascular congestion with a bilateral pulmonary edema， accompanied by a hemodynamic state of shock. There was no evidence of soot deposition in the lower respiratory tract.\n\n【42】This unspecific microscopic observation may result from diffuse cutaneous burn lesions in relation with inhalation of toxic fumes. The death occurred on a previous non-pathological subject who may have contributed to the death.\n\n【43】Discussion\n\n【44】The temperatures found in a car in the event of a fire are often high， estimated at 1，000°Cto 1，100°C according to experiments 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. It has also been proven that the window shattering-during an accident or due to thermal causes -leads to a draught which results to a local increase of temperature from 600°C in an enclosed environment to1，100°C.\n\n【45】In our case of a victim who was trapped in her vehicle， the CT scan carried out prior to the autopsy revealed numerous recent bone lesions throughout the skeleton as well as the presence of pulmonary edema which could be part of an inhalation asphyxiation syndrome. The autopsy showed a state of diffuse charring associated with a pugilist's position， loss of distal phalanges and diffuse skin defects， particularly on the vertex.\n\n【46】An asphyxiation syndrome with diffuse vascular congestion， pulmonaryedema and pleural petechiae was also found， in association with soot inhalation in the subglottic airways in relation to smoke inhalation and therefore with the victim's living status at the time.\n\n【47】Toxicological analysis did not indicate any higher-than-normal levels of CO or cyanides. Lastly， the anatomopathological examination confirmed the presence of diffuse pulmonary vascular congestion， which could also be linked to an asphyxiation syndrome.\n\n【48】The case of the victim found incarcerated and charred in her vehicle thus raised several questions： was it a polytraumatized victim unable to escape from the vehicle then secondarily burnt， or a victim neutralized by the fire fumes then secondarily burnt. Symes et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u> has described diagnostic bone characteristics specific to thermal injuries. Longitudinal fractures are very common， and follow the architecture of haversian tubes. For some authors， they only occur on dry bone. Helical fractures， as seen in this case， represent a variant of longitudinal fractures . Transverse fractures， also very common， perpendicular to the haversian architecture and therefore parallel to the orientation of the Volkmann tubes. They are due to the perpendicular arrival of heat on the bone and can thus be seen just as much as transverse fractures， particularly on the upper limbs when the pugilist's position is set. For some authors， they are especially visible on greenstick fractures 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. Oblique fractures have arciform diaphyseal ends associated with beveling between the cortex and the spongy bone； they are also called fractures in “bec-de-flute\". They reflect the evolution of an arciform fracture with detachment of the bone . Decortications or delamination are areas of the cortical bone that are detached under the effect of heat， exposing the dipole of the skull by crumbling of the outer table  or the删除1换行spongy area opposite an epiphysis. The CT scan analysis can then be used to visualize the fracture lines within the cancellous bone，parallel to the cortical surfaces， known as the “split dipole sign\" in relation to the calvaria . The reticulated fissures are superficial cortical fissures - in a network with more or less tight and regular meshes - most often on wide areas with little thickness of soft tissue such as the skull， which would indicate regions less exposed to the heat.\n\n【49】The topography of the evaluated regions is also important and has specific features to be known.\n\nThe cranial vault can be subject to a “pressure cooker”effect and explode due to the internal pressure of water steam  通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. On the skull， the fissures readily appear facing the temporal or frontal regions， as these are the most exposed. These fissures are mainly bilateral， with irregular and jagged edges. They may only concern the external table or both tables. The occurrence of a pseudo extradural hematoma is ordinary but important to know whereas a subdural hematoma will have a perimortem meaning. It important to know that toxins concentrations within these extradural hematomas seer to be particularly reflective of the perimortem toxins concentrations|删除段之间换行|Thermal amputations are frequent in the presence of high temperature or a sustained heat source； they are due to disarticulations or thermal fractures. The upper limbs often appear in major retraction with thermal fractures of the hands and wrists . The thorax and abdominal-pelvic cavity appeared well preserved. Due to the anterior position of the teeth and their thinness， the incisors are the most exposed to alterations. According to Quatrehomme et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>， the enamel cracks as early as 150C and fractures around 500°℃， the unexposed dentine cracks around 600°C before disintegrating around 800°C 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>.\n\n【51】Based on all of these considerations， we assess that bone lesions found on this corpse were of thermal origins without any obvious traumatic bone lesions.\n\n【52】Conclusion\n\n【53】This case illustrates the importance of differentiating peri-and post-mortem lesions in the context of calcination and particularly the complementarity between autopsy and CT scan data. The analysis of this case shows that most of the bone lesions were of thermal cause without bone lesions of obvious traumatic appearance. Furthermore， the conjunction oflow levels of carboxyhemoglobin and cyanides and pulmonary parenchymal lesions are also in favor of a thermal origin death.\n\n【54】The distinction between these lesions of different origin is especially important in the case of suspicion of death by the action of a third party； it then becomes essential to recognize thermal lesions in order to distinguish them from lesions of another origin. The combination of imaging and autopsy is then particularly effective in this regard.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

Staphylococcus aureus was detected from nasal and pharyngeal swabs. A coagulopathy workup yielded a negative result.\n\n【16】Because of his hypotension patient was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) due to ongoing hemodynamic instability. Initially， fluid resuscitation and electrolytes correction was done (20 ml/kg in the first hour and 10 ml/kg in the next two hours). Broad-spectrum antibiotics were administrated (Ceftriaxone and Amikacin). Due to persistent hypotension one dose of fresh serum plasma was given (10 ml/kg). His hypotension remained problematic despite adequate volume expansion and inotropic support (Dopamine).\n\n【17】Clinical suspicion was between Kawasaki disease and multisystem inflammatory syndrome. The possibility of KD was raised， and clinical investigations were continued. There were no features of heart ischemia on the electrocardiogram . A chest X-ray showed significant cardiomegaly and pulmonary stasis. Abdominal ultrasound examination revealed a normal liver， pancreas， and both kidneys， with slightly drops of the gallbladder. Transthoracic echocardiography on the second day of admission (day 9 of illness) was performed. Echocardiography examination showed a small pericardial effusion and mild AV valve regurgitation. Biventricular systolic dysfunction was noted. 2-Dechocardiography showed a giant and generalized dilatation and loss of normal tapering of the Left Main Coronary Artery (LMCA)， measuring in the proximal to distal part from 9 mm to 16 mm (Boston z-score +9.3) .

There was resolution of the fever， conjunctivitis， and oral mucositis by day 10 of admission. The transthoracic echocardiography was repeated every two days which showed pericardial effusion being completely resolved with improved left ventricular systolic function. Persistent proximal LCA， LAD， and circumflex artery dilatation were noted. Serial blood results showed resolution of inflammatory markers with transient anemia (Hgb -92 g/l).

Renal impairment was manifested with high levels of urea(15.6 mmol/l) creatinine (134 umol/l). His B-natriuretic peptide was5.560 ng/l (normal range <100 ng/l) and his troponin-I level 1.10ug/l (normal range <0.04 ug/l). Microbial cultures were negative. His hypotension persisted despite adequate fluid resuscitation (50 ml/kg in total for 24 h) and inotropic support (Dopamine). The diagnosis of KD was considered in view ofhis clinical features. Electrocardiogram was normal. X-ray of the chest revealed cardiomegaly with increased bronchopulmonary markings. The abdominal ultrasound examination was normal. Transthoracic echocardiogram on day 7of illness revealed severe biventricular dysfunction with a fractional shortening of 19%， moderate AV valve regurgitation， and diffuse dilatation ofthe right coronaryartery of 6.1 mm (z-score +6.2) . The LCA system was normal in appearance and dimensions.\n\n【22】The patient was treated with 2 g/kg IVIG divided into two doses， and antiplatelet therapy (Clopidogrel and Aspirin -70 mg/kg/d) was administrated. Two broad-spectrum antibiotics (Cefotaxim and Amikacine) and methyl-prednisolone (3 mg/kg/d) divided in three doses were included in the drug treatment. Omeprazole was given parenterally to prevent gastric injury. His general condition improved during the next 36 h and subsequently became afebrile. In the next three days， he was normotensive and with normal capillary refill time. Except for clinical condition， there was an echocardiographic improvement of global heart function over the subsequent days.

The caretaker of the child was diagnosed with tuberculosis two months back with sputum beingpositive foracid fastbacilliand GeneXpert detecting thepresenceofMycobacterium tuberculosis sensitive to Rifampicin. Subsequently， the parents had recovered from COVID-19about six weeks back. In view of baby having CNS symptoms along with history of contact with a patient of tuberculosis， the baby was suspected to have TB meningitis and relevant investigations were sent accordingly. Computed Tomography (CT) chest revealed necrotic mediastinal nodes. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) brain showed moderate communicating hydrocephalus with meningeal enhancement.

Therefore， assessing the burden of hypertension and possible risk factors in the community is a good opportunity to update the epidemiological data on hypertension in the South Gondar Zone rural community.\n\n【2】Methods： A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among the 674-adult population. A multistage systematic sampling technique was employed to select study participants. Data were entered into Epi-Data Manager software version 4.6.0.0， and then exported to STATA MP 16 software for statistical analysis. A multivariable logistic regression model was conducted to identify factors associated with hypertension and presented by an Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) with95% CI. The model's fitness was checked using Hosmer-Lemeshow significance testing at P values 0.05.\n\n【3】Results： Overall， the prevalence of hypertension among adults was 16.1%(95% CI， 13.5-19.26). In multivariable logistic regression analysis， older age (AOR=1.03， 95% CI， 1.01-1.05)， female gender(AOR=1.91， 95% CI， 1.15-3.19)， divorced or widowed marital status (AOR=3.2， 95% CI， 1.17-8.8)， and physically inactive individuals (AOR=4.02， 95% CI， 2.10-7.70) were statistically significant associated factors with hypertension.\n\n【4】Conclusion： The overall prevalence of hypertension was high in the study community. Older age， female sex， and not engaging in vigorous-intensity physical exercise were found to be significant factors associated with the risk of hypertension. Therefore， it is crucial to establish community education programs about hypertension， and its screening， in the study community.\n\n【5】Keywords： Hypertension； Adults； Community； Ethiopia\n\n【6】Introduction\n\n【7】Blood pressure is the force that moves blood through our circulatory system. It is an important force because oxygen and nutrients would not be pushed around our circulatory system to nourish tissues and organs without it 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u>. Since 2017， the American Heart Association (AHA) has advised that people with high blood pressure should receive treatment at 130/80 mmHg rather than 140/90mmHg. The current category now forms two separate ranges： Elevated blood pressure， from 120129/less than 80 mmHg， stage Ihypertension， from 130-139/80-89 mmHg. In these new guidelines， the AHA also advises that doctors should only prescribe medication in cases of a previous heart attack or stroke， or the presence of risk factors for these conditions， such as age， a diabetes mellitus diagnosis， or chronic kidney disease 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>.\n\n【8】Globally 1.13 billion people are estimated to have hypertension， two-third of them are living in low- and middle-income countries. Hypertension or high blood pressure is defined as a systolic and or diastolic blood pressure ≥140/90 mmHg. The burden of hypertension varies across regions and countries. Nowadays the highest prevalence of hypertension occurs in low-and middle-income countries due to a rise in hypertension risk factors in those populations 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>.\n\n【9】Hypertension is a serious medical illness that knowingly increases the risk of heart， brain，删除1换行and kidney disease which is responsible for 54% of stroke and 47%of coronary heart disease globally. Besides hypertension is one of the major causes of premature death and the silent killer which is accountable for 7.6 million deaths per annum in the world 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>.\n\n【10】One of the global targets for non-communicable diseases is to reduce the prevalence of hypertension. However， the awareness and practice on prevention and control of hypertension are low in developing countries including Ethiopia. In low-income countries， there is a double burden of non-communicable and infectious diseases. The health care resources are priory invested in infectious diseases like HIV/AIDS， tuberculosis， and malaria. Due to these issues， prevention and control of hypertension didn’t get attention通用删除6(英):<u>[31</u>.\n\n【11】Environmental and personal lifestyle factors such as excessive alcoholconsumpottiioonn。 excessivedietarysalt intake， stress， sedentariness， and obesity may play a significant role in the increment of incidence of hypertension 通用删除6(英):<u>[4-6]</u>.\n\n【12】Different organizations support low-and middle-income countries including Ethiopia to reduce hypertension as a public health problem and to improve cardiovascular health through launchingthe global HEARTS (Healthy-lifestylecounseling， evidence-based treatment protocols， access to essential medicines and technology， risk-based management， team-based care， and systems for monitoring) initiative since 2016 通用删除6(英):<u>[5，7，8]</u>. Besides to reduce the burden ofhypertension-related death require the parallel application of the population strategy at the community level and the clinical strategy focusing on new and improved treatments for people with hypertension 通用删除6(英):<u>[3，8，9]</u>.\n\n【13】Therefore， assessing the burden ofhypertension and possible risk factorsinthecommunityissignificant forevidence-basedinterventions and it is a good opportunity to update the epidemiological data of hypertension in the South Gondar zone rural community. This study aimed to assess the prevalence of hypertension and associated factors in the rural community of the south Gondar zone.\n\n【14】Methods and Materials Study setting and period\n\n【15】A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among the adult population living in towns of the South Gondar zone from March to June 2021. South Gondar zone is one of the zones in Amhara Regional state which is located 137 km from a regional town， Bahir Dar， and 701 km from Addis Ababa， the capital city of Ethiopia. According to population growth projection， the current total population of the zone is about 2，578，906.\n\n【16】Population\n\n【17】The source population was all adult persons living in South Gondar zone towns and the study population was all selected adult individuals who live in South Gondar zone towns during the study period.All adult persons whose age is ≥30 years and who lived at least6 months in the towns were included in the study. Those who were severely ill to the extent unable to communicate，known hypertensive patients (self-report)， pregnant women， and disabled individuals(difficult to measure blood pressure) were excluded from the study.\n\n【18】Sample size and sampling procedure\n\n【19】The minimum sample size required for the study was calculated using single proportion population formula as follows：\n\n【20】删除10:<u>Were</u>\n\n【21】n = sample size， Z=Confidence Interval (CI) at 95% which is1.96 (where a=0.05)， d = margin of error tolerated which is 5%， P= the highest prevalence of hypertension in the previous studies in Ethiopian adult population which was 28.3%通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u>. Based on the above formula and assumptions the sample size was calculated to be 674 by considering design effects of 2.\n\n【22】A multistage systematic sampling technique was used to select study participants. At the first stage， four representative kebeles were selected by lottery method， and then the sample was proportionally allocated to the selected kebeles. In the second stage， a systematic random sampling method was used to select study households. The first household was selected by lottery method.\n\n【23】Data collection procedure\n\n【24】The data were collected using an interviewer-administered striictured questionnaireeandphysical measiirement. The questionnaire was adapted from the WHO STEPS instrument 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>， to collect socio-demographic profiles， behavioral related factors， and clinical data of eligible participants. To keep its consistency first， the questionnaire was prepared in English and translated to Amharic local language then back-translated to English. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure was measured by a standard adult arm cuff mercury sphygmomanometer after 5-min rest in a sitting position. Two readings were taken in five-minute intervals and the average of the two was recorded as a final blood pressure of the participant.\n\n【25】Study variables\n\n【26】Dependent variable： Hypertension [Yes/No].\n\n【27】Independent variables： Age， sex， educational status， marital status， occupation，resident， income， family history of hypertension， alcohol consumption， cigarette smoking， Khat chewing， and physical activity， fruit consumption， vegetable use， and use of excessive salt.\n\n【28】Operational definitions\n\n【29】Hypertension： Systolic blood pressure ≥140 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mmHg.\n\n【30】Regular physical exercise： Participants who purposively perform anykind of exercise for over 30 min at least 3 times per week.\n\n【31】Data processing and analysis\n\n【32】Data were checked for completeness and entered into Epi-data software version 3.1 then exported to STATA for statistical analysis. All variables were cleaned by running simple frequencies to avoid missing values and checked for normality and fulfillment of assumptions. Descriptive statistics (mean and standard deviation for continuous variables； and frequencies and percentages for categorical variables) were computed. Bivariate logistic regression was used to explore the relation between hypertension and each independent variable. P-value ≤ 0.25 cutoff points were considered to select potential candidates for the full model. Finally， a multivariate logistic regression model was used to identify factors associated with hypertension and presented by Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) with95% of CI. The model fitness was checked using Hosmer-Lemeshow at significance test at P values <0.05.\n\n【33】Data quality management\n\n【34】To ensure data quality， training， and adequate orientation were删除表格换行given for all data collectors and supervisors. For validation of the questionnaire， a pre-test was conducted on 5% of the sample size at Debre Tabor town， before the actual data collection time.

The variation might be due to the difference in the study population， sample size， and study setting. Since the study population might have differences in lifestyle in different settings. It might be also due to the age variation of the study population in the study sites. However， the finding is in line with evidence from a systematic review and meta-analysis which showed the overall prevalence of hypertension in the general population ranges from 9.3% to 30.3% 通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>， and a study conducted in Southwestern Ethiopia (17.7%)通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>.\n\n【60】After controlling the effect of potential confounding factors in the multivariablelogistic regression analysis， the variables old age， female gender， widowed/divorced marital status， and inactive physical exercise were significantly associated factors with hypertension.

This finding is in line with a study conducted at Northwest Ethiopia， Mekele， and in Southwest Ethiopia in which older patients were more likely to develop hypertension than the younger age group通用删除6(英):<u>[15，17]</u>.

This difference might be explained by the variation in the age ofthe study population and sample size.\n\n【63】Another important variable which found to have a significant association with hypertension was marital status (widowed/divorced). The odd of developing hypertension among widowed/divorced was 3.2 times higher than singles. This could be explained as those divorced/widowed people may be at risk for stress and depression which problem leads to overweight or associated with increased blood pressure， consequently hypertension.\n\n【64】Our study also revealed that patients who did not do regular physical exercise (in active physical exercise) were more likely to have hypertension than their counterparts. That is those who didn't involve in vigorous-intensity physical exercise were 4 times increased risk of hypertension when compared with those who did vigorous intensive physical exercise. This finding is in line with a study conducted in North and southwest Ethiopia 通用删除6(英):<u>[13，15]</u>. This implies having regular physical exercise is an important factor for the prevention of hypertension.\n\n【65】Conclusion\n\n【66】In this study， the overall prevalence of hypertension was 16.1%in the study community which was comparatively higher in females than males. Older age， female sex， not engaging in vigorous-intensity physical exercise was found to be a significant factor that likely increased the risk of hypertension in the study population.

Physical examination was negative.\n\n【10】Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a homogenous relatively well-defined intraconal mass lesion in the left orbit isointense on T1 sequences and hyperintense on T2 sequences . The patient underwent a left orbitectomy and histopathological examination of the excised mass was consistent with metastatic adenocarcinoma with an immunohistological profile suggestive of lung or thyroid origin (CK+， TTF1+， CK20-). Serum tumor markers were negative. PET/CT performed as a part of the initial process revealed a mild IF-FDG uptake in an apical nodule of the upper right lobe with pretracheal lymph nodes involvement and lytic bone metastasis on the right temporal bone and the sternum . Thyroid gland was normal on both F-FDG PET/CT and ultrasound examination. A diagnosis of primary malignancy in the lung with metastases was made based on immunohistological profile of the orbital mass and FDG PET/CT findings， since lung biopsy had not been made. The patient was treated with 6 courses of palliative chemotherapy according to the protocol paclitaxel and carboplatine， followed by radiotherapy on the orbital lesion(30 Gy spread over 10 sessions). Follow up F-FDG PET/CT showed recurrence of the left orbital mass that appears hypermetabolic .

Abdominal computed tomography (CT) showed partial compression of the third portion of the duodenum， which passes between the superior mesenteric artery and aorta， and dilatation of the oral side， resulting in SMA syndrome . Clinical history， hair abnormality and macrocytosis were suggestive of selenium deficiency. Serum selenium concentration was below the detection|删除段之间换行|Written consent was therefore obtained from the patient after a study protocol for sodium selenite administration was approved by Nagoya City University Ethics Committees. Intravenous administration of sodium selenite at 100 ug/day at day 1 and at200 ug/day at day 2-7， was performed， and administration at 200ug/day twice a week thereafter was continued. Six months after starting administration， curly and ulotrichous hair， nail changes and dysarthria gradually resolved ， and MCV rapidly normalized to 88.7 fL. Serum selenium concentrations gradually increased to 10.9 ug/dL (within normal limits) by December 2016. However， visual abnormalities and sensory abnormalities of thelimbs remained unchanged， and persisted.\n\n【17】Selenium deficiency causes distinct physical manifestations like hair and nails changes， and visual and limb sensory disturbances， but definitive diagnosis is difficult due to the rarity. We have reported here a rare case of selenium deficiency in a patient receiving long-term management with full ED due to repeated abdominal pain from SMA syndrome associated with CD. Continuous administration of sodium selenite resulted in partial improvement.\n\n【18】Elental° comprises amino acids， very little fat， vitamins， trace elements， and a major energy source， dextrin， but， does not include selenium 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. The therapeutic effects of ED such as Elental reportedly result from reductions in not only immune stimulation in the gut通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u> and intestinal permeability 通用删除6(英):<u>[8，9]</u>， but also the concentrations of cytokines associated with mucosal inflammation 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>. Thus， based on the usefulness of ED in CD patients， continuous full and/or half ED is frequently used for inducing and maintaining remission 通用删除6(英):<u>[5，11，12]</u>. On the other hand， one report described the risk of decreased concentrations of serum selenium under long-term management with full ED 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>. In general， selenium deficiency is known to arise among 1 month to 6 years after starting total parenteral nutrition(TPN)通用删除6(英):<u>[14-16]</u>. Long-term full ED administration is also supposed to cause selenium deficiency. Clinical knowledge regarding increased risks for selenium deficiency during full ED，and signs and symptoms of selenium deficiency are generally lacking for physicians and gastroenterologists. In addition， sodium selenite has not been approved forthe treatment of selenium deficiency in Japan. Therefore， a long time may pass before a definitive diagnosis of selenium deficiency is reached and treatment is started. In the present case， 13years elapsed before treatment with sodium selenite was started.\n\n【19】Selenium is incorporated in glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and selenoprotein P as a key element， and plays an important role in the stability of the plasma membranes of neurons， erythrocytes， muscle and liver cells. GPxs act as reductases eliminating the oxidants and lipid peroxides constitutively produced in cells 通用删除6(英):<u>[17，18]</u>. Attenuation of GPxs by selenium deficiency cause cardiac andskeletal myopathy 通用删除6(英):<u>[19，20]</u>， liver damage， erythrocyte macrocytosis 通用删除6(英):<u>[21，22]</u>， encephalopathy 通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u>，neuropathy通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u>and nailandhair abnormalities通用删除6(英):<u>[6，22-24]</u>. In particular， whitened nail beds in the hands and/or feet represent a well-known sign. In the present case， curly， ulotrichous hair was observed in addition to recurved and flat nails on the hands， but nail beds were not whitened. Based on the fact that nail changes gradually resolved soon after sodium selenite was administered， recurved and flat nails may also represent a symptom associated with selenium deficiency. Moreover， this suggested that changes to nails and hair might support definitive diagnosis of selenium deficiency and monitoring of the effects of therapeutic treatment，as the turnover of nails and hair is rapid.\n\n【20】Visual disturbance is another key symptom observed in selenium deficiency， and other neurological symptoms included dysarthria， spasticity of the extremities， ataxia and sensory disturbance. These manifestations occurred 1-12 years after starting TPN or elemental enteral nutrition 通用删除6(英):<u>[6，21，25]</u>. In the present case， visual disturbances and sensory disturbances of the limbs remained unchanged， and persisted. Most cases with neurological disorders receiving sodium selenite have shown no or only slight improvement 通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u>. These unfavourable outcomes may mainly result from irreversible oxidative damage to the brain related to the low levels of GPxs and other selenoproteins due to selenium deficiency 通用删除6(英):<u>[25]</u>.\n\n【21】In conclusion， clinical history and manifestations including hair and nail changes， visual disturbances and sensory disturbances of the limbs， and macrocytosis may be useful to make a diagnosis. Since the prognoses of visual and sensory disturbances don’t seem so good， selenium should be administered rapidly before those disturbances emerge if deficiency is suspected.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

It is isolated from patients receiving broad spectrum of antibiotics or long-term urinary catheter carriers. Its identification is one of the biggest challenges facing the laboratory because it is usually missed in routine urine cultures since it does not grow well after an overnight incubation. Thus， its diagnosis is often delayed due to the need for specific culture media， staining techniques and electron microscopy. Herein， we report one patient with clinical suspicion of Corynebacterium urinary infection. However， the isolation of the pathogen was highly demanding. The aim of this case report is to highlight the need of a multidisciplinary approach to diagnose this pathogen and the establishment of protocols to make easier its diagnosis.\n\n【2】Keywords： Infection； Encrusted cystitis； Urinary stones； Corynebacterium Lipophile\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Encrusted Cystitis (EC) is a rare form of Urinary Tract Infection (UTI)， especially in children通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Is characterized by bladder， ureteral and pelvic encrustations causing pain， bladder necrosis and occasionally renal failure or death. Such encrustations are usually composed of ammonium magnesium phosphate and calcium carbonate-apatite crystals 通用删除6(英):<u>[2，3]</u>.\n\n【5】Corynebacteria Species (CS) are the cause ofthis pathology； they are gram-positive slow-growing bacillus characterized with a strong urease activity infecting the lower and upper urinary tract 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. CS are frequently selected by repeated broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy and are nosocomial acquired 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>.\n\n【6】EC is treatable， but its diagnosis is often delayed. Despite suggestive symptoms and imagining features， diagnosis of EC is challenging given the need for specific culture media， staining techniques and electron microscopy 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. There is no consensus of treatment， but multiple options have been suggested based on three complementary elements： Antimicrobial therapy； acidification of urine， chemolysis and elimination of encrustations 通用删除6(英):<u>[6，7]</u>.\n\n【7】Here in， we report the importance of a multidisciplinary work between urologist， radiologist， microbiologist， anatomopathologist and infectiologists. After a clinical suspicion， specific staining techniques and electron microscopyare needed for its identification. In addition， due to its multiple resistances and the tissue adherence， the antibiotic treatment may be insufficient， and a multiple approach is needed.\n\nAn 18-year-old woman， with 10 years of repeated history of UTI， visited the urology department referring hypogastric pain， painful urination， and bladder stones expulsion. Normal uroflowmetry without postvoid residual urine. Laboratory workup did not reveal any clinically significant findings， except alkaline urine (pH 7.8). Standard urine culture was negative. Stone composition analysis revealed ammonium magnesium phosphate (struvite). CT pelvic scan showed thickening and calcification of the bladder wall . The patient went through an endoscopic transurethral resection， multiple solid neoformations coated by calcifications were resected (Figure|删除段之间换行|2). Anatomopathological analysis revealed intense mononudear leukocyte infiltration with focal calcified encrustations . The procedure exacerbated the pain.\n\n【9】Prompting a diagnosis ofEC， with pathogenic agent identification missing， a second endoscopic transurethral resection was performed. The anatomic pathology revealed again an intense mononudear leukocyte infiltration with focal calcified encrustations. Resected tissue culture for CU revealed few copies of the bacillus suggesting that urine cultures may be positive for CU infection. To confirm the species identification， PCR and sequencing was performed on the 18S ribosomal gene DNA of the bacteria isolate revealing a Corynebacterium Lipophile Group F1.\n\n【10】We started a combined therapy with levofloxacin 500 mg every 24haccordingtoantibiogram results，L-metionine and acetohidroxamic acid (125 mg every 8 h). Three weeks later an endoscopic removal was performed. After one month， the symptoms of frequency， urgency and suprapubic pain disappeared. Urinalysis was normal. Ultrasonography did not show any calcification of the bladder wall.\n\n【11】Discussion\n\nMany urea-splitting bacteria are responsible for EC， but CU (or Corynebacterium group D2) are the most frequent causative agent通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u> and can be isolated from different samples including urine， blood and expelled encrustations in urine 通用删除6(英):<u>[8，9]</u>. This fastidious and opportunistic slow-growing microorganism can be missed in routine cultures， requiring enriched media and prolonged cultures(>48 h).

In our case， resected tissue culture revealed few copies ofthe bacillus suggesting that urine cultures may be positive for CU infection. To confirm the species identification， PCR and sequencing was performed on the 16S ribosomal gene， revealing a Corynebacterium lipophile group F1.\n\n【13】The correct identification is important because the antimicrobial susceptibilities of different coryneform bacterial isolates are quite variable 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>.

The delayed diagnosis and drug resistance of CU makes its treatment arduous. The identification of CU is one of the biggest challenges facing the laboratory and its diagnosis demands a multifocal approach.

It constitutes the leading cause of medical admission in developed countries (150 million new cases/year worldwide， 3% of which requires hospital admission)， with a significant social and economic burden in this age group. More than half of cases are due to Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV)， whose transmission is airborne through the contact of nasopharyngeal or conjunctival mucosa with respiratory secretions of infected individuals 通用删除6(英):<u>[1-3]</u>. SARS-CoV-2 global diffusion and COVID-19 associated Public Health Measures (PHM) have profoundly modified the epidemiology of airborne communicable diseases. With the main purpose of curbing virus spread， from march 2020 governments imposed a broad range of non-pharmacological interventions (NPIs； e.g.， social distancing， school closing， travel and gathering restrictions， mandatory face masks， promotion of hand washing.)， determining radical changes in daily lifestyle and collaterally limiting the circulation of other airborne transmissible pathogens 通用删除6(英):<u>[4-8]</u>. The major decline in infection rates concerned enveloped viruses (especially RSV and influenza)， instable and easily neutralized by the widespread alcohol-based sanitizers. This did not affect envelope-free viruses (among all， rhinovirus)， transmitted by either aerosol or fomites， which kept circulating and became the leading etiological agents of some clinical entities(e.g.， bronchiolitis) 通用删除6(英):<u>[4-6，9-11]</u>. The efficacy of PHM established to contain COVID-19 pandemic is consolidated evidence， nonetheless viral circulation in a certain area is the result of a complex interplay between local microbiology， climatical conditions， population susceptibility and social interactions 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>. Recent evidence points out that different pathogens can compete in the single host(viral interference)， affecting each other’s circulation at a population level： for instance，interferon response to rhinovirus is protective against influenza A virus， which may explain their asynchronous circulation in some areas and seasons 通用删除6(英):<u>[13，14]</u>. Antiviral immunity activation may also explain the coincidence in time between the unexpected decrease of RSV infections and the parallel increase in SARS-CoV-2 Omicron cases recorded in late December 2021 (RSV usual epidemic peak) 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>.\n\nThe seasonality ofviral respiratory diseases is widely recognized. Cold temperatures and humidity foster viral transmission respectively stabilizing the envelope and facilitating the deposition ofheavy droplets， other than encouraging indoor social gatherings 通用删除6(英):<u>[15，16]</u>. RSV epidemiology， indeed，varies according to meteorologic conditions： in the Northern Hemisphere， transmissions rate increases from Novemberto March，reaching its peakinJanuary-February，while epidemicpeak in the Southern Hemisphere takes place in May-July 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>. Data show that is not a contiguous spread rather locally evolved variants that underlie epidemics， because of susceptible reservoirs (e.g.， adults with COPD or immunodeficient children) who guarantee a low-level continuous viral replication， periodically enhanced by favorable meteorological and social conditions 通用删除6(英):<u>[16，18]</u>. Climate factors and pathogens mutual interactions do not fully explain the rebound effect we are experiencing after the relaxation of preventive measures， characterized by heavier disease burdens and infection rates peeking out of the conventional epidemic season or age range 通用删除6(英):<u>[7，19-21]</u>.COVID-related Non-Pharmacological Interventions (NPIs) had indeed an impact on both， cross-border and local diffusion， generating off-season resurgences and incidence rate fluctuations correlated to the different intensity of containment measures throughout the entire pandemic period 通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u>. A matter of actual concern is the detrimental impact of NPIs on immune competence at host and population level. Abundant evidence demonstrates that recurrent antigenic stimulation increases immunity effectiveness. On the contrary， prolonged periods of reduced exposure to pathogens deprive immune system ofantigenic stimulation， resulting in waning herd immunity and producing what is now referred to as “immune debt”通用删除6(英):<u>[19，21]</u>. In this perspective， social restrictions and hygiene measures facilitated the selection of a population susceptible to already known infections. With the gradual relaxation of community|删除段之间换行|NPIs， previously disappeared viruses started to circulate again， facing an immunologically“naive”population unable to build up an appropriate neutralizing response. Consequently， the association of relaxed anti-COVID restrictions and decreased protective immunity contributed to a paradoxical， intense and out-of-season resurgence of respiratory illnesses 通用删除6(英):<u>[7，20-25]</u>. This is a particular concern for Respiratory Syncytial virus， for which susceptibility largely depends on age-dependent airway and immune development but mostly on protective immunity arising from repeated antigenic recognition. Transient immunity against reinfection (lasting from 7 to 15 months) is provided initially by vertical transmission and through periodic seasonal exposure thereafter 通用删除6(英):<u>[7，20，26]</u>. The absence of seasonal viral circulation deprived the pediatric population of passive protection obtained with maternal antibodies and of the infection-related active immunization. The “immune debt generated in such unexposed and therefore susceptible cohort of infants is held accountable for the growing trend in RSV infections observed with social restrictions easing通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u>.\n\n【13】It is legitimate to wonder what to expect in next seasons， in view of the likely necessity to employ effective containing measures for incoming SARS-CoV-2 periodic waves. Mathematical models predicted that the intensity and duration of NPIs reducing pathogens’spread are positively correlated with the size of their future epidemics通用删除6(英):<u>[27]</u>. This acquires significant implications in terms of prevention and health planning， since the unpredictability about Public Health burden of unexpected epidemics forces health systems to maintain a prolonged and source-consuming level of vigilance 通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u>. Preliminary data from both hemispheres report that 2022-2023 bronchiolitis seasons is going to be of high impact (personal data). Should we consider the immunity debt paid off? A better understanding of SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology - and more specifically of the impact that COVID-19 restrictions collaterally have on microbiological epidemiology and immune competence - is necessary to predict and consequently anticipate the resurgences of seasonal respiratory viruses. Concerning RSV，this would allow governments to timelyand effectively allocate healthcare resources (e.g.， prevention campaigns with monoclonal antibodies)， primarily to preserve most fragile patients (e.g.， under 3 months， premature， with comorbidities)， at greater risk of hospitalization and severe complications 通用删除6(英):<u>[6，20]</u>. With reasonable probability SARS-CoV-2 will become， like others， an endemic virus， and restrictive interventions necessary for its containment will no longer be necessary. Meanwhile， however， we advocate for an implementation of RSV epidemiological surveillance and hope that technological advancement will soon provide new tools(e.g.，vaccines) to cope with unexpected outbreaks， thence balancing the immune debt of a population weakened by the need to face a greater threat.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

However， migration and early spontaneous expulsion of the screw after treatment of the symphysis pubis disjunction is considered rare.

Treatment with an anterior plate in the pelvis is recommended as a fixation method for disjunctions of the pubic symphysis 通用删除6(英):<u>[1-3]</u>. Because the fixation is performed in the joint area， micro movements occur and may cause plate breakage or loosening of screws 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. The literature demonstrates that late screw loosening with migration to the bladder is relatively common 通用删除6(英):<u>[1-4]</u>. In this study， we report a case of migration to the bladder and early (one month) spontaneous expulsion of the screw after anterior pelvic ring surgery with plates in the pubic symphysis.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】Male patient， 64 years old， victim of a fall from a roof， approximately three and a half meters high on November 254， 2021. Upon admission to the orthopedic emergency room， after physical examination and imaging tests， the opening of the pubic symphysis chapter II was diagnosed.\n\n【7】Both the patient and the fracture remained stable throughout the treatment， and it was decided not to temporarily fix the pelvis with an external fixator. After carrying out all the preoperative preparation， the definitive orthopedic surgical procedure was performed seven days after the trauma. A pelvic approach was used through the Pfannenstiel access， with associated detachment to protect the urinary bladder. The orthopedic surgical technique used was the placement of two orthogonal plates， one superior and one anterior. Top plate was large fragment DCP with 4 mm x4.5 mm screws. The anterior reconstruction plate was made of small fragments with 4 mmx3.5mm screws. Satisfactory radiographic control was performed at all stages .\n\n【8】On January 015， 2022， the patient reported spontaneously eliminating， via urine， 1 screw 3.5mm from the anterior plate after loosening the plate. After examination of excretory urography associated with cystoscopy， it was confirmed the formation of a fistula in the anterior wall， close to the transition with the lateral/medial bladder fundus， around 0.6 cm .\n\nThe formation of the fistula was due to a foreign body reaction (friction against the bladder) after loosening the 3.5 mm screw， and after its formation it was encompassed by the organ. From the urological point of view， we proceeded in an expectant manner， keeping the patient using an indwelling urinary catheter for 30 days associated with the use of the antibiotic Bactrim|删除段之间换行|(sulfamethoxazole + trimethoprim) for 10 days and ultrasound control to confirm the closure of the orifice. From the orthopedic point of view， watchful waiting was maintained； with no weight bearing for two months associated with radiographic control and computed tomography.\n\n【10】Discussion\n\n【11】Screw migration to the bladder after disjunction of the pubic symphysis with exit through the urethra has been reported as an extremely rare event 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. Bladder injury can be caused by the trauma itself， considering theproximity ofthe organ to thebone，byherniation of the bladder into the symphysis or by iatrogenic injuries 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>.

To avoid the instability generated by fixation of the pubic symphysis， fixation with two plates was chosen a 4.5DCP in the upper region and a 3.5 anterior reconstruction plate. The doubt raised by the authors was the need for posterior fixation of the sacroiliac joint and the use of long V-shaped anterior screws， which could stabilize the pelvis， preventing screw migration.\n\n【14】Conclusion\n\n【15】This report is intended to alert orthopedic surgeons to be careful with the fixation ofthe pubic symphysis and to look for the diagnosis of bladder injuries due to trauma， avoiding complications such as migration of the screw to the bladder.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

A combination of exergaming and conventional physiotherapy was conducted for twenty weeks. Outcome measures included the International Knee Documentation Committee(IKDC)， Cincinnati Knee Score， 10-Metre Walk Test (10MWT)， vertical jump test， Single-Leg Hop Test (SLHT)， and Single-Leg Triple Hop Test (SLTHT).

The last phase of rehabilitation is based on the gesture performed in real-life sports 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>， andbalance training 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. Individuals with ACL rupture usuallypresent balance deficits after ACL reconstruction， and balance training needs to be included during the rehabilitation period通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>. Several resources are used for balance training， such as exercises on the ground， on unstable surfaces， and exercises with visual biofeedback through exergaming devices 通用删除6(英):<u>[5，9]</u>. Exergaming is one exercise modality that allows the user to interact directly with a simulated environment through a television screen 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>. The multidimensional interaction with the environment， multi-删除1换行sensory experience through visual， audio， and haptic sensations， increasing attention， motivation and adherence are advantages of the exergaming 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>. There are also increased body awareness， motor coordination， postural balance，and strength 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>.\n\n【9】Studies reported positively on the use of modern technology via computer， video games， and virtual reality in the rehabilitation of patients with neurological diseases and balance disorders 通用删除6(英):<u>[12，13]</u>. Nonetheless， it is still a growing prospect on the application in the orthopedic field 通用删除6(英):<u>[10，14]</u>. Exergaming using Nintendo Wii has been used to provide a realistic environment in physiotherapy settings 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>. However， only two studies have reported the use of Nintendo Wii in the ACL post-operative rehabilitation 通用删除6(英):<u>[15，16]</u>. Further， no study evaluated the effects of virtual reality on the hop tests. Therefore， it is necessary to report the functional outcomes of patients who had undergone ACL reconstruction， using conventional physiotherapy and exergaming in an associated program. The intervention used in the current case report can be a potential therapeutic strategy in future studies. Thus， this study aimed to describe the effects of the combination of exergaming and conventional physiotherapy on the functionality of a patient with ACL reconstruction.\n\n【10】Materialand Methods\n\n【11】A 43-years-old male patient， an employee of the xxx，recreational athlete， sought medical treatment on June 12h，2009， after a traumatic sprained right knee in football， with clinical symptoms compatible with ACL rupture. Imaging exam showed complete ACL rupture， a grade I rupture of the medial collateral ligament and medial meniscus tear. ACL reconstruction surgery was performed with double gracilis and semitendinosus flexor tendon graft and partial meniscectomy in the xxx on May 25h，2010. The participant signed a written informed consent before the inclusion. The study was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee of xxx and performed in compliance with the Helsinki Declaration for research in humans.\n\n【12】The outcome measures included subiective assessment of the knee and objective measures of the lower extremity. The subjective assessments were performed by two self-reported instruments(International Knee Documentation Committee Subiective Knee Evaluation Form -IKDC， and The Cincinnati Knee Score). The objective assessments included the maximum walking speed during the 10-metre walk test， the vertical jump test， the single-leg hop test， and the single-leg triple hop test. Data were collected at four time points： baseline (week 10 after surgery)， during the treatment (week20 after surgery)， end of treatment (week 30 after surgery)， and删除1换行follow-up (week 40 after surgery). The single-leg triple hop test was not assessed on week 10 because the patient was afraid to perform the test.\n\n【13】A physiotherapist with three years of clinical experience in the musculoskeletal rehabilitation xxx performed the intervention from July to December 2010. Each session lasted approximately45 min， and the intervention was performed twice weekly. All sessions occurred in the physiotherapy outpatient clinic at xxx. The intervention included two phases： Conventional physiotherapy and exergaming using the Nintendo Wii. Each phase of the physiotherapy program was performed in 10 weeks. Conventional physiotherapy included electrotherapy (i.e.， functional electrical stimulation for muscle strength)， myofascial technique， knee joint mobilization， stretching， and therapeutic exercises with weight and elastic bands. Subsequently， exergaming using Wii-rehab included lower limb strengthening and balance exercises through the Wii Fit Plus game. A detailed description of the Wii-rehab exercises is provided in Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Figure 1A-1H.\n\n【14】Aerobic exercise in a stationary bike was added on week 12， and strength training started on week 14. During this phase， additional devices such as ankle weights， balance boards， and mini trampoline were added in some exercises. The Wii Fit Plus exercises were similar to those routinely used for ACL injury rehabilitation 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>. There were no adverse events during the study. Descriptive statistical analysis of the data was performed in Prism software version 7.0 (GraphPad Software， Inc.， CA，and USA).\n\n【15】Results\n\n【16】The subjective assessment demonstrated an improvement in both instruments. The IKDC scores increased from 43.68 (week 10) to85.05 (week 40) out of 100 points， and the Cincinnati Scale scores from 63 (week 10) to 80 (week 40) out of 100 points .\n\n【17】The obiective assessment showed increased maximum walking speed for the 10-metre walk test： 1.52 m/s (week 10)， 2.67 m/s (week20)， and 4.84 m/s (week 30). Despite that， the follow-up assessment presented lower walking speed (week 40= 3.55 m/s). Besides， the vertical jump test demonstrated improvements [week 10 (1.17 m)， week 20 (1.36 m)， week 30 (1.59 m)， week 40 (1.80 m)] .\n\nSingle-leg hop testand single-legtriple hop test distance presented an improvement during the treatment， which persisted at follow-up evaluation for the injured side. The tests scores related to uninvolved healthy side values remained higher than the involved side in the|删除段之间换行|Discussion\n\n【19】This study aimed to describe the effects of adding exergaming to a conventional rehabilitation program. The combination of the exergaming and conventional physiotherapy presented subjective and objective improvement after the rehabilitation period. The subjective measures demonstrated progressive improvement. The walking speed increased up to the end oftreatment and reduced at the follow-up evaluation. The hop tests evidenced continuous improvement， and the single-leg hop tests showed a trend to reach similar results compared to the healthy side. Although the combination of the exergaming and the conservative treatment achieved satisfactory results， the case reported did not reach the recommended value for the limb symmetry (90%) in the hop tests 通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u>.\n\n【20】There are few studies on Wii-rehabilitation in traumatology and orthopedic physiotherapy 通用删除6(英):<u>[7，8，15，16]</u>. A previous study presented no difference between exergaming using Nintendo Wii and conventional treatment on functional tests 通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>. The two approaches had similar improvement in patients after ACL reconstruction. Moreover， a protocol combining Nintendo Wii and conventional physiotherapy found similar findings related to knee range of motion in patients after ACL reconstruction and total knee arthroplasty surgery compared to删除1换行conventional physiotherapy通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>.\n\n【21】Jir case1presented satisfactory results in the subjective assessment. For instance， the IKDC score was 85 out of 100 at week40， which is similar to the mean of IKDC score (88.4) among subjects who returned to the sport after the ACL rehabilitation program 通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u>. The IKDC and the Cincinnati Knee Score are considered essential tools to evaluate knee function during the rehabilitation program通用删除6(英):<u>[20，21]</u>. Exergaming may play a role as an alternative approach for knee rehabilitation 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>. The Wii-rehabilitation could favor patient adherence to sessions due to the playfulness of the games 通用删除6(英):<u>[7，10]</u>.\n\n【22】Our findings demonstrated that the patient still improved in the functional tests， which can be associated with the restoration of the normal activities of daily living. Functional tests have been used in clinical settings to evaluate lower extremities performance and predict a return to sport 通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u>. Wii-rehabilitation could be used as an alternative tool for physiotherapists. The program may contribute to physical improvements as well as a conventional rehabilitation program 通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>. We encourage further research with a larger sample size to provide new therapeutic strategies involving exergaming in musculoskeletal rehabilitation. In the current study， we offered treatment for an extended period， which probably contributed to functional advances observed on obiective and subjective assessments. An exergaming rehabilitation program is feasible， safe， and cheap 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>. Thus， the exergaming may be used to improve functional tasks as squat， single-leg weight-bearing， and balancing training. The functional outcome of patients suggests that adding exergaming in rehabilitation can be a beneficial adjuvant for patients undergoing surgery for ACL reconstruction and partial meniscectomy. The case reported in the删除1换行current study was a 43-years-old male， non-professional athlete，and these characteristics may limit the use of the rehabilitation protocol in different populations. ACL injury is usually related to younger adults and athletes. Furthermore， the improvement observed in the functional test was low (limb symmetry<90%) despite the tendency to increase at follow-up and may be affected by the number of sessions per week. Future studies should compare groups with a different frequency of sessions to clarify this issue.\n\n【23】Conclusion\n\n【24】The patient functional outcomes suggest that adding exergaming in rehabilitation can be a beneficial adjuvant for patients undergoing surgery for ACL reconstruction and partial meniscectomy.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

The management oflarge lesions can be challenging. We present a case of a giant arteriovenous malformation that was successfully and minimally invasively treated by embolization， allowing preservation of the renal uinit.\n\n【5】Introduction and Background\n\n【6】Renal vascular malformations are conditions that involve renal veins and arteries and include Arteriovenous Malformations (AVM) and Arteriovenous Fistulas (AVF). They may be acquired， congenital， or idiopathic 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>.\n\n【7】Congenital arteriovenous malformations are characterized by abnormal communication between the renal arterial and venous systems， and they are typically diagnosed in the third or fourth decade oflife 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. They are thought to represent focal spontaneous failures of vascular development occurring during the first trimester of pregnancy 通用删除6(英):<u>[2-4]</u>. The right kidney is affected more frequently than the left one， and women are three times more likely to be diagnosed with a renal AVM than men 5.\n\n【8】Three types of congenital renal AVM can be distinguished based on the vessel architecture： The angiomatous type， which is characterized by a single large artery feeding multiple interconnecting distal branches； the cirsoid type， the most common， with multiple arteriovenous interconnecting varix-like vascular communications； and the aneurysmal or cavernosaltype， which is more common in elderly patients， occurring typically from a pre-existing arterial aneurysm which has eroded into an adjacent vein 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>.\n\n【9】Acquired arteriovenous fistulae resulting from instrumentation or kidney surgery are the most prevalent kind of renal vascular abnormalities. Additionally， they could be caused by pyelonephritis， renal-cell carcinoma， or blunt or penetrating trauma 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>.\n\n【10】Clinical manifestations of kidney vascular lesions are varied， and they range from asymptomatic presentation， flank or back pain 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>， hematuria， which is the most common presentation 通用删除6(英):<u>[6，8，9]</u>， abdominal mass 通用删除6(英):<u>[10，11]</u>， hypertension 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>， and high output heart failure 通用删除6(英):<u>[12-14]</u>. Ifleft undiagnosed and untreated， these lesions may result in considerable morbidity and mortality 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>.\n\n【11】The ideal course oftreatment can be chosen after extensive clinical evaluation and non-invasive imaging and angiographic studies. The preferred initial diagnostic technique for assessing the kidneys is ultrasonography. On Computed Tomography (CT) imaging， AVM appear as masses of vascular density with dilated draining renal veins通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u>. The best method for displaying the precise vascular anatomy of a renal vascular abnormality is still angiography， which can define the main arterial supply， the presence of a nidus， the size of the arteriovenous shunt and venous drainage 通用删除6(英):<u>[4，9]</u>.\n\n【12】Surgical treatment of these anomalies has been replaced by endovascular embolization， which is considered the procedure of choice， because it allows occlusion of the vascular lesion with preservation of the unaffected renal parenchyma通用删除6(英):<u>[5，10，14，15]</u>.\n\n【13】We present a clinical case， imaging studies and management related to a patient with a giant congenital right renal AVM that was treated with endovascular embolization.\n\n【14】Case Presentation\n\n【15】The case of a 51-year-old woman with no significant medical history other than recurrent Urinary Tract Infection (UTI) is presented.\n\n【16】An ultrasound was requested during follow-up of her urological pathology， and it revealed a mass in the lower pole of the right kidney with a longitudinal axis of approximately 4 cm. It had an irregular morphology and a partially calcified， echogenic wall. Doppler study revealed that it was a vascular structure. The rest of the examination and blood and urine tests were normal. The patient did not report back pain， hematuria or other symptoms derived from the lesion described.删除1换行arteriovenous malformation was evident occupying the entire lower third of the kidnev. The malformation measured 42 mm x22 mmx26 mm and was dependent on an inferior polar artery of hilar origin.\n\n【17】After careful discussion of the case with the local staffand with the patient， the decision was to perform angiography and embolization of the lesion under local anesthesia by interventional radiologists.\n\n【18】Catheterization of the right femoral artery and a selective arteriography of the right kidney were performed with a 7F curved guide catheter， revealing that the inferior polar artery was feeding the aneurysmal sac.\n\n【19】Endovascular treatment was successfullyperformed by deposition of small caliber fibrous micro-coils until complete occlusion of the aneurysmal sac and nutritional artery .\n\n【20】The patient remained in the hospital ward for 24 h and was discharged with no immediate complications and with stable renal function.\n\n【21】An abdominal CT scan performed 1 month after the procedure showed the embolization material correctly positioned， with no recanalization of the vascular malformation and good perfusion of the remaining renal parenchyma . Serum creatinine was normal (0.9 mg/dL). The CT scans at 3- and 6-months follow-up show no changes.\n\n【22】Discussion\n\n【23】Renal arteriovenous malformations are rare vascular anomalies with.heterogeneousmanifestations.Thieepatient may remain asymptomatic， and AVM are frequently diagnosed incidentally on imaging studies performed for a different reason 通用删除6(英):<u>[6，16]</u>.

Multiple materials have been used with excellent results reported 通用删除6(英):<u>[5，14]</u>. Surgery is occasionally necessary for very large anomalies or unstable patients.\n\n【27】Follow-up after endovascular treatment for renal AVM is not well defined. The main endpoint is symptom resolution， if previously present. Furthermore， control of renal function should be performed within the first 48 h after the procedure. Initial worsening with progressive improvement is common. Blood pressure should also be monitored通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>.\n\n【28】The imaging test of choice during follow-up is contrast-enhanced CT， which allows to assess the success of the procedure， to determine the existence of a parenchymal infarction and to evaluate the hypothetical coil migration and its consequences 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>. There is some experience with the use of angiography during follow-up to assess parenchymal perfusion， although coils may limit image quality.

Later， it was found that PBL also occurred in people with normal immune function 通用删除6(英):<u>[2-4]</u>. Our study demonstrated that patients with PBL were immunocompetent and the prognosis seems to be better than that reported by western countries通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. The pathogenesis of PBL remains largely unknown and the prognosis was still poor and it is urgent to develop new targets and agents.\n\n【8】删除10:<u>China</u>\n\n【9】Here， we reported a male patient with HIV V negative PBL with rapidprogression after chemotherapy followed by ASCT.\n\n【10】通用间距删除-1:<u>Citation：</u>\n\n【11】A 57-year-old Chinese male presented in November 2021 with multiple lymph nodes enlargement which was detected by computed tomography for lung during physical examination. No systematic symptom was observed and he was negative for HIV test. The patient was referred for 18F-FDG PET/CT examination and extensive 18F-FDG positive mass involving lymph nodes throughout the body (cervical， mediastinal and hilar) and pancreas were detected . No evidence of lymphoma was observed by bone marrow biopsy of the right iliac crest. A biopsy of the supraclavicular lymph node indicated a B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma with plasmablastic morphology and immunohistochemistry results showed that CD38， Mum-1， CD30， Bcl-2， c-Myc were positive while CD20， CD79a， Bcl-6，CD10， CD138， CD30， CD138， PAX-5， TIA-1，CD4，CD8， CD7， CD43. The ki-67 expression was nearly 100% and EBV-Encoded small RNA (EBER)-1/2 was positive.\n\n【12】Laboratory examination was as follows： White blood cells 8500/uL， hemoglobin 13.5 g/dL， platelets 340，000/uL； the lactate dehydrogenase， serum calcium and immunoglobulin levels were at normal ranges； following the PET/CT and biopsy results， the patient received 5 cycles of DA-\n\n【13】EPOCH chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide，doxorubicin， vincristine， etoposide， prednisone). The metabolic activity decreased significantly and the patient achieved partial remission as determined by PET/CT . This patient received Autologous hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (ASCT) as consolidation therapy after chemotherapy. However， disease progression occurred and brain metastases was revealed by MRI two months after ASCT . The patient died around three months after ASCT and the overall survival time was around 11 months.\n\n【14】Discussion\n\n【15】PBL was classified as a special subtype of Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) in the 2016 World Health Organization(WHO) classification of lymphoid and hematopoietic diseases. Although previous studies showed that PBL mainly occurred in the HIV positive population 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>， recent research demonstrated that most of the reported cases of PBL in China were elderly with normal immune function 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>.\n\n【16】The most common sites of HIV negative PBL were oral cavity， followed by gastrointestinal tract， lymph node and skin 通用删除6(英):<u>[2，4]</u>. The删除1换行pathomorphological features of PBL were unique， the tumor cells had immunocytoblast/plasmablastic morphology but showed plasma cell markers， with weakly expressed or no expression of mature B cell markers such as CD20， PAX-5， CD3， CD45. CD56Was expressed in some cases 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>.\n\n【17】PBL is characterized by high recurrence and mortality rates and poor overall prognosis. At present， there is no standard treatment regimen for PBL. Surgery and radiotherapy are mainly used for early cases with local involvement. Anthracycline-containing regimens such as CHOP or CHOP-like regimens are commonly used 通用删除6(英):<u>[3，4，7]</u>. However， the duration of remission obtained by chemotherapy is short， and ASCT shows greater feasibility， especially for patients with high risk factors. A retrospective analysis of 9 HIV-negative PBL patients from Moffitt Cancer Center in the United States was conducted. Four patients received ASCT as consolidation therapy after complete remission (first complete remission) as first-line therapy. The survival time was 13.3 months and 36.5 months， respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for HIV-negative PBL has rarely been reported. The patient in our study received ASCT after achieving PR， however， brain metastasis occurred and the survival time was 11 months.\n\n【18】Conclusion\n\n【19】HIV-negative PBL is an aggressive disease and most of the patients are in late stage. ASCT may be a better treatment option for HIV-negative PBL patients.

In 1928， Kubie 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u> first described it as teratomatous cysts and later as intestinomas by Puuseep 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u> in 1934. In 1954， the current name of Neuroenteric cyst was given|删除段之间换行|These are benign cysts of foregut origin with endodermal lining from the incomplete dissolution of the neuroenteric canal. There are two theories which describe the origin of these cysts. First， at the time of notochordal development， failure of separation of notochord and foregut during the process of excalation leads to incorporation of endodermal cells with notochord which later becomes Neuroenteric cysts 通用删除6(英):<u>[4-6]</u>. Second theory is of an endodermal diverticulum behind the oropharyngeal membrane called as Seesel pouch which may be a progenitor for midline supratentorial cysts 通用删除6(英):<u>[7，8]</u>.\n\n【21】These cysts are mostly seen in the spine but can be rarely seen intra cranially. They are commonly seen in posterior fossa， anterior to brainstem， frequently in midline and sometimes in cerebellopontine angle 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>.\n\n【22】Histologically the intracranial Neuroenteric cysts are classified as mucin poor and mucin rich based on the content of mucin within the cyst. The mucin poor cyst shows pseudostratified ciliated columnar epithelium while the mucin rich cyst shows simple columnar epithelium 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>.\n\n【23】Few important imaging features of neuroenteric cyst have been described. Also， the imaging characteristics vary as per the content of the cyst like the mucin， a proteinaceous secretion. On Computed tomography， Mucin rich cysts appear hyperdense and mucin poor appear mildly hypodense. In MRI imaging， the protein content tends to vary the signal characteristics on T1 and T2. The lesions appears hyper intense on FLAIR sequence， predominantly hyper intense on T2W and sometimes hypo intense and on T1W it appears hyper to isointense compared to CSF. Contrast study shows no obvious contrast enhancement except at the site where the cyst is adherent with brain parenchyma 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>.\n\n【24】Neuroenteric cyst can be circular or lobulated and significantly hypo intense on T2W images due to presence ofhigh protein content， squamous metaplasia and keratin debris. Presence of NAA like peak at 2.02 ppm on MR spectroscopy was considered specific for these cysts 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>. This NAA like peak is supposed to be secreted by celllining of the cyst wall and contains perchloric acid or sialic acid bound to macromolecules resonating at 2.02 ppm 通用删除6(英):<u>[12，13]</u>.\n\n【25】The main differential diagnosis of neuroenteric cyst are arachnoid cyst， epidermoid cyst， dermoid cyst rarely Rathke and colloid cyst. However imaging features can differentiate between these cysts. Arachnoid cyst is of CSF intensity on all the MRI sequences， epidermoid cyst shows restricted diffusion， Rathke and colloid cyst have different site of location.

In addition we found heavily T2W sequence like CISS 3D very useful in differentiating these cysts.

Subsequently，the neuroenteric cyst ruptured spontaneously during the hospital course causing chemical aseptic meningitis with sulcal and cisternal FLAIRhyperintensity and intense leptomeningeal enhancement. Following treatment with steroids， patient recovered completely within two days. Follow-up imaging showed near total resolution of the neuroenteric cyst. In our knowledge this is first case， showing near total resolution of the neuroenteric cyst following spontaneous rupture without any obvious trauma. We could not get the imaging follow up of the patient but telephonic follow-up suggested that patient was asymptomatic.\n\n【30】Conclusion\n\n【31】Clinical signs of headache and vomiting in a known case of neuroenteric cyst could be the warning sign of impending rupture and spontaneous rupture can occur leading to partial or complete resolution. Also CISS 3D sequence (heavily T2W) can be used additionally to further characterize the cystic lesions.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

There are effective laser treatments for the prevention and therapy of OM， however， the lack of trained professionals difficult the use of this technique in Brazil's public hospitals， being necessary alternative treatments to circumvent this issue. Non-clinical studies conducted by our group to elucidate the mechanism of action of A. chica extract with further toxicity on genotoxicity and mutagenicity reports provided necessary data to apply for authorization to conduct clinical trial with the herbal gel containing 2.5%Arrabidaea chica Verlot standardized extract. The open-label clinical trial protocol aims to access safety issues of the herbal gel on oral mucosa of healthy research participants. This clinical trial was approved by the ethics committee of research in humans at the Faculty of Medical Sciences of University of Campinas (report no. 007891/2015). Results of this trial demonstrated that herbal gel is safe， which culminated in the approval of the phase 2 clinical studyprotocols.\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Clinical trials are a way to test new methods of diagnosing， treating， or preventing health conditions. The goal is to determine whether something is both safe and effective. Clinical trials take place in four different phases during which different questions are asked. Each phase provide evidence on safety and efficacy issues related to the intervention under study. Drug developments proceed throughout all four phases over a long period of time. With phase four being a surveillance phase after post marketing to monitor safety issues with broaden use. Phase I focuses on safety issues with participant groups that range from 20 to 100 research participants， generally with healthy individuals aiming to determine which is the highest dose humans can tolerate without serious side effects. Investigators monitor this phase closely to see the drug candidate's outcome on participants’health 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>.\n\n【4】These studies are fundamental to identify new products for the relief of symptoms that cause patients suffering， seeking to improve patient’s life quality. Among diseases that are life-threatening with various side effects arising from treatment are neoplasia. Oral Mucositis (OM) is a frequent event in patients treated with radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy， which tends to appear in buccal and labial surfaces， the ventral surface of the tongue， the floor of the mouth， and the soft palate of patients. This side effect interferes in patient’s life quality since oral mucositis is associated with considerable pain and dysphagia which also complicates nutritional intake， increases susceptibility to infections， and leads to cancer treatment interruption， that has outcomes on total treatment increased cost 通用删除6(英):<u>[2-6]</u>.\n\n【5】The Brazilian government published the RENISUS list that consist of plants that are of interest to further study for the purpose to apply in the public system of health (SUS) 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. Arrabidaea chica(Humb.& Bonpl.) Verlot， was included in this list as result of previous reports indicating healing and antiulcerogenic activity in preclinical studies 通用删除6(英):<u>[8，9]</u>. The crude standardized A. chica extract， enriched with anthocyanins， demonstrated calcaneus tendons healing in animal model 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>，along with reduction of cutaneous fulcerations， evaluated in experimental in vivo healing experimental model with semisolid basis incorporated extract 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>. Arrabidaea chica extract decreased 96%wound area in dermal ulcer models of male Wistar rats. In diabetic Wistar rats， A. chica extract decreased the ulcerated area by 85% 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>.\n\n【6】Preclinical toxicity study with A. chica extract evaluated on Salmonella test and in vivo删除1换行micronucleus test from mice bone marrow confirmed that the sample tested did not present any mutagenic or genotoxic potential， inferring the extract to be genetically safe 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>. In gastrointestinal tract mucositis and oral mucositis experimental models induced by5-fluoracil in mice and hamsters showed that animals treated with A. chica extract had an increase in survival lifespan in comparison with the negative control. Furthermore a decrease of diarrhea and increase of food intake was also observed 通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u>. Recently Wiziack Zago et al. reported that at low concentrations， A. chica extract showed promising cytoprotective effects against zoledronic acid induced damage.\n\n【7】These results contributed to the development of the phase I clinical study protocol with the objective of identifying possible adverse events and toxicity signs of the herbal medicine containing A. chica extract applied to healthy participants.\n\n【8】Clinical Experience with Phase 1Studies\n\n【9】In the order to evaluate the safety of an herbal gel containing 2.5%Arrabidaea chica Verlot standardized extract on the oral mucosa of healthy research participants a phase 1 clinical trial protocol submitted to the Research Ethics Committee (CEP) was developed. This clinical trial was approved by the ethics committee of research in humans at the Faculty of Medical Sciences of University of Campinas(report no. 007891/2015).\n\n【10】Twenty research participants were selected after laboratory， clinical， and dental evaluation. Ten men and ten women， who were framed within the concept of healthy individuals. Following Resolution 466 of December 2012 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>， participants signed the Informed Consent Form (ICF) before entering the open-label study carried out during 30 days. On May 19h， 2016， after medical， dental， and pharmaceutical anamnesis， 1 pump pack containing the herbal medicine (the study object) was dispensed. The herbal medicine was given to participants every 10 days within 30 calendar days.\n\n【11】The instructions were to use the gel three times a day， morning， afternoon， and night， in 4 different oral mucosa regions (palate， right and left cheek， under the tongue). Before each application， participants were guided to sanitize the oral cavity by brushing and flossing teeth with no further water and food intake for 30 min after product application. The participants remained in their routine activities and maintained their normal general diets.\n\n【12】Each participant had a paper file for registering any discomfort or pertinent observation， during the 30 days of gel application， such as burning， use of concomitant medication or even forgetting to apply the gel. Weekly， the participants were submitted to clinical pharmaceutical， medical， and dental evaluations. At the end of the30 days of gel application， all the participants repeated the laboratory tests which， together with the diary and the clinical annotations of the medical records were analyzed to evaluate the possible adverse events generated by the use of the herbal medicine.\n\n【13】There are no reports of adverse events found in the literature for the crude extract of Arrabidaea chica， therefore， for patient follow-up， the events described in the package insert of a mucoadhesive herbal gel already commercialized and prescribed for mucositis， such as dry mouth， rash， itching， coughing， redness in the face， among other hypersensitivity reactions that could arise were monitored. The extract's red coloring was also taken into account， since the extract could stain mucosa and teeth. Also any discomfort caused by the删除1换行texture of the gel associated with the sweet taste due to the natural sugars present in the extract was assessed regarding the presence of nausea and even vomiting at the time of application. For security monitoring purposes， the participants were monitored daily and any and every report thoroughly analyzed.\n\n【14】According to the report of all the at the application sites， the oral mucosa， as well as the nearby teeth， were stained with “bright”red， but after a few hours， this color was no longer visible. During the study，the following adverse events were observed：\n\n【15】 A participant， displayed throat inflammation after medical evaluation that was promptly treated with anti-inflammatory drugs， nevertheless this event after a thorough clinical evaluation was proven not to have relationship with the test medication.\n\n【16】 Complaint of migraine， from a participant after using the herbal medicine for the first time. As the first application of the gel was assisted by the research team， the medical and dental evaluation was immediate， where the use of an analgesic was advised. The second application was then carried out under the supervision ofthe research investigator and there was no further complaint. The adverse event， after clinical evaluations， therefore did not have relationship with the use of the gel.\n\n【17】 Report of unpleasant taste by a participant but without signs of nausea or rejection of the gel.\n\n【18】 A participant reported that the gel had better grip on the cheeks and felt a numbness in the region of the tongue. After dental evaluation， this reported event may be related to the use of the test medication.\n\n【19】 A participant reported pain in the dental arch after the tenth day of the study. Self-medicated with an analgesic and reported pain improvement. The day after the report， a dental evaluation was performed and this event was not related to the use of the test medication， but to a tension in the dental arch.\n\n【20】These results were submitted to the CEP， through a report for the evaluation of the execution of the study as well as of all medical， dental， and pharmaceutical clinical evaluations carried out and of the cases of the reported adverse events. The report was approved culminating in the development of the Phase 2 study protocol，which， after approval by the same ethics committee， is undergoing for the assessment of safety and efficacy 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>.\n\n【21】Conclusion\n\n【22】The complexity of developing a clinical protocol coupled with low financial investment in the areas of research on natural products discourages translational progress from pre-clinical to clinical phases. Therefore， herein insight to the importance of investing on the discovery of new products for the relief of patients' suffering， seeking life quality is a positive influence for the treatment of diseases of life-threatening neoplasia with the various side effects resulting from treatment. Furthermore， data provided herein permitted to apply for the ongoing phase II trial， stimulating research progress with products from natural sources.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

Topiramate is a first line agent for migraine prophylaxis； however25% of migraine sufferers are unable to tolerate its side effects. Topiramate can cause fatigue and cognitive dysfunction mimicking the symptoms of CFS/ME therefore there is uncertainty if this group is able to tolerate Topiramate.\n\n【2】Aim： To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of Topiramate in Migraine prophylaxis in CFS/ME patients\n\n【3】Design： A retrospective study.\n\n【4】Methods： Data was gathered from two specialist CFS/ME rehabilitation services who serve a population of >600.000 in the north of England. Patients started on Topiramate for migraine prophylaxis were contacted and their feedback regarding Topiramate including current dose， efficacy， side effects and reason for withdrawal if appropriate were noted.\n\n【5】Results： 27 patients were started on Topiramate. 24 were females with a mean age of 37(SD27). The dose ranged between 25 mg to 125 mg with mean 79 mg daily.5 patients (18.5%) could not tolerate Topiramate because of increasing fatigue； cognitive side effects and paresthesia. 3 patients had side effects of self-limiting paresthesia and continued with the medication.

As the physical examination and investigations are invariably normal 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>， the diagnosis is made using diagnostic criteria such as Fukuda criteria 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u> or Canadian consensus criteria 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. Symptoms such as debilitating fatigue which is not relieved by rest and is associated with post exertional malaise are the hallmarks of the illness 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. Other symptoms such as unrefreshing sleep， physical pain and cognitive impairment are also common. All diagnostic criteria include headaches as a common feature of CFS/ME. Headaches can present in different forms such as tension headaches， episodic or chronic migraines 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. More than two thirds of Migraine sufferers fulfill the criteria for diagnosis of CFS/ME 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u> and more than 80% of CFS/ME patients complain of migraine 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>. Recent advances in the understanding of the two conditions suggest that a common pathology may explain such strong association 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>.\n\n【11】The focus on a vascular phenomenon as the primary pathology of migraine has proven an inadequate explanation as the complex interplay between the peripheral trigeminal vascular and the complex central networks are suggesting a much more complex pathology 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>. Recent research has also shown that the approach to CFS/ME as a solely functional disorder with psychosocial factors删除表格换行predisposing， precipitating and also perpetuating the condition is a simplistic explanation for this common and disabling condition. The persistent symptoms can be at least partially explained by a central sensitisation process， a process shared with migraine， fibromyalgia and Gulf War Illness 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>.\n\n【12】Table 1： Comparison between our cohort and the pooled data analysing topiramate use 通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u>.\n\n|  | Studied cohort  | Topiramate pooled data 通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u>  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| >50% reduction in frequency of migraine attacks  | 19/27(70%)  | 46%  |\n| >75% reduction in frequency of migraine attacks  | 10/27(39%)  | 25%  |\n| Average dose  | 79mg  | 100mg  |\n| Topiramate discontinued (not tolerated)  | 5/27(18.5%)  | 25%  |\n| Side effects (total  | 8/27 (29%)  | >50%  |\n\n【14】Such strong correlation between CFS/ME and migraine is not just of interest to neuroscientists but also has significant implications in clinical practice. Stress and anxiety are strong perpetuators of both conditions and a successful reduction of its burden is likely to help both conditions 通用删除6(英):<u>[12，13]</u>. Pharmacological management of the2 conditions can be a challenge in some patients with many CFS/ME patients either having several medications to manage other symptoms such as physical pain， insomnia or mood disorders 通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u>. Paradoxically， some CFS/ME patients find it difficult to tolerate many medications 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u> especially with associated conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome， idiopathic environmental intolerance or because of the medications impact on already depleted energy levels.\n\n【15】Propranolol and Topiramate are suggested as the first line migraine prophylactic treatment in patients older than 12 years 通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>. We could not identify any scientific literature reporting on the use of either drug in migraine patients suffering also from CFS/ME. In this short paper we are reporting our experience using Topiramate in a cohort of CFS/ME for migraine prophylaxis.\n\n【16】Methods\n\n【17】Two specialist services for CFS/ME management serve a population of more than 600.000 residents (Wigan， Bolton and Bury) in the north west of England. The first author provides medical input for both services. The standard practice is to use Topiramate as a first line treatment with Propranolol and Pizotifen occasionally used if specifically needed for a clinical reason. All CFS/ME patients prescribed migraine prophylaxis in a period of 24 months were identified from the patients'electronic records. Those patients were contacted either by phone or face to face during a clinical review. The patients demographics and type of medication prescribed were documented. The patients still on the medication prescribed were asked about their response (no attacks， more than 50% improvement in frequency， less than 50% frequency or no improvement)； the patients were asked about any side effects and what the dose they are on. The patients who decided to discontinue the drug prescribed were identified and asked about the main side effects that led to discontinuation of the drug.\n\n【18】Results\n\nProphylactic management wasFprescribed for 37Ppatients but only 33 could be contacted. 3 patients decided not to start the medication. Two patients were started on Propranolol as they had poorly controlled anxiety and Propranolol was deemed uniquely suitable to tackle the anxiety as well. Both patients reported reduction of migraine frequency ofaround 50%. Another patient was started on|删除段之间换行|Pizotifen because of an associated nutritional problem. The Pizotifen reduced the migraine frequency by more than 50%. Full data was available for 27 patients who started Topiramate. Their age ranged between 18-62 years with a mean 37 (SD11.9). 3 were males. 5 patients(18.5%) could not tolerate Topiramate and discontinued it (2 because of paraesthesia and 3 because of cognitive impairment).\n\n【20】Patients 22 (81.5%) on Topiramate were on doses of 25 mg to125 mg daily 79 (SD27.9). Only 3 reported self-limiting paraesthesia and the other 19 (70%) denied having any side effects. 10 patients(39%) reported complete control of their migraine， 9 (33%) reported more than 50% improvement in frequency whilst 3 (11%) reported less than 50% improvement.\n\n【21】Discussion\n\n【22】Three double blind randomised controlled trials published in 2004reported the positive impact of Topiramate in Migraine prophylaxis通用删除6(英):<u>[17-19]</u>. MIGR 1 MIGR 2 showed Topiramate to be significantly better than placebo whilst MIGR 3 demonstrated the equivalence of both Topiramate and Propranolol in migraine prophylaxis. A daily dose of 100 mg was superior to 50 mg dose which failed to significantly improve migraine control， whilst 200 mg daily had a similar impact in the frequency of attacks. A dose of 100mg/day was duly recommended as the standard recommended dose for migraine prophylaxis 通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u>.\n\n【23】The pooled data from the 3 trials was presented by D'amico in2006 通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u>. The data suggested that almost half of the patients on Topiramate should expect at least a 50% reduction in the frequency of migraine attacks. On the other hand， the pooled data highlighted the problems many of the patients may experience with side effects especially paraesthesia which affects half of the subjects； other side effects such as fatigue， speech problems and cognitive impairment are also common complications of Topiramate use. The severity and refractory nature of the side effects resulted in a high level of intolerance ofthe drug with roughly quarter of the subjects having to discontinue the drug according to the pooled data.\n\n【24】Such high levels of intolerance of Topiramate may discourage clinicians from prescribing it especially in a patient group such as CFS/ME sufferers 通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u>. Problems with drug intolerance， fatigue， cognitive impairment and/or chronic pain are cardinal features of the disease 通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u>； therefore， concerns about Topiramate worsening these symptoms seems to be a valid issue when consideringtreatment strategies.\n\n【25】The comparison between the outcomes and tolerance of our cohort in comparison with the pooled data reported by D'Amico shows in . The comparison suggests at least a similar favorable response to Topiramate if not a superior control of the migraine frequency. Less patients in our cohort reported side effects or discontinued the drug compared to the pooled data as well.\n\n【26】Several aspects in our clinical practice and the nature of CFS/ME patients may explain such a positive result. Our standard practice is to initiate pharmacological management simultaneously with the CFS/ME rehabilitation programmed which often includes concepts such as stress management， relaxation techniques， pacing among other strategies that may have a positive impact on migraine management通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u>. The patient also receives detailed information about the potential side effects with explicit recommendations to build up the dose slowly with an offer for support from the team if needed. The potential for weight loss as a common side effect 通用删除6(英):<u>[25]</u> is also highlighted. One would expect some patients to welcome such side effect especially that many CFS/ME patients find it difficult to control their weight because of lack of physical activity or side effects of other medications (e.g. GABA agonists)通用删除6(英):<u>[26]</u>.\n\n【27】We also feel that the similarities between the common side effects of Topiramate and the main symptoms of CFS/ME may paradoxically help some patients tolerate these side effects as they experience it readily. A migraine sufferer experiencing paraesthesia or cognitive impairment for the first time to may be more concerned about such symptoms and more likely to report them or discontinue the drug.\n\n【28】This is a short retrospective study reporting the outcomes of a small number of subiects. We would like to stress the caution that must be exercised when interpreting the results or attempting to generalize the conclusions. The authors are the clinicians treating the subjects so a bias from both sides (patients and clinicians) cannot be excluded. Having said that， we feel that our observations should be in the public domain to at least encourage further evaluation of the pharmacological management in such complex population of overlapping co-morbidities.\n\n【29】In conclusion， we feel that reluctance to use Topiramate for migraine prophylaxis when associated with CFS/ME because of the concerns about intolerance is unjustified. Further research evaluating pharmacological interventions in patients with complex co-morbidities is needed to provide more informed guidance for clinical practice.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

These patients were treated with intrathecalautologous bone marrow total nucleated cells. All three patients demonstrated clinical improvements in their neurological functions. Additionally， fMRI was performed 6， 9， and 10 months， respectively， after the intervention. An increase in anisotropy fraction was observed when evaluated by specialized MRI radiologists， which correlated with their improvements.\n\n【3】Discussion： It has been demonstrated that hematopoietic progenitor cells promote neurogenesis and angiogenesis in brain tissue affected by hypoxic-ischemic injury. This report seeks to add the idea of using fMRI to evaluate improvements after interventions where stem cells are used.

So， how can we explain the improvement of patients with therapy? Evidence suggests that the benefits obtained through treatments such as this one is due to immunomodulatory effects since they migrate to sites where there is inflammation and cell damage and have a chemotactic impact 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>， secrete many bioactive molecules that promote cell regeneration 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u> and angiogenesis 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>.\n\n【30】This has been evidenced by the fact that this type of cell has been used successfully in therapies of another nature， where the damaged tissue is not of the hematopoietic lineage， such as neurons 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>， skeletal muscles， and kidneys 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>.\n\n【31】Conventional imaging methods have not proved to be useful for objectively measuring improvements in patients with CP. The fMRI is a more sensitive and invaluable tool that can impartially dimension the changes and improvements after stem cell therapy. In addition， this can give us better evidence of neurogenesis and angiogenesis.\n\n【32】Because CP does not have a conventional or specific treatment owing to its complexity and does not boost regardless of standard treatments， as rehabilitation， stem cell therapy could be a therapeutic option to improve the quality of life of these patients and their families.\n\n【33】We decided to use the IT route as the route of administration for several reasons. Although the IV route is better in terms of safety，删除1换行the number of cells administered IV that can cross the blood-brain barrier still needs to be clarified. In addition， it must be considered a loss of cells distributed in other organs (e.g.， liver， lung， etc.) 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>. When cells are administered IT， more of these cells are concentrated in the hypoxic areas 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>. The IT route has proven to be safe and tolerated， with side effects such as fever， headache，nausea， vomiting， and stiffness of the neck， which do not last for more than six days5，12.删除1换行fMRI is a tool that can objectively identify changes and improvements after cell therapy， as in the 3 patients mentioned above. Unfortunately， conventional imaging methods have not proven to be very useful since the size of ischemia or edema reduction does not directly correlate with the clinical improvements observed in patients 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>. Currently， more sophisticated methods such as fMRI， which， through anisotropy， is more sensitive and allows analysis of the restructuration of the white matter and its fascicles，provide more evidence of neurogenesis and angiogenesis 通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u>. Although that brain fMRI did not show evidence of morphological changes， an increase in the anisotropy fraction of the cortical tract was found compared to the study performed before treatment . Furthermore， it was also observed an increase in white matter formation.\n\n【34】Conclusion\n\n【35】CP is a condition that does not improve despite current treatments. The application of BM-TNC can enhance neurogenesis and angiogenesis in affected hypoxic-ischemic brain tissue， which could result in an alternative treatment for patients with this condition. This was demonstrated by fMRI in the cases above and can become a powerful tool to obiectively evaluate changes in the central nervous system， specifically in the white matter tracts.

Although usually diagnosed in the first decades of life， it is possible that manifestations are not recognized at older ages. This article aims to report the case of a 70-year-old female patient， admitted to the emergency department with delirium， and who， after ruling out organic causes， was diagnosed with a rare mitochondrial syndrome. The detailed evaluation of the case allowed the diagnosis of MELAS syndrome， with symptoms manifesting late. In this report， the importance of possible differential diagnoses regarding encephalopathies of atypical course is highlighted， even in patients with advanced ages.\n\n【2】Keywords： MELAS； Delirium； Mitochondrial Diseases； Older adults\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】MELAS (Mitochondrial myopathy， Encephalopathy， Lactic Acidosis and Stroke) syndrome is one of the most common mitochondrial diseases， although its prevalence is rare (0.18 cases per100，000 population/year) 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，2]</u>. There are reports of more than 30 pathogenic variants related to this syndrome， as the m.3243A>G mutation is known as the most commonly found. It is a mitochondrial DNA pathogenic variant， and maternal relatives of patients with the syndrome may carry this mutation without showing symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. The prognosis of patients with MELAS is quite unfavorable， with rapid and aggressive progression； thus， patients hardly ever reach advanced ages and only 1% to 6% of cases occur after the age of 40 years 通用删除6(英):<u>[4，5]</u>.\n\n【5】Especially for patients at older ages， MELAS syndrome manifests as cumulative multi-organ disease with broad manifestations that are relatively common to agingpopulation including stroke-like episodes， dementia， hearing impairment， muscle weakness and diabetes. Such impairments， evaluated separately， would hardly be attributed to a rare genetic syndrome， especially in an older patient and could possibly be undiagnosed. Similarly， the syndrome may course with cognitive deterioration in different degrees， and its manifestations may mimic an acute confusion condition， that could be attributed to other cause or even and undefined etiology 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，2]</u>.\n\n【6】This case report aims to describe a patient with an initial clinical manifestation of delirium， which， after extensive investigation， led to a late diagnosis of MELAS syndrome. Previous cognitive alterations， history of familial migraine，neuroimaging exams， and a positive family history with the pathogenic variant m.3243A>G helped in the diagnostic conclusion.\n\n【7】Case Presentation\n\n【8】删除10:<u>cited.</u>\n\n【9】A 70-year-old white female patient was admitted to the emergency room with a history of psychomotor agitation and worsening of disorientation that began the day before admission. Her comorbidity history was referred by a son and consisted of systemic arterial hypertension， type II diabetes mellitus not properly controlled， visual and auditory impairment since the age of 50， and no history of smoking. During her medical history， it was also reported that， approximately a year before， the patient had a stroke， manifested with aphasia and transient motor deficit (right hemiparesis). Since then， she had been apathetic， with periods of disorientation and psychomotor agitation， associated with tonic-clonic seizures. She presented a neuroimaging exam that showed previous ischemic insults. In the first 24 h of hospitalization， the patient presented with decreased level of consciousness associated with generalized tonic-clonic seizures， with gasping respiratory pattern， being submitted to orotracheal intubation in the emergency room and referred to the intensive care unit for neurological monitoring and hemodynamic control.\n\n【10】During the investigation， Computed Tomography (CT) of the skull demonstrated cortical-subcortical hypodensities in the left temporal and occipital region with liquor density， suggesting encephalomalacia due to a previous ischemic event， and another temporal cortical-subcortical hypodensity on the right， suggesting another area of ischemia. Laboratory testing showed elevated blood glucose， with no evidence of bacterial infection and negative viral serological markers. Electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm and repolarization alteration； transthoracic echocardiogram with preserved cardiac function and mild mitral insufficiency； doppler of carotids showed no obstructions. Sedation was discontinued a couple of days after but the patient did not recover consciences.\n\n【11】Furthermore， an electroencephalogram was performed， which showed no epileptiform seizure pattern， as well as a control CT scan of the skull， with no evidence of acute ischemic or hemorrhagic events. Thus， it was decided to collect Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF)， which showed elevated lactate (58 mg/dl-RV： 9-19 mg/dl)， with no other alterations. During hospitalization， the patient underwent skull Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (MRI) due to clinical worsening， demonstrating an alteration in the cortical-subcortical intensity of the temporal lobes，hyperintense on T2 and FLAIR， notably to the left. Contrast enhancement in the thalamic capsular vascular lesion， on the left. Lentiform nucleus has hypersignal on FLAIR， hypoxic-ischemic lesion， dilatation of the ventricular system . Cranial arterial and venous angioresonance was also performed， which showed no evidence of aneurysmal dilatation or stenosis.\n\nRegarding clinical evolution， the patient underwent treatment for subsequent infectious conditions， required dialysis therapy with recovery of renal function and， due to the indispensability of|删除段之间换行|Discussion\n\n【13】Genetic diseases involving pathogenic variants are more prevalent in youngpatients， rarely developing symptoms after the age of 65. Among the diseases caused by pathogenic variants， one of the most frequent is MELAS syndrome. The manifestations of MELAS are typical in childhood， with a prevalence of 65% to 76% of affected individuals presenting symptoms until the age of 20 通用删除6(英):<u>[4，5]</u>. Although the onset of MELAS manifestations is more typical in young patients， this case report shows a later onset of symptoms.\n\n【14】MELAS syndrome is a neurodegenerative disease caused by the decreased ability of cells to produce sufficient energy in the form of Adenosine 5'-Triphosphate (ATP) 通用删除6(英):<u>[5，6]</u>. Dysfunctional mitochondria are unable to generate enough ATP to meet the energy needs of various organs，particularly those with high energy demands， including the nervous system， skeletal and cardiac muscles，kidneys， liver， and endocrine system 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>.\n\n【15】MELAS involves multiple organ involvement with diverse clinical manifestations， including neurological symptoms， lactic acidosis， myopathy， recurrent headaches， hearing impairment， psychiatric， renal， gastrointestinal， and endocrine disorders 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. Symptoms develop when the metabolic demands of the body exceed the available energy supply of the defective mitochondria 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>. The most com manifestations of MELAS include altered level of consciousness， stroke-like e episodes， focall or generalized1 seizures， migraine headaches， and dementia. Stroke-like episodes are so described because they do not present an ischemic etiology， and the affected areas do not correspond to the classical vascular distributions 通用删除6(英):<u>[6，9]</u>.\n\n【16】The reported patient initially presented with two important clinical manifestations： Acute onset disorientation and psychomotor agitation， attributed at first to a delirium possibly superimposed on a previous neurodegenerative condition. Acute changes in the emergency department have a high prevalence in patients over 65years of age. Commonly， these patients are rashly diagnosed with delirium， and the organic cause is often not identified. Delirium is defined as an acute neuropsychiatric syndrome marked by cognitive and behavioral changes. It comprises a brain dysfunction， with删除1换行multifactorial etiology， of abrupt onset and fluctuating course. Delirium is a common disease， but 55% to 80% of cases are not recognized and are not documented by the clinical team treating the disease 通用删除6(英):<u>[7，10]</u>. Initially， the management involves identifying several etiologies， such as： Psychoactive drugs， hydroelectrolytic alterations， severe pain， hypoxemia， severe anemia， infections， and significant immobility 通用删除6(英):<u>[11-14]</u>.\n\n【17】In the present case， after excluding the most common etiologies that trigger delirium， the presence of clinical manifestations， such as seizures， decreased level of consciousness and behavioral changes， associated with a history of recurrent headaches， psychiatric alterations and maternal family history， and neuroimaging exams， stimulates clinical reasoning focused on differential and uncommon diagnoses of other encephalopathies. After a joint investigation of the clinical， family， laboratory， and imaging history， it is concluded to be a rare mitochondrial syndrome.\n\n【18】As a genetic disease with hereditary characteristics， MELAS is a progressive neurodegenerative disease associated with polygenic mutations， inherited from the mother， of the mitochondrial DNA通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>. Thus， a rigorous review of family history is of great importance， especially in relation to maternal antecedents， including a history of migraine， exercise intolerance， and psychiatric alterations. In the clinical case reported here， the family history proved to be of enormous magnitude to hypothesize MELAS as a possible diagnosis.\n\n【19】As well as the clinical history， the radiological examination is extremely important to aid in the diagnosis， since the lesions are similar to stroke in the temporal， occipital and parietal regions. The affected areas do not correspond to the classical vascular distributions， presenting an irregular distribution， well associated with metabolic or small vessel etiology 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>. In the reported case， neuroimaging exams showed cortico-subcortical alterations in temporal and occipital regions， on the left， and thalamus， justifying the symptoms presented， such as migraine and neuropsychiatric alterations.\n\n【20】The managementofMELAS syndromeinvolves a multidisciplinary approach， with lifestyle modification by means of diet and physical exercises， in addition to symptomatic treatment and treatment of complications. There is no drug therapy approved by the Food and Drug Administration or therapeutic protocol established to date for the treatment of MELAS 通用删除6(英):<u>[16-18]</u>. Affected individuals need to be evaluated globally， with assessment of the organs most affected by the disease and should be followed up at regular intervals to monitor progression， with screening for possible complications 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>. One of the most important behavioral measures is smoking cessation since it can worsen mitochondrial dysfunction 通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u>. Among the treatments， supplements， such as antioxidants and cofactors， are being used in MELAS syndrome based on limited clinical trials， for example， L-arginine and citrulline， which aim to increase the availability of nitric oxide， leading to an improvement in vasodilation and， consequently， blood flow 通用删除6(英):<u>[20，21]</u>. More studies are still needed to effectively establish a drug therapy that can interfere with the prognosis and improve the quality of life of patients with MELAS， especially those with a later diagnosis.\n\n【21】The case reported here demonstrates the importance of screening and initial evaluation of older patients with delirium or acute encephalopathy， reinforcing the concept of the need to perform a detailed review of the clinical history of these patients， including family history. It is emphasized the importance of expanding the range of differential diagnoses when the most prevalent and common删除1换行etiologies are discarded or when the evolution of the case presents clinical manifestations that do not confirm the context of delirium. The present report also emphasizes that MELAS disease， although rare， may be diagnosed in older patients and it is possible that the incidence is underestimated due to underdiagnosis.\n\n【22】Conclusion\n\n【23】Acute neurological conditions are highly prevalent in patients over 65 years of age in the emergency department； therefore， detecting their etiology might be challenging. In cases that present with unusual clinical manifestations and atypical evolution， less prevalent diagnostic hypotheses should be considered. Mitochondrial pathologies， although more common in young people， can mimic an acute neurological condition in older adults. Although there is an unfavorable and progressive evolution， without therapeutic possibility， the diagnosis of MELAS is fundamental for the planning of patient comfort care and support in the face ofunfavorable evolution. The diagnosis also allows genetic counseling of family members and its better recognition and investigation in future studies，contributing to the understanding of the causative mechanisms of this disease and therapeutic possibilities.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

Spermatic cord liposarcoma is a rare tumor， and only some 200 cases have been reported in the literature. About 20% of liposarcomas are retroperitoneal， involving only 0.1% of the inguinal mass， typically confused with inguinal hernia. We treated the patient with organ sparing surgery， preserving the testicle， without chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Follow-up for six months showed good response， without recurrence or metastasis.\n\n【2】Keywords： Liposarcoma； Inguinal mass； Spermatic cord\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Tumors of the spermatic cord are rare and generally hard to diagnose. Most are benign， and when malignant they are almost always sarcomas. Here we report a case of giant spermatic cord liposarcoma in an 80 year old patient， presenting scrotal mass initially diagnosed as an inguinal hernia.\n\n【5】Spermatic cord liposarcoma is a rare cause of inguinal mass. These tumors can closely mimic inguinoscrotalhernia upon physical examination. However， these tumors require a different surgical approach and treatment plan. Liposarcomas are tumors that occur mainly in retroperitoneum： Only3% to 7% are found in the paratesticular region. The spermatic cord is the main place of origin in these cases. This malignant disease can result in loss of fertility， in addition to life threatening sequelae.\n\n【6】Case Presentation\n\n【7】A.S.D.F， 80 years old， presented weight loss (10 kg in 6 months) associated with normocytic and normochromic anemia and a giant inguinoscrotal mass on the left with a 5 year evolution. Computed tomography of abdomen and pelvis indicated the presence of a massive left inguinal hernia with fatty contents .\n\n【8】The patient was referredto amedicalclinic wherehe was evaluatedby proctology and submitted to general surgery due to the suspicion of consumptive intestinal focus syndrome， and inguinal hernia， respectively. Finaly， he was evaluated by urology， in which the surgical procedure was indicated， due to suspicion of inguinal cord liposarcoma. Total inguinal mass resection with preservation of the testis and free margins was performed . He evolved well in the postoperative period and was discharged after five days for outpatient follow-up. The histopathological report evidenced the presence of well differentiated liposarcoma . The patient was referred to clinical oncology and opted not to undergo radiotherapy or chemotherapy， even in the case of lesions greater than five centimeters， but grade I， with favorable pathology， due to his advanced age. The risks of complications would outweigh the benefits. He remains in good general condition， so far without recurrence， six months after the surgery.\n\n【9】Discussion\n\nSarcoma of the spermatic cord was first reported by Lesauvage in 1845 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Based on case reports since then， it appears that most patients with spermatic cord liposarcomas develop the condition in the fifth or sixth decade of life， with an uneven， painless， irregularly growing inguinal or inguinoscrotal mass that is distinct from the testis 通用删除6(英):<u>[2-4]</u>. Diagnosis of spermatic cord liposarcomas in the preoperative period may be challenging， since this clinical presentation can indicate several more common conditions， such as inguinal hernia， lipoma， hydrocele， epididymal cyst， funicular|删除段之间换行|On ultrasound examination， a liposarcoma of the spermatic cord usually presents heterogeneous echogenicity. However， these ultrasonographic findings have no specificity. Computed tomography is suggestive of diagnosis in approximately half of the cases and helps to determine the involvement of the anterior abdominal wall and/or retroperitoneum 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，5，9，10]</u>. They can be classified into four groups：well differentiated， myxoid， round cell or pleomorphic type. The first two are the most cited in the literature and have better prognosis. Some authors advocate the theory that a liposarcoma may arise due to degeneration of a previous lipoma， but other reports say the opposite通用删除6(英):<u>[11</u>J.\n\n【11】The size of the tumors can range from 3 cm to 30 cm in diameter and they tend to be gray white or yellow. Most of them are lobulated or nodular and in some cases a certain degree of necrosis may be present.\n\n【12】Current standard treatment strategies for these tumors include radical orchiectomy with extensive local excision of surrounding structures and with high ligation of the spermatic cord. Even in well-differentiated liposarcomas， local recurrence is high. In this case， a broad excision of the inguinal canal， with or without orchiectomy， should be performed if not previously done. Adjuvant radiation or chemotherapy is not well established， although there is some evidence supporting high grade chemotherapy， especially for PPC rhabdomyosarcomas 通用删除6(英):<u>[12，13]</u>.\n\n【13】Some studies report a 5 year overall survival rate of 75% for well differentiated tumors. Some risk factors for recurrence have been defined and include tumor grade， size， depth of invasion， and most importantly， surgical margin status 通用删除6(英):<u>[14，15]</u>.\n\n【14】Although this is an uncommon condition， so few cases have been reported in the literature， the current trend is focused on organ sparing surgery， involving fewer multi layers， especially in well differentiated liposarcomas or in patients with advanced age， and comorbidities， since even with high local recurrence， these are late. Some authors have already reported that complete excision of the tumor， if possible， can be performed with the intention of preserving the testis， as in the case presented here 通用删除6(英):<u>[16，17]</u>. Radical surgery remains the gold standard and rigorous follow-up should be maintained over the long term. Every effort should be made to report new cases with organ-sparing surgeries，to enable improving patient outcomes in the future.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

More than 70% of cases of Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) worldwide are caused by Sickle Cell Anemia(SCA) 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. Sickle-cell disease is a major global public health issue and the most common life-threatening genetic disorder worldwide. However， despite being the most prevalent genetic disease in Africa， the serious health and sociodemographic consequences are largely ignored 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>.\n\n【2】It has been estimated that approximately 90% of the world's SCD population lives in these three countries： Nigeria， India， and the Democratic Republic of Congo 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>， where the disease affects 2% of the population and carriers (sickle cell trait) account for 10% to 30% of all cases 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. In Nigeria alone， there are estimated to be 150，000 babies born with SCD every year， which is 20 per 1000 births 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>.\n\n【3】In SCD， the oxygen-carrying protein hemoglobin is abnormally altered in red blood cells， resulting in an autosomal recessive genetic blood disorder. Those with HbS develop deformed red blood cells (erythrocytes)， which become hard and sticky under stress and resemble a C-shaped farm tool called a 'sickle. Due to the short lifespan of sickle cells， anemia is often caused by the constant shortage of red blood cells 通用删除6(英):<u>[5，6]</u>.\n\n【4】In order to establish a clinical classification based on severity， it is necessary to search for factors responsible for the clinical variability of SCD. By using this classification， management can be optimized and follow-up matched to each patient's actual risk 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. As a result， understanding the genetics underlying the heritable sub-phenotypes of SCD， specifically for each population， would be useful for prognosis and could help to tailor therapeutic interventions. Numerous studies have been devoted to genetic modulating factors of SCD 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>. Fetal Hemoglobin (HbF) concentration is one of the major modifiers of the Sickle Cell Disease which directly affects the sickle erythrocyte and is a major modulator of the phenotype of the disease 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>. Fetal Hemoglobin (HbF) concentration is the most powerful modifier of the clinical and hematological features of the Sickle Cell Disease (SCD)通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>. Understanding the genetics underlying the heritable sub phenotypes of sickle cell anemia would be prognostically useful. This could inform personalized therapeutics， and might help the discovery of new “drug gable\" pathophysiologic targets 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>.\n\n【5】Five typical haplotypes have been described across the B-globin gene cluster based upon the pattern of specific restriction fragment-length polymorphisms across the region 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>. Four haplotypes are associated with HbS in Africa (Benin， Bantu/Central African Republic， Senegal and Cameroon) and the fifth is thought to have arisen in India and/or the Arabian Peninsula (Arab/Hindu) 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>. It has been suggested that these haplotypes also have an effect on the severity of the disease through their genetically determined effect on HbF level 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>. Verylow HbF and hematocrit are associated with SCD individuals carrying Bantu (Central African Republic) haplotype and they mostly present with severe clinical complications 通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u>. Meanwhile， clinical presentations of individuals with Senegal or Arab-India haplotype are usually mild due to high levels of HbF and hematocrit. Clinical course of persons with Benin haplotype is in between the Bantu and Arab/India haplotypes. Benin haplotype， associated with low HbF level， is the predominant haplotype in Nigeria with a frequency of 93.2% to 97% 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>. The mean HbF among Nigerian SCD patients is about 6% 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>.\n\n【6】Genetic association at the three principalloci have been identified， SNPs in major loci that are associated with different HbF levels in patients with SCD and in healthy adults. The BCL11A gene is located on chromosome 2 (2p16) and the HBS1L-MYB intergenic region on chromosome 6(6q23)通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>.\n\n【7】The HBS1L-MYB Intergenic Polymorphisms (HMIP) are present in three Linkage Disequilibrium (LD) blocks with most of the effect on HbF levels and numbers of F cells contributed by the second block通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>. Among the causes of unusually high HbF levels are deletions or single base substitutions in the HBB gene cluster and Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) in the genes.HBS1L-MYB： known main HbF sub-loci in this region， HMIP-2A (tagged by rs66650371). The SNP rs66650371， the functional 3-bp deletion in the MYB enhancer， is one of the most significant SNPs in the HMIP region 通用删除6(英):<u>[17，18]</u>.\n\n【8】Methodology\n\n【9】This was a cross-sectional hospital-based study to investigate the fetal hemoglobin variant HBSIL-MYB in individuals with sickle cell anemia and their phenotypic presentations with a view of providing explanations on strategy for reducing the burden of the disease in Nigeria. All suspected homozygous sickle cell patients attending Sickle cell clinics of Adeoyo Hospital and University College Hospital from age thirteen above in the period of the study was enrolled， 260blood samples of Sickle cell Patients were collected for this study.\n\n【10】Hematological and Hemoglobin analyses\n\n【11】A total of 7 ml blood sample was collected from each participant and dispensed into Ethylene Diamine Tetra Acetic acid (EDTA)， for laboratory analysis. The Packed Cell Volume (PCV) was measured to determine the proportion of the volume occupied by the Red Blood Cellsto the volume ofthe whole blood. The PCV was determinedusing the hematocrit reading device 通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u>. Fetal Hemoglobin Concentration(HbF)， was determined using Betke method 通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u>. The quantity of hemoglobin is measured to the proportion of alkali-resistant (fetal) hemoglobin is then calculated as a percentage of the fetal hemoglobin present.\n\n【12】Molecular analysis\n\n【13】DNA extraction was done from archived buffy coat by using Da An Gene Kit， following the manufacturers protocol. ARMS-PCR reaction was carried out in 25 uL total volume to amplify the DNA segment 通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u>. ARMS is based on the use of sequence-specific PCR primers that allow amplification of test DNA only when the target allele is contained within the sample. The Amplification-Refractory Mutation System (ARMS) is a simple method for detecting any删除1换行mutation involving single base change or small deletions.\n\n【14】Statistical analysis\n\n【15】Data obtained was statistically analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) software version 24.0. Chi-square was used to determine the association between HbF and the genetic variants.P values ≤ 0.05 at 95% confidence interval was considered significant. Descriptive analysis was used to present the frequencies of outcomes. Genetic association analysis was performed by multiple regression， with age and sex as covariates (SPSS v.20).\n\n【16】Results\n\n【17】The genetic variant rs66650371 (HBS1L-MYB) was genotyped from 260 SCA patients， and its effect on HbF levels， phenotypic variables and PCV were investigated. The mean age is 23.0±0.6 (SE).\n\n【18】Table 1 shows the prevalence of Vaso-occlusive crises among SCD patients across one year. Higher HbFlevels have been associated to benefit some complications of the disease than others， examples of some of its benefit include， reduced rate of acute painful episodes， fewer leg ulcers， less frequent acute chest syndromes and reduced disease severity 通用删除6(英):<u>[221</u>. These Vaso-occlusive variables were the bench mark used to determine how severe and how frequent participants experience crises in this study. About 59.2% of the population experiences chest symptoms at least once in a year while only 15.2%experiences leg ulcers. The high frequency of sickle crises amongst the participants is similar to what has been reported in a previous study in Nigeria， which revealed that there is an overall increase in the frequency of Vaso-occlusive crises among SCD patients 通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u>. This situation is consistent with the trend in some countries such as Britain and Saudi Arabia 通用删除6(英):<u>[24，25]</u>.\n\n【19】Table 2 shows the relationship between Vaso-occlusive variables， HbF and PCV values among SCD patients. The HbF Concentration ranged from 1.8% to 12%， the mean HbFlevel of patients in this study was 4.9 ± 2.4 percent， which is lower than what has been reported in a study in Ife， Nigeria 通用删除6(英):<u>[26]</u>. The mean HbF was 9.9 ±6.0 percent. This difference may be as a result of the different methods used in the estimation of fetal hemoglobin levels in both studies， or the mean age of the populations， for instance， report from Ife showed the age range recruited for their study was 1 to 15 years， at this stage， fetal hemoglobin levels are not yet stable， this might account for the discrepancy in the mean fetal hemoglobin levels of both studies. The mean Hbf of this study is close to a study that evaluated the fetal hemoglobin concentration levels of individuals in Ibadan (5.16±4.04) 通用删除6(英):<u>[27]</u>. There was no statistical difference in the mean HbF\n\n【20】Table 1： Prevalence of Vaso-occlusive crises in SCD patients.\n\n| Number of Crises in a year， N=260  |  | Chest painN=260  | Leg Ulcer N=260  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Once= 130 (50%)  |  | Yes=154 (59.2%)  | Yes=41 (15.8%)  |  |\n| Twice =26(10%)  |  | No= 106 (40.7%)  | No=219 (84.2%)  |  |\n| Quarterly= 104 (40%)  |  |  |  |  |\n\n【22】Table 2： Relationship between Vaso-occlusive Variables， HbF and PCV.\n\n| Vaso-occlusive Variables  | Low HbF  | High HbF  | Low PCV  | High PCV  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Leg Ulcer， Yes  | 68.30%  | 31.7%  | 71.5%  | 28.5%  |\n| No  | 53.00%  | 47.0%  | 55.5%  | 44.5%  |\n| Chest Pain， Yes  | 71.40%  | 28.5%  | 74.5%  | 25.5%  |\n| No  | 41.1  | 58.8%  | 30%  | 70%  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n\n【24】PCV count is also significantly increased in patients with high HbF levels than in patients with low HbFlevels which is also in line to a study done in Tanzania 通用删除6(英):<u>[28]</u>， how the beneficial effects of elevated HbF seen in their studyreduced anemia，leukocytosis and thrombosis. Increased PCV counts reduces anemia， which is common to SCD patients. Also， the average mean of males PCV was higher compared to that of females.\n\n【25】Conclusion\n\n【26】The present study demonstrated the presence and beneficial effect of fetal hemoglobin， and HBSIL-MYB gene with SCD patients. The number of Vaso-occlusive crises， such as acute chest pain，leg ulcer is significantly indirectly proportional to elevated HbF levels. Patients with reduced HbF levels， have repetitive number of Vaso-occlusive crises in a year. The 3bp deletion of rs66650371 has been associated with elevated levels of HbF and mild Vaso-occlusive crises among SCD patients in Ibadan， Nigeria.\n\n【27】Facilities for early and regular quantification of fetal hemoglobin should be made available in Sickle cell Clinics and Hospitals in Nigeria.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

In current study， the hepatoprotective aptitude of T. cordata was evaluated against Aceclofenac (ACF) instigated oxidative stress in rats. Leaves of T. cordata were extracted in methanol and various fractions were prepared by polarity-based method. Qualitative and quantitative spectrophotometric analysis along with HPLC-DAD analysis was performed on samples. Antioxidant potential of extracts was identified by DPPH method while BSA method was used to assess the anti-inflammatory activity. Rats were divided into various groups and oxidative stress was induced by ACF in liver of rats. T. cordata Methanol extract (TCM) was used to mitigate the oxidative stress. Serum analysis for liver enzymes and tissue analysis for enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants was performed. Qualitative and quantitative spectrophotometric analysis of various extracts depicted the presence of phenolics， flavonoids， andtannins. In vitro antioxidant and anti-inflammatory studies further elaborated the protective potential of plant extracts. Furthermore， treatment of rats with ACF showed decline (p<0.05) in the level of liver antioxidant enzymes， in contrast，elevation was found in the concentration ofhydrogen peroxide and nitrite in hepatic tissues. Increased serum markers of the liver were revealed after ACF treatment. Hepatocyte inflammation and injuries were prominent in histopathological studies of the liver in ACF-treated rats. However， the administration of TCM to ACF-intoxicated rats reduced liver injuries and restored the levels of antioxidant enzymes and free radical towards normal rats. T. cordata possess strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory potential due to presence of polyphenols and can help in development of drug against liver injuries with strong antioxidant potential.\n\n【2】Keywords： Telosma cordata； Antioxidants； Anti-inflammatory； Oxidative stress； Aceclofenac\n\n【3】Abbreviations\n\n【4】通用间距删除-1:<u>OPEN ACCESS</u>\n\n【5】删除7:<u>通用间距删除-1:<u>Correspondence：Mehreen Fatima， Department of Biochemistry， Quaid-j-Azam University， Islamabad， Pakistan， E-mail： mfatima@bs.qau.edu.pk Received Date： 30 May 2023</u></u>\n\n【6】TCM： Telosma cordata Methanol extract； ER： Endoplasmic Reticulum； TPC： Total Phenolic Content； TFC： Total Flavonoid Content； TTC： Total Tannin Content； HPLC： High Performance Liquid Chromatography； DPPH： 2，2-Diphenylpicrylhydrazyl； BSA： Bovine Serum albumin； ACF：Aceclofenac； TLC： Total Leukocyte Count； MCH： Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin； PTC： Platelets Count； MCV： Mean Corpuscular Volume； ALT： Alanine Transferase；AST： Aspartate Transaminase； ALP： Alkaline Phosphate； SOD： Superoxide Dismutase； POD： peroxidase； CAT： Catalase\n\n【7】删除7:<u>Accepted Date： 12 Jun 2023</u>\n\n【8】Introduction\n\n【9】删除7:<u>Published Date： 17 Jun 2023 Citation：Fatima M， Rashid Khan M.

ROS have the ability to initiate lipid peroxidation， known as a chain reaction， and cause oxidation of other cellular components， such as DNA and proteins. The main cause of liver ailment is lipid peroxidation which arises due to prolonged exposure to hepatotoxins. These free radicals enhance the production of Thiobarbituric Reactive Substances (TBARS)，when they interact with the polyunsaturated fatty acids，henceleading to necrosis. Therefore， Oxidative stress causes several ailments i.e.， cancer， atherosclerosis， nervous disorder， diabetes， idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis， asthma， and liver fibrosis.

Vitamins also known as antioxidants， such as vitamin C， are also important in regulating metabolic signaling pathways that lead to the organs'perfect activities. Synthetic medicines for treating liver injuries can be less efficient and have disastrous effects. Different natural plants and microbes are used as the main component in the manufacturing process of medicinal products. Plants naturally contain different nutrients and antioxidants that integrate into their defense system to protect the plant itself and other organisms from damage induced by reactive substances.

In contrast， silymarin treatment showed ameliorating effects against ACF-induced toxicity as body and organ weights of this group were similar to normal rats. Co-administration ofTCM (150 mg/kg bw and 300 mg/kg bw) with ACF suppressed the toxic effects of ACF and showed an increase in body weight whereas restoration of absolute and relative liver weight was also observed.

Though， albumin showed a significant decrease in its level. Increased levels of various serum enzymes are associated with hepatic damage with loss of integrity of cells. By contrast， co-administration of ACF with silymarin significantly (p<0.05) restored the level of these serum enzymes towards the control rats. Likewise， simultaneous treatment of Aceclofenac and TCM doses (150 mg/kg bw and 300 mg/kg bw) showed a remarkable effect (p<0.05) in repressing the levels of serum markers， yet an increase in albumin level was also notable.\n\n【91】T. cordata restored antioxidant enzymes in liver\n\n【92】CAT： Catalase； SOD： Superoxide Dismutase： POD： Peroxidase： GSH：Reduced Glutathione\n\n【93】T. cordata reduced toxicity in liver tissues\n\n【94】Table 7 summarizes the hepatoprotective ability of TCM on levels of H，O。 nitrite， TBARS， and total protein. Total protein was decreased， while a significant (p<0.05) increase in H，O。 nitrite， and TBARS was noticed in ACF-treated rats compared to normal rats. TCM administration with ACF markedly (p<0.05) reduced the concentration of biochemical markers while an elevation was observed in protein level. Rats treated with TCM alone did not affect the levels of biochemical markers. By reducing the hepatotoxicity caused by ACF， silymarin administration showed a significant(p<0.05) restoration of nitrites， TBARS， H，O， and total protein toward the normallevel.\n\n【95】Protective role of T. cordata on histology of liver\n\n【96】Liver of normal rats showed a normal architecture with intact hepatocytes， central vein and equally distributed cytoplasm. Liver of ACF treated rats showed severe injuries such as sinusoidal obstructions， necrosis， fibrosis， and hepatocellular degeneration as alterations were prominent in morphology of tissue. Administration of high dose of TCM with ACF showed improvement in morphological structure of liver by reducing the liver damages and injuries hence showing protection against liver toxicity while rats administered with low dose of plant TCM along with ACF showed necrosis and some injuries. Liver of rats from TCM alone treated groups had shown normal morphological features of liver . Silymarin (200 mg/kg bw)， a standard drug， was given to restore structural abnormalities and cellular anomalies as shown in Figure 3 and 5C.\n\n【97】Discussion\n\n【98】Toxic chemical substances cause liver injuries in body which induces oxidative stress and inflammation. Natural antioxidants and food additives help to reduce induced stress and toxic effects of xenobiotics by scavenging free radicals. Humans have been using plants as a source of conventional medicines for hundreds of vears. Many herbal extracts， prepared from plants， have been examined for their antioxidant， anti-inflammatory， andhepatoprotective properties against liver injuries in various experimental animal models 通用删除6(英):<u>[34]</u>. In the present study， a phytochemical qualitative study confirmed the presence of alkaloids， flavonoids， tannins， coumarins， phenols， and saponins in T. cordata fractions.\n\n【99】The production of ROS is correlated with a number of severe删除1换行and persistent body disorders which embraces liver， pulmonary， neurodegenerative， and digestive infections. Diet is a rich source of antioxidants and can help the body to regulate the deficiency of antioxidants endogenously and thus restore all the damage caused because of oxidative stress.\n\n【100】Phenolics and flavonoids such as rutin， quercetin， gallic acid， catechin and caffeic acid were found in the HPLC analysis of TCM. Rutin is a well-known standard antioxidantandprotective compound against toxicity and getting recognition due to its medicinalproperties通用删除6(英):<u>[35]</u>. On the other hand， catechin shows strong activity against free radicals thus having antioxidant activities 通用删除6(英):<u>[36]</u>. Thus， the presence of these compounds in TCM extract could be the reason for scavenging free radicals when evaluated against DPPH and showing antioxidant activity. The presence of antioxidants in TCM is also linked with the inhibition of denaturation of bovine serum albumin and showing anti-inflammatory potential. Our findings are similar to the studies of Naz et al. which claimed that phytochemicals of Pilea umbrosa have antioxidant properties 通用删除6(英):<u>[34]</u>.\n\n【101】ACF has been identifieddascommonly associated with hepatotoxicity and oxidative stress and it is also assumed as the major cause of cellular disorder by damaging the antioxidant enzymatic system， acute hepatitis， and increasing peroxidation of lipids. Hepatotoxicity from NSAIDs can be found at any time after initiation of treatment， but like most severe drug reactions， it occurs after 6 to12 weeks after administration. In the liver， ACF causes activate lipid peroxidation， necrotic and apoptotic cell death， and deterioration of membranal structure leading to the secretion of enzymatic components in blood. According to previous research， a significant increase in levels of biochemical markers i.e.，ALP， ALT，and AST can be seen after oral induction ofanimal models with Aceclofenac 通用删除6(英):<u>[5，37]</u>. Toaccess the protective potential ofour plant， an Aceclofenac exposed system is created in rats. Our research has clearly demonstrated that treating the animal models with Aceclofenac at higher dose for about eight weeks on alternate days resulted in the induction of hepatic damage and oxidative stress， while T. cordata showed promising protective results against stress and organ damage. Our results are in line with a previous study 通用删除6(英):<u>[37]</u>.\n\n【102】This study has also found that TCM did not cause injurious alterations in hematological markers， including the count of HB， MCV， WBC， HCT，RBC，and platelets in rats， even at a high dose of3000 mg/kg. TCM is found to be non-toxic， as any signs of discomfort or pain was not obvious in TCM-treated rats. Similar results for the methanolic extract of the plant are declared by previous findings 通用删除6(英):<u>[34]</u>.\n\n【103】Body weight is an important factor in the conflicting effects of hepatotoxins and is replicated as an element that limits toxicity studies. In the current study， the percent increase in body weight of rats was reduced， whereas absolute and relative liver weight was enhanced with ACF administration. Basically， NSAIDs induce oxidative stress by producing free radicals in the body that cause an increase in the organ weight by affecting the metabolic process of different organs. Same results are represented by previous research Bort et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[38]</u>.\n\n【104】Naturally， our body has a specific antioxidant defense mechanism that includes endogenous enzymatic antioxidants such as CAT， SOD， POD， and glutathione. These enzymes along with exogenous antioxidants protect the organ and body from damage caused by oxidative stress by capturing ROS. Catalase has ability to neutralize hydrogen peroxide H.O， via a catalytic transformation or through删除1换行peroxidation metabolism 通用删除6(英):<u>[39]</u> while superoxide dismutase is a metallic enzyme that helps in the conversion of superoxide radicals to H，O， and O， by dismutase reaction to reduce the toxicity 通用删除6(英):<u>[40]</u>. Glutathione peroxidase causes the neutralization of peroxides and thus providing protection against toxicity of ROS. Abnormal necrosis in liver is stimulated by decreased levels of GSH 通用删除6(英):<u>[41]</u>. All these antioxidant enzymes and GSH level in cells were reduced markedly in ACF treated group， which have caused injury in liver cells through deposition of ROS. Administration of TCM along with ACF has significantly restored antioxidant enzyme concentration near to normal range. TCM contains many bioactive components which are efficient in balancing the levels of antioxidants as well as in combating different infectious diseases. Increasedlipid peroxidation is associated with higher levels of TBARS that result in tissue destruction and failure of antioxidant defense mechanisms 通用删除6(英):<u>[5，35]</u>. ACF-intoxicated rats treated with TCM (300 mg/kg) reduced the lipid peroxide levels compared with rats treated with ACF only.\n\n【105】An extreme notch of disruptions in hepatic cells consisting of cellular hypertrophy， intrusion of inflammatory cells， intrusion of the central lobule，and sinusoidal obstruction was observed in rats treated with ACF dose through histological examination of tissues.Low/high doses of TCM with ACF dose reduced these losses in the bodytissues. No morphological changes were observed in the liver anatomy of groups treated with TCM doses alone. Similar results have been declared by Gupta and Pandey， who claimed that Terminalia bellirica fruit extract has a protective aptitude against Aceclofenac endured hepatic damage 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. Many biocomponents and polyphenols are present in TCM extract， which have potential antioxidant properties and thus help the plant to prevent tissue damage by reducing peroxidation of lipids in body organs， including the liver.\n\n【106】Conclusion\n\n【107】The current study illustrated the potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory propensity of T. cordata extract. The presence of flavonoids and polyphenols are claimed for the possible antioxidant， anti-inflammatory and hepatoprotective mechanism of T. cordata. Our data also revealed protective effect of TCM by regulating the levels of enzymatic markers， anti-inflammatory mediators and serum markers against the intoxicated effects of ACF. Moreover， TCM reduces the injuries of liver architecture， hence restoring the hepatic morphology.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

A variety of new laparoscopic and endoscopic techniques exist to aid in the weight loss process， with some of the newest advances in intra gastric balloons. In this case report， we aim to answer the question of whether the Air-filled Gastric Balloon System can act as a bridge to definitive bariatric surgery， as an off-label use， in patients with a BMI greater than 65 kg/m.\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】The prevalence of obesity is increasing worldwide， and The Center of Disease Control (CDC) data indicates that 39.8% of adults and 18.5% of youth in the United States are obese 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Obesity is associated with several comorbidities， including heart disease，stroke， diabetes， and various types of cancer. Additionally， obesity and related co morbid conditions impart an increasing economic burden on health care systems. For example， in 2008， it was estimated that the United States spent$142 billion USD on obesity-related medical costs 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>.\n\n【4】Although lifestyle modifications are first-line treatments for obesity， these approaches are generally ineffective due to several factors， particularly lack of patient compliance. Thus， various surgical interventions have emerged over the last five decades to facilitate obesity management. Since the first jejunoileal bypass was performed in 1954 by Dr. Kremen， bariatric surgical procedures have continued to evolve 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. With relatively recent advancements in endoscopic and laparoscopic techniques， there are now several procedures with varying degrees of complexity used for obesity management. An emerging treatment option for obesity is the intra gastric balloon.\n\n【5】Intra gastric balloons are currently used as an adjunctive therapy for weight loss in obese individuals. The principle mechanism of action of these balloons is to target the mechanoreceptors of the gastric wall. Once delivered into the stomach， they occupy the gastric cavity， induce an early sensation of satiety， and thereby reduce caloric intake.\n\n【6】Currently there are two types of intra gastric balloons： fluid-filled and air-filled. The Obalon Balloon System was approved for use in 2016 and is the first FDA approved swallow able balloon system designed for weight loss. Currently， the Obalon Balloon System is indicated for temporary use to facilitate weight loss in adults with a BMI of 30 kg/m’ to 40 kg/m’ who have failed to lose weight through diet and exercise. The system is intended to be used as an adjunct to a moderate intensity diet and behavior modification program.\n\n【7】The Obalon Balloon System comes in a set of three balloons that the patient swallows. Occasionally， endoscopy is used to assist in intra gastric placement of the baloon. All balloons must be removed 6 months after the first balloon is placed 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. Of the air-filled intra gastric balloon options， the Obalon Balloon System has been shown to be the most likely to achieve weight loss通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. Aside from a rare potential association between fluid-filled intra gastric balloons and acute pancreatitis 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>， the side effect profile of the Obalon Balloon System is relatively benign. The most common adverse effects reported are nausea and emesis 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. Small bowel obstruction has also been reported from a migrating Obalon balloon， which was managed endoscopically 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>. Additionally， there is one reported case in Korea of gastric perforation in a patient with noncompliance of PPI therapy after intra gastric balloon insertion， however， it should be noted that the Obalon Balloon System was not used in this case 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>.\n\n【8】Here， we report the first use of air-filled gastric balloon system (Obalon) as a successful adjunctive modality for bariatric surgery in a patient with morbid obesity in extremely high BMI(>65 kg/m²). To our knowledge， there has not been any other documented off-label use of an intra删除1换行gastric balloon system.\n\n【9】Case Presentation\n\n【10】A 52-year-old male with a history of arthritis， hypertension， hypothyroidism and morbid obesity presented in July 2018， for evaluation for bariatric surgery. His weight was 243 kg (BMI 70.7kg/m)andprevious attempts toloseweight with nutritional modification were unsuccessful. In addition，due to a history of arthritis，the patient was bed-bound and unable to carry out activities of daily living. Immobility and morbid obesity resulted in the development of an acute lower extremity deep vein thrombosis and shortness of breath， likely due to a pulmonary embolism， which was never confirmed because of the weight limit of the CT scanner. Due to his high BMI， and associated co morbid conditions， the patient was considered to be an extremely high risk bariatric surgical candidate. The decision was made， after comprehensive discussion with the patient， to utilize the Air-filled Gastric Balloon System to attempt weight loss and optimize the patient for bariatric surgery. He underwent insertion of a total of three intra gastric balloons from July to September 2018. He presented to Flushing Hospital Medical Center on February 5h， 2019for removal of the balloons.\n\n【11】Our patient lost a total of 73 kg and weighed 170 kg (BMI 49.5kg/m’) at the time of the intra gastric balloon removal. He is currently scheduled to undergo sleeve gastrectomy sometime in the next 3 to4 months.\n\n【12】Risk Profile\n\n【13】Based on the ACS NSQIP Surgical Risk Calculator 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>， we calculated that with our patient's initial weight (243 kg， BMI 70.7kg/m) and severe co morbid conditions， his risk of serious postoperative complications would have been 5.5%， which is double that of the average population at 2.4%. His calculated overall postoperative complication risk would have been 6.9%， compared to 3% in the average risk patient. By lowering his weight， his calculated risk of serious postoperative complication would decrease to 2.7% (which is similar to those at average risk at 2.4%).\n\n【14】Discussion\n\n【15】Intra gastric balloons have emerged as a safe and practical adjunct for weight loss in obese individuals. Among the air-filled balloon options， the Obalon Balloon System has been demonstrated to be most likely to result in weight loss 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. Moreover， while the other methods involve at least an endoscopic suite for placement， the Obalon Balloon System is available in pill form and can be administered in an ambulatory setting. Since there is no requirement for anesthesia，the risk of complications is lower.\n\n【16】The safety profile of the Obalon Balloon System is based off of a double blinded，randomized controlled， clinical trialthatincluded 387patients with a BMI between 30 kg/m and 40 kg/m. These patients were randomized to receive either the Obalon Balloon System or a sham device and were assessed for weight loss and safety outcomes after an initial 24-week period 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>. Since this study， the Food and Drug Administration has approved the Obalon Balloon System for a targeted patient BMI between 30 kg/m’ to 40kg/m.\n\n【17】An important consideration in applying the Obalon Balloon\n\n【18】System is the cost. The Obalon Balloon System is not currently covered by insurance， thereby imparting a patient-provided cost of $6，000 to $8，500 USD. Thus， there is a potential socioeconomic burden that may affect endpoints in the future.\n\n【19】Our patient chose to undergo a pioneeringprocedure for a patient of his BMI. Had this not been offered， alternative options to this off-label use include intensive inpatient dietary modification and exercise programs， or direct to surgery. For patients with a BMI greater than65 k/m²， these alternate options， if failed， pose a greater risk and cost.\n\n【20】Prospective studies should be conducted to investigate the feasibility ofusing intra gastric balloons as a bridge to bariatric surgery in extremely obese individuals，that otherwise have a prohibitive risk tor surgical intervention.\n\n【21】Conclusion\n\n【22】Effective and safe weight loss in patients with morbid obesity is essential. In our patient， the air-filled gastric balloon system(specifically Obalon) offered a minimally invasive and compelling method in achieving adequate weight loss prior to bariatric surgery. We demonstrated the successful off-label use of the air-filled gastric balloon system as an adjunctive therapy to facilitate weight loss and serve as a bridge to bariatric surgery in a patient with an initial BMI greater than 65 kg/m.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

The mean age of onset is approximately 30 years， with fewer than 15% of cases in the age group above40 years. The diagnosis ofTakayasu’s arteritis can be challenging without a proper clinical suspicion and acumen. We report a case of Takayasu's arteritis diagnosed in a 63-year-old lady who presented with heart failure despite an obvious blood pressure discrepancy in her previous seven pregnancies.\n\n【2】Keywords： Takayasu's arteritis； Blood pressure discrepancy； Computed tomography aortogram\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Takayasu's arteritis is a large vessel vasculitis， involving the aorta and its major branches. It affects mainly the young females， with higher prevalence among Asian populations. Non-specific presentations and lack of specific laboratory markers make the diagnosis of Takayasu's arteritis challenging. The presence of characteristic features such as absent or diminished pulse and blood pressure discrepancy in the absence of proper clinical suspicion might result in missed diagnosis of Takayasu's arteritis. Early diagnosis and treatment are important to prevent any serious complications of the disease.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 63-year-old lady presented with chest pain and heart failure symptoms of orthopnea and reduced effort tolerance. The chest pain is heavy in nature， central and non-radiating. She has a background history of bronchial asthma diagnosed 40 years ago， in good control with turbuhaler symbicort. She has a history of admission to a district hospital 6 months ago with similar chest pain， treated as unstable angina with 3 days of subcutaneous fondaparinux and discharged home with aspirin and clopidogrel. She was referred to a tertiary centre for further management of ischemic heart disease， however， still awaiting an appointment date.\n\n【7】Upon presentation， she was hypotensive with a blood pressure of 85/50 mmHg and a heart rate of 103 beats per min. Her Glasgow Coma Scale was full and orientated and does not appear to be in respiratory distress with an oxygen saturation of 97% under room air. Her physical examination revealed a displaced heart apex beat to 64h intercostal space at left anterior axillary line with the presence of pansystolic murmur over the apex and early diastolic murmur over the left sternal edge. There were fine crackles heard at the lower thoracic region bilaterally with no pedal edema. Otherwise， her jugular venous pressure was not raised with good peripheral perfusion and other systemic examinations were unremarkable.\n\n【8】Her chest radiograph demonstrated a congested lungs field with bilateral blunted costophrenic angle and cardiomegaly . Her electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm with left bundle branch block and a bedside echocardiogram revealed a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction of 40% with severely dilated left atrium and ventricle and the presence of severe mitral and aortic regurgitation. Otherwise， her serum creatinine kinase and troponin I levels were not raised at 41U/L and 16.8 pg/mL respectively. Other baseline blood investigations including full blood count， renal profile， liver function test， and coagulation profile were normal.\n\nShe was admitted for cardiogenic shock secondary to acute coronary syndrome.

Measurement of blood pressure on different limbs showed a significant discrepancy between upper and lower limbs with 91/57 mmHg over right arm， 90/50 mmHg over left arm， 179/69 mmHg over right leg， and 185/62 mmHg over left leg.\n\n【14】A computed tomography aortogram was done and revealed an ectatic ascending aorta and right brachiocephalic trunk with multiple\n\n【15】Discussion\n\n【16】Takayasu's arteritis has been reported in all parts of the world. However， data on epidemiology of Takayasu’s arteritis is limited， probably due to the rarity of the disorder. It appears to be more prevalence among the Asian populations， affecting mostly young females in 80% to 90% of the cases， with an age of onset between 10to 40 years old通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>.\n\n【17】The onset of symptoms in Takayasu’s arteritis tends to be sub acute with a wide range of presentations. In the early phase of Takayasu's arteritis， non-specific constitutional symptoms such as weight loss， low grade fever， night sweat， arthralgia， myalgia， malaise， and fatigue are common 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，2]</u>. As the inflammation progresses， leading to permanent vascular injuries， characteristic features become more apparent. One of the common features is hypertension， which can be a result of renal artery stenosis or coarctation of aorta， with the former being the more common cause 通用删除6(英):<u>[1-3]</u>. More than 80% of cases have diminished or absent pulses associated with limb claudication and blood pressure discrepancies. Vascular bruits present in up to94% of cases， particularly affecting the carotid， subclavian， and abdominal vessels 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. Chest pain may occur due to coronary artery ostial narrowing from aortitis or coronary arteritis. Mesenteric artery involvement will result in post-prandial abdominal pain， diarrhea，删除1换行and gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Neurological symptoms such as light-headedness， vertigo， headache， convulsions， strokes， and visual impairment may result from carotid and vertebral arteries stenosis. About 10% to 30% of patients experienced carotidynia， which is tenderness of a carotid artery 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>.\n\n【18】The diagnosis of Takayasu’s arteritis is often delayed due to the non-specific presentations and lack of specific laboratory markers. Time from onset to diagnosis may take several months up to 11years. Without a proper clinical suspicion， the diagnosis can be missed even with apparent signs such as loss of peripheral pulses. Significant delayed in diagnosis of >12 months may subject patients to angioplasty and surgery， which may be prevented by an increased clinical awareness of Takayasu’s arteritis for earlier diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. In the present case， she was asymptomatic with only blood pressure discrepancies noted in multiple pregnancies， however， were unheeded leading to delay diagnosis with complication of heart failure.\n\n【19】There is no unified guideline for the management of Takayasu's arteritis due to the lack of complete placebo-controlled and randomized clinical trials. High dose prednisolone (1 mg/kg/day) is the standard initial treatment for Takayasu's arteritis， with conventional immunosuppressive agents such as methotrexate and azathioprine to be added as steroid sparing agent while tapering down steroids. Some physicians prefer an initial treatment with the combination of steroids and another immunosuppressive agent. To date， there is no evidence on clinical outcomes of different immunosuppressive agents. Biologic agents such as anti-TNF agents， rituximab and tocilizumab are choices of treatment for patients who are resistant or intolerant to initial therapy. Antiplatelet may help in lower down ischemic events in patient with Takayasu's arteritis.

Its clinical and radiological manifestations are not entirely clear due to the rarity of the disease； and hence diagnosis of this condition can be delayed due lack of knowledge associated with the disease. We present a case of a 63-year-old man who presented with a few weeks of cognitive deficits with dysphasia and marked impairments in short term memory. His MRI brain showed subtle FLAIR and T1contrast abnormalities near the lateral ventricles abutting the temporal lobe at the choroid plexus. On brain biopsy he was noted to have perivascular atypical B lymphocytes consistent with PCNSL. High-dose methotrexate， teniposide， BCNU， prednisolone and Rituximab， followed by 5 months of consolidative chemotherapy with cytarabine resulted in clinical and radiological improvement. He subsequently relapsed twice and salvage chemotherapy with consolidative radiotherapy was delivered. Unfortunately， 6 months later his condition worsened and he was referred to palliative care， and then deceased. PCNSL of the choroid plexus is very rare and cases of relapsed disease generally have poor outcome despite a variety of chemo and radiotherapy options. Targeted therapies with optimal penetration of the blood brain barrier are warranted.\n\n【2】Keywords： Primary CNS lymphoma； Choroid plexus； Brain malignancy\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Approximately 4% of all intracranial tumors are primary CNS lymphomas 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>， of which intraventricular neoplasms are rare representing 1% to 10% of primary CNS malignancy 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. There is an increased incidence of primary CNS lymphoma in individuals with acquired or inherent immunodeficiency 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Involvement of the choroid plexus by lymphoma is rare with only less than10 individual case reports in the literature. The aim of this report is to present a case of a 63-year-old man who presented with cognitive deficits and after a myriad of investigations on brain biopsy was found to have primary CNS lymphoma of the choroid plexus. The case highlights the challenges in diagnosis， the rarity of such cancer affecting the choroid plexus and the response to treatment where treatment efficacy might be reduced due to location of the lesion.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 63-year-old man was brought into the ED by his partner， dueto a1-weekhistoryof\"confusion\"， short-term memory loss and inability to recall directions. There was no history of recent headaches， photophobia， neck stiffness， or seizures. He did not have fevers or night sweats but according to his partner， had lost 3 kg in weight in the past 3 months. His past medical history included a lumbar spinelaminectomy 10 years ago and he was a current smoker (30 pack-year history) but had recently quit. He worked as a farmer and had horses， cattle， dogs， and sheep in the farm. He sailed regularly and his most recent travel was to Japan 3 months prior to his presentation.\n\n【7】On examination he was afebrile with a blood pressure of 122/74 mmHg. There was no palpable lymphadenopathy no hepatosplenomegaly. Visual acuity was normal with pinhole correction.\n\n【8】Cranial nerve， gait and neurological limb examination， and fundoscopy were normal.\n\n【9】There were no abnormalities on examination of higher centers， frontal， parietal or occipital lobe functions， however marked deficits in recall with retrograde amnesia extending for at least one week with inability to form new memories. He scored 17/30(0/3 recall) on Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and NUCOG of 71/100 with deficits in short-term memory. Formal neuropsychological testing confirmed specific deficits in recall of recent events.\n\n【10】Full blood examination， renal and liver function， inflammatory markers， Vitamin B12， folate，TSH，ANA，dsDNA，rheumatoid factor， pANCA and cANCA were all normal. Anti-GAD， anti-NMDAR and VGKC antibodies were negative. HIV serology was negative. Immunoglobulin levels were normal. Serum protein electrophoresis detected a paraprotein band of IgMlambda 4g/L.CT chest/abdomen/pelvis revealed no evidence of malignancy with no enlarged lymph nodes seen.\n\n【11】Lumbar puncture showed an opening pressure of 4 cm， H，O with 48 ×10/L polymorphs， 177 × 10/L lymphocytes and 0 x10/L red blood cells. Glucose was 1.5 mmol/L and protein was 3.93g/L. Cytology showed chronic inflammation with no evidence of malignancy. There was no clonal B- or T-cell populations identified by flow cytometry. Cryptococcal antigen， Herpes virus multiplex PCR and syphilis screen were negative. Electrophoresis was normal. NMDA receptor and neuronal antibodies were not detected in CSF.\n\n【12】MRI brain with gadolinium revealed thickening of the choroid plexus at the level of the atria of the lateral ventricle (extending to the temporal horns)， more pronounced on the right side associated with marked enhancement ofthe choroid plexus . There was no pathological contrast enhancement within the brain parenchyma outside the ventricular system， and the brain parenchyma was of normal volume with no volume loss of the hippocampal formation. The differential diagnosis from the MRI findings included malignancy， sarcoid or infection. A diagnostic biopsy of the choroid plexus lesion confirmed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma consistent with PCNSL on histology and immunohistochemistry  showing presence perivascular atypical CD20 positive B cells， which were MUM1positive and a Ki-67 index of approximately 80%. A bone marrow biopsy for staging showed no evidence of lymphoma involvement.On slit lamp examination，there was no ocular lymphoma involvement.\n\n【13】He was subsequently referred to Hematology and commenced treatment withmulti-agentchemotherapy with high-dose methotrexate， teniposide， BCNU， prednisolone and Rituximab(monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody). He received 2 cycles， following which a MRI scan showed near complete resolution of his CNS lymphoma.Hlee then receivedconsolidation with high-dose cytarabine. Five months later， he presented with deterioration in gait and MRI brain scan showed recurrence of periventricular/choroidal enhancement. He received 8 cycles ofsalvage chemotherapy withhigh dose methotrexate and rituximab with the addition of temozolomide on odd-numbered cycles. Restaging MRI showed resolution of the CNS lymphoma consistent with improvement in clinical symptoms. He preceded with 30 Gy of consolidative whole brain radiotherapy delivered in 20 fractions. Unfortunately， six months later， patient exhibited worsening cognition and short-term memory loss and MRI scan confirmed relapsed disease in the ependymal surface of all ventricles， most pronounced in the lateral ventricles of both hemispheres. There was increased T2 signal extending into the white matter and this pattern of disease was in similar distribution to his original scan in June 2014 . Due to his poor prognosis， palliative treatment was discussed with him and his partner and he died within a month of his second relapse.\n\n【14】Discussion and Conclusions\n\n【15】PCNSL is an uncommon variant of extra nodal Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL) that involves the brain， leptomeninges， eyes， or spinal cord without evidence of systemic disease 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，2]</u>. The CNS normally lacks lymphoid aggregates and it remains speculative whether malignant transformation develops locally within normally trafficking CNS lymphocytes， or from within a sub-population of lymphocytes with specific tropism for the CNS 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. Such tropism may be facilitated through the expression of specific cell-surface adhesion molecules， such as CD44 and CD18，and various chemokine receptors 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. Spreading of malignant lymphoid cells within the CNS is believed to involve a complex interaction of selection and cadherin molecules， such as adhesion molecule CD44 and transmembrane protein receptor Fas (CD95) 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>.\n\n【16】Intraventricular neoplasms consist of two categories： those that originate from the ventricular wall， and those that originate from structures within the ventricular system such as choroid plexus 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. The choroid plexus is a leaf-like structure with a granular surface attached to the ependyma by a thin stalk in the lateral， third and fourth ventricles. It produces CSF and is crucial in maintenance of ionic balance 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. Tumors arising from the choroid plexus are extremely rare， and include choroid plexus papilloma， choroid plexus carcinoma and non-neoplastic lesions. Of these，lymphoma is an extremely rare form of choroid plexus tumor. A PubMed search revealed only less than 8 cases of primary CNS lymphoma of choroid plexus， highlighting the rarity of the disease.\n\n【17】The risk factors for PCNSL include： iatrogenic immunosuppression， congenital immunodeficiency including ataxia-telangiectasia， Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome and severe combined variable immunodeficiencies 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. PCNSL can also arise from EBV-mediated clonal expansion and malignant transformation of B-lymphocytes， a process that is likely regulated by immune mechanisms通用删除6(英):<u> 5]</u>.\n\n【18】High-dose methotrexate-based induction chemotherapy is currently the first-line of treatment. As monotherapy， high-dose methotrexate achievesa 35%to74%response rate 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>andcombination chemotherapy regimens have increased response rates to 77% to 85%通用删除6(英):<u>[9，10]</u>. However， 35% to 65% of patients still relapse and radiation therapy is utilized as salvage treatment for relapsed or refractory disease with neurocognitive long-term toxicity a major concern 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>. In a recent study Yang and colleagues reported the outcomes of 11cases of intraventricular primary CNS lymphoma showing that the majority (70%) relapsed and in the majority of cases salvage therapy(high does methotrexate and radiotherapy were required) 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>. The overall prognosis for relapsed PCNSL is poor with salvage radiation treatment increasing median overall survival by approximately 11months in radiotherapy-naive patients 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>. Another multi centre study used induction therapy with rituximab， high dose methotrexate and temozolomide followed byhigh dose consolidation with etoposide in addition to cytarabine (without whole brain radiotherapy). A complete response to rituximab， methotrexate and temozolomide of66% and progression free survival at 2 years of 57% were seen 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>. Other studies have reported high dose chemotherapy-autologous stem cell transplantation as a first line treatment for primary CNS lymphoma； and in a phase 2 trial of 30 patients， 5 year probability of relapse-related death was 21% for all patients (n=30) and 8.7% for patients treated with high dose chemotherapy plus autologous stem cell transplantation 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>.\n\n【19】The case that we presented died from relapsed disease where salvage chemotherapy was ultimately ineffective in controlling the underlying illness. Age and premorbid function are thought to be independent risk factors for future prognosis in PCNSL通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u>. A complete response on neuroimaging after two courses of chemotherapy is also reported to be predictive of progression-free survival 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>. The case presented did not have complete resolution of radiological changes after the course of chemotherapy. One reason could have been that the location of the neoplasia being within the choroid plexus was presumably hard to access for the therapeutic agents. Future studies are required to decipher PCNSL location and its association with future outcome.\n\n【20】PCNSL of the choroid plexus is a very rare tumor. We present a case of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma of the choroid plexus with extension into the temporal horns ofthe lateral ventricle. Radiological and clinical improvement were achieved with high-dose methotrexate combination treatment with Rituximab but the patient experienced 2relapses within 5 to 6 months of completion oftreatment， heralding a poor prognosis. This is consistent with the literature where recurrent or relapsed PCNL has been reported to have poor outcome despite the many varieties of therapies that have been trialed. Targeted therapies that could penetrate the blood brain barrier are required to deal with this highly invasive brain cancer. Recent efforts on the use of agents such as ibrutinib， lenalidomide and immune checkpoint inhibitors for treatment of PCNL is underway.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

One of the most cutting-edge fields that show these changes is the interdisciplinary science of medical image processing. Approaches in this rapidly evolving field enable the entire data flow in modern medical imaging systems， from raw data collecting to digital image transfer. These systems now offer ever-increasing spatial and intensity resolutions as well as faster collecting times， resulting in a vast volume of high-quality raw image data that must be carefully processed and reviewed for correct diagnostic results.\n\n【10】Imaging in medicine has improved the quality of life for an uncountable number of people， and this trend is only going to continue. It is extremely important to recognize diseases in their early stages. If have reason to feel that something is wrong with the body， must undergo the diagnostic scans to find out whether or not there is cause for concern. It could very well end up saving our life.\n\n【11】Medical imaging techniques are incredibly useful for the diagnosis of many of the cancers such as cervical， brain， breast， leukemia blood cells etc. To increase a patient’s chances of surviving such a dreadful disease， it is crucial that they receive a diagnosis at the earliest feasible time. Medical imaging techniques enable the diagnosis of tumors at progressively earlier stages.\n\n【12】Currently， in the field of medical area nanotechnology has evolved rigorous applications and it is being applied to the development of novel imaging techniques for medical purposes. It is highly probable that the development of nano-scale imaging will advance medicine by enabling the creation of more comprehensive images of the activities of cellular components. The capabilities of currently existing medical imaging equipment are being enhanced so that they can be utilized at the nanoscale more effectively. In addition， contrast agents are being developed to facilitate the monitoring of implanted nanoparticles throughout the body. Especially， nanoparticle implantation helps in cancer like diseases to cure the particular area proliferated in the body instead of affecting other parts through the oral medicines. It can also apply in the process of protein detection， optical coding and cell manipulation etc.\n\n【13】删除10:<u>COm</u>\n\n【14】Molecular imaging agents based on nanoparticles are currently being manufactured. These nanoparticles will reveal whether there are mutations in cancer-causing genes or how tumor cell's function. It has been demonstrated that nanoparticles can be emploved therapeutically as anatomical structural contrast agents. This information can be used to suggest a treatment plan or modify an existing one. By altering their properties in response to biological stimuli or processes，bioactivatable nanoparticles serve as dynamic recorders of in vivo conditions， revealing how diseases evolve and the efficacy oftreatments.\n\n【15】In the fight against cancer， early detection is tantamount to gaining a decisive advantage. The development of new molecular contrast agents and materials， made feasible by nanotechnology， offers the path for an earlier and more accurate initial cancer diagnosis as well as continuous monitoring of cancer treatment. There are already a number of nanoparticle-based medical screenings and diagnostics available on the market. The most prevalent usage of nanoparticles， however， is in thetreatment of a wide range of medical conditions， including stomach and intestinal diseases， nerve and intestine obstructions， and many more can be captured by the capsule cameras.\n\n【16】For cancer prevention， nanodevices designed to capture blood-borne biomarkers are being explored. Biomarkers include cancer-associated proteins， spread around the tumor cells， tumor DNA， and exosomes produced by the tumor. Sensors enabled by nanotechnology are capable of readings with high sensitivity， specificity， and multiplexing. The next generation of diagnostic删除1换行technologies combines sample collection with genetic analysis to improve understanding of a patient's cancer， potential treatments， and disease progression.\n\n【17】In the field of image acquisition，hardware advances that improve the quality of raw data and increase its informational value are favorable. Integrated front-end solutions offer quicker scan times， higher resolutions， and unique structures， such as CT/PET/X-ray， ultrasound/mammography，and PET/MRI combination systems. An accurate automatic prediction based on the image processing faces many challenges like time consumption，efficiencythrough numerous trending technologies such as machine learning algorithms like naive Bayes， KNN， SVM etc. and deep learning algorithms such as CNN， RNN，LSTM，GAN (Generative Adversarial Networks)，RBFN(Radial Basis Function Networks)，SOM (SelfOrganizing Maps) are working in a way. This process involves particular steps like pre-processing， feature extraction， segmentation classification etc. Similarly， visual images face， expressions etc. and other images like EEG plays an imperative role in the fields of cognitive science and neuroscience to predict the behavior of the people. It is an admitted fact that despite giving good results， still we are unable to introduce fully in real-time applications as giving challenges in many aspects.\n\n【18】The most trending technologies like quantum computing and cloud storage can address the challenges which are given by existing systems over the year in terms of time complexity and massive storage. In fact， the results in some cases that take few years will be made in seconds. The imagery which is captured through the edge cutting technologies can be stored in the cloud. Due to these unparalleled services of aforementioned technologies on image processing brings the quality life nearer to the human life with the faster and pure services. Most of the largest countries are making the massive investments in the fields of above to solve the challenges towards the many fields in the society such as health care， finance， security， technology， forecasting etc.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

We took Tiger on， fixed him up， and he became our loving companion for nine years. Hearing about other stray and abandoned felines numbers grew to thirty-six colonies， and Tiger was joined by more than a dozen others.\n\n【5】Now， a quarter of a century on， the Lonely Miaow Association is an Incorporated Society with dozens of volunteers， and has rescued 11，649 stray and abandoned cats and kittens from 3，337colonies in the Auckland region at a cost of around $2 million.\n\n【6】Lonely Miaow Resources and Processes\n\n【7】Over the years Lonely Miaow has built up a number of strategic assets which enable us to humanely manage stray and abandoned cats.\n\n【8】Our volunteers are first and foremost， with excellent and hard-working people managing the functions of Administration， Cat Rescue， Foster Homes， Marketing， IT， Fundraising， and Finance.

All incoming calls and communications from the public are entered onto the Call Log database and resolved or moved on to the Colony Record database. Members of the public can now also log a new colony directly through our website， which has reduced the number of calls and enabled our Cat Rescue Manager to action rescues more quickly. Each colony is automatically assigned a number， as is each rescued cat. Each cat is assigned to a colony and a colony is closed once all the cats there have been rescued. Each cat is Outcome once it leaves the care of Lonely Miaow. The great majority are vet checked， desexed， vaccinated， defleaed， dewormed， and microchipped before finding their new forever home with a caring and responsible member of the public. A number of key Management Reports are readilyo3S1btainable from our database on the cats and colonies.

As well as our own volunteers going out to colony locations to directly rescue the stray and abandoned cats， we often loan cages to members of the public who have unwanted strays on their property. Each cat rescued is taken to a local vet for a temperament and health assessment， with the great majority being collected by a local foster home通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>.\n\n【18】Lonely Miaow Focus and Strategy\n\n【19】We focus on stray and abandoned cats in unmanaged colonies in the Auckland region. We are删除1换行not involved with owned or feral cats， nor do we manage stray cat colonies.\n\n【20】Our management strategy is Trap， Assess， Resolve. We do not return a cat to a situation where its health and welfare are not being cared for. We work with members of the public who report stray cat colonies to us to achieve the best outcome for the individual cat， and we welcome collaboration with other rescue groups.\n\n【21】Reasons for our focus I am sure are clear to all. In spite of the significant numbers mentioned at the start of this talk Lonely Miaow has not made a substantial impact on the overall total. A guesstimate figure of 200，000 stray and abandoned cats in Auckland was published in Animals’ Voice in 2012， which could mean around 1 million unwanted kittens born in Auckland each year.\n\n【22】The main reason we operate a Trap， Assess， resolve management strategy is because stray and abandoned cats are suffering， from starvation， sickness， and lack of shelter from inclement weather. A cat is a domestic animal， New Zealand's most popular companion animal. We believe it does not have a place outside of the human bond as a stray or feral in New Zealand. The suffering they endure is highlighted by a recent study made by Sarah Jolly， Unitec， 2014，“Welfare Comparison between managed and unmanaged colony cats in the Auckland Region.\" To quote： “It was of great interest that there was a significant difference in body condition score between the managed and unmanaged colony cats. Thin condition was much more prevalent in the unmanaged colony cats than the managed.\"“There was a substantial difference in the subjective quality of life score given to managed and unmanaged colony cats. No excellent quality oflife scores was given to unmanaged colony cats.”\n\n【23】What is a Stray Cat?\n\n【24】Lonely Miaow receives an unending stream of calls and reports from members of the public about stray and abandoned cats and kittens. All communications are responded to， to ascertain the number of felines involved， their exact location and type of location， and what steps have been taken to establish that these are stray or abandoned felines. Often these cats have turned up， usually at the place of residence and occasionally at the workplace of the person reporting. Most often too the person reporting has started feeding， then kittens have arrived， and now there are too many and none are wanted. We confirm that enquiries have been made to ascertain whether there is an owner， and no owner has been found. We may check ourselves with Pets on The Net， or distribute flyers around the neighborhood. Often， we are told that an old guy or lady had some entire cats， and now that person has gone the cats have dispersed throughout the neighborhood. On visiting the location to rescue those reported we are often told that “there are more down the back.”There are always more!\n\n【25】删除3:<u>Trap，Assess，Resolve</u>\n\n【26】Each cat trapped is assessed by the rescuer and by the vet for temperament and health. The great majority are assessed as suitable for fostering and rehoming， with the main reason for a negative outcome being unsuitable temperament. The great majority of sick cats are treated by a vet， fostered， and rehomed. Whilst no cat is returned to a colony situation， Lonely Miaow makes a great effort to work with members of the public to achieve the desired outcome. Occasionally a cat is wanted back， and therefore after confirming that the person is willing and able to feed it cat food every day， the cat删除1换行is defleaed， dewormed， vaccinated， desexed and microchipped and returned to the place where it was rescued from， but as an owned， not a colony， cat.\n\n【27】What is a Cat Colony?\n\n【28】According to the Companion Cats Animal Welfare Code， 2007， published by NAWAC， Section 13： \"Stray cats may live singly or may join colonies.\"Lonely Miaow considers a colony to comprise of one or more stray cats. A single stray is often a pregnant female， resulting in a sudden increase in numbers. The largest colonies we have been involved with have comprised 120 stray cats. An average colony is around five， basically a mother and kittens. The majority of colonies，80%， are located on residential land.\n\n【29】Cat Colonies - How they are Managed and Resolved\n\n【30】At Lonely Miaow we define anything from one cat to a large group of cats at a property as a colony. When people contact us through our website， email or phone to report cats our call loggers log these in our database as colonies.\n\n【31】From these colony logs the Rescue Manager goes through daily and assesses the urgency of each colony based on：\n\n【32】If the cats are in danger?\n\n【33】Are they being fed?\n\n【34】Do they pose a risk to people?\n\n【35】Do we have foster space?\n\n【36】Any cat that is not being fed， is pregnant or is in danger is our top priority.\n\n【37】Usually if a cat is injured and requires urgent attention or is being mistreated， they will be referred to the SPCA. Sometimes we get reports of cats that are putting people at risk. We have recently been involved with a stray pregnant cat coming into a 99-year old’s home and posing a tripping hazard. In this case not only is it a priority due to the cat being pregnant but also because the man could come to harm by it being there.\n\n【38】Once it is decided that the cats will be rescued a rescue volunteer is organized to go to the property to trap the cat， or the person reporting can drop it to one of our participating vets. When all the cats are in our care the colony can be closed.\n\n【39】We have still a number of colonies we have been working on for a long period of time that are not as simple to bring in. They have a ale 110colony manager who takes care of trapping and assessing these cats to slowly work towards resolving these larger and possibly wilder colonies.\n\n【40】Foster Homes andFostered Cats- How thev are Humanely Managed and Adopted Out to a Responsible Owner\n\n【41】Lonely Miaow currently has over 100 active foster homes throughout Auckland， a number that has almost doubled in the past vear. The foster home management team have spent the last two years focused on both refining procedures and the growth of Lonely Miaow， hindered only by a lack of financial resources， a limitation that is shared by so many other rescue organizations. Winter is the quieter season when a lot of our hardworking volunteers take a short删除1换行break and we usually house upwards of about 60 cats and kittens. In kitten season the number of cats and kittens in our care can exceed 200.\n\n【42】All of our foster homes are volunteers - supplies and access to veterinary care is provided by Lonely Miaow， but the heart and soul of our efforts lie with them. The gift they give Lonely Miaow is one that many of you will be familiar with- not only do they contribute their valuable time while juggling family and work commitments， they are often found staying up late to feed orphaned or abandoned kittens， administering to cats that are unwell， and exercising patience with those that need a bit of time to come around to the idea of living with people.\n\n【43】It's not uncommon for a cat who lacks confidence around people to remain in our care for six months or more before even being ready to meet potential adopters， and the foster homes who not only have the perseverance to continue rehabilitation efforts， but the strength to invest so heavily in these cats， and then see them leave to go to new homes are a huge， and sadly very limited asset that helps to give these less confident， less desirable'strays a chance at a life where they are healthy， safe and cared for.\n\n【44】Lonely Miaow’s cats and kittens are all desexed， microchipped， and started on a flea treatment， worming and vaccination protocol before leaving our care. Our adoptions include microchip registration on the New Zealand Companion Animal Register database， which is processed immediately after adoption to ensure that these microchips can be utilized without delay in the event that a cat goes missing. We are proud to be partnered with Pet Plan Pet Insurance， who offer a free four-week cover with almost all of our adoptions.\n\n【45】Our policies in assessing potential adopters include a mandatory meet-and-greet before an adoption can be mutually agreed upon(while we will allow a short hold' period， we do not consent to adoptions sight-unseen)， owner-occupancy or confirmation that a landlord is agreeable to a new feline family member， and an open discussion on the household's suitability to the cat (or vice versa). We are lucky to have developed a relationship with Pet Stock stores in Auckland late last year， who have shown exceptional judgement and heart in caring for our more confident cats and kittens in-store and facilitating many more adoptions than we would have been able to achieve on our own. It is this collaboration that has allowed us to achieve our recent growth sustainably with only a few scary financial moments!\n\n【46】Lonely Miaow is only as great as our volunteers， and we are so proud of each one of them， and the development and improvements that we have been able to make in recent years. It is the combined efforts of all of us， as well as supporting and helping each other， that will ultimately see us achieve our common goal.\n\n【47】FutureManagementofStrayand Abandoned Cats\n\n【48】As stated earlier Lonely Miaow has not been successful in making a significant impact on the overall number of stray cats and colonies.\n\n【49】This is because we operate a scatter-gun approach， rushing to rescue cats from a colony in one suburb to a colony in other miles away. Over the years we have rescued cats from colonies in ninety-nine Auckland suburbs. We simply can’t keep up. In discussing this issue with William Gomaa， Alley Cat Allies USA， over dinner at a recent NZCAC conference， he put forward a different approach. Start with one colony at one house， expand to neighboring properties， cover the whole block， then adjacent blocks， the whole neighborhood， adjacent neighborhoods， and finally the whole city， region， and country. But that would mean condemning cats in say Henderson to carry on suffering whilst we focused on say Otahuhu. We care for them all equally， so we keep rushing about rescuing a few from everywhere， and meantime the problem continues.\n\n【50】Sarah Jolly's study， referred to earlier， points the way for the future.“Global cat overpopulation is no doubt a human responsibility.\"Compulsory， subsidized desexing， microchipping and vaccination laws for owned cats as well as colony cats could be implemented. Registration of cats would help enforce these laws.\"“More resources are needed for the removal of unmanaged colony cats from urban areas and for funding of larger animal shelters to make the potential of rehoming greater. Colony carers， wildlife managers， animal control，shelters， and veterinarians and most importantly the public must all work together to find the most humane solutions to this huge problem. Adoption for socialized cats remains the ideal solution but isn’t possible for all stray cats. The responsibility of managing cat populations lies ultimately with both local and central government who can create and enforce laws and provide funding and resources Non-governmental organizations also play a large role and should work together with the government for the best possible solutions.”\n\n【51】We are delighted that the Wellington City Council has introduced compulsory microchipping and registration for cats which will come into force in February 2018， and we hope that this initiative will be taken up by all New Zealand's Territorial Authorities.\n\n【52】It is pleasing that the NZCAC has created the National Cat Management Strategic Group comprising NZVA， Companion AnimalSociety， RNZSPCA，locallgovernment，the Morgan Foundation，and NZCAC representatives， to proactively address the impact of cats in New Zealand， and by doing so taking up a number of Sarah's recommendations. The Strategic Goals are commendable， and achievable if we all work together. Management， a comprehensive database， staff and volunteers， legislation and bylaws， Cat Rescue Centers， and above all finance， are all requirements for success. Lonely Miaow fully supports the Intent， Strategic Goals， and Strategic Outcomes and we will play our full part in achieving these.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

Currently， there is no such quantifiable measurement to guide towards a diagnosis. Unfortunately， although it is an easy parameter to obtain， no absolutely reliable Standard Uptake Value (SUV) threshold has been found that can be used to clinically differentiate benign from malignant uptake due to the similar mechanism of FDG accumulation between tumor cells and white blood cells 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>.\n\n【20】Unexpected and incidental uptake foci in oncology PET/CT are relatively common.Given the increased uptake of 18F-FDG，infectious and inflammatory responses have the potential to be misinterpreted as metastatic disease. Following analysis of more than 1，000 patients undergoing 18F-FDG PET/CT， it has been reported in the literature通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u> that more than a quarter of these scans contained foci of FDG uptake of benign origin attributed to infectious and non-infectious inflammation. Respiratory tract infections and brain infections were among the most common etiologies incidentally identified by PET/CT performed for oncological indications. The body responds to inflammatory stimuli with a cascade of events， including local hyperemia， release of proteins such as fibrin and immunoglobulins， andinfiltration of inflammatory cells.Inflammation exhibits18F-FDG uptake due to the recruitment of activated white blood cells(neutrophils and lymphocytes)， which have a high affinity for glucose transporters， particularly GLUT 1 and GLUT 3.\n\n【21】COVID-19 infection can lead to various imaging findings， as it is the great radiological mimic， as reported by Duzgun et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. It is well known that the most common imaging finding of COVID-19pneumonia is bilateral matted glass opacities accompanied by consolidation with thickening of interlobular or intralobular septa(crazy pavement pattern). Atypical findings are isolated lobar or segmental consolidation， interlobular septal thickening accompanied by pleural effusion， cavitations and solitary pulmonary nodules. Nodules represent one of the many facets of COVID-19 infection， with an incidence on CT scans of 3% to 12% in the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>.\n\n【22】Spontaneous regression of the solitary pulmonary nodule may be associated with the organization of pneumonia thathas been shown to occur secondary to COVID-19 infection. Recognition of rare imaging cases of COVID-19 infection is essential for proper diagnostic and treatment management通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>.\n\n【23】Similar cases with complete resolution of lung nodules have been reported in the literature and are associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. One of these cases is of a 57-vear-old patient， smoker， diagnosed with COVID-19 infection， imaging evaluation by computed tomography， with the detection of a 20 mm lung nodule， irregular in the left upper lobe (a，b). To rule out a possible primary lung cancer， given the history of chronic smoking， transthoracic percutaneous needle biopsy is planned. Pre-procedural chest CT shows regression of nodule size (c)， so biopsy is postponed and re-evaluation is recommended at three months， when complete resolution of the left lung nodule is described (d) 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u> .\n\n【24】It is unclear whether the pulmonary involvement of COVID-19in cancer patients is different from that in the general population. Therefore， the development of new pulmonary nodules in a patient with a history of malignancy requires further evaluation 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>.\n\n【25】The occurrence of metastases with a mammary starting point at a distance of 15 years is a rare phenomenon described in the literature. Most breast cancers metastasize about two vears after the start of treatment， with another peak at 8 to 9 years. In a meta-analysis described by Dr. Rikke Norgaard， Dr. Buket Ozturk Esen and Dr. Lene Mellemkjaer， in a paper published in November 2021， following 36，924 women with breast cancer， 2，595 cases developed late metastases， 10 to 32 years after diagnosis. Women at risk for late recurrence are those with high lymph node burden， large tumor size， and estrogen receptor positivity， requiring more extensive surveillance or more aggressive treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>.\n\n【26】Approximately 75% of primary breast tumors have already spread by the time of diagnosis， seeding micrometastases at a regional or distant anatomical site. These micrometastases survive in a resting tumor state， whereby cell growth is balanced by apoptosis. Changes in cytokines， immune cells and growth factors in the tumor microenvironment leads to cessation of tumor rest， resulting in complete metastatic growth 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>.\n\n【27】In breast cancer， understanding the mechanisms underlying cancer cell stagnation and retreatment is of crucial importance due to a particularly wide window of tumor recurrence， spanning up to two decades after diagnosis. Hypoxia， which occurs in patients with COVID-19 in the setting of respiratory distress and thrombosis， is a hallmark of micro-medial， poor prognosis of solid tumors. In breast cancer， hypoxia has been shown to be responsible for dormant cell generation by promoting expression of genes involved in cancer quiescence，drug resistance， stemness and EMT通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>.\n\nThroughout the pandemic， questions have been raised about how the SARS-CoV-2 infection， including its long-term effects， acts on cancer patients. Thus， it has been hypothesized that severe COVID-19infection may increase the risk of subsequent cancer recurrence by inducing reactivation Of Latent Cancer Cells (LCCs). In a severe form of SARS-CoV-2， pathophysiological events such as immune-mediated tissue inflammation， impaired T-cell and Natural Killer(NK) cell activity， neutrophil hyperactivation and thrombocytosis occur， which may collectively generate a temporary pro-tumorigenic microenvironment favorable to LCC reactivation. Since the beginning删除1换行of the pandemic， ACE2 has been identified as the entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2. Although ACE2 has been reported to exert multiple antitumor effects， including inhibition of cancer angiogenesis and metastasis， its downregulation may itselfpromotetumor progression. Up-regulation of ACE2 causes hyperactivation of NF-kB， the most important molecule linking inflammation to cancer. NF-kB activation in cancer cells promotes proliferation， chemoresistance and invasion， while in the Tumor Microenvironment (TME) it stimulates angiogenesis and immune suppression， supporting the metastatic process 7|\n\n【29】Patients with the severe form of COVID-19 usually develop acute respiratory distress and Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS)， which can lead to sustained fever， edema， neurological symptoms， organ failure and shock. IL-6 plays a central role in the pathophysiology of CRS， and its high levels have been correlated with increased risk of tumor recurrence in breast cancer and head and neck cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>.\n\n【30】Recent studies have reported that NETs (Neutrophil Extracellular Traps)，activate metastasis formationby severalmechanisms，including the trapping of circulating tumor cells， activation of pro-metastatic fibroblasts and proteolytic destruction of the anti-tumorigenic factor thrombospondin-1. Importantly， NETs (Neutrophil Extracellular Traps)， have been reported to awaken dormant breast cancer cells disseminated to the lungs 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>\n\n【31】The association between COVID-19 and increased risk of lung metastasis in patients with prior breast cancer should lead to specific follow-up programs and personalized therapies using anti-inflammatory agents capable of interfering with immune-mediated inflammatory pathways or NETs formation in order to decrease the risk of tumor recurrence 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>.\n\n【32】Conclusions\n\n【33】PET/CT is a very useful tool in cancer diagnosis and follow-up， due to the high sensitivity of this imaging modality. Its specificity， however， may be reduced by the presence of infectious and inflammatory traps， the COVID-19 pandemic bringing new difficulties in tumor vs. inflammatory interpretation.\n\n【34】It is important to always be alert to these false-positive results， as they can influence the diagnosis and course of patient treatment. Patient pathological history is a mandatory step in navigating PET/CT imaging.\n\n【35】Before scheduling patients for 18F-FDG PET/CT scans for various oncological purposes， we must consider sources of possible interferences， such as COVID-19 infection， considering that there is no concise protocol indicating the time required for lesion resorption. Double PET/CT examination at a two-month interval shows the fleeting nature of the inflammatory capturing lesions three months after the COVID-19 infectious episode.\n\n【36】This case presentation is intended to increase awareness of the complications that COVID-19 disease can bring. In addition to many others， the effects of the pandemic can be felt indirectly， hindering the correct diagnosis of patients and decreasing the chances of survival. More similar case reports and other descriptive articles are needed to quantify the impact the pandemic has had on this type of situation.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

Similar to that in general population， post-spinal meningitis may be caused by bacterial and aseptic reasons. The latter comprises of infection by viruses， meningeal involvement in autoimmune and neoplastic diseases， and Drug-Induced Aseptic Meningitis (DIAM). DIAM may in turn be caused by two mechanisms -direct chemicalirritation ofthe meningesbyintrathecaladministration ofanesthetic and chemotherapeutic drugs or systemic immunological hypersensitivity (antibiotics， non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs， intravenous immunoglobulin) 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. When associated with spinal anesthesia， it generally has an acute onset within 24 h of dural puncture， and a self-limiting and benign course. Multiple authors have reported DIAM following bupivacaine spinal anesthesia. We present a case of likely DIAM， subsequent to bupivacaine subarachnoid block for elective arthroscopic surgery， posing a diagnostic dilemma for the involved surgeons， anesthetists and intensivists. Informed consent was taken from the patient before reporting this case.\n\n【15】Case Summary\n\n【16】A 36-year-old male patient presented with history of injury to the right knee， resulting in multiple locking episodes and joint instability. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) showed partial ACL tear. The patient was posted for arthroscopic right anterior cruciate ligament repair with partial medial meniscectomy under subarachnoid block. Pre-anesthetic check-up was completely normal， and the patient was declared ASA (American Society of Anesthesiologists) grade I. On the day of elective surgery， subarachnoid injection was given with 2.4ml of 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine with 20 mcg fentanyl as additive. Cleaning and draping were performed as per departmental protocol and the spinal was given at L3-L4 level using 25 Gauge Quincke needle after local anesthetic injection. Patient was positioned and surgery was started after achieving a sensory level of T8. Surgerylasted for less than an hour and patient was shifted to the Post-operative Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU) with stable vitals. From here， the patient was transferred to admitting ward when level of sensory block receded to L1 level. Four hours after shifting to ward， patient started complaining of severe headache for which injection diclofenac 75 mg was given. This was followed by 2 episodes of vomiting， tachypnea and disorientation to time， place， and person. The surgeon and anesthetist on duty decided to shift patient to Intensive Care Unit(ICU) for further evaluation and management.\n\n【17】The patient arrived in ICU with a low GCS (Glasgow Coma Scale) score of E2V2M3 and dyspnea， necessitating tracheal intubation and assisted ventilation. Neck rigidity was observed but there was no fever. Bilateral pupils were normal in size and reaction. Blood investigations revealed a White Cell Count (WBCs) of 12，300/cumm and neutrophilia (89%) on differential count. Serum procalcitonin level was 4.1 ng/ml. A working diagnosis of bacterial meningitis was made， and neurology consultation was sought. Ceftriaxone， vancomycin， phenytoin， and dexamethasone 8 mg thrice a day were started empirically， while the patient was investigated further. Non-Contrast Computed Tomography (NCCT) and MRI brain were done， which were normal. Fundus examination did not reveal any disc edema. A lumbar puncture was subsequently performed， which showed cell count of 400 cells/cumm with 60% mononuclear cells and 40% polymorphs in Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) on cytological examination. CSF biochemistry revealed a glucose level of 150 mg/dl and protein of 777 mg/dl. Gram staining and culture were found to be negative.\n\n【18】As per the above findings and the observation that patient never exhibited any fever， the diagnosis of bacterial meningitis seemed unlikely. We started thinking along the lines of aseptic meningitis， post-subarachnoid block. Antibiotics were de-escalated， but steroids删除1换行and phenytoin were continued. After 3 days of assisted ventilation and supportive care in ICU， the patient's GCS， blood investigations and ventilation parameters improved markedly. The patient was responsive， neck rigidity was absent and diaphragmatic excursion was normal on ultrasonography. Trachea was extubated and patient's neurological assessment， including higher mental functions were found to be normal， except for some residual amnesia about surgery and post-operative period. The patient was kept in ICU another day and then shifted to orthopedics ward for further care.\n\n【19】Discussion\n\n【20】Neurological complications after an uneventful spinal anesthesia and surgeryareinfrequent，but when they occur，theypose a diagnostic dilemma to the physicians. It is essential to differentiate DIAM from bacterial meningitis， as the latter is a potentially life-threatening condition， requiring urgent intervention and leaves the patient with neurological sequela. Additionally， establishing the diagnosis of DIAM also prevents unnecessary treatment with advanced antibiotics and hospital/ICU stay 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. However， symptomatology and clinical findings may not help us distinguish between bacterial and aseptic meningitis， as both may present with headache， nuchal rigidity and febrile episodes 通用删除6(英):<u>[4，5]</u>. CSF findings may also confuse the situation further， showing pleocytosis with neutrophil predominance(later， may shift to mononuclear predominance) and raised protein levels (hyperproteinorrachia). CSF glucose levels may be low(hypoglycorrachia) or normal 通用删除6(英):<u>[5，6]</u>.\n\n【21】Bihan et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u> reported in their study on 329 cases of DIAM that a clear meningeal syndrome， involving headache， neck stiffness and vomiting may be seen in only 15.5% of cases. Out of the typical symptoms of the meningeal triad， only headache is present in >2/3of DIAM cases. All other symptoms are reported in only 20% to40% of cases. Ducornet et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u> published certain defining criteria for diagnosis of aseptic meningitis： Time to onset of signs within 24hours after spinal anesthesia； the absence of prior antibiotic therapy； apyrexia； a WBCs in CSF similar to bacterial meningitis； high protein value in CSF； a normal glucose value in CSF； negative bacterial CSF culture； full recovery in less than 48 h Our patient met each of the above criteria.\n\n【22】This goes to show that DIAM is a diagnosis of exclusion and empirical antibiotics should be started initially in all cases. When negative CSF cultures are obtained， antibiotics may be stopped to prevent development of antibiotic resistance 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. However， some clinicians favor the continuation of antibiotics till complete symptom resolution， as bacterial meningitis may masquerade as DIAM and is almost always more dangerous， leaving neurological complications. Aseptic meningitis， on the other hand， has a favorable outcome with删除表格换行a spontaneous recovery. Mortality is an exception rather than the rule6.\n\n| S.No.  | Author  | Year published  | Findings reported  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1  | Ducornetet al.7|  | 2014  | Reported likely cause for DIAM to be bupivacaine.  |\n| 1  | Ducornetet al.7|  | 2014  | Gave diagnostic criteria for DIAM， as outlined in discussion.  |\n| 2  | Oliveiraet al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>  | 2019  | Reported 2 cases of DIAM post-spinal anesthesia.  |\n| 2  | Oliveiraet al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>  | 2019  | Bupivacaine was given in the first patient， who underwent an orthopedic procedure.

This may be due to similarity in structure amongst amide local anesthetics.

Clinical and laboratory findings cannot distinguish between DIAM and bacterial meningitis. CSF analysis may show polymorphs on cytological examination and hyperproteinorrachia， similar to bacterial meningitis. Antibiotics and supportive treatment may be started empirically， but may be discontinued after negative CSF cultures.

World Health Organization (WHO) recommends every newborn baby to feed breast milk within 1-h of birth and feed colostrum. However， in Ethiopia， colostrum feeding is poorly practiced and culture makes a difference in the acceptability of colostrum. Thus， the study aimed to assess the knowledge， attitude， and practice of colostrum feeding among lactating women in Northeast Ethiopia， 2021.\n\n【2】Methods： An institution-based cross-sectional study was done in Debre Berhan town from May to June 2021. A systematic random sampling technique was used to recruit 308 participants. The data was cleaned， coded， and entered into Epi-Info software version 7.2.1 and exported to SPSS version 24.0 statistical software for analysis. Univariable analysis was computed and the finding was summarized using frequency tables. For continuous variables， means and standard deviations were computed.\n\n【3】Result： The overall prevalence of good knowledge， favorable attitude， and good practice ofcolostrum feeding among participants was 74%， 69.4%， and 56.2%， respectively. Believe that colostrum feeding cause's abdominal pain and diarrhea (51.2%)， and culture (30%) were the main reasons for avoidance of colostrum. About 26.9% of mothers initiate prelacteal feeding. Butter and non-human milk were the commonest prelacteal feedings.\n\n【4】Conclusion： The knowledge， attitude， and practice of colostrum feeding were very low. Health education dissemination should be given to all reproductive age groups， pregnant and postnatal mothers， and community members regarding the importance of colostrum and avoidance of prelacteal feeding. Besides， emphasis should be placed on harmful cultural practices to increase the level of practice.\n\n【5】Keywords： Knowledge； Attitude； Practice； Colostrum； Ethiopi\n\n【6】Abbreviations\n\n【7】ANC： Antenatal Care； CSA： Central Statistical Agency； EDHS： Ethiopia Demographic and Health Survey； EPI： Expanded program of immunization； KAP： Knowledge， Attitude and Practice； UNICEF： United Nation Childrens Fund； WHO： World Health Organization\n\n【8】Introduction\n\n【9】Colostrum is the first milk produced by the mammary glands of mammals immediately following the birth of the newborn and continuing through the early days of breastfeeding 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. This is the most suitable food for the newborn and ensures the neonate's adaptation and successful transition to independent postnatal life. This special milk is thick， sticky， and yellow to orange in color 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. It is very rich in proteins， carbohydrates， immunoglobulins， vitamin A and sodium chloride， but contains lower amounts of lipids，fat， and potassium than normal milk. Thus， it helps to fight against various viral， bacterial， fungal， and protozoal infections. Besides， it protects against childhood and adolescent illnesses， i.e.，pneumonia， diarrhea， overweight， obesity， various cancers， asthma， allergies， and autoimmune diseases that are difficult to treat 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>.\n\n【10】Early initiation of breastfeeding (provision of breast milks to infants immediately/within 1-h of删除1换行birth) is important for both the mother and the child and confirms that the infant receives the protective milk， the colostrum 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. Early initiation of breastfeeding protects the newborn from diseases， encourages bonding between the mother and her newborn， facilitates the production of regular breast milk， and helps the uterus contract， reducing the postpartum hemorrhage 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. In addition， colostrum has a laxative effect that encourages passage of the baby’s first stool(meconium) which intern helps to clear excess bilirubin produced in large quantities at birth and helps prevent jaundice 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. For most children breastfeeding makes the difference between life and death and is the infants “passport to life\". Colostrum is also considered the first vaccine for newborns. Even if it is secreted in small amounts (30ml to 100 ml per day)， the mothers need to be explained that this small amount of colostrum is adequate for the infant and must not be discouraged 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>.\n\n【11】A secondary analysis of the WHO Global Survey on Maternal and Perinatal Health indicated that the prevalence of Early Initiation of Breastfeeding (EIBF) ranges from 17.7% to 98.4% (average 57.6%)通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. According to data from 35 Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS)， the timely initiation of breastfeeding in SSA is 58%， ranging from 24% in Chad to 86% in Burundi 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. In Ethiopia， 73% of children begin breastfeeding within 1 h after birth，92% of infants breastfed within 1 day of birth， and 8% of children receive prelacteal feeding. Amhara region is the third-lowest region in the level of early initiation of breastfeeding (66%)通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>.\n\n【12】Malnutrition has been a cause directly or indirectly for millions of deaths annually among under-five children. Globally in 2020， over 149 million children under 5 were estimated to be stunted，45million were wasted， and 38.9 million were overweight or obese. Under nutrition accounts for about 45% of deaths among under 5years of age. They are the most vulnerable groups to ill health. These mostly occur in low-and middle-income countries particularly in Southern Asia， Asia， and Africa. However， the number of children with stunting has declined in all regions except Africa 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>. One of the main reasons for under nutrition is delayed breastfeeding along with colostrum avoidance 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>.Additionally，newborns who initiated breastfeeding 2 h to 23 h after birth had a 33% greater risk of neonatal mortality， and those who initiated after 24 h of birth had an 85%greater risk of neonatal mortality than those initiated within 1-h of birth 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>. Universal optimal breastfeeding could save more than800，000 child death per year 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>， and an estimated 20，000 annual deaths from breast cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>.\n\n【13】In a study of Wolaita Zone， 66% of mothers were knowledgeable and 70% had a positive attitude towards colostrum feeding 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. Though 90% of mothers in the Tigray region knew about colostrum feeding； only 48% of them started colostrum feeding within 1-h of birth 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. According to a study done in Bench Maji Zone， 66.6%，69.4%， and 72.4% of mothers had good knowledge， positive attitude， and practice colostrum feeding， respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. In Debre Tabor， 74%of mothers gave colostrum to their index children 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>.\n\nIn Harar town， 8% of mothers discourage colostrum feeding because of increased abdominal cramping (45%)， difficulty to digest(18%)， and belief it is polished (36%) 通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u>. Similarly in Debre Tabor，12% of mothers thought that colostrum doesn’t contain sufficient milk secretions 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>. Further， in North-Eastern Ethiopia， 13.5% of mothers discard colostrum. The reasons for colostrum avoidance were a belief that colostrum is not good (26%)， traditional (23.5%)， and thought colostrum milk is dirty (22.4%) 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>. The 2016 Ethiopian|删除段之间换行|Demographic Health Survey (EDHS) results showed that theneonatal， infant and under 5 mortality rates were 29，48， and 67 deaths per 1，000live births， respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. Besides， in Ethiopia， colostrum feeding is still unsatisfactory. These major child deaths can be reduced by immediate initiation of breastfeeding and colostrum after birth 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>. Thus， this study aimed to assess the knowledge， attitude， and practice of colostrum feeding among lactating women in North Shewa Zone， Ethiopia，2021.\n\n【15】Methods\n\n【16】Study setting， design， and population\n\n【17】An institution-based cross-sectional study was done in Debre Berhan town from May to June 2021. Debre Birhan is the capital city of the North Shewa Zone of Amhara Region and is located 130km Northeast of Addis Ababa on the Ethiopian highway. It is the highest town in Africa with an elevation of 2，840 m. Debre Berhan has fourteen kebeles with a total population of 1，10，500； of whom 14，966are children under five years. The town has 2 hospitals， 3 Health centers， 14 clinics， and around 20 pharmacies.\n\n【18】All lactating women presented for an Expanded Program of Immunization (EPI) in the North Shewa Zone health facilities were the source population. All lactating women who fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were available at the time of the data collection were the study population. Randomly selected mothers with infants less than6 months of age presented for EPI were included. Lactating mothers with known chronic illnesses (Hepatitis B/C and HIV/AIDS)， had active herpes simplex virus infection with lesions present on the breast， who delivered premature baby， and birth defects (cleft lip/palate) were excluded from the study.\n\n【19】Sample size， sampling technique， and procedure\n\n【20】The sample size was determined using Open Epi Version 3.03. The following assumptions were considered： 95% confidence level，5% margin of error， and proportion， 74.4% of practice of colostrum feeding 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>. Adding a 5% non-response rate， the final sample size equals 308.\n\n【21】The number of mothers with infants less than 6 months of age visiting the health facilities was obtained from the respective health institutions EPI registration book. Then systematic random sampling was applied to proportionally select mothers from all health institutions included in the study.\n\n【22】Data collection tool， quality control， andstatistical analysis\n\n【23】A striictuired and pre-tested interviewer-administered questionnaire was used to collect data. The questionnaire was adapted from different works ofliterature and modified according to the local context. The questionnaire was first prepared in English and then translated to the local language， Amharic， and then back to English to maintain consistency. The questionnaire was pre-tested on 5% of the samples in Deneba health center which was not selected in the study. The questionnaire was modified based on the result obtained from the pre-test. In addition， one-day training was given to the data collectors and supervisors about the obiective and methods of data collection. The supervisor and principal investigators daily checked and reviewed the data for completeness， clarity， and consistency.\n\n【24】The data was cleaned， coded， and entered into Epi-Info software version 7.2.1 and exported to SPSS version 24.0 statistical software for analysis. Univariable analysis was computed and the finding删除1换行was summarized using frequency tables. The means and standard deviations were estimated for continuous variables.\n\n【25】Measurement\n\n【26】Knowledge： Participants who answered greater than or equals to 60% of the knowledge questions were considered to have“Good knowledge\"， whereas those who scored below 60% were considered as having \"Poor knowledge”通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>.\n\n【27】Attitude： Participants who responded greater than or equals to60% of the attitude questions were considered to have a “Favorable attitude\"， whereas those who scored less than 60% were considered as having“Unfavorable attitude 通用删除6(英):<u>[1-3]</u>.\n\n【28】Practice： Is the overt habit of feeding colostrum/first thick and yellowish milk to the newborn within the first three days of birth without prelacteal feeding.\n\n【29】Optimal breastfeeding practice： Is the early initiation of breastfeeding within 1 h of birth， exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months of life， and continued breastfeeding for up to 2 years or beyond with appropriate complementary feeding beginning at 6months 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>.\n\n【30】Prelacteal feeding： If the newborn is given any solid or liquid foods other than breast milk during the first 3 days of birth.\n\n【31】Ethical clearance\n\n【32】Ethical clearance was obtained from Debre Berhan University， Institute of Medicine and Health Sciences. A cooperation letter was written to the selected health institutions. After explaining the objective and benefits of the study， written informed consent was obtained from voluntary participants. Confidentiality was ensured.\n\n【33】Result\n\n【34】Socio-demographic characteristics\n\n【35】A total of 290 mothers were interviewed in this study making a94.2% response rate. The mean age of participants was 29+5.45 years. Half of the respondents (52%) belonged to the age group of 20 to 34years. About 77.2% of mothers are housewives， and 91.7% of them are married. Regarding monthly income， 41.4% of mothers earn less than2000 Birr per month .\n\n【36】Utilization of maternal health service\n\n【37】About 45.9% of mothers had only one child. More than half(53.8%) of women had Antenatal Care (ANC) follow-up， however， only 7% of them had postnatal care visits. Around 61% of women were counseled about early breastfeeding during antenatal care follow-ups .\n\n【38】Knowledge of colostrum feeding\n\n【39】More than half (54.5%) of mothers have heard about colostrum feeding. Health provider (51%) was the main source of information about colostrum feeding. Around 53.8% of mothers know that colostrum is the best nutrition for the newborn . The overall prevalence of good knowledge of colostrum feeding among participants was 74%， 95% CI (68.3-79.4).\n\n【40】Attitude towards colostrum feeding\n\n【41】About 38.3% of mothers believe that colostrum causes diarrhea， and 41.7% think that colostrum breast milk is dirty and looks like pus. Besides， more than half of mothers (57.2%) agree that colostrum is important for growth and mental development . Overall，\n\n【42】Table 1： Sociodemographic characteristics of participants in North Shewa Zone， Ethiopia， 2021.\n\n| Variables  | Category  | Frequency  | Percent (100%)  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Age  | <20  | 43  | 14.8  |\n| Age  | 20-34  | 151  | 52.1  |\n| Age  | >34  | 96  | 33.1  |\n| Mothers'education  | No formal education  | 81  | 27.9  |\n| Mothers'education  | Primary school  | 87  | 30  |\n| Mothers'education  | Secondary school  | 79  | 27.2  |\n| Mothers'education  | College and above  | 43  | 14.9  |\n| Religion  | Christian  | 179  | 61.7  |\n| Religion  | Muslim  | 111  | 38.3  |\n| Residence  | Urban  | 159  | 54.8  |\n| Residence  | Rural  | 131  | 45.2  |\n| Occupation  | Housewife  | 224  | 77.2  |\n| Occupation  | Government employee  | 19  | 6.6  |\n| Occupation  | Private employee  | 37  | 12.8  |\n| Occupation  | Daily laborer  | 10  | 3.4  |\n| Marital status  | Single  | 12  | 4.1  |\n| Marital status  | Marriec  | 266  | 91.7  |\n| Marital status  | Divorced  | 12  | 4.1  |\n| Living arrangement  | Alone  | 24  | 8.2  |\n| Living arrangement  | With my husband  | 266  | 91.7  |\n| Partner education  | No formal education  | 69  | 25.9  |\n| Partner education  | Elementary school  | 63  | 23.7  |\n| Partner education  | Secondary school  | 60  | 22.6  |\n| Partner education  | College and above  | 74  | 27.8  |\n| Monthly income (in ETB)  | ≤2000  | 120  | 41.4  |\n| Monthly income (in ETB)  | 2000-4000  | 98  | 33.8  |\n| Monthly income (in ETB)  | >4000  | 72  | 24.8  |\n\n【44】ETB： Ethiopian Birr\n\n【45】69.4%，95% CI (64-74.5) of mothers had favorable attitudes towards colostrum feeding.\n\n【46】The practice of colostrum feeding\n\n【47】This study indicated that 56.2%， 95% CI (51.9-60.3) of mothers feed colostrum for their babies within the first three days of birth.Of these， 60.1% of them initiated feeding immediately within one hour and 14.1% of them started after 24 h. Believe that colostrum feeding causes abdominal pain and diarrhea (51.2%)，and culture (30%) were the main reasons for avoiding colostrum feeding. Butter and non-human milk were the commonest prelacteal feedings .\n\n【48】Discussion\n\n【49】In this study， 74%， 69.4%， and 56.2% of mothers had good knowledge， favorable attitude， andgood practice of colostrum feeding， respectively. The main reasons for colostrum avoidance were a belief that colostrum feeding causes abdominal pain and diarrhea and culture. About 26.9% of mothers initiate prelacteal feeding. Butter and non-human milk were the commonest prelacteal feedings.\n\n【50】In the current study，74%， CI (68.3-79.4) of mothers had good knowledge about colostrum.

About 73.8%of mothers in the Bench Maji Zone also had good knowledge of colostrum feeding 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. However， this was higher than the findings from Wolaita Zone 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u> which found that 66.1% of participants删除1换行were knowledgeable on colostrum feeding. This might be due to the differences in socioeconomic， culture， and study period. In the current study， 55% of mothers are urban residents compared to 48%in Wolaita Zone. This might increase access to information from various sources (mass media and campaigns). Further， the higher knowledge may be the result of health information dissemination and awareness creation done by the health extension workers in the study area.\n\n【56】On the otherhand， the result was lower than the study conducted in Mekelle city which showed that 89.7% of mothers had good knowledge about colostrum feeding 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. The variation maybe because of the differences in socio-cultural， geographical， and utilization of maternal health care services. In the current study， 53.8% of mothers had Antenatal Care (ANC) follow-up compared to 83% in Mekelle，60.9% have been counseled about colostrum during ANC follow-up compared to 86.7%， and 59.7% of mothers delivered in health institutions compared to 81.5% in Mekelle. The utilization of health services increases access to health education and promotion.\n\n【57】This study found that 69.4%， CI (64-74.5) of mothers had a favorable attitude towards colostrum feeding. This is similar to the studies done in Bench Maji Zone 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>， Mekelle 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>， and Wolaita Zone通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u> which reported that 69.7%， 67.2%， and 69.9% of mothers had a positive attitude about colostrum feeding， respectively. However，this result was lower than 89% in Harar town 通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u>. This discrepancy might be due to differences in the study setting， socio-cultural deference， and a better understanding of colostrum feeding among the study participants living in Harar city.\n\n【58】This study also assessed the practice of colostrum feeding by mothers and the finding showed that colostrum feeding is practiced by 56.2%， CI (51.9-60.3). WHO recommends every newborn baby to feed breast milk within 1 h of birth and feed colostrum. This was comparableto the study done in Mizan Tepi Teaching Hospital(60.8%)通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. A study from Debre Tabor 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u> showed that colostrum feeding is practiced by 74.4% of mothers which is higher than the current study. Similarly， it is lower than 72% in Pakistan 通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u> and 80.5% in Mekelle通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u>. The variation may account for sociodemographic differences and cultural beliefs. Debre Berhan communities are more bigoted for culture and religion. In addition， it may be due to variation in information access and utilization of maternal health care services including place of delivery.\n\n【59】According to this study， 43.8% of mothers avoid colostrum. About51.2% of mothers believe that colostrum causes abdominal pain and diarrhea and 29.9% of them believe that it is culturally forbidden. A study in Pakistan reflected a similar finding where 28% of mothers feel that colostrum is not milk， having harmful effects on child health and may cause diarrhea. Mothers prefer to feed water， honey， or herbal preparation in place of the colostrum 通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>. Similarly， in Mizan Tepi， 60.5% of mothers believe that colostrum harms both the mother and her newborns 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. A cross-sectional study in Bure identified the reasons for colostrum avoidance and found colostrum causes neonatal illness (2.3%)， is culturally forbidden (4%) and is very thick(2.7%)通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u>. Further， in the Raya Kobo district， untrained traditional birth attendants believed colostrum causes abdominal cramps and raw butter cleans an infant's stomach. They recommend discarding colostrum and fed raw butter before initiation of breastfeeding 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>. This could be due to low educational attainment and poor access to information and health care.\n\n【60】Table 4： Attitude of mothers towards colostrum feeding in North Shewa Zone， Ethiopia， 2021.\n\n| Variables  | Agree，n(%)  | Disagree， n(%)  | Neutral，n(%)  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Baby's do not like colostrum breast milk.  | 52(17.7)  | 214(73.8)  | 24(8.3)  |\n| Colostrum causes diarrhea for an infant.  | 111(38.3)  | 159(54.8)  | 20(6.9)  |\n| Colostrum makes the baby sick.  | 111(38.3)  | 159(54.8)  | 20(6.9)  |\n| Colostrum is a dirty part of milk.  | 121(41.7)  | 158(54.5)  | 11(3.9)  |\n| Colostrum milk is difficult to digest.  | 112(38.6)  | 160(55.2)  | 18(6.2)  |\n| Necessary to discard colostrum.  | 116(40.0)  | 161(55.5)  | 13(4.5)  |\n| Colostrum is forbidden in culture.  | 112(38.6)  | 151(52.1)  | 27(9.3)  |\n| Colostrum impairs growth and development.  | 93 (32.1)  | 166(57.2)  | 31(10.7)  |\n\n【62】Table 5： Practice of colostrum feeding in North Shewa Zone， Ethiopia， 2021.\n\n| Variable  | Category  | Frequency  | Percent  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Have you fed calastrum far your baby within the first three days of birth?  | Yes  | 163  | 56.2  |\n| Have you fed calastrum far your baby within the first three days of birth?  | No  | 127  | 43.8  |\n| Initiation of first breast milk  | Within one hour  | 98  | 60.1  |\n| Initiation of first breast milk  | Within six hours  | 42  | 25.8  |\n| Initiation of first breast milk  | After 24 hours  | 23  | 14.1  |\n| Reasons for not feeding colostrum  | Medical reason  | 5  | 3.9  |\n| Reasons for not feeding colostrum  | The baby can't suck  | 5  | 3.9  |\n| Reasons for not feeding colostrum  | Breast can't secrete  | 14  | 11.1  |\n| Reasons for not feeding colostrum  | Cause abdominal pain and diarrhea  | 65  | 51.2  |\n| Reasons for not feeding colostrum  | Culture  | 38  | 29.9  |\n| Prelacteal teeding  | Yes  | 78  | 26.9  |\n| Prelacteal teeding  | No  | 212  | 73.1  |\n| If yes， what did you give the baby?  | Non-human milk  | 26  | 33.3  |\n| If yes， what did you give the baby?  | Butter  | 41  | 52.6  |\n| If yes， what did you give the baby?  | Plain water  | 8  | 10.3  |\n| If yes， what did you give the baby?  | Water with sugar  | 78  | 3.8  |\n\n【64】Limitation of the Study\n\n【65】Participants may answer questions in a manner that would be viewed favorablyby others (Social desirability bias).

There is an increase pool of evidence that suggest a causal relationship between brain damage and heart dysfunction. It is at times difficult to ascertain whether the cardiac dysfunction seen in patients with acute ischemic stroke is triggered by the stroke or is the underlying cause ofthe stroke.\n\n【2】Case Studv\n\n【3】We present a 75-year-old African Arab male known hypertensive who was admitted with a history of sudden onset of right sided weakness and aphasia. He had normal vital signs except for tachycardia 119 beats per minute (bpm) and tachypnea (25b/m). Systemic examination was noted for prominent neck veins， a displaced apex at 6\"h intercostal space and apical grade III systolic murmur. The computed tomography scan of the head revealed an acute left basal ganglia infarct. An ECG done on the day of admission showed sinus tachycardia (139 bpm) with T-wave inversion in lateral leads. Other work ups included an Echocardiogram (ECHO) which showed： Dilated left atrium， dilated and hypertrophied left ventricle with an Ejection Fraction (EF) of 44%， elevated Troponins and BNP were also documented. On the 2nd day the patient became dyspnoeic and required oxygen support， a repeat ECG was remarkable for atrial fibrillations (162 bpm). Intravenous Furosemide40 mg b.i.d， Digoxin 0.25 mg o.d， Losartan 50 mg o.d， Aspirin 75 mg o.d and Atorvastatin 40 mg nocte were administered 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，2]</u>. Warfarin at a dose of 5 mg OD was also given (CHA2 DS2 VASc score of 6). On the fourth day he was doing better off oxygen support， chest was clear but was still tachycardic at a rate of 140 bpm. Propranolol at a dose of 40 mg b.i.d was added for rate control. He was discharged on the 74 day with a resting heart rate of 90 bpm.\n\n【4】Discussion\n\n【5】Cardiac dysfunction in the setting of acute stroke is not uncommon phenomenon. A number of cardiac complications have been reported after an acute stroke including heart attack， congestive heart failure， cardiac arrest and abnormal heart rhythm such as atrial fibrillation. This was the case in our patient who seems to have developed tachyarrhythmia (atrial fibrillation) and decompensated heart failure after an acute ischemic stroke. Many of the cardiac complications are preventable and thus early recognition and treatment can improve patients'outcomes.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

His diet consists of mangoes， papayas， oranges， cereals in industrial preparation for children， soda water. Clinically， he presented with anorexia， gastrointestinal disturbances in the form of vomiting and diarrhea. There was moderate dyspnea. He then benefited from two successive antibiotic therapies， the first of which consists of a Sulfonamide-Trimethoprim combination for seven days and the second of a synergistic combination of Amoxicillin and Clavulanic acid for a week. At the end of the three days of partial remission of the primate， he received therapy based on metronidazole.\n\n【13】Although the patient's condition improved， it was not satisfactory because the diarrhea and vomiting persisted. Then， he received a gastric dressing based on diosmectite and a reconstituting intestinal microbiota. On the day’s death， dyspnea aggravated and the emergency care based on dexamethasone treatment failed to save the patient life. Immediately following the death of this chimpanzee， the Abidjan (Cote dIvoire) zoo administration referred the primate to us in order to investigate the case.\n\n【14】Autopsy Findings\n\n【15】Externally， the subject was in a good condition but moderately dehydrated. Internally， there were interstitial mild hemorrhagic multifocal and moderate emphysematous pneumonia； diffuse congestive and catarrhal colitis with telangiectasia ， diffuse severe catarrhal enteritis； diffuse moderate to severe hepatic steatosis， mild to moderate and focal congestive myocarditis.\n\n【16】Parasitological Examinations\n\n【17】The fecal material of the subject was positive to Strongyloides stercoralis parasite with a parasitic load of 200 eggs per gram. Besides， the dead chimpanzee was positive to Ancylostoma duodenale parasite with a parasitic load of 150 eggs per gram of feces.\n\n【18】通用间距删除-1:<u>Citation：</u>\n\n【19】After these findings， halfpart of liver， lung， kidney， heart， spleen， small and large intestine have been fully dissected to check for Strongyloides stercoralis parasites . There were more than7 parasites (3 adult females and 4 larvae) in the large intestine， 6 (2 adult females， 4 larvae) in the small intestine， 7(2 adult females and 4 larvae) in the lung， 5 (2 adult females and 3 larvae) in the liver， and nothing in the heart， kidney or the spleen.

This immunosuppression is chiefly caused by long term and high dose of glucocorticoid treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. A few described conditions include inappropriate use of immunosuppressive drugs 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. In the current case， none of these etiologies could be valid. It is comprehensive删除1换行that immunosuppression condition if it is proven， could explain dissemination.Nonetheless， in the current case，there was no evidence of immunosuppression due to absence ofhypoplasia of lymph nodes. Yet， we recognize that the blood values have not been estimated during ante mortem in order to appreciate lasting leukopenia. It is a pathological process that initially affects the digestive function with a significant subsequent impact on the lungs (for the record， the chimpanzee grabbed his chest shortly before death)， liver and whose main etiology is Strongyloides stercoralis hyperinfection followed by its dissemination. The constitutions of thrombi in the lungs have not yet been described in this pathology. This fact could be explained by hemorrhagic lesions in lung that imply necrotizing vasculitis. But these thrombi that can cause thromboembolism are a serious factor. However， diffuse alveolar hemorrhage due to Strongyloides stercoralis hyperinfection has been substantiated in a recent human clinical hospitalized case 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. The skin dermis was highly parasitized. In our case，the responsibility of Ancylostoma duodenale in the dissemination of strongyloidiasis remains unknown. This is an unexplained and particular disseminated strongyloidiasis： There was neither evidenced immunosuppression nor lasting glucocorticoid treatment. Another lesson of this rare case is that human alimentary practices could be a major risk factor for Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Diseases (NAFLD) in captive Non-Human Primates (NHP).\n\n【39】Many chemicals that cause Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis(NASH) as well in human and animal model such as Paraquat， Atrazine， Simazine， and Arsenic 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u> are still used as herbicide or删除1换行crop chemicals. In many under developing countries， agriculture foods such as fruits that are sold before the end of withdrawal time-a delay that has to be observed after a crop chemical treatment in order to permit elimination of residues. Thus， the consumers including captive NHP become exposed for a long time.\n\n【40】In consequence， as far as NASH is becoming a public health concern in termsof its potential complications(cirrhosis， hepatocellular carcinoma， for instances)， its physiopathological relation with strongyloidiasis dissemination deserves to be addressed.\n\n【41】Final Diagnosis\n\n【42】Disseminated strongyloidiasis withNon-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis stage F1 of chimpanzee.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

The MLD patients clinically present with progressive psychomotor regression. ARSA and SapB protein deficiency ascribe to biallelic disease-causing mutations in the ARSA and PSAP genes， respectively.

In the diagnostic course it was found that the sciatic nerve was compressed by a Heterotopic Ossification (HO) of the greater trochanter.\n\n【2】The stretching lead to a dislocation of the nerve around the HO， which prevented the nerve to slip back in its anatomical position.\n\n【3】Operation was performed and the neurological symptoms diminished.\n\n【4】Keywords： Sciatic nerve compression； Peronaeus nerve palsy； Heterotopic ossification\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 41 year old patient presented to our Emergency Department (ED) after performing a stretching technique derived from Yoga with the name， Ardha Paschimottanasana\". During this exercise one of the legs is bend in the hip and knee joint in a sitting position so that the foot is placed on the medial aspects of the contralateral thigh. Next step is to bend the upper body above the thigh which leads to stretching of the hamstring muscles.\n\n【7】While performing this exercise the patient felt a sudden pain in her posterior thigh which resulted in the inability to extend her knee. The knee was locked in 70° flexion.\n\n【8】In the past she has been treated due to algophobia (fear of pain) and she was diagnosed with a somatic disorder. Other than that she repeatedly suffered from muscle cramps in the posterior thigh. No further relevant past medical history was present.\n\n【9】On admission in the ED3 days later she showed no pain in a relaxed position but still was not able to extend her knee. A passive movement of the knee was not possible because the patient felt uncomfortable and reported dysesthesia of her lower thigh and foot. A meniscal tear was assumed and a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)-scan was performed. There were no pathologic findings.\n\n【10】The patient was ambulating on crutches and Continuous Passive Motion (CPM) was applied. While walking her then expressed mild symptoms of sensory perineal nerve palsy.\n\n【11】A neurological examination was performed but did not show typical symptoms that could be associated with a nerve root injury or a peripheral injury of the perineal nerve. Knowing that the patient had a somatizing disorder (algophobia). The neurologist assumed an interference of her symptoms.\n\n【12】However an MRI-scan of the lumbar spine was obtained to rule out nerve root injury or compression， it also showed no significant pathologies. To prevent ongoing lack of motion of her knee joint it was extended under mild analgosedation. The knee showed free Range of Motion (ROM) under sedation. A knee brace was applied to keep the knee in an extended position. The following day she presented with a foot drop.\n\n【13】Once more we asked the neurologist for a detailed examination including a Nerve Conduction Study (NCS). The NCS showed pathologic signals indicating an acute sciatic nerve injury.\n\n【14】Mean while the patient mentioned that she had been diagnosed with a bony tumor in her proximal right femur. An MRI-scan of that area was obtained externally just a few weeks before. The MRI images were not available but the results were reported negative regarding any compression of the sciatic nerve.\n\n【15】The X-ray showed a heterotopic ossification of approx. 16 mm ×13 mm emerging from the posterior aspect of the greater trochanter.\n\n【16】An MRI-scan of the proximal femur showed significant swelling of the sciatic nerve and a dislocation from its anatomical position. The nerve was strained around the ossification and showed signs of acute hemorrhage.\n\n【17】The patient then was operated via Kocher-Langen beck approach and the ossification was removed.Intraoperativelythe nervepresented with elongation and hematoma but its continuity was preserved.\n\n【18】Once the ossification was resected the nerve slipped back into its anatomical position. It then was tested to remain in place while moving the hip and knee joint .\n\n【19】A few days after the operation the sensory function of the nerve started to recover mean while the drop foot remained.\n\n【20】The patient was discharged eight days later to a rehabilitation facility.\n\n【21】Discussion\n\n【22】A rare case of a locked knee and foot drop due to sciatic nerve compression is presented.\n\n【23】Peronaeus nerve palsy is common in trauma patients often caused by proximal fibular fractures or compartment syndrome.\n\n【24】However compression syndrome the sciatic nerve can also lead\n\n【25】These symptoms have different reasons. There are numerous case reports about compression syndromes caused by veins， pseudoaneurysms of the gluteal artery， heterotopic ossifications or hematoma following surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>[1-10]</u>.\n\n【26】The number of patients suffering from sciatic nerve palsy is unknown since most of the literatures are case reports only.\n\n【27】Correct interpretation of this patient's symptoms was difficult due to a known somatic disorder. She was sometimes comfortable with her situation and did not express any signs of severe pain， while few minutes later she was crying in bed due to unbearable pain not responding to any medication. As complicating factor she was diagnosed with a， bony tumor “possibly resulting from a fall a few years earlier. Unfortunately we did not get this information on admission. Retrospectively the patient reported periodic cramps and pain in her posterior thigh ongoing for several months. An MRI-scan of that area was performed externally shortly before was reported to show no signs of sciatic nerve compression at that time.\n\n【28】This might have been one of the reasons why we first did not focus on a possible nerve injury but rather on thelocked knee and the lower spine. Therefore the MRI of the pelvis and thigh was the last of three MRIs performed.\n\n【29】The symptoms were inconclusive and only the nerve conduction study objectified the injury of the sciatic nerve. Once it was diagnosed operation was performed immediately to decompress the nerve and to prevent long term symptoms11.\n\n【30】Conclusion\n\n【31】In cases with nerve palsy especially in young and healthy patients a thorough neurological examination and a nerve conduction study should be performed as soon as possible to differentiate between删除1换行central or peripheral causes.

In Pakistan alone the prevalence ofGDM is approximately12% of all pregnancies 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. GDM has been related with a multitude of factors that include genetic， epigenetic and environmental factors. Furthermore， GDM is associated with both short term and long-term complications and thereby causes a lot of stress to both the mother and the developing fetus. Stress in not only limited to physical stress but also extends to mental and psychological stress to the expecting mother and pregnant females with GDM are four times likely to develop psychological stress 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. In recent years the role of genetic factors in GDM 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u> and psychological and behavioral reactions have started to gain global attention 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. Genetic studies such as Genome Wide Studies (GWAS) have successfully lead to discoveries of Single-Nucleotide Polymorphisms(SNPs)， common genetic variants and new loci that are related to common complex diseases 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. Such studies along with meta-analysis， case-control analysis and linkage analysis have identified candidate genes in the etiology of both GDM 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u> and psychological stress disorders. However genetic studies that link GDM with psychological stress are less well studied. The aim of this review is to understand the association of genetic changes particularly single nucleotide polymorphisms common in females with GDM and pregnancy induced psychological stress.\n\n【2】Single Nucleotide Polymorphism\n\n【3】Polymorphisms are a form of genetic variation， which refers to the presence of two or more alternative forms of a distinct phenotype. This variation can occur in any morphological， physiological， and behavioral traits and can occur in both coding and non-coding regions of the DNA 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. Among these genetic variations the Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNP) are of the most common type occurring in about 90% of the observed differences in the genome. Another feature of a polymorphism is that the most abundant allele should be present in the population at a test frequency of 99% or less. Therefore the rare allele will present at a total frequency of at-least 1%通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>. Most SNPs occur in the non-coding regions of the human genome but about 50，000 SNPs have been estimated to occur in the coding region of the DNA called cSNP where they can alter protein structure. These SNPs are an important genetic variation as they can influence morphological， physiological and pathological traits thereby have relevance to disease mechanism 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u> as shown in Figure 1. Associations of these SNPs have been linked as risk factors to many diseases including both type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Establishing an association with the genetics can offer prediction of drug response and possibly develop a genome based diet that is safer to risked individual 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>.

It is the most common metabolic disturbance duringpregnancy. It is a multifactorial disease with a rising prevalence globally where both environmental and genetic factors play an important role in the pathogenesis of the disease and associated post pregnancy complications 通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u>. In a systemic review done by Zhang et al. have assessed multiple genes that are associated with GDM. Among these they identified seven genes that are very significantly associated with GDM. These are The minor alleles of Transcription Factor 7 Like 2 (TCF7L2)， Glucokinase删除1换行region. The SNPs in the coding region are further sub divided into synonymous or non-synonymous SNPs. The synonymous SNPs and Non-coding SNPs results in un-altered protein structure whereas as non-synonymous SNPs result in altered protein structure which contributes to the pathogenesis of the disease.\n\n【6】(GCK)， Potassium Inwardly Rectifying Channel Subfamily J Member11(KCNJ11)， CDK5 Regulatory Subunit Associated Protein 1 Like 1(CDKAL1)， Insulin Like Growth Factor 2 MRNA Binding Protein 2(IGF2BP2)， Melatonin receptor 1B (MTNR1B)， and Insulin Receptor Substrate 1 (IRS1). Among these TCF7L2 showed the strongest association with GDM risk 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>.\n\n【7】Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms in Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM)and Psychological Disorders\n\n【8】Gestational Diabetes Mellitus is a pregnancy related metabolic disorder characterized by glucose intolerance that was nonexistent prior to pregnancy 通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>. A diagnosis of GDM furthermore increases emotional distress， such as depression， anxiety or stressamong women. A study done by Lee et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u> showed that prevalence depression， anxiety and stress were 39.9%，12.5% and 10.6 % respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>. Pregnancy itself being a stressful condition the superimposed GDM along with stress results in further complications that could potentially lead to postpartum depression or diabetes mellitus post pregnancy. Multiple factors come into plays that contribute towards the development of stress and GDM however genetic factors play substantial role in the etiology of both psychological symptoms and GDM. In a recent review done by Yahya et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u> they identified about 83 candidate genes that were associated with GDM of which TCF7L2， MTNRIB， CDKALI， IRSI， and KCNQ1 are the most prevalent 通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u>. For the purpose of the review， we would only focus on these 5 major genes any overlap of these genes with psychological symptoms.\n\n【9】Transcription Factor7 Like 2\n\nGenetic studies have showed TCF7L2 is found to be the strongest determinant of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) in the human population. In a review done by Chang et al. encompassing 22 studies6 out of 8 common SNPs were found to be strongly associated with GDM where rs7903146，rs12255372 and rs790169 had the strongest association 通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u>. Furthermore In vivo studies showed that not only|删除段之间换行|TCF7L2 is associated with T2DM but is also related to altered behavior of the mice which was seen prior to the development of glucose intolerance 通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u>. This shows that TCF7L2 could potentially be associated with stress and GDM however further studies would be needed to make this association.\n\n【11】The Melatonin Receptor 1B (MTNRIB)\n\n【12】The Melatonin Receptor 1B (MTNR1B) is a newly identified candidate gene belonging to the class of G protein coupled receptors. Till date human genetic studies have identified many common variants of this gene associated with T2DM and GDM. Among these the polymorphism rs1387153 and rs10830963 was to be highly significant 通用删除6(英):<u>[6，21]</u> later being also found in placental tissues associated with increased risk of GDM 通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u>. However when rs10830963polymorphism was assessed for depressive symptoms in T2DM no correlation was found 通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u> but independently this polymorphism was associated with increased risk of Schizophrenia 通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u>.\n\n【13】The Cyclin-Dependent Kinase5(CDK5) Regulatory Subunit-Associated Protein1-Like 1(CDKALI)\n\n【14】The CDKAL1 is a member of the methylthiotransferase family encoded by CDKALI gene has been implicated in the development of T2DM 通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u> and GDM particularly the rs7754840 variant 通用删除6(英):<u>[25]</u>. Although this variant was not yet studied with respect to stress development multiple genetic variants of this gene were found to be associated with depressive symptoms with T2DM通用删除6(英):<u>[26]</u>.\n\n【15】Insulin Receptor Substrate IRS-1\n\n【16】Insulin receptor substrate-1iIsS：an important endogenous substrate of the insulin signaling pathway. Variants of this gene mainlyrs1801278 have been shown to be associated with both T2DM and GDM 通用删除6(英):<u>[27，28]</u>. Other variants of this gene particularly rs13411764and rs3820926 in the upstream region have found to be a risk factor for major depressive disorder 通用删除6(英):<u>[29]</u>. Though not linked via studies as a risk factor for stress in GDM the potential of IRS being involved删除1换行in GDM and variants having association with psychological illnesses could possibly serve as a question for future research studies.\n\n【17】Potassium Voltage-Gated Channel Subfamily QMember1(KCNQI)\n\n【18】The Potassium Voltage-Gated Channel Subfamily Q Member 1(KCNQ1) gene variants rs2237892， rs2237895， rs2283228， rs151290， and rs2074196， have been recently identified as a risk factor for the development of T2DM 通用删除6(英):<u>[30，31]</u>. Among these the variant rs2237892and rs2237895 were found to be associated with GDM in Chinese and Pakistani population respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>[32，33]</u>. Polymorphisms of this gene in relation to psychiatric disorders are not much studied KCNQ1 variant rs8234 was found to be associated with increased of Schizophrenia 通用删除6(英):<u>[34]</u>.\n\n【19】Studies Showing SNPS in Stress Related to GDM\n\n【20】Currently there are not many studies that have related SNPs associated with stress and GDM. A study done by Lee et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[35]</u>， have shown 14 genes associated with GDM and stress. These are NPY5R； ANO2； EPHX2； TPH2； NRGI； LHPP； FKBP5； SDK2； RORA； OXTR； BDNF； HTR2C； TEX51； and PLEKHG1 which are important candidates for various psychological disorders such as depression， anxiety and stress 通用删除6(英):<u>[35]</u>. In another study by Lin et al the authors investigated that association between gene polymorphisms， environment and psychological stress in GDM. The study included COMT， NPSR1， HSP90B1，HSP90AA2， FKBP5. Among these genes only NPSR1 (rs324981) T/T genotype was associated with reduced risk of psychological stress where as the other genes had no significant association 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>.\n\n【21】At present only two studies have shown associations of genetic variants with respect to stress and GDM. However， the candidate genes studied were mostly associated predominantly with stress and psychological disorders. This review further tried to link common candidate gene variants predominantly associated with GDM with potential relation to stress and therefore could serve as a basis for further studies.\n\n【22】Implications of Future Research\n\n【23】There is no any research work conducted in a local setting， highlighting the relationship of stress with GDM in background of genetic mutations. Thus； exploring the genetic profile of pregnant women is of paramount importance. Identifying the epigenetic mechanism of stress and GDM can benefit for sustainable long-term behavioral change measures to address the mental health of pregnant women. Further， the study will help the health providers treat the pregnant woman in a best suited way as well as to determine whether the new born to a woman will be predispose to psychological disorders in the future.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "86418280-fe9a-4962-82d5-f4fba669db58", "title": null, "text": "【0】Abstract\n\n【1】Early postoperative infection is an unusual complication of implant placement that can lead to bone resorption， inflammation， and ultimately implant failure. Treatment of such infections is still challenging in clinical work. An Erbium-doped Yttrium Aluminum Garnet (Er：YAG) laser is reported efficient in disinfection and decontamination. This case report describes a patient with early post-implantation infection that caused severe bone resorption in the right mandibular anterior region 2 months after the implant surgery. Complaint of pain was recorded. After reasonable decontamination and debridement using Er：YAG laser， Guided Bone Regeneration (GBR) was performed. Six months after the surgery， CBCT was taken which indicated that the infected implant achieved re-osseointegration and no lucency around the fixture. Debridement with Er：YAGlaser is promising in treating the infected implant.\n\n【2】Keywords： Er：YAG laser； Post-implantation infection； GBR\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Early infection after dental implantation is not a common complication. Factors are mainly related to patients'systemic problems， such as untreated diabetes and heavy smoking， technical problems such as bone overheating during drilling and inaccurate implant inserting， compromised operation sterility， and poor oral hygiene 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Severe and acute infection can result in alveolar bone resorption， implant exposure and osseointegration failure. Due to the excessive dense bone， the risk of early implantation failure was 2.7 times higher when implants were placed in the anterior mandibular region than in the posterior mandibular region 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. The wavelength of the Er：YAG laser is 2，940 um， which happens to be at the highest peak of water absorption， so it can be absorbed extraordinarily by water to produce a \"microexplosion\" effect. An Er：YAG laser can act on the deep of implant threads and produce less heat， so it is one of the ideal treatment modalities for decontamination and debridement of an infected implant and for promoting implant re osseointegration.\n\n【5】In this case report， by using Er：YAG laser for decontamination and debridement， the implant was saved with sufficient bone support. Favorable restorative results and excellent implant osseointegration were achieved.\n\n【6】Case Presentation\n\n【7】A 38-year-old female patient was received implant placement 2 months ago at mandibular right central incisor region. The patient suffered persistent swelling of the gingiva and pyorrhea with pain for about 1 months. No improvement was achieved after local irrigation with chlorhexidine. The patient denied a medical history with systematic disease， such as hypertension， diabetes and heart disease； no drug allergy； no bisphosphonate treatment； and no smoking.\n\n【8】A healing abutment was placed on the implant without mobility. The gingiva of the implant was showing hyperemia， swelling， and hemorrhage. A fistula was observed at the apical of the implant of the labial mucosa. Discomfort occurred when palpating the labial gingiva around the implant. CBCT images showed that the implant was present without the labial bone .\n\nUnder local anesthesia， a full-thickness flap was reflected to expose the implant. Labial bone was completely resorbed and the exposure of implant threads were observed. There was a large amount|删除段之间换行|Granulation tissue was completely removed with an Er：YAGlaser(parameter settings： SP， 80 mJ， 30 Hz， and water/air： 5/2). Infected implant surface decontamination and debridement were achieved with an Er：YAG laser (parameter settings： SP， 50 mJ， 30 Hz， and water/air： 5/2). After debridement， there was a bone defect in the distal area of the implant.\n\n【10】After decortication， bone graft (0.5 g， Bio-Oss， Geistlich) was filled into the bone defect. A resorbable collagen membrane (13mm x 25 mm， Bio-Gide， Geistlich was placed upon the bone graft. Wound closure without tension was achieved by interrupted sutures. Postoperative CBCT images showed that bone graft with a thickness of 2.2 mm was observed on the labial aspect of the implant. Two weeks after the operation， the surgical area healed uneventful without membrane exposure or obvious abnormal secretions. A Maryland Bridge was placed as a temporary prosthesis.\n\n【11】Six months after surgery， CBCT images revealed that there was new bone formation on the labial aspect of the implant， and the implant was achieved osseointegration. A screw retaining temporary prosthesis was made to shape the gingival soft tissue. After 3 months， the final prothesis was produced. X-ray images revealed that the crown was seated well. The patient was satisfied with the effect of therapy .\n\n【12】Results\n\n【13】At the 24-month follow-up， the implant prostheses showed good function and no noticeable soft-tissue recession was observed. The radiologic examination showed satisfactory preservation of marginal bone .\n\n【14】Discussion\n\n【15】The mandibular anterior region generally has the densest bone， mostly consisting of type I and II bone qualities 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. Although the primary stability of the implant is excellent in this region， but risk删除1换行of implantation failure was increased due to the friction and bone necrosis induced by high local temperature during surgical drilling通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. Studies have reported that when exposed to a temperature of47°C for half an hour， local osseous necrosis， soft tissue wrapping around the implant， and osseointegration failure can occur， so the area is more susceptible to bacterial infection 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. Sufficient bone， which can provide a rich blood supply to maintain the processes of regeneration and reconstruction of peri-implant bone， is required for the implant success. When the facial bone thickness was more than 2mm， bone loss of the implant decreased significantly通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. When labial bone thickness was insufficient， bone resorption was more likely to occur in the mandibular anterior region with dense bone and poor blood supply.\n\n【16】A large number of studies have shown that implants can still achieve re-osseointegration following localdebridementand decontamination ofthe infected implant 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. It was demonstrated that implants with smooth surfaces were more likely to re-osseointegrate than implants with rough surfaces 通用删除6(英):<u>[8-10]</u>. This may be due to the ease of decontamination of smooth implant surfaces. However， more bone regeneration was observed for implants with rough surfaces than that for implants with smooth surfaces when re-osseointegration occurred通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>. Therefore，how to achieve effective decontamination of implants with rough surfaces are urgently needed in the clinic.\n\n【17】At present， various methods， including mechanical curettes， ultrasonic devices， mechanical sandblasting， titanium brushes and irrigation with chlorhexidine， are commonly used for implant surface decontamination. The wavelengthoftheEr：YA Glaser is the same as the highest peak of water absorption，producing a\"microexplosion\"effect for tissue cutting， debridement and sterilization， which causes little damage to the implant. In vitro experiments showed that， compared with other mechanical methods， the Er：YAG laser had the best decontamination effect on the rough surface of the implants because Er：YAG laser light can irradiate the deep areas of the threads 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>. Animal study has demonstrated that an Er：YAG laser can effectively treat infected implants and promote implant osseointegration 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>. In a prospective clinical cohort study， 20 patients with peri-implantitis were treated with an Er：YAG laser (initial settings of 50 mJ and25 pps). After 1 year of treatment， CBCT images revealed that the infrabony defects around the implants disappeared 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>. However， different Er：YAG laser parameters had different effects on the implant. The application of a high-level Er：YAG laser (150mJ/10 Hz) decreased the proliferative ability of osteoblasts on the SLA surface通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u>. The application of an Er：YAG laser (80 mJ/20 Hz) changed the surface topology structure of implants with SLA surface 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>. Low energy level of Er：YAG lasers (50 mJ， 60 mJ， 120 mJ) were sufficient for debridement and decontamination of the implant surface 通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>. Moreover，Er：YAGlasers had different therapeutic effects on implants with different surfaces 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>.\n\n【18】Conclusion\n\n【19】Decontamination and debridement with an Er：YAG laser were promising in treating the infection of the implant. Satisfactory therapeutic effects were obtained in a short period oftime，but further review is still needed in the long term especially for the optimum parameters of the Er：YAG laser.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

Despite treatment with piperacillin/tazobactam he developed signs of sepsis accompanied by chest pain and orthopnea. The echocardiogram revealed a significant pericardial effusion (end-diastolic echo free space： 2.2 cm) ， located mainly at the posterior and lateral wall of the left and at the free wall of the right ventricle， so colchicine and intravenous methylprednisolone were initiated. Because of deterioration in his clinical status and incipient tamponade signs an echo-guided pericardiocentesis was attempted. The fluid had high viscosity， a yellow-brown color and a curd-like appearance， resembling pus . A pig-tail catheter was inserted into the pericardium and used for drainage of the fluid； however there was no free flow， so aspiration was only possible with the use ofsyringes. Thorax and abdomen CT scans were performed to verify catheter’s correct intrapericardiac position and to exclude an extracardiac site of infection， (Supplementary Video of the CT scan). The analysis of the fluid confirmed it as pus and both blood and fluid cultures were positive for Staphylococcus aureus. Antibiogram-guided， treatment with oxacillin resulted in severe leukopenia and thrombocytopenia thus substituted by ceftriaxone. The hematological side effects gradually subsided and after three weeks the patient was discharged， totally ameliorated with no pericardial effusion.\n\n【3】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Correspondence： Keywords： Computed tomography； Pericarditis； Pericardiocentesis； Pus； Staphylococcus</u>\n\n【4】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Afendoulis Dimitrios， Department</u>\n\n【5】通用结尾删除-1:<u>of Cardiology，“Skylitseio”General Hospital of Chios， El Venizelou Str.

Genotyping is an essential tool to predict the outcome of better treatment and control of this infection. 50 samples from patients with HCV infection within the ages from 20 to65 years were collected. HCV Ab ELISA kit was used for the detection of virus in the samples which tested 43 patients HCV RNA positive. Maximum viral load detected in patients was 9.4×10IU/mL and the minimum quantity of viral load was 1.2×105 IU/mL. The major mode of transmission of virus which caused hepatitis in patients included unsafe blood transfusion， use of unsterile needles and dental instrument. In our study 37 patients were detected with 3a genotype， 2 with 1a genotype and genotype of 4 patients was untypable. Further analysis of these patients’ genotype by Real-Time PCR revealed that they were also infected by 3a genotype. Overall assessment showed that genotype 3a is the most prevalent genotype affecting 95% patients followed by 1a. Only males were infected by genotype 1a due to travelling to neighbor countries. Comparative analysis on genotyping methodologies suggests that Real-Time PCR has advantage over traditional PCR. Conventional PCR is less effective method because of its poor resolution，less sensitivity and risk of contamination. It is time consuming process and yield results at the end point of reaction. In contrast， Real-Time PCR has enhanced rapidity， reproducibility， sensitivity and the reduced risk of contamination. In addition， it can resolve 95% of HCV genotypes and can provide data at exponential growth phase of the reaction.\n\n【2】Keywords： Hepatitis C virus； HCV-RNA； Genotyping； Real-Time PCR\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Viral hepatitis is one of leading killers across the globe since 1989. Hepatitis C virus is a blood borne virus and mainly affects the function ofliver causingacute or chronicliver diseases 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Patients developing cirrhosis have high risk of HCC (1% to 4% per year) prompting liver transplantation. HCV is considered second most common cause of viral hepatitis 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. On the basis of Phylogenetic analysis of nucleotide sequences， multiple genotypes and subtypes of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) have been recognized 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. Common subtypes that cause disease are la， 1b， 2a，2b，3a，3b，4，5a，6a.\n\n【5】WHO reported that globally 3.3% people are HCV infected and causes 700，000 deaths annually? The prevalence of HCV varies by region. HCV prevalence is lower (<2%) in regions of Western Europe， the Americas and Australia. Areas of African and the eastern Mediterranean have highest percentage of HCV prevalence 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. Country with the highest prevalence of HCV in the world is Egypt， having more than 14% infected people 通用删除6(英):<u>[5，6]</u>. Estimates show that prevalence in Asia is about2% but it differs greatly between individual countries 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. As Mongolia shows the highest HCV prevalence which is above 10%， Uzbekistan and Pakistan are next having 6% of total population infected with HCV 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. Data on the HCV prevalence in Pakistan shows that it is highly endemic， infecting almost 6.8% population of the country. Most common HCV genotype is 3a which continues to infect almost 61.3% people in Pakistan. However， recently the frequency of subtype2a has increased in few areas of Pakistan. Subtype 2a was most common in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa infecting 17.3% population and in Sindh provinces infecting 11.3% of the total population 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>.\n\n【6】Incredible advancement has been made over the previous years in explaining the structure and function of the Hepatitis C Infection (HCV) proteins， a large portion of which are currently effectively being sought after as antiviral targets. Discovered in 1989 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>， HCV is a small enveloped virus with approximately 10 kb long plus-sense， single stranded RNA genome. It belongs to the Hepacivirus genera of Flaviviridae family 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>. Hepatitis C contains one long Open Reading Frame(ORF) which encodes for a non-functional polyprotein of approximately 3，000 to 3，010 amino删除1换行acids. This non-functional polyprotein is cleaved by signal peptidase， cellular and viral encoded proteases to yield at least 10 different viral protein products. Structural proteins which forms the viral particle， are encoded in the 5'N-terminal part of ORF and include C，E1，E2and P7， whereas the non-structural proteins are encoded in the 3part of the ORF in the order NS2， NS3，NS4A， NS4B， NS5A， NS5B通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>. HCV enters the cells through endocytosis after binding to particular receptors. The viral genome is translated into a precursor polyprotein subsequent to uncoating， and viral RNA is incorporated by a virus encoded polymerase complex. Newly synthesized viral particles are discharged into endoplasmic reticulum and are secreted from cell passing through Golgi apparatus 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>. Epidemiological studies revealed that the spread of HCV in Pakistan is through different modes of transmission which include blood transfusion， sexual activity， and intravenous drug abuse， unsafe use of needles， non-sterile dental instruments and hemodialysis 通用删除6(英):<u>[13-16]</u>. HCV also spreads through non-sexual household contacts， ear piercing， tattoos， and use of community barber shops 通用删除6(英):<u>[17-19]</u>.\n\n【7】Medical and public health literature in detail on the prevalence of HCV in Pakistan has been reviewed by scientists for long period. In order to decrease burden of HCV in Pakistan awareness programs are required targeting rural areas. Different genotypes of HCV have specific drug sensitivity according to which the therapy is recommended 通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u>.\n\n【8】There is currently no licensed vaccine for HCV， which is a worldwide health issue， recently infecting 3 to 4 million people annually. In present HCV vaccine approaches include peptide， plasmid DNA， recombinant proteins and vector-based vaccines. HCV treatment is based on pegylated-Interferon-a (IFNa) and the nucleoside analogue ribavirin， which is expensive， toxic， prolonged(24 to 48 weeks) and leads to a Sustained Virological Response (SVR) in only 50% to 60% of patients， depending on the infecting genotype通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u>.\n\n【9】The aim ofour study was to evaluate and comparetheperformance features of two currently available HCV RNA quantification procedures including Real-time PCR based assays and conventional PCR based assays. Real-Time PCR methods are sensitive with lower limits of detection/quantification on the order of 10 to 15 HCV RNA International Units (IU)/ml， and are not prone to carryover contamination. It is done to identify the genotypes circulating in Pakistan and to determine the suitability of the HCV genomic region for routine determination of HCV genotypes. The Abbott Real-time HCV assay was used to evaluate the genotype and then it was compared to the conventional PCR method. The intrinsic and clinical performances of the recently developed Abbott m2000 real-time PCR system for HCV RNA quantification， which uses the automated Extractor m2000sp and the m2000rtdevice for automated real-time PCR amplification and detection of PCR products is examined.\n\n【10】Materialand Methods\n\n【11】Serological diagnosis\n\n【12】In order to diagnose HCV infection， plan antiviral treatment programs and evaluate virological response to antiviral therapy， serological and virological tests play a key role. Serological diagnosis of HCV infection is based on two categories of laboratory tests， namely serologic assays detecting specific antibody to HCV (anti-HCV) (indirect tests) and， molecular assays that can detect， quantify， or characterize the components of HCV viral particles， such as HCV\n\n【13】RNA and determine HCV genotype (direct tests) prior to sample collection diagnosis of patients was done. ELISA was performed to test positive antibodies to HCV.HCV-RNA detection in plasma was carried out by Qualitative RT-PCR (Abbott m2000rt) with lower limit of detection of 50 IU/ml\n\n【14】Sample collection\n\n【15】In the present study 3cc blood was collected from 50 patients with detectable HCV RNA using disposable syringes. Blood samples were properly labeled with patient’s name and Lab ID number for convenient analysis. Blood was transferred into EDTA coated vacutainer. In our study 43 patients out of 50 were tested positive for HCV， on which further diagnosis was performed.\n\n【16】Plasma separation\n\n【17】Samples were left at room temperature before centrifugation. The sample was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 15 min and 750 ml of plasma was collected. Plasma was carefully stored at -80°C to avoid contamination until further use.\n\nRNA extraction by Abbott m2000sp： The automated steps of the extraction system include sample and reagent pipetting， heating and incubation， magnetic capture and washing， and elution， all of which are optimized in ready-to-use protocols|删除段之间换行|1. Sample is prepared for the extraction and concentration of RNA molecules to help amplification of target region and removal of potential inhibitors from the sample.\n\n【19】2. The Abbott m2000sp instrument prepares samples for the Abbott Real-time HCV assay using the Abbott mSample Preparation System reagents.\n\n3. The Abbott m2000sp uses magnetic particle technology to attach nucleic acids and particles are washed to remove unbound components from the sample|删除段之间换行|4. The bound nucleic acids are eluted and transferred to a 96deep-well plate. The nucleic acids are then prepared for amplification.\n\n【21】5. The IC (Internal Control) is placed through the complete sample preparation procedure along with the calibrators， controls， and specimens.\n\n【22】Amplification master mix：\n\n【23】1. The Abbott m2000sp instrument automatically assembles the amplification master mix (HCV Oligonucleotide Reagent， Thermostable rTth Polymerase Enzyme， and Activation Reagent) and then transfers aliquots of the master mix to the Abbott 96-Well Optical Reaction Plate.\n\n【24】2. Nucleic acid samples are then transferred into the Abbott96-Well Optical Reaction Plate by the Abbott m2000sp from the Abbott 96 Deep-Well Plate.\n\n【25】3. The plate is fixed by the user with an Abbott Optical Adhesive Cover and set into the Abbott m2000rt instrument for PCR amplification and fluorescence detection.\n\n【26】Amplification：\n\n【27】1. During the amplification reaction on the Abbott m2000rt， the target RNA is transformed to cDNA by the activity of reverse transcriptase of the thermostable rTth DNA polymerase.\n\n【28】2 HCV and IC reverse primers anneal to their particular删除1换行targets and are extended during a prolonged incubation period.\n\n【29】3. After incubation， the temperature of the reaction is raised above meltingpoint of double stranded cDNAleading to denaturation step： RNA product， a second primer anneals to the cDNA strand and is extended by the DNA polymerase activity of the rTth enzyme to create a double-strandedDNA product.\n\n【30】4. During each round of thermal cycling， amplification products dissociate to single strands at high temperature allowing primer annealing and extension as the temperature is lowered.\n\n【31】5. Exponential amplification of the product is achieved through continual cycling between high and low temperatures， resulting in a billion-fold or greater amplification oftarget sequences.\n\n【32】6. Amplification of both targets (HCV and IC) takes place simultaneously in the same reaction.\n\n【33】Quantitation：\n\n【34】1. Quantitation of HCV RNA concentration of samples and controls requires a calibration curve.\n\n【35】2. Two assay calibrators are run in replicates of three to generate a calibration curve. The calibration curve slope and intercept are calculated from the assigned HCV RNA concentration and the median observed threshold cycle for each calibrator and are stored on the instrument.\n\n【36】3.

Shift in删除1换行percentages from lower to higher in these areas as compared to conventional PCR results is due to detection of untypable genotype with genotype 3a by Real-time PCR.\n\n【107】HCV viral load\n\n【108】Patients were categorized according to viral load into six groups ranging from 100000-100000000. Maximum viral load detected in patients was 9.4×10'IU/mL and the minimum quantity of viral load was 1.2 ×10 IU/mL. Analysis of our data showed that greater number of patients were in the category of viral load ranging from>10000000 IU/mL to 50000000 IU/mL .\n\n【109】Comparison of conventional PCR and real-time PCR\n\n【110】Through statistical analysis it was observed that genotypes of patients that were identified as Untypable (9.3%) by conventional PCR were detected with genotype 3a by Real-time PCR. Percentage of genotype 3a patients (86%) detected through conventional PCR shifts to 95% when detected through Real-time PCR .\n\n【111】Discussion\n\n【112】Hepatitis C virus is one ofthe leading causes of death and disabil ity worldwide and also getting endemic in many parts of Pakistan because very limited data on the genotyping of HCV has restricted the treatment of patients. In this study， we compared conventional PCR and Real-Time PCR genotyping methodologies of HCV to evaluate their efficiency to diagnose genotype of HCV patients.\n\n【113】In our study percentage of HCV genotype 3 was observed higher(95.3%) than genotype 1a (5%). It is proven in other studies done by通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>， which claimed that 3a genotype is the major genotype in Pakistan followed by la genotype. Also in our study genotype 1a was second major genotype.\n\n【114】The predominance of genotype 3a in Pakistan is a good hope as it requires short duration of treatment and control of hepatitis C than genotype 1a 通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u>. The occurrence of HCV 3 genotype in our population confirmedthe occurrence ofHCV genotype in neighboring countries including China， Iran， Afghanistan and India. In the west， Baluchistan shares a long border with Iran where genotype la and3a are most prevalent. It is reported that there is the high prevalence of genotype 3a and 1b in China 通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u>. So， it is quite possible that other genotypes and subtypes can be transferred from surrounding countries to Pakistan. In our study， only males were infected by HCV genotype 1a while all females were infected by genotype 3a. High percentage of genotype la in males is due to traveling in neighboring countries in search of jobs， trade and developing career opportunities通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u>. Shifts in HCV genotype distribution needs to be noticed as it删除1换行is an alarming signal to take major steps to reduce infections caused by other genotypes because genotype la and 4a are responsible for severe cirrhosis.\n\n【115】We compared the results of conventional PCR with Real-time PCR results. Those patients whose genotype was untypable were detected with 3a by Real-time PCR. This proved that Real-time PCR is accurate method that can detect each genotype infecting a patient.Real-time PCR in contrast to conventional PCR is rapid and reproducible method for the assessment of Hepatitis C virus load and genotype in serum samples. Quantitative PCR method such as regular or conventional PCR detects viral load and measures amplification product at the final phase of the reaction 通用删除6(英):<u>[25]</u>. Similar study suggests that at the exponential phase ofPCR the quantity of product is directly proportional to the initial number of template copies. As the reaction reaches plateau phase this correlation is lost. In contrast to regular PCR， Real Time PCR allows the detection and accurate knowledge of amplification product in every cycle of the reaction. Measuring kinetics at exponential phase allows the samples to be analyzed before reaction approaches the plateau phase 通用删除6(英):<u>[26]</u>.\n\n【116】In regular PCR， the end point varies from sample to sample and gel is insensitive to detect these variabilities， while Real-Time PCR is sensitiveenough to detect them. Moreover，conventionalPCR method is sophisticated， labor intensive and results are obtained within many days， also gel resolution is poor about ten folds. Whereas，Real-Time PCR is a speedy process and results can be obtained within hours and it can detect as little as two-fold change 通用删除6(英):<u>[27]</u>.\n\n【117】Conclusion and Future Recommendations\n\n【118】Our study reveals the clinical significance of genotyping of HCV patients and the accurate methods for the assessment of viral load. It is hoped that this study will help clinicians to find precise viral load in HCV positive patients and manage a better treatment plan based on correct and reliable genotyping of patients. In this we have observed that 95% of patients are infected with genotype 3a and only5% patients were infected with genotype 1a. This data shows that genotype 3a is common in Pakistan's population which can be timely treated. Furthermore， it is clear from these results that Real-Time PCR was more accurate and reliable method for HCV genotyping and measuring the amplified product.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

Molecular testing for the pathognomonic t(x； 18) chromosomal translocation has enabled diagnostic confirmation in approximately 90% of cases通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. In t(x； 18) negative cases， diagnosis must rely on histologic and immunophenotypic features. The differential diagnosis of primary pulmonary synovial sarcoma is particularly challenging when histologic features unusual to synovial sarcoma， but common to other neoplasms are focally present. This challenge is compounded with negative t(x； 18) findings. We present a case ofprimary pulmonary synovial sarcoma where unusual histology was present and t(x； 18) was negative. We offer diagnostic pearls to prevent misdiagnosis in such challenging cases.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 49 year old female presented with chest pain and shortness of breath with no significant medical or family history.

Incorrect kinase signaling causes cancer， developmental， and metabolic problems. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors are effective in cancer treatment and growth. Drug development is hampered by TKI-induced drug resistance. Understanding how TKs cause sickness and drugs to stop working will boost TKI research. Protein kinases regulate complicated bioprocesses. This involves cell growth， cell death， and cell division. 2% of human genes encode 518 kinases. 90 tyrosine kinases 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Since the discovery of v-Src as a protein kinase in 1978， it has been recognized that dysregulated kinase signaling is at the root of many human disorders， including cancers， developmental， and metabolic issues. Since v-identification， Src's been a protein kinase. Protein kinase inhibitors are sought for medical use. Imatinib， a tyrosine kinase ABL inhibitor， was developed to treat CML in 2001. When the BCL-ABL mutation causing CML was found， Imatinib was produced (CML). This therapeutic technique targets mutations that induce oncogene production to stop tumor growth. Clinical trials found many more tyrosine kinase inhibitors beneficial. Sorafenib 通用删除7(英):<u>(2005)</u>， Sunitinib 通用删除7(英):<u>(2006)</u>， Pazopanib 通用删除7(英):<u>(2009)</u>， and Axitinib 通用删除7(英):<u>(2012)</u> all go after mutant EGFRs in NSCLC (NSCLC).\n\n【15】This targeted treatment responds well. Drug resistance reduces response duration. Clinical cancer genome sequencing reveals medication resistance genes. Intrinsic drug resistance alters the drug's target； extrinsic resistance avoids its effects (compensatory signaling through other pathways and pharmacokinetic factors that primarily reduce drug concentration in targeted cells). Amplification， overexpression， epigenetic activation， and missense mutations may render kinase inhibitors ineffective. Mismatch mutations induce intrinsic resistance 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. Medication therapy induces clonal growth of treatment-resistant cancer cells 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. Proteins involved in drug interactions or kinase activation often have drug-resistant point mutations. These alterations reduce the drug's binding affinity but don't affect the ATP substrate's interaction with the targeted kinase. Different drug-resistant kinases have similar hotspots.\" drug-resistant Commonly， gatekeepers mutate.ABLT315I is associated with CML， PDGFRT674I/M with hypereosinophilic syndrome， EGFRT790M with NSCLC， KITT670I with gastrointestinal stromal tumors， and ALKL1196M with NSCLC. ATP binding affinity， catalytic power， and conformational change are increased by most gatekeeper mutations. Mutant Gatekeeper resistance needs dormant kinases. This compensates for the increased energy required to switch from the disease-driven active to inactive conformation if the inhibitor targets the inactive conformation. increasing molecular weight， lipophilicity， and drug-like characteristics. New chemical entities should target mutant kinase activity.\n\n【16】Dasatinib 通用删除7(英):<u>(2006)</u>， nilotinib 通用删除7(英):<u>(2007)</u>， bosutinib 通用删除7(英):<u>(2012)</u>， and ponatinib 通用删除7(英):<u>(2012)</u> are strong ABL kinase inhibitors. Wild-type and mutant ABL kinases are inhibited. Imatinib， nilotinib， and ponatinib support ABL kinase. Trifluoromethyl improves nilotinib's effectiveness against native and mutant ABLs， except ABLT315I. Ponatinib is the only ABL inhibitor that works against ABLT315I. It substitutes the pyrimidinylamino linker with an acetylene group， which enhances interaction with I315. Dasatinib and nilotinib occupy space near the gatekeeper region， so they may alter the ABLT315I mutant's active conformation， lowering its blocking ability. Active conformation ABL inhibitors may help CML patients who relapse after TKI treatment.\n\n【17】Imatinib and second- and third-generation ABL inhibitors pave the path for targeted kinase inhibitors and TKI resistance treatment. In 2011， crizotinib (PF-02341066) was authorized for late-stage NSCLC patients with the EML4-ALK fusion gene. Crizotinib-treated patients develop treatment resistance， similar to imatinib-treated individuals. ALK gene amplification， secondary mutations like EML4-ALKL1196M， and c-KIT/EGFR activation are resistance mechanisms 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. ALK inhibitors are beneficial for crizotinib-naive and -refractory ALK+ NSCLC patients (NSCLC).\n\n【18】LDK378 and alectinib inhibit natural and mutant ALKproteins better than crizotinib，approved in 2011. ALK inhibitors include crizotinib， LDK378 and alectinib. These ALK inhibitors interact variably with the ALK gatekeeper region， causing varying L1196M sensitivity. LDK378is 3 to 6 times more potent than crizotinib. Crizotinib-relapsed ALK-positive patients showed a 60% response rate and an 8.5-month median PFS. Imatinib and crizotinib are low-cellular-activity kinase inhibitors. In refractory patients， second-generation inhibitors are virtually as effective as the first. Sequential therapy involves following a less effective kinase inhibitor with a second-generation， broad-spectrum inhibitor.\n\n【19】Next-generation EGFR inhibitors for NSCLC patients resistant to gefitinib or erlotinib capture disease-driven kinase conformation. Even though afatinib suppresses EGFR by covalently attaching to the ATP binding site， the drug-resistant T790M mutant favors the active conformation. Like ATP， Afatinib inhibits EGFR. Afatinib cannot connect to T790M mutant EGFR because it is in the incorrect conformation. AZD-9291 and CO-1686 use a pyrimidine scaffold to reduce gatekeeper-related structural features while increasing G-loop interactions. In phase I studies for EGFR TKI-resistant patients， both AZD-9291 and CO-1686 were effective.\n\n【20】Reversible EGFR inhibitors that target EGFRT790M will help EGFR TKI-refractorypatients. Protein kinases are cancer treatments. Protein kinase inhibitors comprise 50% of cancer drug research 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. One or a few TKs seem crucial to the development of many cancers. Mutant TK-targeting TKIs should target cancer cells selectively and improve patient safety. Both the development oftargeted medications and the clinical treatment of advanced malignancies will face obstacles due to intratumor heterogeneity and tumor adaptability. TKIs and TKI combinations should have anti-tumor effects. As resistances molecular rrooiutes are recognized， new strategies are evolving. Inhibitors must target distinct kinase active site topographies to circumvent drug resistance. This effective protease design method may lead to chronic cancer therapy.\n\n【21】Cancer and other disorders include protein kinases. Lahiry et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u> showed that 50 kinases form 67 single-gene clinical entities， and half are TKs 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. Kinase gene mutations cause illness. Mutations induce neurologic，skeletal，craniosynostosis，hematological，vascular， immunological，endocrine， and metabolic disorders. Tofacitinib is the first TKI authorized for inflammatory disorders. Despite 30 kinase inhibitors reaching commercialization and hundreds in clinical research， structural variation and target coverage are restricted. If we knew how protein kinases work and how they malfunction in diseases， we may have discovered unmet medical needs. Current kinase inhibitors may be improved in structural diversity， selectivity， and toxicity. Non-oncology and combination cancer therapies need high-quality TKIs. Effective， selective， and safe TKIs need further structural biology and medicinal chemistry research.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

The patient's case was studied 13 months after DC through high-resolution CT， assessing brain， skull and scalp data， that were used for virtual Three-Dimensional (3D) analysis and planning， in order to produce hypoprojected PEEK implants that prevented both an excessive tension on the severelyscarred scalp and an excessive intracranial dead space. The patient was treated with a one-stage cranioplasty that reconstructed 208 cm’ of the cranial vault while obtaining tensionless scalp closure； a total of 46cm² of skull surface in the lower temporal areas were left unreconstructed as they could work as a warning sign for the rise of ICP in case of swelling. The 12-months follow-up showed satisfactory aesthetic and structural results.\n\n【3】Discussion： Whether it’s for treatment of the syndrome of the trephined or for aesthetic purposes， the need to reconstruct calvarial defects remains a challenge， especially for very large defects (>150cm’) which are rarely described in literature. To overcome the potential intra- and extracranial complications to the procedure， available surface-guided CAD-CAM programming represents an optimal solution.\n\n【4】Conclusion： In this report， use ofundercorrection in planning and finalizing subtotal custom-made cranioplasty， appears able to restore skull integrity and aesthetics while avoiding excessive skin tension and reducing intracranial dead space.\n\n【5】Keywords： Cranioplasty； Subtotal cranioplasty； Custom-made cranioplasty； Decompressive craniectomy； Traumatic brain injury\n\n【6】Introduction\n\n【7】In cases of large skull defects， reconstruction currently represents a necessity， with the aim to provide structural protection for the underlying brain， a barrier against infection， and the solution to correct aesthetic deformities 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. These skull defects are frequently the result of Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) -related Decompressive Craniectomy (DC)； in other cases， craniectomy is performed due to intracranial aneurysm， Arteriovenous Malformations (AVM)， cerebral abscess， ischemic stroke-related cerebral edema， and tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>.\n\n【8】Since ancient history， great efforts have been made to solve the problem of skull defects， but it was only after World War I that cranioplasties were performed in greater number 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. Between the reasons that support reconstruction， the main one is undoubtedly the treatment of the Syndrome of the Trephined 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u> which consists in the rapid neurological deterioration while changing the posture of the patient is specific positions (from orthostatic to horizontal or Trendelenburg position)， together with modifications of Cerebral Blood Flow (CBF) and Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF). In these patients， cranioplasty has a therapeutic effect in preventing these sudden neurological symptoms by avoiding the flaccid scalp portion covering the cranial defect from being sensitive to atmospheric pressure， causing direct force over the cortex 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. Thanks to the vast knowledge of materials and design refinements while programming a Computer-Aided Design and Computer-\n\n【9】Aided Manufacturing (CAD-CAM) cranioplasty， it is now possible to perform subtotal cranioplasties， although uneventful results still represent a challenge. This work has been reported in line with the Scare Criteria 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>.\n\n【10】Case Presentation\n\n【11】Informed written consent was obtained from the patient’s legal guardian for the writing and publication of this case report. A22-year-old patient was sent to the Emergency Room of our IIIlevel University Hospital 1 h after a 7-meter fall from a roof while working. Neurological examination assessed a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 6， and the patient underwent a brain CT scan  that showed bilateral cerebral swelling with multiple cerebral contusions and a suspected intracranial right carotid artery rupture.\n\n【12】He was transferred to the emergency operating room and under general anesthesia， he underwent right temporoparietal DC. After 24 h， the patient’s Intracranial Pressure (ICP) was still high(23 mmHg) and a left temporoparietal DC was performed . The patient’s Glasgow Coma Scale score was 6 on postoperative day 11 and continued until discharge. Due to the trauma， the patient suffered irreversible traumatic brain damage， and despite the DC， a long-term outcome of Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS-E)=2 was assessed.\n\n【13】The patient suffered 3 episodes of skin flap dehiscence along different parts of the surgical incisions， that healed by secondary intention with the aid of medicated dressings.\n\n【14】A High-Resolution CT of the craniomaxillofacial complex was acquired (Siemens SOMATOM Definition AS+， Siemens， Erlangen， Germany)， assessing both the brain and the skull data ， which were processed using Materialise's Interactive Medical Image\n\n【15】Control System 10.0 (Materialise， Leuven， Belgium).\n\n【16】All data regarding the surface of preoperative and postoperative cranial defect were acquired， together with the scalp surface and the intracranial dead space between the brain and the scalp. Using this data， 16 months after decompressive craniotomy， the patient underwent bilateral Polyether Ether Ketone (PEEK) custom-made cranioplasty (implants were fabricated by 3dific， Perugia， Italy) for the skull defect along the original incision approach . After discharge， the patient was checked at the 1-week， 2-weeks 1-month， 6and 12 months clinical and radiological follow-up.\n\n【17】The data details regarding the area of skull surface reconstructed\n\n| Skull surface before DC  | 651 cm²  | Skull surface after DC  | 397 cm²  | Skull surface after cranioplasty  | 605 cm²  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Scalp surface before DC  | 686 cm2  | Scalp surface after DC - multiple flap dehiscenceevents  | 663cm2  | Scalp surtace after cranioplasty  | 664 cm2  |\n|  | /  | /  | /  | Total area reconstructed  | 208 cm²  |\n|  |  | 7  | /  | Area left unreconstructed  | 46 cm2  |\n\n【19】Discussion\n\n【20】Under the circumstances of brain insults， such as trauma or intracranial hemorrhage， inflammatory cascade， impaired osmolyte transport and oxidative stress， combined to the eventual direct injury， lead to serious brain swelling and subsequent damage 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. It is not a coincidence， in fact， that the first neurosurgical operation performed was indeed a trephination， performed by the Incas over 3000 years ago，probably with the purpose to treat the consequences of a trauma. However， we will have to wait the sixteenth century to see the first description of a cranioplasty， done by a Flemish physician named Fallopius 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>.\n\n【21】In modern times， treatment of such harmful events as TBI\n\n【22】However， whether it’s for treatment of the syndrome of the trephined or for aesthetic purposes， the need to reconstruct calvarial defects remains a challenge， especially for very large defects (>150cm) which are rarely described in literature.\n\n【23】Historically， replacement of the patient's stored autologous bone flap has represented the first-line treatment for reparation of post-decompressive skull defects， usually taking place between 6 and 12months after surgery. However， complications like bone resorption， infection or chronic scalp wounds can result in a composite skull defect that should be approached by alternate means 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>.\n\n【24】Nowadays， multiple options for restoring skull integrity following DC or previous autologous bone repositioning failure have been described， and in these cases， reconstruction planning should consider previous scalp incisions， to avoid scalp vessel damage that could bring to necrosis. Moreover， a thorough study of the scalp surface available should be performed， to obtain a tensionless closure. In an article of Nout et al. a CAD-CAM implant for parietal reconstruction was slightly decreased in projection， in order to facilitate wound closure通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>. In these cases， CAD-CAM surface measurement can help predict the total skull surface before and after surgery， allowing to prevent potential complications such as skin dehiscence， or in cases when it is most suitable， to suggest the need for free soft tissue transfer or scalp expansion 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>， as advised by Baumeister et al.\n\n【25】Another important factor to consider for a successful cranioplasty is the choice of the material， which should be carefully made： A recent systematic review reported a 20.64% risk of complications with alloplastic materials， but each of them has advantages and disadvantages that must be considered. Titanium offers low rates of infection (10.7%) and can be easily screwed directly to the adjacent bone； however， it has a higher extrusion rate compared to the删除1换行other materials， and being radiopaque， it gives problems for tumor surveillance follow-up 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>. Polyether Ether Ketone (PEEK) offers the advantage that it is radiolucent and hypodense and does not cause radiographic artifacts on CT scans or MRIs 通用删除6(英):<u>[11，12]</u>. It has a 7.3%infection rate and a lower overall complication rate (17.3% vs. 31.8%for titanium). Polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) implants benefit from this material's strength， radiolucency and relatively low cost compared to the others. Prostheses made of PMMA can be modified intraoperatively using a bur， but， during handling and fixation， cases of prosthesis fracture are described， and account for an overall complication rate of 19% 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>.\n\n【26】In our patient， a large bilateral DC was performed， bringing the total calvarial defect to 254 cm. Due to this impressive bilateral defect， which represented approximately 40% of the total neurocranium， the patient had to rest only in supine position， causing a high risk of pressure sores and making it difficult to move the patient during bed changes or daily hygiene. For these reasons， the patient could not be left to the care of his family and had to stay at along-term care facility.\n\n【27】In the months following DC， several episodes of skin flap dehiscence along different parts of the surgical incisions occurred， treated by the neurosurgery and plastic surgery units. After complete healing of the scalp dehiscence， the maxillofacial surgery team was asked to reconstruct the calvarial defect， and with the aid of an engineering team， started programming the reconstruction， and two possible complications were highlighted. The first one is related to the skin quality and its surface； after several episodes of flap dehiscence， the skin resulted heavily scarred， thickened and contracted. The second potential complication is given by the dead space that would follow a cranioplasty which brings the calvaria to its original shape， while the brain would maintain its post-traumatic volume. Free tissue transfer was at first considered as a possible solution； it offers several benefits， including providing durable coverage for skull reconstruction， obliteration of dead space， and is of great benefit in revision cranioplasty patients with chronic overlying wounds lacking adequate soft tissue coverage 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>. However， free tissue transfer often limits the retention of native hair-bearing scalp skin at the defect site and would have necessitated a two-step surgery for both bringing soft tissue and calvarial custom reconstruction. Moreover，the relatives of the patient denied their consent to the free flap option to preserve a potential donor site from further surgery on such a delicate patient， and they preferred for us to find a solution for the problem without harvesting a free flap.\n\n【28】In order to overcomethe potential complications to the procedure， the program of developing adequate implants for cranioplasty firstly focused on the scalp surface， that was measured in the 3D rendering of the TC， giving an estimate of the scalp available (663 cm²). With this data， the biparietal implants for cranioplasty were designed to utilize all the skin surface available for cranioplasty without stretching the already scarred parietal skin， obtaining an undercorrected skull surface . Another concept that was taken into consideration was the volume of the dead space between the implant and the brain； by undercorrecting the custom-made implants， the amount of dead space was dramatically lowered. Despite the large area reconstructed with cranioplasty， thelower portion of the temporal area on both sides删除1换行was not covered by the implant ， since due to the presence of the zygomatic arch， it was the safest area to leave unreconstructed and could work as a warning sign for the rise of ICP in case of swelling.\n\n【29】Conclusion\n\n【30】Cranioplasty oflarge calvarial defects with poor soft tissue quality represents a challenge in which the surgeon could need to think\"outside the box\" to solve the problem he is put in front of. We have achieved durable aesthetic and functional results in this setting using undercorrected CAD-CAM PEEK implants for reconstruction，both reducing the risk of skin dehiscence and drastically reducing the intracranial dead space. For these patients， an accurate planning， that takes into consideration both soft and hard tissues is paramount. Further investigations are needed to better examine the long-term results of undercorrected CAD-CAM in cranioplasty patients.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

The natural and nutritional red carotenoid pigment is used as dietary supplements. Liver cancer is the fifth most common cancer in worldwide but because of very poor prognosis； it is the third most common cause of death among other cancers. There are currently limited therapeutic regimens available for effective treatment of this cancer. The present study was designed to evaluate the beneficial effects of dietary pigment astaxanthin， against Diethyl Nitrosamine (DEN) -induced oxidative stress and liver carcinogenesis in Wistar rats. ASX was orally administered to experimental rats at 20 mg/kg body weight prior to cancer induction. In the present study， we investigated the anticancer effects of Astaxanthin (ASX) during DEN-induced Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) in male Wistar rats.DEN treatments resulted in increased levels of Aspartate Transaminase (AST)， Alanine Transaminase (ALT)， Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP)， Acid Phosphatase (ACP)， and Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH) in blood serum， and decrease the antioxidantenzymic parameters such as Superoxide Dismutase (SOD)，Catalase (CAT)，Glutathione Peroxidase (Gpx)， Glutathione Reductase (GR) and non-enzymic parameters Vitamin A， C， and E in liver homogenates. Pretreatment with ASX significantly attenuated these alterations and increase in antioxidant parameters and decreased the levels of AST， ALT， ALP， ACP and LDH in blood serum. Nevertheless， the experimental and control rats of liver morphological， histopathological examination and immunohistochemical expression of COX-2 and PCNA analysis are authenticated the protective effects of astaxanthin treated rats. These findings suggest that ASX is a potent antioxidant and anticancer agent against DEN induced HCC.\n\n【2】Keywords： HaematocoCCHS pluvialis； Astaxanthin (ASX)；FHepatocellularr carcino]ma； Antioxidants； COX-2；PCNA\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Antioxidants are quenchers of free radicals that are responsible for inducing oxidative stress generated via Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) in the body； thus they prevent several ROS induced degenerative diseases such as cancer， ulcer， diabetes，cardiovascular diseases etc 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. HCC is a majior healthcare problem worldwide because it is the 54 most common cancer with more than one million fatalities occurring annually worldwide 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. Liver is one of the most important organs in energy metabolism. Most apolipoproteins， endogenous lipids， and lipoproteins are synthesized in the liver， which depends on the integrity of cellular functions of this organ. Under normal physiological conditions liver ensures homeostasis of lipid and lipoprotein metabolism.HCC impairs this process leading to alterations in the lipid and lipoprotein patterns 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. It is less common in most parts of the developed western world but appears to be increasing substantially in incidence and its incidence is very high in Asian countries 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. These highly variable geographical distributions of HCC indicate that environmental factors are of major causative importance 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. The reason for relatively high删除1换行incidence in Asian countries is due to the widespread contamination of foods with mycotoxins， moderately high prevalence of Hepatitis B virus， Hepatitis C virus-related chronic liver disease， which are considered as the most important risk factors for the development of HCC. The mortality rate remains high from HCC despite treatment with recent results showing 1-year， 3-years and 5-years survival rates of 66.1%， 39.7%， and 32.5%， respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>.\n\n【5】DEN a hepatocarcinogen， is known to cause perturbations in the nuclear enzymes involved in DNA repair/replication and is normally used as a carcinogen to induce liver cancer in animal models 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. The presence of nitroso compounds and their precursors in human environment together with the possibility of their endogenous formation in human body have led to suggestions of their potential involvement in human cancers 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. The main cause for concern is that DEN is found in a variety of foods like cheese； soybean； smoked， salted， and dried fish； cured meat； and alcoholic beverages 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>. It is also found in tobacco smoke at a concentration ranging from 1 ng/cigarette to 28 ng/cigarette and in baby bottle nipples at a level of 10ppb通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>.\n\n【6】The micro alga， Haematococcus pluvialis (chlorophyte) is one of the richest sources of astaxanthin accumulating up to 2% to 3% of dry weight and constitutes ~85% to 88% of total carotenoid 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>. As attributed to carotenoid and closely associated to B-carotene，lutein， and zeaxanthin， astaxanthin shares with them many of the general metabolic and physiological activities. On the other hand， ASX has unique chemical properties based on its molecular structure. The presence of the Hydroxyl (OH) and keto (C=O) moieties on each ionone ring explains some of its unique features， namely， a higher antioxidant activity. ASX (3，3'-dihydroxy-B.B-carotene-4，4-dione) has been documented to provide important metabolic functions in animals， including conversion to Vitamin A 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>， enhancement of immune response 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>， and protection against diseases such as cancers by scavenging oxygen radicals 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>. The antioxidant activity of ASX has been reported to approximately 10 times stronger than that of other carotenoids tested 通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u>. ASX also shows strong activity as an inhibitor of oxygen radical-mediated LPO 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>.\n\n【7】In recent years， a number of studies on astaxanthin have in vitro and in vivo demonstrated its antioxidant effect， for example， the quenching effect on singlet oxygen， a strong scavenging effect on superoxide， hydrogen peroxide， and hydroxyl radicals and an inhibitory effect on lipid peroxidation 通用删除6(英):<u>[16，17]</u>. In addition to these， several other biologic activities of ASX， including anti-cancer， anti-inflammatory， antidiabetic， immunomodulatory activities and a neuroprotective effect， also have been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u>. From the above reports Astaxanthin is known to be a powerful antioxidant，although these facts suggested that ASX might be a potent candidate for a natural hepatoprotective agent， further basic evidence to demonstrate the hepatoprotective effect of ASX is needed.\n\n【8】Cyclooxygenases also known as prostaglandin H2 syntheses are the rate-limiting enzymes involved in the conversion of arachidonic acid into Prostaglandins (PGs) 通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u>. Two isoforms of COX exist， with diverse tissue distributions. COX-1 is constitutively expressed in many tissies and cell types， whereas COX-2 is an inducible isoform that participates in pro-inflammatory responses in response to certain stimuli such as mitogens， cytokines and growth factors通用删除6(英):<u>[20-22]</u>. Upregulation of COX-2 has also been implicated in cancer development and growth. Recent reports on COX-2 expression in cancers show that this enzyme stimulates angiogenesis and is删除1换行associated with tumor growth， invasion， and metastasis 通用删除6(英):<u>[20，23]</u>.\n\n【9】Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA) is a 36-kDa protein functions as a cofactor of DNA-polymerase and an important marker for evaluating the proliferation of several cancers including HCC通用删除6(英):<u>[24-26]</u>. PCNA is synthesized during the late G1-early S phase of the cell cycle， immediately preceding the onset of DNA synthesis， is most abundant during the S phase， and declines during the G2/M phase 通用删除6(英):<u>[27，28]</u>. X-ray crystallography has shown that PCNA molecules form a trimeric ring around DNA 通用删除6(英):<u>[29]</u>. The detection of PCNA using immunohistochemical methods is a common way to study the proliferating activity oftransformed cells.

Liver is one of the most important organs in energy metabolism. Most apolipoproteins， endogenous lipids， and lipoproteins are synthesized in the liver， which depends on the integrity of cellular functions of this organ. Under normal physiological conditions liver ensures homeostasis of lipid and lipoprotein metabolism. HCC impairs this process leading to alterations in the lipid and lipoprotein patterns 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>.\n\n【69】Hepato specific enzymes were activated when hepatocellular damage give rise to abnormalities of liver function and these enzymes are remarkably increased in HCC 通用删除6(英):<u>[36]</u>. One of the most sensitive and dramatic indicators of hepatocyte injury is the release of intracellular enzymes， such as transaminases， phosphates， and LDH in the circulation after DEN administration. The measurement of phosphatase activity is useful as an indicator of liver function通用删除6(英):<u>[51]</u>. In the liver， it is closely connected with lipid membrane in the canalicular zone， so that any interference with the bile flow， whether extra-hepatic or intra-hepatic leads to increased serum levels of ACP and ALP activities. Aminotransferases (AST and ALT) are reliable marker enzymes of liver and they are the first enzymes to be used in diagnostic enzymology when liver damage has occurred 通用删除6(英):<u>[52]</u>. Because of their intracellular location in the cytosol， toxicity affecting the liver with subsequent breakdown in membrane architecture of the cells删除1换行leads to their spillage into serum， and their concentration rises in the latter. LDH release into the serum reflects a nonspecific alteration in the plasma membrane integrity and permeability or may be due to its overproduction by tumor cells. LDH is a fairly sensitive marker of solid neoplasm 通用删除6(英):<u>[53]</u> and many studies revealed increased LDH activity in various types of tumor 通用删除6(英):<u>[36，54，55]</u>. In the present study the levels of marker enzymes were increase in serum was observed， when administration of DEN and treatment with ASX showed a significant reduction in the levels of marker enzymes in serum.\n\n【70】Several studies have demonstrated the antioxidant potential of carotenoids that can significantly reduce free radicals and the oxidative load to help the body maintain a healthy state. Studies have shown that in vivo supplementation with exogenous astaxanthin is capable of suppressing the formation of byproducts (e.g.， TBARS) of membrane LPO induced by superoxide anion. Studies in the past have attributed that the LPO attenuating effect of ASX to its molecular structure 通用删除6(英):<u>[56]</u>. The above reports were substantiated by our study as administration of ASX to DEN-induced rats significantly reduced the levels of TBARS and hydroperoxides proving its potential antioxidant ability. The enzymatic antioxidants such as SOD， CAT， GPx and GR limit the effects of oxidant molecules on tissues and are activated against oxidative cell injury 通用删除6(英):<u>[57]</u>. These enzymes work synergisticallyto eliminate active oxygen species and small deviations in physiological concentrations may have a dramatic effect on the resistance of cellular macro molecules and DNA to oxidative damage通用删除6(英):<u>[58]</u>. The decreased activities of these enzymic antioxidants observed in DEN-induced rats might be due to increased oxidative stress as enhanced levels of LPO along with the reduced activities of enzymic antioxidants has been observed during DEN-induced malignant alterations 通用删除6(英):<u>[56]</u>. In this study， ASX administration prevented DEN-induced changes in enzymatic antioxidant enzymes and this could be attributed to its high scavenger potential， which would protect the tissues against free radicals generated by DEN， sparing antioxidant defenses 通用删除6(英):<u>[59，60]</u>.\n\n【71】The non-enzymatic antioxidant parameters Vitamins A， C， and E prevent its oxidation.

Cellproliferation is thought to play an important role in several steps of the carcinogenic process.

Elevated expression of PCNA in the liver of DEN-administered animals indicates the hyper proliferative activity of tumor cells. Reducing cellular proliferation was one of the hallmarks of controlling the carcinogenic process and higher expression of PCNA protein was closely related to increased proliferation because it plays an essential role in nucleic acid metabolism as a component of the replication 通用删除6(英):<u>[30]</u>. ASX administration resulted in decreased expression of this proliferative marker， which clearly revealed its antiproliferative activity in HCC.\n\n【77】COX2 is a key enzyme in arachidonic acid metabolism， is consistently absent in normal tissue， and is increased in the tumor. Increased expression of COX-2 in HCC was observed by several investigators 通用删除6(英):<u>[21，22，26，65]</u>. In the present study， increased expression of COX-2 was observed in the liver of Group II hepatoma-bearing animals. It is possible that the increased levels of COX-2 serve to lower the intracellular levels of free arachidonic acid， thereby preventing carcinogenesis. ASX treatment significantly inhibited the expression of COX-2， thereby maintaining increased levels of free arachidonic acid in the cells， which might have resulted in the suppression of carcinogenesis.\n\n【78】In conclusion， we found that the ASX has exhibited potent antioxidant， immunomodulating and enzyme in ducing properties， all of which suggest a potential role for this carotenoid in the prevention of cancer. Moreover， its unique structural properties and its lack of删除1换行pro-oxidant activity make it aprime aspirant for further investigation in this area of human health. More research is needed on the absorption and metabolism of this promising anticancer agent in humans， and on its interactions with other carotenoids and Vitamins in the human system.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

However，the suitability of RMT for patients with different characteristics and different severity of COPD is unknown. We investigated the effectiveness of home-based RMT in three patients with COPD with different characteristics， including symptoms of respiratory diseases， dynamic hyperinflation， and respiratory muscle weakness， and who presented with varying degrees of COPD severity from COPD Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) grades II to IV. The three patients underwent home-based RMT therapy. They all continued to take existing medication and performed RMT exercises for 8 weeks with a target respiratory muscle training load of 50% of each participant's maximum respiratory muscle strength. Data on dyspnea sensation， Quality of Life (QoL)， respiratory muscle strength， pulmonary function， 6-Min Walk Distance (6MWD)， and diaphragm excursion were collected. The patient with symptoms of respiratory diseases improved the most as indicated by a decrease in dyspnea sensation during activity and an improvement in diaphragm excursion at rest. The patient with dynamic hyperinflation had an increase in the changed of inspiratory capacity and the 6MWD. The patient with respiratory muscle weakness had an improved QoL. Further studies should be performed with larger sample sizes.\n\n【2】Keywords： Respiratory muscle training； Symptoms of respiratory diseases；IDynamic hyperventilation； Respiratory muscle weakness； Diaphragm sonography； COPD\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】COPD has an estimated prevalence rate of 6.1% in the general population in Taiwan 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Rochester showed that generalized muscle weakness in patients with COPD contributes to low inspiratory muscle strength next to hyperinflation 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. Furthermore， Maximum Inspiratory Pressure (MIP) is known to be impaired by hyperinflation due to shortening of the inspiratory muscles 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. Total Lung Capacity (TLC) is calculated according to lung volume-related physiology as the sum of End-Expiratory Lung Volume (EELV) and Inspiratory Capacity (IC) 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. Thus， when air trapping during physical activity， EELV increases， IC decreases， and TLC remains constant. This phenomenon is known as dynamic hyperventilation.\n\n【5】We can surmise that hyperventilation leads to diaphragm limitation during exercise. A Min et al. found that the degree of diaphragmatic excursion during deep breathing was lower in patients with COPD and correlated significantly with disease severity 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>.\n\n【6】Alba et al. demonstrated that inspiratory muscles training induces adaptive changes in the structure of the external intercostal muscles 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. Improvement in inspiratory muscle performance is associated with an increase in 6MWD and the sensation of dyspnea 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. Furthermore， Chun et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u> reported significant improvements after pulmonary rehabilitation in diaphragmatic motion during full inspiration and expiration in both lungs， indicated by fluoroscopy imaging findings 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>.\n\n【7】Therefore， this case series investigated the effects of RMT in patients with COPD who exhibit classic respiratory symptoms， dynamic hyperinflation， or respiratory muscle weakness. We investigated the effectiveness of RMT in patients with COPD of varying severity who present with various symptoms.\n\n【8】Materials and Methods\n\n【9】Study design and subjects\n\n【10】The study protocol was approved by the ethics committee of the Taipei Medical University Joint Institutional Review Board， Taiwan(Study Code： N201808069). Data collection were performed from October 2018 to June 2019 at Taipei Medical University Hospital Pulmonary Rehabilitation Center， Taipei， Taiwan. A signed consent form has been obtained from all of the patients. The inclusion criteria were the participants who were categorized from moderate (GOLD II) to very severe (GOLD IV) COPD， age from 40 to 90 years old with stable condition. The GOLD strategy for COPD categorization was located in group B. The exclusion criteria were neuromuscular disease， diaphragm paralysis， dementia and COPDAE past 3 months.\n\n【11】Patient 1 exhibited respiratory disease symptoms. Patient 2exhibited dynamic hyperventilation. Patient 3 had respiratory muscle weakness. Participants were permitted to continue taking existing medication. We collected the following information： Health history， dyspnea sensation， Quality of Life (QoL)，respiratory muscle strength， pulmonary function，6MWT，and diaphragm excursion.\n\n【12】Respiratory muscle training with a Dofin breathing trainer\n\n【13】RMT involving both inspiratory and expiratory muscles was performed. The target training load was set individually at 50% ofeach participant's MIP and MEP. After 4 weeks， participants returned to the pulmonary rehabilitation center for a respiratory muscle strength evaluation. Updated MIP and MEP values were used to adjust each participant's target training load. Participants then performed RMT involving 30 breaths per day with a pause of 30s to 60s after every five breaths. The experimentlasted for 8 weeks.\n\n【14】Outcome evaluation\n\n【15】Exercise pulmonary function test： Dynamic hyperinflation used to be indicated by a change in IC (AIC， in liters) of less than or equal to -0.10 L at the peak of exercise 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>； however， it is more recently indicated by a tidal volume at peak exercise (VT peak) /TLC of less than 0.4 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>. Pulmonary function test was assessed using a spirometer (Vitalograph model 6800). Participants performed a6MWT to measure their exercise endurance index.\n\n【16】Respiratory muscle strength test： The MIP Lower Limit of Normal (LLN) was 62 - (0.15 ×age)， and the MEP LLN was 117 -(0.83 xage) cmH，O in men 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>. In our analysis， patients with MIP<60 cmH，O were considered to have inspiratory muscle weakness通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>. MIP and MEP were measured with GaleMedGas Pressure Gauge， while participants were in a sitting position.\n\n【17】Quality of life evaluation： QoL was measured using the CAT formulated by from GlaxoSmithKline. A Short Form 12-item (SF-12) survey was used to measure functional health and wellbeing from each participant’s perspective.\n\n【18】Diaphragm excursion measurement： Diaphragm excursion was measured using ultrasound imaging (Hitachi Noblus) of resting deep breath by one thoracic medical physician. The measurement reference lines were the bilateral scapular lines and bilateral posterior删除1换行axillary lines. We measured the distance moved according to the grid lines on the screen of the ultrasound imaging machine.\n\n【19】Results\n\n【20】Patient 1 was a 78-year-old man presenting with symptoms of a respiratory disease and moderately severe COPD with predicted FEV1 of 54% and an mMRC score of 2. The 6MWD at baseline was147 m， and that after RMT intervention was 244 m. At baseline， the Borg scale at rest was 5 and that after the 6MWT was 7； after the RMT intervention， the Borg scale at rest was 2 and that after the 6MWTwas3， indicating an improvement in the sensation of dyspnea.\n\n【21】QoL also improved considerably. Scores from the SF-12 survey increased from 40% to 63%； specifically， the scores increased from21% to 50% in the physical component and 52% to 71% in the mental component. The CAT score decreased from 20 to 14 points.\n\n【22】MIPincreased from 80 cmHO to 104cmH.O，and MEPincreased from 100 cmH，Oto 120cmH，O. Diaphragm excursion also increased from 4 cm to7cm.\n\n【23】Patient 2 was a 77-year-old man who presented with dynamic hyperventilation and severe COPD with predicted FEV1 of 35% and an mMRC score of 1. The exercise pulmonary function test revealed a AIC of -0.12 L after the 6MWT. At baseline，his 6MWD was 263 m， and post-RMT， his 6MWD was 433 m. Also， it is worth noting that the AIC was from -0.12 improved to 0.09.\n\n【24】The QoL and CAT scores also improved. Scores from the SF-12survey increased from 74% to 80%， including 71% to 81% for the删除表格换行mental component. The CAT score decreased from 13 to 10 points.\n\n| Case  | 1  | 2  | 3  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Characteristic  | Symptoms of respiratory disease  | Dynamic hyperinflation  | Respiratory muscle weakness  |\n| Age/Gender  | 78/Male  | 77/Male  | 75/Male  |\n| BMI (kg/m²)  | 30.5  | 17.9  | 15.8  |\n| COPD Group  | B  | B  | B  |\n| FEV1/FVC%  | 63  | 44  | 35  |\n| FEV1%  | 54  | 35  | 11  |\n| FVC%  | 64  | 61  | 24  |\n| mMRC  | 2  | 1  | 4  |\n| 6-min Walk Test  |  |  |  |\n| 6MWT distance(pred%)  | 147 (40%)  | 263 (51%)  | 89(18%)  |\n| AIC(L)  | 0.04  | -0.12  | 0.24  |\n| Lowest SpO%  | 83  | 89  | 70  |\n| Borg  | 5s7  | 12  | 1>2  |\n| Quality of Life  |  |  |  |\n| SF-12(%)  | 40  | 74  | 51  |\n| CAT Score  | 20  | 13  | 21  |\n| Respiratory Muscle Strength  |  |  |  |\n| MIP (cmH，O)  | 80  | 54  | 12  |\n| MEP (cmH，O)  | 100  | 80  | 48  |\n| Diaphragm Excursion (cm)  | 4  | 4  | 1.5  |\n\n【26】Disease； FEV1： Forced Expiratory Volume in One Second； FVC： Forced Vital Ir2Capacity； 6MWT： 6-Min Walk Test； IC： Inspiratory Capacity； SF-12： Short Form12-Item Health Survey； CAT： COPD Assessment Test； MIP： Max Inspiratory Pressure； MEP： Max Expiratory Pressure\n\n【27】Table 2： Respiratory muscle training effectiveness.\n\n| Case  | 1  |  | 2  |  | 3  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Characteristic  | Symptoms of respiratory disease  |  | Dynamic hyperinflation  |  | Respiratory muscle weakness  |  |\n|  | B  | 2M  | B  | 2M  | B  | 2M  |\n| 6-min Walk Test  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| 6MWT distance (pred%)  | 147 (40%)  | 244(66%)  | 263 (51%)  | 433(84%)  | 89(18%)  | 111(23%)  |\n| A6MWT distance (m)  |  | +97  | -  | +170  | 删除8:<u>一 </u> | +22  |\n| AIC (L)  | 0.04  | -0.06  | -0.12  | 0.09  | 0.24  | -0.44  |\n| Borg  | 5s7  | 2s3  | 1>2  | 0：2  | 1>2  | 1s4  |\n| Quality of Life  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| SF-12(%)  | 40  | 63  | 74  | 80  | 51  |  |\n| Physical (%)  | 21  | 50  | 79  | 79  | 50  | 64  |\n| Mental (%)  | 52  | 71  | 71  | 81  | 52  | 86  |\n| CAT Score  | 20  | 14  | 13  | 10  | 21  | 19  |\n| Respiratory Muscle Strength  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| MIP (cmH，O)  | 80  | 104  | 54  | 73  | 12  | 22  |\n| AMIP  |  | 24  |  | 19  |  | 10  |\n| MEP (cmH，O)  | 100  | 120  | 80  | 91  | 48  | 54  |\n| AMEP  | 删除8:<u>一 </u> | 20  |  | 11  |  | 6  |\n| Diaphragm Excursion (cm)  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Right post-axillary line  | 4  | 7  | 4  | 4  | 1.5  | 2  |\n\n【29】MIP increased from 54 cmHOto73 cmHO，and MEP increased from 80 cmH，O to 91 cm H.O. The resting deep breath diaphragm excursion was unchanged at 4cm.\n\n【30】Patient 3 was a 75-year-old man who presented with respiratory muscle weakness and very severe COPD with predicted FEV1 of 11%and an mMRC score of 4. The 6MWD at baseline and that following RMT intervention were 89 and 111 m， respectively. QoL improved considerably. Scores from the SF-12 survey increased from 51% to77%； The CAT score decreased from 21 to 19 points.\n\n【31】His respiratory muscle strength improved slightly. At baseline， his MIP was 12 cmH.O， and MEP was 48 cmH.O. Post-RMT intervention， the MIP was 22 cmH.O and MEP was 54 cmHO. The diaphragm excursion did not change significantly. The distance in the right post-axillary line was 1.5 cm at baseline and 2 cm post-RMT intervention .\n\n【32】We measured diaphragm movement using four lines， which were删除1换行the scapular line and the post-axillary line on both the right and left sides. The distribution was related. The post-axillary line was slightly longer than the scapular line .\n\n【33】Discussion\n\nThe aim of this case series was to identify characteristics that are associated with favorable outcomes from RMTintervention. Increased breathing difficulty is indicated by a high inspiratory pressure to MIP ratio， which is related to perceived dyspnea sensation 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>. Chuang et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u> revealed that RMT increases MIP， improves 6MWT， reduces sensations of dyspnea， and improves QoL， allowing patients to more easily perform daily activities in patients with moderate to very severe COPD|14.\n\n【35】We found that in patient 1， when symptoms subsided， the QoL improved. Previous research has shown that MIP has a significant negative correlation with diaphragm excursion 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>. His diaphragm excursion increased from 4 cm to 7 cm accompany by increase MIP also noted.\n\n【36】Patient 2 presented MIP， MEP and 6MWD increased after the RMT intervention. A previous study showed that higher inspiratory muscle strength leads to improved exercise capacity and reduces dynamic hyperinflation and breathlessness during exercise 通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>. We now have a better understanding of the mechanisms that lead to improved exercise capacity through RMT. QoL also improved with increased exercise tolerance. No change was observed in the diaphragm excursion in patient 2， different results might be observed if the diaphragm is measured in an active state.\n\nPatient 3 presented with very severe COPD and with respiratory muscle weakness. Decreased MEP is common in patients with advanced COPD 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. His 6MWD increased by only 22 m. But the minimum clinically important difference of the 6MWD suggests approximately 32 m 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>. The increase in diaphragm excursion only|删除段之间换行|0.5 cm was below the threshold of clinical measurement accuracy. Despite the poor clinical results， this patient’s QoL improved much. The benefits of RMT for patients with very severe COPD remains unknown. Patient 3 did not show significant improvement probably because the training period was too short or because complementary modalities were required. In any case， RMT resulted in maintained muscle strength and increased exercise capacity， thereby improving QoL.\n\n【38】In conclusion， RMT has varying degrees of benefit for patients with COPD. Prolonged RMT or RMT in combination with additional training may provide better results.\n\n【39】Conclusion\n\n【40】Additional RMT increased MIP，MEP， CAT scores and QoL. The participant with symptoms of respiratory diseases had the greatest improvement in diaphragm excursion. The participant with dynamic hyperinflation had an increased AIC， which subsequently improved exercise capacity. The participant with respiratory muscle weakness， which is usually associated with very severe COPD， exhibited improvement in QoL.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

This case suggests the possibility of use of ASV to negate the need for fasciotomies for compartment syndromes complicating snake bites.\n\n【16】An 11-year old previously healthy child presented with a history of snake bite on his left hand删除1换行index finger complicated with progressive painful swelling of his left upper limb. His parents immediately tried to stop the bleeding by sucking out the venom and applying traditional remedies over the wound， though no cuts were made. The parents noticed bruising， bleeding and gradual swelling then， a tourniquet was tied and the patient was brought to the nearest district hospital which was 2 h away. The swelling had progressed over the left wrist and extended half way up the forearm. The tourniquet was immediately removed at the hospital. Intravenous antibiotics and tetanus prophylaxis were administered. He did not have any bleeding or neurological symptoms. However overnight the swelling had progressed beyond the elbow joint and there was bruising and bullae formation over the bite site Painful finger movements on the left hand with absence of radial pulse were noted. The patient was then referred to the orthopedic surgeon at our hospital for management of compartment syndrome.\n\n【17】On examination there was swelling of the entire left upper limb extending onto the left shoulder joint. There was significant tenderness on palpation of forearm and arm muscles and pain on passive extension. Radial pulse was palpable. Capillary refill time on the finger beds was less than 3 sec. Local examination revealed evidence of severe envenomation including redness， swelling， blistering and underlying ecchymosis.\n\n【18】A diagnosis of compartment syndrome was made. Patient was initially planned for urgent fasciotomy. However， his 20 min Whole Blood Clotting Time (WBCT) was found to be prolonged and he also had prolonged pro thrombin time and International Normalized Ration (INR). In view of the rapidly progressive severe local envenomation signs and deranged coagulation profile， the decision to first administer polyvalent Anti- Snake Venom (ASV) was made， though at that time >24 h had elapsed since the bite. After discussion with the orthopedic surgeon， it was decided to continue ASV and to withhold fasciotomy unless there is no evidence of improvement.\n\n【19】During the course of administration of anti-venom， the patient developed early allergic reaction evidenced by cough， scratchy throat， and urticarial rashes and vomiting with presence of hematemesis. The reaction was immediately managed1 with fluids， oxygen， adrenaline， antihistamines and steroids. ASV was stopped and patient was monitored. With resolution of symptoms， the infusion was further diluted and slowly restarted at a slower infusion rate. Is coagulation profile was normalizing at 6 h. Overnight his swelling over the forearm reduced significantly and pain had reduced. With normalization of coagulation profile and improvement of compartment symptoms fasciotomy was withheld. He responded well despite late administration of ASV. His limb swelling drastically improved and was discharged on day 7 of admission.\n\n【20】Discussion and Conclusion\n\n【21】Epidemiological data on snakebites in Bhutan remain limited.Of what is known and recorded， there are 69 species， of which 15 are venomous snakes belonging to two families， Elapidae and Viperidae6.\n\n【22】The timely administration of ASV remains the mainstay to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with snakebites. A retrospective study in Bhutan reported that around 35% of snake bites developed envenomation signs and symptoms. Polyvalent ASV was found to have excellent outcomes with only 7% mortality 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>.\n\n【23】Compartment syndrome involves the sustained elevation of interstitial tissue pressures within an osteofascial envelope to non-physiologic levels. It causes tissue injury leading to irreversible damage and， therefore， early recognition and treatment is critical for optimal outcomes 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>. Alternatively， fasciotomy performed prophylactically may lead to worsened local myonecrosis 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>. In most cases of snakebite， fasciotomy is not necessary. Once administered， anti-venom helps neutralize the venom， reducing compartment pressure and inhibiting the development of compartment syndrome.\n\n【24】In our case， in view of deranged coagulation profile， a decision was made to defer fasciotomy and observe response to ASV. Gregory et al.， reiterates that fasciotomy should only be performed in patients with clinical signs and symptoms of compartment syndrome that are present despite elevation of the affectedlimb and administration of 20vials of anti-venom 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>. A study by Hall noted that， out of 1，257 cases of extremity bites only two required fasciotomies 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>.\n\n【25】In contrast， a recent study， where intra-compartmental pressures were measured for diagnosis of compartment syndrome， recorded a higher rate fasciotomies at 10.8%. As in the discussed case， the local and systemic envenomation effects of venom closely resemble the signs and symptoms of compartment syndrome. Fasciotomy， in the past， could have been withheld in patients with actual compartment syndrome， attributing the symptoms to the venom 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>.\n\n【26】Initiation of anti-venom should not be held for delayed presentation of snakebites. Prophylactic fasciotomies should be considered after correction of hematological parameters. Though controversial， it is still prudent to start ASV first with closely monitoring and consider surgery only if compartment symptoms persist with failed response to ASV. ASV can， not only reverse coagulopathy， but may also be helpful in reducing symptoms of compartment syndrome， thereby negating the need for fasciotomies.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

In clinical interview， he reported he had a serious traffic accident one year ago caused by daytime sleepiness. The patient’s history did not contain any systemic disorders， cigarette smoking and alcohol or drug abuse.\n\n【12】On the physical examination， the waist and neck circumferences and body mass index of the patient were 108 cm， 42 cm， and 29.8kg/m²respectively. Not any signs were detected during temporomandibular joint examination. On intraoral examination， presence of elongated soft palate， moderate macroglossia and slightly narrowed oropharynx were noted. Oropharengeal relationship of the patient was classified as Class 4 according to the Mallampati scale. His Epworth Sleepiness Scale (EPSS) was 16 and the provisional diagnosis was OSA. Thus， overnight PSG evaluation was required for definitive diagnosis.\n\n【13】According to the medical history， the patient had been referred to a sleep laboratory by a chest physician two years ago. However， having had difficulty in falling asleep and felt discomfort arising from cables and electrodes he had left the test unfinished. Therefore， it was decided to perform overnight PO recording at home in order to check his cardiorespiratory stability during sleep. In addition， snoring monitorization was planned concurrent with the PO recordings. Thus， a sleep app (SnoreLab， Reviva Soft works Ltd， London， UK) was downloaded and set as the creators'instructions. To obtain the most accurate data， the noise level of the patients' bedroom was checked with a sound level meter (LM-8102， Lutron Ltd， Taipei， Taiwan) and conveniences of the room conditions were confirmed. The patient was informed in detail about the working principals of the PO and the app. The Smartphone (IPhone 4S， Apple， CA， USA) was switched and the app was activated before sleep. Finally， the PO (Beurer PO80， Beurer Medical， Ulm， Germany) was inserted by a sleep technician and overnight recordings were performed at the patient’s home. In total， three recordings were executed in order to minimize the error margin. While the PO data were scored by an experienced chest physician and snore score values were calculated by the algorithm of the app. Results of the first snoring evaluation were given at the Figure1. PO and sleep app values of three overnight Diagnostic Recordings(DRs) were given at the Table 1.\n\n【14】According to DRs， the patient was diagnosed with moderate OSA and habitual snoring.

Impressions were made with irreversible hydrocolloid material (CA37， Cavex， Haarlem， Holland) and the master casts were obtained from Type III dental stone (Moldano， Heraeus Kulzer， Hanau， Germany). Maxillary and mandibular occlusal splints were manufactured with Autopolymerising Clear Acrylic Resin Material (ACARM) (Ortocryl， Dentaurum， Ispringen， Germany) on isolated master models such as to cover occlusal and incisal surfaces of the existing dentition. Prepared splints were inserted in the mouth and adjusted on dental arches. Afterwards，intermaxillary relationship was recorded at 75% of maximal mandibular protrusion and intraoral records were mounted on a semi-adjustable articulator (Artex Type NK， Amann Girrbach， Pforzheim，Deutschland). The vertical openingamount was increased up to 10 mm，approximately. Maxillary and mandibular splints were删除1换行attached to each other using ACARM and finishing procedures were performed. After intraoral adjustments， the MAD was delivered to the patient with recommendations. Three Follow-Up Recordings(FRs) were performed at the end of the 6th month of the MAD treatment. The same recording procedure applied in the DRs was also performed during Frs. Insertion of the MAD during sleep was the only difference between DRs and FRs protocols. The results of the last snoring recording were shown in the Figure 1.\n\n|  | Results of the 1t FR  |  | Results of the 2nd FR  |  | Results of the 3dFR  |  | The mean values of FRs  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | SpO2  | Pulse  | SpO2  | Pulse  | SpO2  | Pulse  | SpO2  | Pulse  |\n| Total events  | 57  | 89  | 63  | 134  | 15  | 49  | 45  | 90.6  |\n| Time in events  | 28.3  | 38.7  | 36.3  | 47.3  | 6.3  | 13.3  | 23.6  | 33.1  |\n| Average event duration  | 29.8  | 26.1  | 34.5  | 21.2  | 25.3  | 16.9  | 29.8  | 21.4  |\n| % Artifact  | 11.8  | 11.8  | 4.7  | 4.7  | 19.7  | 19.7  | 11.9  | 11.9  |\n| ODI  | 9.6  | 15  | 9.7  | 20.7  | 6.7  | 21.8  | 8.6  | 19.1  |\n| Basal SpO2  | 90.7  |  | 90.3  |  | 89.6  |  | 90.2  |  |\n| Minimum SpO2 (%)  | 83  |  | 75  |  | 84  |  | 80.6  |  |\n| Average pulse rate (bpm)  |  | 67  |  | 68  |  | 82  |  | 72.3  |\n| Lowest pulse rate (bpm)  |  | 55  |  | 57  |  | 70  |  | 60.6  |\n| Results of the follow-up snoring recordings  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n\n|  | Results of the 1th FR  | Results of the 2nd FR  |  | Results of the 3rd FR  |  | The mean values of FRs  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Time monitoring (min)  | 370  | 389  |  | 409  |  | 389.3  |  |\n| Time snoring (min)  | 34  | 19  |  | 22  |  | 25  |  |\n| snore score  | 8  | 2  |  | 2  |  | 4  |  |\n\n【21】At the end of the six months follow-up period， the EPSS of the patient dramatically decreased at 3. The mean ODI of the patient was improved significantly with the MAD therapy. In addition， significant improvement in HRV was observed with the MAD therapy. Moreover， therapeutic effect of the MAD was recorded successfully with the sleep app. All snore scores obtained by the sleep app showed删除1换行highly compatible alterations both with EPSS and PO values. Not any serious complaints were reported by the patient except dry mouth that generally occurred in mornings.\n\n【22】Discussion\n\n【23】According to our knowledge， this is the first report describing the utilization of a sleep app and PO in the management of a moderate OSA patient with habitual snoring. Gradually increasing usage of the PO in sleep studies can be observed from the current literature， and its diagnostic value has been qualified by previous studies 通用删除6(英):<u>[1-3]</u>. However， there exist some studies notifying the variable sensitivity of PO according to the severity of the OSA. Chung et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u> stated that PO recordings could be more sensitive for the patients having ODI above 10 (93%). The reason of the highly coherent ODI values obtained from three DRs could be arisen from the moderate severity of the OSA in the present case. In fact， three ODI values obtained from the DRs was extremely close to each other. However， a little less proximity was detected among ODI values obtained from FRS Nevertheless； strong and coherent relations was seen among EPSS， PO and sleep app values in terms of DRs and FRS Moreover， EPSS， PO and sleep app values dramatically decreased in chorus at the end of six months.\n\n【24】As seen in the present case， snoring may be the foremost signs of OSA directing the patients to seek a medical assistance. However， there is no agreement in the literature on the accuracy of snoring severity predicted with the provided information by bed partners. In fact， objective findings may affect the treatment planning of patients or have an importance for avoiding elective surgical interventions通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. In the present case， simultaneous decrease in EPSS， IDO， HRV and snoring scores displayed not only treatment efficiency of the MAD therapy for a moderate OSA patients， but also problem solving capacity of sleep apps on the existence of an objective method to score the snoring severity of subjects in home conditions. Thus，using a sleep app in the scoring of snoring severity may be an option for the home based sleep studies at the foreseeable future. However， some unknown titles should be made clear to take yet another turn， as previously stated by Stipping et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. Numerous brand of SP with different hardware and software have been presented in market up to now. Thus， structural properties of the Smartphone's can be quite varied from each other’s and their recording quality may be affected from these variations. In addition， some of them may record human删除1换行snoring sounds more effectively than the others. However， there are not any comprehensive studies in the literature which responds to these queries， yet. Therefore， absence of data about the reliability and repeatability of sleep apps algorithms should be fulfilled.\n\n【25】Unfortunately， an in vivo study about the usage of sleep apps has not been published yet. Thus， impossibility of making a comparison is one of the most important limitations of the present case study. However， absence of any PSG data， which can be enabled the verification of obtained results， is the major limitation of the present case. Additionally， findings of this single case cannot be extended to all related population. Therefore， present findings need to be verified by further studies conducted with inclusion of more participants. Moreover， not only sufficiency of widely used SPs but also accuracy and repeatability of existing sleep apps should be evaluated with further studies. More preferably， standard PSG evaluations can be used to constitute a reference point to compare accuracy and repeatability of both SPs and sleep apps. Despite it is as yet too early to make a definite decision， using a sleep app in the scoring of snore sounds seems like a promising innovation for the future sleep studies to be executed in home conditions.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

Inflammatory cell infiltrates consisted of lymphocytes， histiocytes， and rarely plasma cells. Cross section of the diameter of the adjacent muscle fibres showed its increased variation with atrophy， segmental necrosis， degeneration， vesicular and internal nuclei， and decrease in longitudinal and transverse striation， increase in the number of sarcolemmal nuclei of some muscle fibers， and a small number of regenerating muscle fibers with prominent dark nucleoli . Productive inflammation with endothelial hyperplasia in perimysial blood vessels was not found.\n\n【16】Right lower leg skin biopsy performed at the site of muscle biopsy， showed the areas of some atrophy and oedema of epidermis together with collagenous fibresoedema with slight lymphocytic cell infiltration near and around blood vessels .\n\n【17】The patient was treated by oral prednisolone in the dose 1 mg/kg/day (80 mg/day) together with intramuscular cyclophosphane in the dose 2.5 mg/kg/day (200 mg/day). The size and firmness of nodules as well as firmness of muscles decreased after 1.5 months of treatment； muscle strength increased and the range of movements in joints increased a little too.\n\n【18】Discussion and Conclusion\n\n【19】Manyinvestigations distinguish a special rare variant of\"localized nodular myositis\"as a well-known form of inflammatory myopathies通用删除6(英):<u>[1-6，12-15]</u>. Some authors described this form under the name“focal myositis”as a new clinical and pathological entity representing benign pseudotumour of skeletal muscle 通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>. The disease manifested with rapidly growing painful swellings resembling muscle tumor or venous thrombophlebitis of lower legs in some cases 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>. Authors considered that “focal myositis\"differed from polymyositis. Although this disease is characterized by myalgia and inflammation in a muscle， the pathological process always remains limited to one zone of a single muscle only， and the signs of systemic disease are not observed 通用删除6(英):<u>[12-14，18-24]</u>.Similar cases were describedbyotherauthors later 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，16，25-29]</u>. In some works 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，30]</u> it was shown that focal myositis differs from polymyositis greatly by immunological and clinical changes despite of similar morphological changes in muscles. The same opinion had some other authors 通用删除6(英):<u>[12-14，16，18，20，21，27，29]</u>. However some authors opposed then osological entity of \"localized nodular myositis”among inflammatory myopathies 通用删除6(英):<u>[7，8，31]</u>. These authors suggest that the clinical and pathological evidence indicates a close relationship between localized nodular myositis and polymyositis， as the former clinical picture often precedes and evolves into the latter. It is necessary to remark that such forms of polymyositis starting as focal processes were rarely described 通用删除6(英):<u>[7，8，32，31]</u>.\n\n【20】The clinical picture in our patient differs from that was reported earlier 通用删除6(英):<u>[7，8，31]</u>. In these cases the polymyositis began with the development of painful nodules within limb muscles. Progressive muscle contractures were not found. In the early stage of the disease the restriction of movements was connected with pain full nodules，删除1换行but in the later stage with severe weakness and atrophy of muscles. Thus in these cases localized nodular myositis was a prelude of polymyositis.\n\n【21】In our patient the disease started with oedema， painfulness，“woody\"firmness and stiffness of lower leg and pelvic girdle muscles with rather fast， almost simultaneous， development of contractures of these muscles. Just pronounced contractures of muscles themselves， but not muscle weakness became the cause of sharp limitation of range of movements in our patient.\n\n【22】The clinical picture in our patient differs from the clinical picture in patients with “Stiff Person Syndrome”(SPS). In SPS patient the muscles of the arms and legs don't have “woody\"consistency during palpation， as well as painless nodules of “woody”firmness within some muscles of arms and legs， and pronounced contractures of muscles， which sharply limit patient's movements. Our patient as well had no fluctuating muscular rigidity with repeated episodes of painful muscle spasms which are characteristic for SPS. In SPS patients at initial stage of the disease as a rule there are no signs resembling thrombophlebitis with lower leg oedema and skin hyperemia that we observed in our patient. Unfortunately， in that period we could not determine anti-GAD antibodies that are characteristic of the SPS.\n\n【23】Bradley et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[33]</u> described three patients aged 23， 4 and 6 with extreme perimysial and less endomysial fibrosis that was a result of contractures of muscles which caused the limitation of movements more than muscle weakness. However in these patients the disease began in early childhood and they had no“woodynodules within the muscles， although muscles in Case 1 and Case 3 were extremely firm with “woody\"consistency during palpation.\n\n【24】Earlier Walton and Adams named such cases as \"chronic myositis fibrosa\" and suggested them to represent simply a chronic phase of polymyositis 通用删除6(英):<u>[34]</u>. However in our patient the contractures of muscles of “woody\"firmness developed at the beginning of the disease， and proceeded during 4-6 months， so according to Hudgson our case can be attributed to subacute polymyositis， and not chronic one 通用删除6(英):<u>[26]</u>.\n\n【25】In our patient the picture of morphological changes in the muscle somehow resembled the changes which were observed by some authors 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，7，9]</u>. However coarse degenerative changes of muscle fibers with their replacement by fibrous connective tissue and fat， as it was reported in the cases of the authors cited were not found in our case. The most prominent feature in our case was the extreme increase of connective tissue with massive lympho-histiocytic infiltrates predominantly in perimysial space， and scattered atrophy and degenerative changes of some muscle fibers. All slides of this muscle biopsy specimen were discussed in 1990 at the Round table consultation service of selected cases (Head Prof. Dr. Schroder J.M.) at the VII International Congress on Neuromuscular Diseases in Munchen， Germany.\n\n【26】Histological diagnosis was polymyositis. Activity of the serum enzymes was normal in our patient. It was possibly connected with the absence of rough damage of muscle fibers as well as by extreme increase of connective tissue and a long standing disease 通用删除6(英):<u>[2，35]</u>. At EMG one could see changes resembling polymyositis 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>.\n\nHowever， the clinical picture of the disease in our patient differs greatly from “pure”polymyositis. He had painless muscles of“woody”firmness and intramuscular “woody”swellings resembling sarcoma， which developed after the pronounced muscle contractures|删除段之间换行|The latter caused sharp limitation of movements in large joints of extremities practically through the whole duration of the disease. Extreme perimysial fibrosis without coarse damage of muscle fibres， which usually cause severe muscle contractures， and without visible muscle weakness and atrophy characterized our case.\n\n【28】Thus in our case at the basis of peculiarities of clinical picture， histological muscle changes， EMG results， and some improvement from prednisolone and cyclophosphane treatment we suppose that the localized nodular myositis was one of clinical signs of subacute fibrosing polymyositis.\n\n【29】Sarcoid nodular myositis was excluded because at muscle biopsy no typical sarcoid histological changes including necrotic zones and interstitial granulomas with multinucleated giant cells and epithelioid cells were found 通用删除6(英):<u>[36-38]</u>. Also chest X-ray picture showed no enlarged lymph nodules. Absence of the calcifications， osteoid and cartilage formations on radiographs of the arm and leg muscles allowed to exclude myositis ossificans progressive 通用删除6(英):<u>[39，40]</u>. It is quite possible that localized nodular myositis in some cases is a clinical and pathological and even immunological entity 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，13，14，19-24，27，29，41，]</u>，but in other rare cases it may be the first manifestation of polymyositis or one of the clinical signs of subacute fibrosing polymyositis as we observed in our case 7，17，18，31，32.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

Histologically they appear as small round blue cells， but this is nonspecific with broad differentials. The ESWR1 break-apart rearrangement using fluorescence in-situ hybridization is pathognomonic for Ewing’s sarcoma. Patients with extra skeletal Ewing sarcoma family have a poor prognosis， with median survival ranging between 8 to 15 months in two different case series. Among patients with cancer，approximately 5% develop a critical illness requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission. We report a case of a young female who developed acute respiratory failure secondary to this rare malignancy that required intensive care treatment. Unlike other reported cases， our patient had a large lung and mediastinal mass with pleura but no bony involvement， associated massive pleural effusion necessitating chest tube insertion， subsequent intensive care admission with invasive ventilatory support. This case highlights the importance of supportive intensive care needed to treat this aggressive disease mainly affecting children and young adults.\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Cancer patients who require treatment in the intensive care unit (ICU) is growing. In a large retrospective observational study using cancer registry data in the United Kingdom， 5% of cancer patients developed a critical illness and were admitted to an ICU within 2 years of cancer diagnosis通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>.

We report a unique case of a young female who developed acute respiratory failure secondary to this rare malignancy that required intensive care treatment.\n\n【6】Case Presentation\n\n【7】This was a 30-year-old Indonesian female who was admitted in our hospital， a large tertiary hospital in Singapore. She was a non-smoker/non-drinker with no known past medical history and had no family history of malignancy， tuberculosis， or autoimmune disorder. She presented with dry cough for a month， associated with worsening shortness of breath and left sided pleuritic chest pain. This was accompanied by a loss of appetite and weight over the past 3 weeks.\n\n【8】On examination， she was tachypneic and lethargic， temperature 36.8°C， blood pressure 113/65mmHg， heart rate 97 per minute， pulse oximetry reading 98% on supplemental oxygen at 2 L/min. There were reduced breath sounds in the left lung， and no lymph nodes or breast lumps were palpable.\n\n【9】She had opacification of the left hemithorax with contralateral trachea shift on erect chest radiograph ， with massive pleural effusion found on ultrasound. A chest tube was placed which drained 1350 ml of hemoserous fluid. The pleural fluid was exudative by Light's criteria and lymphocytic (80%) on analysis. Fluid lactate de hydrogenase (LDH) was elevated at 962 U/L and fluid pH was 7.32. Fluid acid fast bacilli smear was negative and no growth was obtained from fluid bacterial cultures.\n\n【10】Computed tomography of the thorax， abdomen and pelvis showed a large heterogeneous mass in the left hemithorax and mediastinum， encasing the left main bronchus causing collapse of the left lung. There was a filling defect in the left main pulmonary artery， which was also encased by tumor. Extensive nodular pleural thickening in the left hemithorax was present， inseparable from the mass. There was also a moderate sized pericardial effusion. No bony erosions were identified. Enlarged upper left para-aortic nodes were noted with a short axis diameter of 1.6 cm. An ill-defined hypodense lesion was noted in the segment IVB of the liver measuring 1.8 cm x 1.4 cm. No enhancing cerebral masses were noted on subsequent contrasted computed tomography of the brain.\n\n【11】She underwent a radiological-guided lung biopsy. The specimen was fixed in 10% neutral formalin and embedded in paraffin. Sections(4-micron thick) were cut and stained with hematoxylin-eosin and periodic acid-schiff (PAS).\n\n【12】The core biopsy showed sheets of small， round， and blue cells， divided into irregular lobules by fibrous stroma. The tumor cells possessed scant cytoplasm and small nucleoli. At least two rosette-like formations were identified. Some rounded globule material in the cytoplasm was highlighted by the PAS stain.\n\n【13】Immunohistochemical studies using commercial antibodies listed in Table 1 was performed. Protocols recommended by the manufacturers were used. Appropriate positive and negative controls were included. The tumor appeared to be diffusely positive with CD99 ， and was positive for CD56. The tumor cells were negative for AE1/3， CAM5.2， EMA， (CD45)LCA， CD79A， CD3， CD20， TdT， TTF-1， S100， Desmin， Synaptophysin， Chromogranin and ALK-1， which negate the differential diagnosis of an epithelial/\n\n【14】A fluorescence in situ (FISH) study for EWSR1 (EWS RNA-binding protein 1) gene rearrangement with a break-apart 22q12probe (test developed by the Cytogenetics Laboratory， Department of Pathology， Singapore General Hospital) was performed. These dual-color fluorescent labeled probes hybridize the telomeric and centromeric flanking regions of EWSR1. Where fusion signals exist， no break apart is present. Cells with split signals are considered positive for the ESWR1 break-apart rearrangement， which is present in this case 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. These findings were pathognomonic for Ewing's sarcoma in this context.\n\n【15】During her admission， she was later noted to be drowsy and found to be hypercapnic. She was intubated for type 2 respiratory failure and mechanically ventilated in the intensive care unit. Repeat chest radiograph showed a new right lower zone consolidation， so she was started on intravenous meropenem for hospital acquired pneumonia.\n\n【16】She was consequentlyinitiated on chemotherapywith Vincristine， Doxorubicin， Cyclophosphamide， and received granulocyte-colony stimulating factor post-chemotherapy. Her hospital course was complicated by diarrhea secondary to Clostridiumn difficile infection. This eventually resolved， and she was transferred back to her home country to continue further chemotherapy. Unfortunately， she was lost to follow up since then.\n\n【17】Discussion\n\n【18】This case report highlights the challenges managing a rare aggressive tumor in a young female patient.\n\n【19】Table 1： Antibodies used for the characterisation of the small round blue cell tumour.\n\n| Antigen  | Source  | Product Code  | Clone  | Antigen Retrieval Method  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| AE1/3  | DAKO  | M3515  | AE1 and AE3  | Enzyme  |\n| CD3  | NOVOCASTRA  | NCL-L-CD3-565  | LN10  | HIFR  |\n| CD5  | NOVOCASTRA  | NCL-L-CD5-4C7  | 4C7  | HIFR  |\n| CD20  | DAKO  | M0755  | L26  | HIFR  |\n| CD45  | DAKO  | M0701  | 2B11+PD7/26  | HIFR  |\n| CD56  | NOVOCASTRA  | PA0191  | CD564  | HIFR  |\n| CD79a  | DAKO  | M7050  | JCB117  | HIFR  |\n| CK19  | DAKO  | M0888  | RCK108  | HIFR  |\n| Chromogranin A  | DAKO  | M0869  | DAK-A3  | HIFR  |\n| Desmin  | DAKO  | M0760  | D33  | HIFR  |\n| EMA  | DAKO  | M0613  | E29  | HIFR  |\n| Ki67  | DAKO  | M7240  | MIB1  | HIFR  |\n| P16  | Ventana  | 705-4713  | E6H4  | HIFR  |\n| S100  | DAKO  | Z0311  | Polyclonal  | Enzyme  |\n| Synaptophysin  | NOVOCASTRA  | NCL-L-SYNAP-299  | 27G12  | HIFR  |\n| TdT  | NOVOCASTRA  | NCL-L-TdT-339  | SEN28  | HIFR  |\n| TTF-1  | NOVOCASTRA  | NCL-L-TTF-1  | SPT24  | HIFR  |\n| EBER-ISH  | NOVOCASTRA  | AR0833  | N.A  | Enzyme  |\n| CD99  | NOVOCASTRA  | NCL-CD99  | H036-1.1  | HIER  |\n| ALK  | Ventana  | 790-4794  | D5F3  | HIFR  |\n\n【21】EMA： Epithelial Membrane Antigen， TDT： Terminal Deoxynucleatidyl Transferase； TTF-1： Thyroid Transcription Factor-1； EBER-ISH： Epstein-Barr Virus-Encoded Small RNAs-Insitu Hybridisation； ALK： Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase， HIER： Heat-Induced Epitope Retrieval. \"Sources were as follows： Dako： Dako Denmark A/S， Glostrup， Denmark； Novocastra： Novocastra， Leica Biosystems Newcastle Ltd， Newcastle， United Kingdom； Ventana： Ventana Medical Systems Inc， Arizona， USA.\n\n【22】Small blue round cell tumors have a typical clear cytoplasm on hematoxylin and eosin staining， due to the presence of glycogen. The differentials of small round blue cell tumors are broad， including Ewingsarcoma1family，lymphoma，small-cellosteosarcoma， mesenchymal chondrosarcoma， dedifferentiated synovial sarcoma， desmoplastic small round cell tumors and rhabdomyosarcoma 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>.\n\n【23】In 1979， Askin et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u> described an aggressive primitive neuro ectodermal tumor (PNET) of the thoracopulmonary region primarily involving children and young adults. The most common radiographic manifestation is a chest wall soft-tissue density mass， sometimes associated with rib erosion with or without pleural effusion 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>. Over the past decades， the Ewing sarcoma family of tumors is classified according to their histologic appearance from undifferentiated Ewing sarcoma (ES)， to atypical poorly differentiated ES and differentiated PNET.\n\n【24】In the 2013 World Health Organization classification of tumors of soft tissue and bone 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>， the term PNET was removed to minimize confusion with the histologically and genetically different PNET of the central nervous system and female genital tract.\n\n【25】The Ewing sarcoma family of tumors (ESFT) share similar immunohistochemistry， and is positive for MIC2 surface antigen(CD99 gene). Cytogenetically， the translocation t 通用删除7(英):<u>(11，22)</u> (q24； q12) is pathognomonic， occurs in 85% of cases and gives rise to the formation of the EWS-FLI 1 fusion gene which is detected by FISH.\n\nA Korean case series of 70 patients studied over 17 years reported the characteristics of extra skeletal Ewing sarcoma. Most primary tumors manifested as large and bulky soft-tissue masses (mean size，9.0 cm； range， 1.3 cm to 23.0 cm)， frequently invading adjacent organs|删除段之间换行|(45.6%) and showed heterogeneous enhancement (73.7%)， a well-defined (66.7%) margin， and partial necrosis or cystic degeneration(81.9%). Metastasis was most frequent to lymph nodes (75.9%)， followed by bone (31.0%)， lung (20.7%)， abdominal solid organs(13.8%)， peritoneum (13.8%)，pleura (6.9%)， and brain (3.4%)通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>.\n\n【27】Ewing sarcoma family of tumors is highly aggressive， with common local recurrence and distant metastases. The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) tumor， node and metastases (TMN) staging systems 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u> for primary tumors of bone and soft tissue sarcoma are not widely used for Ewing family of tumors， but are sometimes used for staging of Askin's tumors. Using the AJCC TNM staging system for soft tissue sarcoma 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>， our patient would be classified to have T2b (deep tumor/mediastinal involvement)， likely N1 (involvement of para-aortic and axillary regional nodes)， and M1with possible liver metastasis， consistent with stage III disease， stage IV ifhistologicallyconfirmed distant spread. tumors that arise outside skin or subcutaneous sites have a worse prognosis 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>. Standard guidelines are absent for the treatment of Askin's tumors. However the main stay of treatment based on case series includes neo adjuvant chemotherapy， surgical resection 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u> and adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>.\n\n【28】The median survival in Askin’s first case series 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u> was 8 months. A Chinese case series of 11 patients (mean age 14.5 years old， range8-22 years old) with Askin tumor found that the median survival for combined (chemotherapy-surgery-radiotherapy) treatment was 15months. Poor prognosis was associated with tumor diameter >5 cm， LDH levels >240 U/l and late stage (stage III or IV) tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u>.\n\n【29】The overall survival in sarcoma in the ICU is comparable with删除1换行other critically ill patients with other solid tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>. However， among patients with multiple organ failures， cancer patients had higher mortality rates than non-cancer patients 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. In a retrospective study performed in a large cancer hospital in the United States， the mortality rate for sarcoma in the ICU was 23% (95%CI， 16.9% to29.6%)， which rose to 59% at six months 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. Acute respiratory failure is the most common cause of ICU admission in cancer patients， and often leads to mechanical ventilation， however，survival remains poor通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>.\n\n【30】Unlike other reported cases， our patient had a large lung and mediastinal mass with pleura but no bony involvement， associated massive pleural effusion necessitating chest tube insertion， intensive care admission with in vasive ventilatory support. This case highlights the importance of supportive intensive care needed to treat this aggressive disease mainly affecting children and young adults. In youngpatients with expected good lung reserve， respiratory symptoms may manifest late in the natural progression of Askin tumors without external chest wall signs. Careful respiratory examination followed by an initial chest radiograph can possibly detect this devastating tumor at an earlier stage.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

The virus has since spread all across the world. Fever， fatigue， and respiratory problems， which can progress to pneumonia， are some of the symptoms. Symptoms usually emerge between 2 days and14 days.\n\n【2】Since being exposed to said virus， patients develop new， persistent or recurrent chronic health problems known as post-COVID diseases. Even Patients who did not suffer COVID-19symptoms in the days or weeks following their infection may also develop post-COVID issues. These conditions， also known as Long COVID，long-haul COVID， post-acute COVID-19， might manifest themselves as various combinations of health issues throughout days or weeks. Long term complications of these conditions include issues of cardiovascular system， respiratory system， neurologic system， psychiatric conditions etc.\n\n【3】Dysarthria is one of the reported post COVID condition. ASHA refers to Dysarthria as “a group of neurogenic speech disorders characterized by \"abnormalities in the strength， speed， range， steadiness， tone， or accuracy of movements required for breathing， phonatory， resonatory， articulatory， or prosodic aspects of speech production\" 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. These abnormalities are due to one or more sensorimotor problems-including weakness or paralysis， in coordination， involuntary movements， or excessive， reduced， or variable muscle tone 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>.\n\n【4】Typically dysarthria is caused due to any pathophysiological altercations in the nervous system like cerebrovascular incidents， neural infection， and degenerative conditions etc. Dysarthria following COVID-19 infection is predominantly caused either due to stroke 通用删除6(英):<u>[2-4]</u>， or due to infections ofnervous systems like meningitis and encephalitis 通用删除6(英):<u>[5-7]</u>. However， very rarely COVID-19virus by itself directly damages the speech musculature thus causing dysarthria. Even though some authors have reported skeletal muscle pain and weakness in cases post-COVID-19 通用删除6(英):<u>[8，9]</u>， it is seldom reflected in the speech and language functions. In this report， we present such a case that did not have marked motoric weakness but had significant dysarthric component post COVID.\n\n【5】Objectives\n\n【6】Report the in depth evaluation of case with Dysarthria Post COVID-19 infection.\n\n【7】Detail the relationship between post-COVID condition and dysarthria.\n\n【8】Methods\n\n【9】A 52-year-old male with a history of COVID-19 came to our department after 8 months of post-infection. The client reported progressive slurring of speech， left-sided tongue deviations， and swallowing difficulty following COVID-19 infection. The client underwent objective as well as subjective evaluation for all the speech and language parameters.\n\n【10】Screening MRI of brain was done followed by nerve conduction study. The client underwent detailed subjective evaluation of all the speech subsystem during which each speech subsystems namely； respiratory， phonatory， articulatory，resonatory and prosodic， were assessed using various task. Respiratory subsystem was assessed by observing the client's breathing at rest as well as during speech. To assess the patient s respiration， he was instructed to take a deep breath in via the mouth and let it out slowly. The patient was instructed to count to 20 as rapidly as possible on one breath to assess respiration in speech. During this the client’s breathing pattern， effort， capacity etc during expiration and inspiration was recorded. Phonatory subsystem was assessed by asking the client to删除1换行produce /a/， /i/， /u/ sound at length as well as during conversation with the client. The duration to which the client can prolong the vowel is jotted together with the pitch， loudness and quality of client’s voice. Pitch and loudness scaling was carried out to assess pitch and loudness range. The first task for assessing articulatory subsystem included conversing with the client while the second task included picture/topic description. During the course of these tasks， the errors in production of various consonant and vowel sounds are recorded with comment on overall intelligibility of speech. Resonatory system was assessed by asking the client to produce /mae/ and /pae/alternatively. The perceptible difference between both the sounds was scrutinized. Also， the nasality during phonation of /a/ was noted. Prosodic system assessment included the reading of contrastive stress words and informal assessment of rhythm and intonation during various conversation instances (questions， narratives， statements etc).\n\n【11】Objective evaluation conducted included Dr. Speech (Tiger DRS， Inc) for phonatory-respiratory system， Electroglottography(Tiger DRS， Inc) for phonatory system. Fundamental frequency， jitter， shimmer， amplitude tremor， ofthe sounds /a/， /e/ and /u/ were recorded using Dr Speech software. Frenchay Dysarthria Assessment was administered for rating the overall severity of dysarthria 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>.\n\n【12】Dysphagia evaluation was carried out subjectively. The client was asked whether he cough or choke while eating. He was also asked whether he had difficulty in clearing throat following which the client was observed while drinking } cup of cold water and then while eating a cookie. The client was questioned whether he had any difficulties swallowing， eating quickly， or having limits on the sorts of things he could consume.\n\n【13】Objective evaluation impression\n\n【14】Oromotor examination was carried out subjectively to chart the weakness at the level of articulators. Structural abnormality of lips at rest was observed. The patient was asked to give an exaggerated smile to check lip spreading. Lip seal was assessed by blowing air into cheeks and by maintain for 15 sec. And then the patient was asked to say /P/./P/ crisply and clearly for 10 times. Lips articulatory movements were tested by repeating “oo ee” for 10 segments in 10sec. The movements of lips in conversation were observed. Palatal maintenance was assessed by asking the patient to say-“ah-ah-ah\"for. Tongue at rest was assessed by asking the patient to open his mouth. Tongue functions like protrusion， elevation，lateral movements were assessed. Alternate movements of tongue were assessed by asking the patient to say \"ka la” for 10 times as quickly as possible. Intelligibility of words was also assessed.\n\n【15】Results删除表格换行normal except for tongue and lips. Lips are structurally normal but the rate of motion is reduced. Tongue is symmetrical at rest， and atrophy is present at center portion. Fasciculation/fibrillations are also evident with mild limitation in range and rate of motion.\n\n【16】Table 11 reveals the obiective evaluation done andtheir respective results. The client’s imaging reports reveal mild diffuse neuroparenchymal atrophy. Nerve conduction study report shows， Axonal motor neuropathy involving bilateral peroneal nerves.

As shown in the Table 4， results of subjective evaluation of all subsystems of speech with swallowing assessment convey the patient to be mildly dysarthric.\n\n【30】Discussion\n\n【31】Through an in depth evaluation， our client was provisionally diagnosed with mild Dysarthria. The client possessed weakness in删除1换行the speech musculature. Surprisingly， the weakness commenced after the recovery from COVID-19 infection. However， the client did not have any conventional positive etiology for his dysarthric component albeit having hypertension. The hypertension as well originated as a post COVID-19 condition. The diffuse parenchymal atrophy reported in the imaging can be attributed to age related neurophysiological alterations. It cannot account for the speech deficits portrayed by the client， as it developed acutely post COVID-19 as opposed to progressive slurring typically reported in age-related speech deteriorations. Furthermore， the peroneal neuropathy reported in the client， would not directly affect speech. Hence， considering all of these facts， we can establish that hypertension was the direct cause of dysarthria. Even though hypertension has been along-established risk factor for dysarthria by virtue of its role in cardiovascular incidences， it in itself is rarely considered as the causative agent. Our case report substantiate the finding that hypertension alone can lead to weakness in muscles thereby leading to dysarthria.\n\n【32】The pathophysiology behind this sequela can stem from the degrading effect of hypertension on the body. As most of the muscles involved in speech are highly vascular in nature， they are immensely vulnerable to the adverse effect of hypertension. The prolonged contraction in these muscles as a response to increased blood pressure can bring about generalized soreness in them， which would result in overall fatigue with mild dysarthric speech. Another major reason that dominates the previous could be that COVID-19 virus interacts with the angiotensin converting enzyme and angiotensin receptors located in the endothelium thereby altering the pathophysiological删除表格换行functioning of Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) that regulates the blood pressure 通用删除6(英):<u>[11-14]</u>. The altered neurochemical changes in RAS system can bring about atrophy and weakness of muscles， as the RAS axis catalyses major functions like contractile activity and damage control through the regulation of sodium balance， fluids volume， and some other hemodynamic features， of the muscles 通用删除6(英):<u>[15-17]</u>. These alterations in the physicality of muscles could be reflected in diminished functions of the speech subsystems too， because of its motoric nature.\n\n【33】Table 4： Impressions of subjective evaluation.\n\n| Subjective evaluation  |  | Results  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Evaluation of subsystem  | Articulation  | Distorted lingual sounds with reduced intelligibility of speech  |\n| Evaluation of subsystem  | Phonation  | /a：/-6.05s  |\n| Evaluation of subsystem  | Phonation  | /i/-5.98s  |\n| Evaluation of subsystem  | Phonation  | /u：-5.77s  |\n| Evaluation of subsystem  | Phonation  | s/z-0.77s  |\n| Evaluation of subsystem  | Respiration  | Abdominal breathing present with inadequate respiratory support  |\n| Evaluation of subsystem  | Resonation  | Hyponasal sound with reduced nasal emission.  |\n| Evaluation of subsystem  | Prosody  | Inadequate stress  |\n| Swallowing Assessment  |  | Chewing difficulty for solids and occasionally chocking is observed after drinking liquids.

According to the figure there is mild ta moderate irregularity of glottal wave with mild hypoadduction of vacal fald in aur client.  |\n| --- |\n\n【37】Adding onto this， is the age related changes occurring in the neuromotor system. As age progress the muscles tends to show morphological changes like loss of fiber， loss of mass， reducedtonicity etc. with functional difficulties including reduced rate and range of movement 通用删除6(英):<u>[18-21]</u>. As our client is just beginning the fifth decade of his life， these degenerations would not have been severe. Nevertheless， as the neuromotor compensatory skills lessen with increasing age， the COVID-19 infection attack would have made the motoric system more vulnerable，henceforth adding to the already existing weakness.\n\n【38】Hence， compiling all the points of discussion we can effectively point out COVID-19 and post COVID hypertension as causative agent of dysarthria in our client.\n\n【39】Conclusion\n\n【40】Apart from the debilitating and life threatening results of COVID-19 infection， it can also cause secondary conditions like hypertension， dysarthria etc. through alteration of systems like RAS. This can hinder the quality of life in the infected patient post recovery. Therefore， it is necessary for us to understand and report these effects and help in rehabilitating these conditions with success.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

A case series of clinical suspect of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the central nervous system (n=8) were analyzed. Cerebral Spinal Fluid (CSF) and nasopharyngeal swab were analyzed by RT-PCR. Our results showed SARS-CoV-2 in five CSF samples and three patients testing positive for COVID-19 also on nasopharyngeal swab. The patients showed different clinical manifestations， including <95% saturation， fever， cough， dyspnea and abdominal pain. The findings of this study alert to the existence of nonspecific symptoms associated with central nervous system infection caused by SARS-CoV-2.\n\n【2】Keywords： SARS-CoV-2；COVID-19； Cerebrospinal fluid； RT-PCR\n\n【3】Short Com munication\n\n【4】In December 2019， cases of severe acute respiratorysyndrome emerged and were after associated with SARS-CoV-2. Since then， reports have described neurological manifestations in addition to the typical clinical symptoms of COVID-19. This virus can spread from the respiratory system to the central nervous system， using transneuronal and hematogenous mechanisms. Although not all COVID-19 patient test positive for the virus in the cerebrospinal fluid exam， the appearance of neurological symptoms associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection reveals the importance of understanding the neurologic manifestations and capacity for neural invasion associated with the pathogen. These aspects are relevant for correct diagnosis and treatment and for the potential development of vaccines 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>.\n\n【5】Hospitalized patients with COVID-19， especialy those with severe disease， can display neurological disorders as shown by Mao et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>， such as acute cerebrovascular disease in up to5.7%， impaired consciousness in 14.8%， and skeletal muscle injury in 19.3% of cases. Nonetheless， COVID-19 seems to be associated with a wide spectrum of neurological manifestations including meningoencephalitis 通用删除6(英):<u>[3-5]</u>， encephalomyelitis 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>， Guillain-Barre Syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>， and perfusion abnormalities in brain magnetic resonance imaging 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. This study highlights the evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection with a focus on neurological involvement and laboratorial diagnosis， based in a case series.\n\n【6】We describe cases of clinical suspect of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the central nervous system. The patients (n=8) were admitted in a Brazilian public hospital. Cerebral Spinal Fluid (CSF) and nasopharyngeal swab were obtained for laboratorial tests. The samples were analyzed by RT-PCR using technical protocol based on the Center of Disease Control.\n\n【7】Ours results showed SARS-CoV-2 in five CSF samples. Of the total， 3 patients also presented positive test for COVID-19 in nasopharyngeal swab. The patients showed different patterns of clinical manifestations， including <95% saturation， fever， cough， dyspnea and abdominal pain.\n\n【8】Laboratorial analysis of 3 CSF samples by RT-PCR did not demonstrate the presence of the virus. Of the 8 patients evaluated， 6 were newborns， 3 of them were children of mothers with COVID-19during the pregnancy .\n\n【9】This study describes cases of COVID-19 with clinical presentation and positive RT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 in CSF. To our knowledge， this presentation of COVID-19 is little reported so far and is important to consider as an atypical manifestation of the viral infection. Our findings reinforce data obtained by Huang et al. 通用删除7(英):<u>(2020)</u>通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u> that RT-PCR of SARS-CoV-2 in CSF can be删除1换行cited.\n\n【10】Footnote： Blank columns means no symptoms or negative lab test； Black columns means presence of symptoms or positive laboratory test； ITU： Intensive Treatment Unit CSF： Cerebral spinal fluid.删除1换行considered as a detection modality for cases of COVID-19 affecting the central nervous system.\n\n【11】We demonstrate that patients with COVID-19 displaying distinct neurological disorders have extremely low levels of SARS-CoV-2in CSF， according high CT (cycle threshold) value of the samples， indicating that viral clearance precede the neurological involvement. It is important to emphasize that the RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2detection in CSFhas not been validated yet. Besides that， undetectable results in some CSF samples of patients could be false negative. This finding points to the need for the development of more sensitive molecular tests and the investigation of other neurotropic pathogens to exclude neuroinfection.\n\n【12】Considering the sole report of a severe case ofmeningoencephalitis with detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA in CSF 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>， likely presenting a low viral load since just one of two RT-qPCR assays turned positive at a cycle CT of 37， we can assume that whether SARS-CoV-2 is detectable in CSF， it may depend on disease severity， the time of sample collection or the sensitivity of the molecular test used. On the other hand， herpes simplex viruses 1 and 2， varicella zoster virus， and enterovirus are responsible for the greatest number of CNS infection in immunocompetent hosts 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>. Therefore， CSF investigation of COVID-19 patients presenting with GBS or CNS manifestations to exclude concurrent neuroinfection with other neurotropic viruses should be encouraged 通用删除6(英):<u>[4，8]</u>\n\n【13】It was not possible to perform the next generation sequencing in the positive samples， to determine the genetic variant responsible for the infection， because this methodology requires a high viral load，删除1换行consequently， a low Ct value. Based on the SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance network in Brazil， during the period in which the present studysampleswere collected，the variantofconcernthatpredominated was Gamma 通用删除11(英):<u>(P.1)</u>， with an occurrence of 85% in the month of March2021， 93.8% in April and 95.5% in May. It may be reasonable to infer that the variant responsible for the CNS manifestations was Gamma by the circulation scenario at the time 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>.\n\n【14】Few cases of encephalitis/meningitis with positive RT-PCR assays of the CSF have been described 通用删除6(英):<u>[1-81</u>. This can be attributed to several reasons： The RT-PCR assay of CSF may yield negative results when performed early； the method has limited sensitivity associated with false negative tests in CSF；and low viral load in the CSF 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>.\n\n【15】Cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection with invasion of the nervous system are being described with the emergence of the new pandemic due to the infectious disease COVID-19. Patients with COVID-19maypresent initially neurologicaallSsymptomIsSor experience neurological complications during hospitalization. The diagnosis of neuro-COVID-19 can be challenging. Since SARS-CoV-2 has neuroinvasive and neurotropic properties， early recognition can help initiate treatment and isolation early， to prevent clinical worsening and spread of the virus and the underreporting of neurological cases associated with COVID-19 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>.\n\n【16】Recent observations suggested possible neurological complications of COVID-19， including the first report of suspected viral encephalitis. We report a case of a 29-year-old male with on nasopharyngeal testing- confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection with severe respiratory symptoms， followed by clinical and radiological删除1换行signs ofencephalitis. Magnetic resonance imaging ofthe brain showed an asymmetric FLAIR-hyperintensity of the left medial temporal cortex associated with mild gyral expansion. Lumbar puncture was normal and PCR for SARS-CoV-2 on CSF were negative. Clinicians treating SARS-CoV-2 infected patients should be aware of possible neurological complications， like encephalitis. The diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 encephalitis is difficult as the laboratory analysis of the CSF may not be altered 通用删除6(英):<u>[9，11]</u>\n\n【17】Clinicians treating SARS-CoV-2 infected patients should be aware of possible neurological complications. In case of suspected meningoencephalitis， additional exams should be performed such as brain MRI scan， long-term EEG monitoring， and lumbar puncture. However， the absence of a typical CSF profile of viral meningitis/encephalitis as well as the negative PCR for SARS-CoV-2 in CSF， makes diagnosing encephalitis linked to SARS-CoV-2 less obvious9，12.\n\n【18】One ofthe studylimitations was the lack of follow-up of diagnosed patients. This follow-up was not possible because the diagnosis was performed as a service to the municipal health authorities，therefore， there were no personnel and financial resources available for this purpose.\n\n【19】Conclusion\n\n【20】The findings of this study alert to the existence of nonspecific symptoms associated with central nervous system infection caused by SARS-CoV-2. This raises the need for laboratory examination to detect this virus in CSF samples and subsequent early and assertive treatment. Further studies are important to elucidate mechanisms of pathogenesis， protocols of clinical management， and laboratory practices of SARS-CoV-2 neurological manifestations.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

We present a woman with CH and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus(SLE)， whose Fertility Preservation (FP) in pregnancy-prohibitedphase may have contributed to BP control and a livebirth. A 33-vear-old woman with CH and SLE conceived twins in SLE remission， without BP control. Both SLE flare and superimposed preeclampsia occurred， and the pregnancy was terminated because of renal dysfunction at 20 weeks. She presented with depression and decreased medical adherence， resulting in prolonged hypertension and pregnancy prohibition. FP was started 40 weeks after stillbirth， and a blastocyst was preserved at the fifth oocyte retrieval. Her medical adherence improved， and her BP became 120-130/90-100 mmHg. After thawed embryo transfer， she conceived a singleton pregnancy. Her BP was 120-130/70-90 mmHg during this pregnancy. At 32 weeks， she delivered a baby due to abnormal findings in Cardiotocogram. In this case， FP may have contributed to BP control and a livebirth. To our knowledge， this is the first report of FP in a pregnancy-prohibited woman with CH or SLE.\n\n【2】Keywords： Autoimmune disease； Fertility preservation； Hypertension； Pregnancy； Systemic lupus erythematosus\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Pregnancy with Chronic Hypertension (CH) is a high-risk pregnancy because the incidence of Superimposed Preeclampsia (SPE)， preterm birth， Fetal Growth Restriction (FGR)， fetal/neonatal death， maternal death， and maternal cardiovascular morbidities such as heart failure， renal failure， stroke， and pulmonary edema are 3 to 10 times more frequent in patients with CH than in normotensive women 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. It is well accepted that Blood Pressure (BP) control， before conception or since early pregnancy， is important. However， the target BP is controversial. The International Society for the Study of Hypertension in Pregnancy (ISSHP) states that the target BP should be in the range of 110-140/80-85 mmHg 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>， and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence(NICE) recommends a target BP of 135/85 mmHg 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. In contrast， in 2019， the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommended that anti-hypertensive therapy for CH should be started when pregnant women have a BP≥160/110 mmHg， and that the target BP should be 120-159/80-109 mmHg 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. This recommendation is based on the finding that strict control of diastolic BP did not improve maternal/fetal outcomes. In April 2022，however，ACOG revised the target BP to 140/90 mmHg 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>， based on the results of the Chronic Hypertension and Pregnancy study.\n\n【5】Pregnancy with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is also a high-risk pregnancy 通用删除6(英):<u>[6-8]</u>. A study including patients with active and inactive disease at conception， showed a significantly higher incidence of hypertension， renal disease， preeclampsia， preterm delivery， cesarean delivery， FGR， and neonatal death in women with SLE than in women without SLE 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>. For women with SLE， conception is recommended after at least 6 months disease remission， which is based on reports showing that pregnancy loss is significantly higher in women who had active SLE during 6 months删除1换行before conception than in those who were in remission for >6 months before conception 通用删除6(英):<u>[6，7，9]</u>. In Japan， the criteria for pregnancy in women with autoimmune disease are based on renal function. The estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) should be ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m. No such criteria for BP exist 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>.\n\n【6】Here we present the case of a woman with CH and SLE who had a healthy baby after BP was controlled before pregnancy. It was suggested that embryo preservation during pregnancy-prohibited period may have contributed to improvement in depression and medical adherence， resulting in BP control and a livebirth. To our knowledge， this is the first report on the embryo preservation in pregnancy-prohibited woman with CH or SLE.\n\n【7】Case Presentation\n\n【8】A 21-year-old woman presented to our hospital with cheek erythema， oral ulcers， finger arthralgia， and thrombocytopenia； she was subsequently diagnosed with SLE at the department of rheumatology in our hospital. Her BP was normal， and her medical history was uneventful. An evaluation of the patient’s family history showed that her mother had hepatic cancer， but there was no family history of autoimmune diseases， hypertension， thrombosis， or sudden death. The patient showed positive results in autoantibody tests for anti-DNA， anti-RNP， anti-Smith， anti-SSA， anti-SSB， and Lupus Anticoagulant (LA)， and negative results for anti-cardiolipin and anti-B2 Glycoprotein I (B2-GPI). SLE flares were observed twice during the following 2 years. During the second flare， her BP was130/80 mmHg. Subsequently， she was in remission and was taking 7mg/day Prednisolone (PSL) and 4 mg/day Tacrolimus (TAC). She got married at the age of 30 years， and her disease remained in remission. She conceived spontaneously at 31 years of age， but the pregnancy resulted in a miscarriage at 7 weeks. LA and anti-B2-GPI tests were删除1换行repeated 8 weeks after the miscarriage， but both showed negative results.\n\n【9】The patient subsequently visited a private fertility clinic， and her BP that time was 137/89 mmHg. She conceived dichorionic diamniotictwins after intrauterine insemination in a natural ovulatory cycle at 33 years of age. At 5 weeks of gestation， her BP was 138/102mmHg. At 9 weeks， she presented with thrombocytopenia and skin erythema， and an SLE flare was diagnosed. Her PSL and TAC doses were augmented， and treatment with Hydroxychloroquine sulfate(HCQ) was initiated . At 13 weeks， she was referred to our Obstetrics and Gynecology (OBGY) department， a tertiary perinatal care center， and was subsequently managed in cooperation with the rheumatology department at our institute. At 13 weeks， LA test again showed negative result. Hypertension (150/110 mmHg) was observed at 13 weeks， and methyldopa， labetalol， and amlodipine were administered； however， her BP remained around 150/90mmHg. She was admitted at 17 weeks because thrombocytopenia had not improved. Although intensive immunosuppression therapy， including intravenous immunoglobulin， augmentation of PSL， and initiation of Cyclosporin A (CyA) and azathioprine， was administered for the SLE flare，the thrombocytopenia did not improve. At 20 weeks， rapid progression of renal dysfunction was observed， which was indicated by changes in the serum creatinine levels (from 0.86 mg/dL to 1.19 mg/dL) and the eGFR (from 62.0 mL/min/1.73 m² to 43.4mL/min/1.73 m). Her serum uric acid levels were also elevated (6.8 mg/dL). Because the patient's thrombocytopenia and renal dysfunction did not improve despite intensive immunosuppressive therapy， we concluded that SPE was complicated with the SLE flare， although the gestational age was only 20 weeks. Considering the gestational age， we recommended termination of pregnancy for maternal safety. After obtaining informed consent， therapeutic termination was performed删除表格换行at 20+2 weeks using a cesarean section， and two babies (292 gand 272g) were delivered.\n\n【10】Table 1： Summary of embryo preservation trials.\n\n| Trial  | Weeks afterthe still birth  | Stimulation  | Number of QQcytesretrieved  | Number ofpreservedtrophoblasts  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1s1  | 40  | Short  | 4  | 0  |\n| 2d  | 56  | CC  | 1  | 0  |\n| 3d  | 64  | CC  | 2  | 0  |\n| 41h  | 68  | CC  | 2  | 0  |\n| 51h  | 72  | CC  | 2  | 1  |\n\n【12】CC： Clomiphene Citrate\n\n【13】Afterthestillbirth，immunosuppression therapy was administered more intensively， including steroid pulse therapy (intravenous methylprednisolone， 1，000 mg/day for 3 days)， initiation of mycophenolate mofetil (which is contraindicated during pregnancy)， and augmentation of CyA. As a result， her serum creatinine levels decreased， and platelet counts increased. Although her hypertension was prolonged， she was discharged 28 days after stillbirth.\n\n【14】Following the discharge， SLE was treated with PSL， CyA， HCQ， and belimumab， and renal function test results and platelet counts were controlled within normal ranges . However， her BP remained around 150-160/100-110 mmHg； therefore， pregnancy was not permitted. She became depressed soon after the stillbirth； at approximately 20 weeks after stillbirth，her depression became severe， and she stopped taking prescribed medicines. She contemplated suicide， but it was avoided with the help of a psychiatrist.\n\n【15】As we could not predict when pregnancy would be permitted， a prenatal team of doctors suggested embryo preservation to the fertility treatment team. We proposed that the couple undergo删除1换行embryo preservation 36 weeks after the stillbirth to preserve fertility. The couple chose to proceed with the embryo preservation. Embryo preservation started 40 weeks after the stillbirth . The stimulation methods and outcomes are shown in Table 1. The first trial used the “short”protocol， and the following trials used administration of Clomiphene Citrate (CC). A blastocyst with good morphology was preserved for the first time at the fifth trial 72weeks after the stillbirth. Following the embryo preservation trials， the patient’s depression had ameliorated， and her adherence of medicines improved. Her BP was 120-130/90-100 mmHg， with the systolic BP falling into the normal range. SLE was in remission， and LA was negative once again. Rheumatology and OBGY doctors had a conference and permitted her pregnancy 76 weeks after the stillbirth.\n\n【16】After obtaining informed consent from the couple regarding the risks of pregnancy that included a possibility of twin pregnancy(2% in single blastocyst transfer)， an SLE flare， preterm birth which could result in a neonatal mortality/morbidity， and the risk of mortality/morbidity to the patient， a thawed Embryo Transfer (ET) was performed in a spontaneous ovulatory cycle 80 weeks after the stillbirth. The patient developed a singleton pregnancy. In this pregnancy， her BP was maintained around 120-130/70-90 mmHg. However， serum creatinine was elevated to 0.97 mg/mL at 32+4weeks， and she was subsequently admitted. At 32+5 weeks， elevated serum creatinine (1.06 mg/dL)， decreased eGFR (53 mL/min/1.73m’)， and abnormal findings on Cardiotocogram (loss of variability) were observed； therefore， an emergency cesarean was performed. A 1，580 g baby was delivered with a 5-min Apgar score of 9. After delivery，the serum creatinine levels became normal. Both the mother and baby were in good health 1 year after the delivery.\n\n【17】Discussion\n\n【18】We presented the case of a woman with CH and SLE whose first删除1换行pregnancy resulted in a miscarriage， the second pregnancy (without pre-conceptional BP control) resulted in therapeutic termination at20 weeks， and the third pregnancy (with pre-conceptional BP control) resulted in a livebirth.\n\n【19】First， we estimated that the patient's hypertension was drug-induced due to administration of PSL and TAC for approximately10 vears.\n\n【20】Second， we diagnosed an SLE flare and SPE during the second pregnancy. In the management of pregnancy in patients with SLE， differential diagnosis of SLE flares and Hypertensive Disorders of Pregnancy (HDP) is important because the treatment for an SLE flare is immunosuppression， while the final treatment for HDP is termination of pregnancy 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>. However， a differential diagnosis may be challenging for clinicians because both conditions present with proteinuria， hypertension， and lower-extremity edema， and may also have systemic effects 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>. In this case， we concluded that both SLE flare and SPE were present because immunosuppressive therapy did not control the disease； therefore，therapeutic termination at 20 weeks was done. A twin pregnancy is a strong possible cause of SPE at an early gestational age. Postpartum improvement of renal dysfunction and thrombocytopenia supports this diagnosis.\n\n【21】Third，wediscussedthesafetyofAssistedReproductiveTechnology(ART) in women with SLE. The most serious complication associated with ovarian stimulation and ovarian hyper stimulation syndrome is thrombosis 通用删除6(英):<u>[11，12]</u>. To avoid thrombosis， selection of appropriate ovarian stimulation， a \"freeze all” strategy， and appropriate heparin administration should be performed， especially for those with Anti-Phospholipid Antibodies (APAs) 通用删除6(英):<u>[11，12]</u>. To avoid thrombosis in thawed ET， a natural ovulatory cycle is the first choice. If hormone replacement is necessary， non-oral natural estradiol andprogesterone should be administrated 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>. Furthermore， single ET should be performed to avoid the risks associated with multifetal pregnancy通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>. ART is not indicated in the women with acute flare， poorly controlled arterial hypertension， pulmonary hypertension， advanced renal disease， severe valvular or heart diseases， or major previous thrombotic events 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>. In this case， we considered that the patient had alow risk ofthrombosis，because her anti-mullerian hormone was low (0.84 ng/mL)， her APAs were negative， and she had no previous episode of thrombosis. In addition， because her platelet count was>10×104 /uL， the risk ofovarian bleeding with Oocyte Retrieval (OR) was low. Therefore， we concluded that ovarian stimulation and OR were acceptable in this case.\n\n【22】Fourth， we discussed the validity of ET in this case as the patient’s BP was 120-130/90-100 mmHg with a relatively high diastolic BP. As mentioned in the introduction， the target BP is controversial in pregnancy in women with CH， with ISSHP，NICE，andACOG having different guidelines. In a retrospective analysis of 215 women with CH， Ueda et al. showed that systolic BP<130 mmHg within 14 weeks of gestation reduced the risk of developing early-onset SPE 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>. We(Kurashiki Central Hospital) participated in this study and recognized the importance of systolic BP control. In this case ET was performed in 2020 when the international guidelines for target diastolic BP ranged from 85 mmHg to 110 mmHg. Therefore， we believed ET to be acceptable in this case.\n\n【23】Lastly， we discussed Fertility Preservation (FP) in women with SLE， who are prohibited from getting pregnant. It is well accepted that SLE itself is not a cause of infertility 通用删除6(英):<u>[6，7，11，12]</u>. However，删除1换行administration of Cyclophosphamide (CPA) decreases ovarian reserve， resulting in decreased fertility 通用删除6(英):<u>[6，7，11，12]</u>. Additionally， when a woman with SLE is advised not to conceive for a long period， her fertility decreases because of a decreased ovarian reserve and oocyte ageing 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>. It is demonstrated that clinicians should give information on FP，including cryopreservation of embryos/oocytes/ovarian tissue， to the female patients with SLE who are going to be administrated with CPA， in European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology(ESHRE) guidelines 通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u> and American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) guidelines 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>. Accordingly， FP counseling before CPA administration is a common practice at present. In Japan， there have been reports on this issue since 2015. However， FP counseling for women with SLE who are advised not to conceive for a long period is not yet a common practice； FP counseling for these women is not present in the ESHRE or ASRM guidelines. A review by Italian doctors showed that FP should be considered for women who are advised not to conceive for a long period 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>， suggesting that FP had been practical in Italy or European nations in these cases. However， we could not find such reports in English. We believe that FP for women prohibited from pregnancy is not yet a common practice because it is undetermined whether ART in women with SLE during a pregnancy-prohibited period is safe and effective. Additionally， we could not find the reports on FP in women with CH.\n\n【24】In conclusion， we present a woman with CH and SLE， in whom post-stillbirth depression and medical adherence improved during embryo preservation， resulting in systolic BP control and a livebirth. We reported this case because it provides in formation on FP in women with CH or SLE during pregnancy-prohibited period. However， the safety and effectiveness on this approach is undetermined，and careful consideration is necessary on a case-by-case basis.\n\n【25】Ethical Consideration\n\n【26】We have obtained the written informed consent from the patient for the publication of this report.

It is characterized by congenital vaginal agenesis， with a prevalence of 1/4000 to 1/5000 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Patients with MRKH typically either have no uterus or only rudimentary uterus. Some of them may also show urologic anomalies and， in rare cases， spinal malformations. They all have a normal female karyotype of 46 XX with normal ovarian functions通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. Ovarian cyst pedicle torsion is a common gynecological acute abdomen with pedicle torsion occurring in approximately 10 percent of ovarian cysts.\n\n【2】However， MRKH syndrome with ovarian cyst torsion is rare. This paper summarizes the clinical data of a MRKH syndrome case complicated with pedicle torsion and necrosis of a giant ovarian serous cystadenoma.\n\n【3】Case Presentation\n\n【4】The patient is a 23-year-old female， who presented with 2-week history of irregular abdominal pain on the right lower quadrant， but no nausea， vomiting， fever， or urinary symptoms. This recurrent symptom initially started over a year ago and had been treated as “pelvic inflammation”with antibiotic in another hospital for multiple episodes. During that period， no ultrasonography was performed. The patient has a known history of MRKH syndrome and underwent vaginoplasty and ultrasonography two years prior. A postoperative follow-up ultrasound scan showed a right ovarian cyst of 4 cm.\n\n【5】Gynecological examination： normal development of vulva， narrow vagina， smooth mucosa， difficulty in accommodating 2 fingers， depth of about 7 cm； absence of cervix and uterine body； a cystic mass of 10 cm ×9 cm× 6 cm next to the right adnexal area with mild tenderness， unclear boundary and not easy to move； no abnormal observations on left adnexa.\n\n【6】Laboratory data： White blood cell count： 8.5×10/L. Neutrophil percentage： 66.9%. Serum amyloid A： 11.5 mg/L. High-sensitivity C-reactive protein： 5.1 mg/L. Fibrinogen： 4.04 g/L. D-dimer：1.15 mg/L FEU. Anti-Mullerian tube hormone： 0.8 ng/mL (normal range 1.52-9.95). Sex hormones and thyroid function were normal. Karyotype was reported as 46 XX.\n\n【7】MRI showed a triangular soft tissue between the giant cyst and the bladder. The structure of vagina was visible， while the boundary was not clear. Multiple cysts were found in the bilateral ovarian areas. The cross section of the right ovarian lesion was about 5.3 cm x2.9 cm， posterior to this lesion there was a nodular signal of obvious enhancement at the size of 2.3 cm ×1.3 cm . The diameter of the largest left ovarian cyst was 1.9 cm. Next to it， there was nodular soft tissue of obvious inhomogeneous enhancement， with the size of 3.1 cm x 1.9 cm . MRI also demonstrated a large irregular tube-shaped cystic in the pelvis， at the size of9.8 cm x4.6 cm×10.1cm， with clear boundary， inhomogeneous wall and no obvious enhancement on contrast-enhanced scan . The kidneys， bladder， intestine， liver， all-bladder and lymph nodes were reported normal.\n\nGiven her medical history of MRKH， the triangular soft tissue above the bladder with bilateral nodules was consistent to an undeveloped primordial uterus. Bilateral ovarian structures were not clearly shown. There were multiple cystic foci in the ovarian region and the right cystic focus showed signs of hemorrhage. The preliminary diagnosis was ovarian cyst. However， because the|删除段之间换行|giant cystic focus of the pelvis extended to the right ovarian region the possibility of it being the pedicle torsion of the right ovarian cyst couldn't be eliminated.\n\nThe operation began with a diagnostic laparoscopy， which revealed a dysplasia-uterine-like muscular tissue of about 3 cm x4 cm x3 cm in the left pelvic cavity near the iliac fossa . Adjacent to it was an oviduct-like tubal structure with part mucosal structure at the umbrella end. Below it was the ovary of about 3 cm x 4 cm x2.5 cm， with no obvious abnormality in appearance nor obvious vegetative growth on the surface. The uterine-like muscular tissue and the left adnexa were stuck together with the left pelvic wall. There was a cystic mass in the right pelvic cavity， partially dark purple and covered with omentum， densely adhered to the right pelvic and anterior abdominal wall. After the separation of the covered omentum and membranous adhesins， a dumbbell-shaped cystic-solid mass emerged. The larger part was about 11 cmx6cm x 8 cm， the other part was about 6 cmx7cm×6 cm . There was no obvious normal ovarian tissue and no obvious fallopian tube-like structure. No abnormal lesions were found in the omentum， stomach， liver， spleen and diaphragmatic roof. A partial resection of the right mass was sent for intraoperative frozen biopsy|删除段之间换行|and was reported as right ovarian serous cystadenoma. Intraoperative diagnosis was pedicle torsion and necrosis of right ovarian serous cystadenoma with bilateral dysplasia uterine. Therefore，laparoscopic right ovariectomy and pelvic adhesion lysis were performed. The surgery went smoothly， and the patient recovered well. Postoperative pathological report was the same as the intraoperative frozen biopsy. On the follow-up， 2 months after operation， the AMH was 1.13 ng/mL， and the sex hormones were still in normal range.\n\n【10】Discussion\n\n【11】MRKH syndrome is characterized by congenital absence of the vagina and uterus， which is generally divided into 2 types： Type I， more common， only vagina and uterus are affected； typeII： In addition to no uterus nor vagina， patients also suffer from malformations of renal and skeletal systems. It should be distinguished from hymen atresia 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>， vaginal atresia 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u> and Complete Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (CAIS) 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. Studies suggest vaginal dilatation as the first-line treatment for MRKH syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>[6-8]</u>， while surgery is also an option. The surgery is called vaginoplasty， including biological patch and peritoneal method. Improved surgical methods are reported constantly to benefit patients 通用删除6(英):<u>[9-11]</u>. The mental health of postoperative patients is also critical and shouldn't be overlooked通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>. For patients with MRKH syndrome， the risk of pelvic complications should not be ignored in clinical practice， and routine gynecological physical examination should also be performed. There are reported cases of MRKH syndrome complicated with uterine leiomyoma通用删除6(英):<u>[13-15]</u>， adenomyosis 通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u> and so on， which could have resulted in misdiagnosis.\n\n【12】MRI is an important imaging examination method for diagnosis of MRKH syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>[17，18]</u>， which helps to determine the presence ofuterus or primordial uterus. A recent retrospective analysis showed that MRI results in determining the degree of reproductive system involvement and multi-system related malformations are highly consistent with the final clinical diagnosis，proving the potential value of MRI in shortening preoperative diagnosis time 通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u>. Clinically，删除1换行ultrasound and MRI can be collaboratively used to reach the diagnosis of pelvic complications in patients with MRKH syndrome.\n\n【13】In regards to the choice of surgical methods 通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u>， considering this patient's clinical history， and the fact that the right ovarian cyst had been twisted for too long， resulting in extensive hemorrhage and necrosis which led to the right ovarian functionloss，right ovariectomy was suggested and performed. As for whether the uterus should be retained， given 1) the patient did not have periodic abdominal pain， 2) her uterus was considered as the primordial uterus， and 3) resection might affect the blood supply to the other healthy ovary and eventually lead to the decrease of ovarian reserve function， resection was not recommended for the contralateral (left) uterus. As for the affected side (right) uterus， since it may be complicated with uterine fibroids， adenomyosis and other related complications， we had suggested resection to her family members but the suggestion was rejected. After the surgery we reiterated the relevant risks to the patient and suggested routine follow-up visits.\n\n【14】For this case， due to congenital dysplasia， the distance between the ovarian suspensory ligament and the ovarian proper ligament was relatively short， so the pedicle torsion was more likely to happen anatomically. Given her MRKH history and repeated abdominal pain symptoms， if the imaging examination was performed sooner， a timelier surgery could have been performed to avoid adverse consequences such as cyst necrosis and extensive hemorrhage.\n\n【15】To sum up， MRKH syndrome is rare in clinical practice， yet， there is still a probability of complication of ovarian torsion due to the malformation of the ovarian ligaments. For such cases， physicians should be aware of this syndrome and pay more attention to the timely diagnosis and treatments.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

The effectiveness of this association could be explained by a complementarity of the two molecules in the dopaminergic and serotonergic pathways 通用删除6(英):<u>[2，3]</u>.\n\n【3】Clinical Description\n\n【4】We report the case of Mr. A.T， 44 years old， married since one year， having academic grade level， without any somatic illness and no alcohol or psychoactive substance behavior. He suffers from paranoid schizophrenia since the age of 30 years and he was followed since 2005 in psychiatric department of Sousse. He was admitted in 2005 in psychiatric unity during four months for resistant auditory hallucination. The diagnosis of resistant schizophrenia was retained and the patient was treated with 900 mg/day Clozapine without side effects.\n\n【5】Mr. A.T had a good adherence treatment. Compliance has been verified using questionnaire administrated to the patient and a member of his family and using compliance items (items 9，Aand B) of the Schedule for the Assessment of Insight -Expanded version (SAI-E).\n\n【6】To evaluate efficacy of treatment， we used the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS)， the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptom (SANS) and the Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms (SAPS).\n\n【7】Plasma concentrations of Clozapine and the main metabolite Norclozapine were evaluated by High-Performance Liquid Chromatography method (HPLC).\n\n【8】Despite the administration of high doses of Clozapine (900 mg/day)， correct plasma Clozapine concentration and correct plasma Norclozapine concentration (respectively 824 ng/ml and 72 ng/ml)， we have achieved only 22% improvement in the BPRS.\n\n【9】Initially， we associate Amisulpride at a dose of 400 mg/day and diazepam at a dose of 15 mg/day to Clozapine without improving productive symptoms after 4 weeks of treatment.\n\n【10】The second alternative was to combine 4 mg/day Risperidone and 15 mg/day Diazepam at the same dose of Clozapine during 20 weeks. No significant clinical improvement was seen. Clozapine and Haloperidol 10 mg/day was also associated but quickly stopped after development of extrapyramidal syndrome.\n\n【11】Finally， when we choose to associate Clozapine 900 mg/day to Aripiprazole at a dose of 10 mg/day， we noted better improvement in positive symptoms with a marked decrease of anxiety and psychotic symptoms. In this association we found improvement of 48% in the SAPS，42% in SANS and 40% in BPRS.\n\n【12】Conclusion\n\n【13】The results of this clinical case suggest that the addition of Aripiprazole to Clozapine in treatment ultra resistant schizophrenia could be an effective therapeutic alternative.

It is estimated that 32.1% ofchildren and adolescents in the United States are overweight or obese 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. However， if prevention is key， then greater emphasis should be directed toward programs that focus on youth in this country. Childhood and early adolescence represent a critical period of growth and maturation when youth are transitioning toward making their own decisions regarding lifestyle behaviors. This includes food choices as well as physical activity selection and participation. It also reflects a time of significant physical， physiological， and mental development before behaviors become so ingrained，they cannot change. Therefore， targeting children or early adolescents is key to the prevention of obesity and unhealthy lifestyle habits in the future. Schools provide an excellent opportunityto influence our nation’s youth because of the great amount of contact and infrastructural support they provide to nurture and educate students while communicating the right health messages to them. However， facing significant pressure to improve language arts， math and science scores， the attention to physical activity and obesity prevention has taken a back seat. The President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology has called for a 33% increase in Science， Technology， Engineering， And Mathematics (STEM) bachelors’degrees each year 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u> and this college trend has trickled down to the public schools. However，public schools must learn how to be creative in integrating both physical activities and academics into the classroom in order to advance cognitive gains without sacrificing physical activity participation and improved metabolic fitness. By balancing both elements， schools can get the right health message across to students to help them maintain active， healthy lifestyle behaviors.\n\n【9】In the take 10 program， teachers implemented 10-min physical activity sessions integrated into the academic lessons. The 10-min sessions increased physical activity levels while also reinforcing academic skills and concepts learned in the classroom 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. The “Physical Activity across the Curriculum\"program was a 3-year expansion of this integrative curriculum. In programs providing>75 min/week of physical activity， body mass index declined. Significant gains in composite reading， math， and spelling scores were also observed 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. Using accelerometers in a similar Texas-I can study， students in the experimental group showed a significant increase in physical activity compared to controls along with a 20% increase in moderate-vigorous-physical activity. Furthermore， times on task or attention to the academic lessons were improved following the physical activity sessions 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. These types of active lessons using activities such as “cardiac relays\" and“spelling freeze tag\"not only improved physical and metabolic fitness but also enhanced academic learning. In the middle schools， Planet Health 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u> and a N.Y. program 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u> possessed integrative elements of academic instruction and physical activity； however， they were used in a different manner. In Planet Health， health-related units and brief sessions of physical activities were integrated into traditional classes such as language arts， math， and science. In both programs， the physical activities did not possess an academic component as implemented at the elementary level， however， physical activities did support health-related concepts taught in class. In the N.Y program， after one semester， insulin resistance， inflammatory markers， and percent body fat， were reduced. Future research should be directed toward finding the optimal types of physical activities for youth， whether they require an academic component for optimal results or not， and/or whether they should consider implementing an independent nutrition and exercise science curriculum incorporating physical activity.\n\n【10】It's time to move away from citing overweight and obesity statistics for every age， state， and race or sending home report cards of BMI to parents and their children. This information can be very psychologically distressing to children and adolescents. It’s well known that an increase in physical activity is associated with greater self-esteem， less body size dissatisfaction， and better academic performance 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>. More emphasis is needed on how active lessons that integrate physical activities删除1换行into the classroom can be interfaced in public school settings， in after-school settings， and/or in summer programs. The latest study among 1.7 million adults showed that those meeting cardiovascular and muscle strengthening guidelines also possessed lower rates of obesity 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>. Finding creative solutions to improve metabolic health and habitual physical activity in youth is where we should be headed and the obesity problem will take care ofitself. Incorporating physical activity into the classroom daily teaches our youth it's that important to incorporate it into their everyday lifestyle behaviors. Dropping or reducing physical activity or exercise conducted on a regular basis， sends the opposite and wrong health message. It’s time we get it right for the future of our nation's youth.\n\n【11】通用结尾删除-1:<u>1. Benjamin EJ， Virani SS， Callaway CW， Chamberlain AM， Chang AR， Cheng S， et al.

Baby was resuscitated and put on ventilator SIMV mode. Antibiotics started as per protocol. On further examination subgaleal bleed was suspected so baby was put on hematocrit and head circumference monitoring. Head compression dressing done to prevent further bleed. Baby was transfused packed red blood cell due to fall in hematocrit and increasing head circumference. Baby had seizures at 4 h of life controlled on antiepileptics and Inj Midazolam drip.

There were no risk factors during pregnancy. Antenatal period was uneventful. Baby was born through vacuum assisted vaginal delivery in view of obstructed labor. On examination baby was lethargic， neonatal reflexes were poor， tone and activity were depressed， anterior fontanel was at level. Baby was maintaining Spo， at 0.5l/min of oxygen therapy. Cranial ultrasonography revealed right lateral ventricle intraventricular hemorrhage with extension into adjacent brain parenchyma， volume corresponding to 22cc. There is also a germinal matrix hemorrhage in left lateral ventricle. Both lateral ventricles are prominent. Therefore， Grade four Intraventricular hemorrhage with adjacent brain parenchymal involvement. Baby was given packed cell transfusion and fresh frozen plasma. On day 4 of life baby landed with inappropriate weight gain and kidney function tests were deranged.

Baby was discharged on Day 14oflife.\n\n【22】Discussion\n\n【23】In this study six neonates born through vacuum assisted delivery were hospitalized in NICU with subgaleal hemorrhage. Out of six two babies had AKI， one is having oliguria and others were having normal urine output. Both babies with AKI improved and were discharged. One baby is having mildly deranged kidney function test at 60 h of life. All three babies with deranged kidney function tests were having inappropriate weight gain as presenting clinical symptom. Babies were put on fluid restriction and extraneous monitoring. All babies were managed conservatively and kidney function tests started improving in 3 days.\n\n【24】All babies diagnosed with acute kidney injury had serious intracranial bleed (Subarachnoid hemorrhage and Grade 4Intraventricular Hemorrhage) along with subgaleal hematoma. Perinatal asphyxia and Septicemia can be worsening risk factors for acute kidney injury.\n\n【25】Subgaleal Hemorrhage (SGH) is bleeding in the potential space between the skull periosteum and the scalp galea aponeurosis. It is rare and lethal complication. Pediatricians should be notified whenever an operative vaginal delivery has been attempted as such neonates should be closely observed. All vacuum-related injuries in term neonates were evident within 10 h of birth. Hence， neonates may be discharged10 or more hours after vacuum delivery if no complications are evident 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. Neonatal death from SGH can be prevented ifappropriate attention is paid to identification of risk factors， early diagnosis， close observation and aggressive treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. SGH can present with anemia， metabolic acidosis， hyperbilirubinemia， intracranial hemorrhage， respiratory distress， seizures， shock， and death.\n\n【26】In previous studies while extra-cranial hematomas and skull fractures have been associated with vacuum assisted deliveries， a causal link to neonatal intracranial hemorrhage (intracranial hemorrhages， subarachnoid， subdural， and intracerebral) is less evident.\n\n【27】Acute Kidney Injury： The incidence of acute kidney injury in NICU is 8% to 24% and associated mortality rate is 20% to 50% 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. AKI is common and associated with poorer outcomes in perinatal asphyxia. The presence of perinatal asphyxia and its severity appears to correlate with increasing incidence of AKI 通用删除6(英):<u>[6，7]</u>. We had used AKIN Criteria to classify into three stages： Stage 1 (Mild)， 2(moderate)， and 3 (severe) 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>. This study reminds us the association of serious intracerebral hemorrhage and AKI. But limitation of this study is etiology of AKI was not explored further .\n\n【28】Conclusion\n\n【29】Since there is recent surge in vacuum delivery it is important that obstetric care providers are aware of neonatal risks and related co-morbidities associated with such deliveries. Neonate should be monitored for diagnosis of intracranial bleed and acute kidney injury as early treatment can be implemented. Early suspicion especially when baby have inappropriate weight gain can be helpful.\n\n【30】Direct association between serious intracranial bleed and acute kidney injury can't be established due to small sample size of study. Moreover， other risk factors like septicemia and perinatal asphyxia were also present.

Thelong-term goal is restoration of function but in the short-term we often focus on obtaining adequate soft tissue coverage.\n\n【2】These injuries， when untreated or poorly managed， lead to sequela and limitations that are often irreparable， causing great harm to the economicaly active population.\n\n【3】There are many techniques described in the literature for wound coverage and normally， the most common options are free flaps， skin grafts， Vacuum-Assisted Closure (VAC) dressings and“second intention healing\". Different factors must be considered when choosing one surgical technique over another， especially the pattern of lesion， patient， surgeon and institution. However， many techniques are not reproducible in other locations due to the cost and population type.\n\n【4】On our case report， we describe a fairly cheap and effective treatment used on a patient with a severe soft tissue injury on the dorsum ofthe foot.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】In January 2022，21 years-old male was involved in a motorcycle accident with an important soft tissue injury on the dorsum of the left foot， associated with an open dislocation of the Chopart(midtarsal) joint. He was first treated at another institution to approach the open dislocation 14 days before admission in our institution.\n\n【7】At our facility we observed a 14 cm × 8 cm wound covered by dry necrosis and important exsudate， in addition to medial and plantar wounds， sutured in the previous hospital . After the X-ray trauma series for foot and ankle， we identified a remaining dislocation of the midtarsal joint which was confirmed with a CT scan. Urgent surgical treatment was performed on the same day in order to restore articular congruence.\n\n【8】Due to the severity of the soft tissue lesion， a closed reduction of the Chopart articulation was performed and fixed with two 1.5 mm Kirschner wires in talonavicular joint and one 1.5 mm Kirschner wire in calcaneocuboid joint. In addition to the bone procedure， we surgically debrided and washed the wound with 6 liters of 0.9% saline solution. The vast soft tissue loss didn't allow for primary wound suture and we chose to close the injury with a sterile polyethylene prosthesis . Patient remained hospitalized for 5 days to monitor wound healing.\n\n【9】Weekly visits were made for 60 days， followed by fortnightly follow-ups for another 60 days.\n\n【10】Forty-eight days after the operation， the patient was admitted to our emergency room due to leakage of secretion in the dressing， and partial loosening of the polyethylene prosthesis was observed. Suture of the distal component of the dressing was performed with nylon thread，under local anesthesia.\n\n【11】Weight bearing was planned to start six weeks after surgery， but due to this minor episode of dressing loosening it was postponed to eight weeks after major healing of the injury was visualized through the prosthesis. Full weight bearing on the operated limb was allowed 70 days after surgery通用删除6(英):<u>[1-7]</u>.\n\n【12】Four months after the first procedure， although the excellent aspect of the wound， a minor lesion remained on the central area of the wound and surgeons proposed another intervention with removal of the dressing and a minimal skin graft coverage . He was readmitted for operative treatment on May 2022 but after removal of the prosthesis the injury was completely granulated and no additional procedure was necessary .\n\n【13】Considering that the technique was adapted for larger lesions， this coverage maintenance period will be influenced according to the location and size of the lesion to be treated. It is common during the treatment that some stitches may becomeloose over the weeks. When this loosening occurs， the patient should be submitted to a partial revision and a new suture， on an outpatient basis， to avoid leakage of secretions and contamination ofthe wound. The suture used must be adapted to the lesion site as well as the thickness of suture thread. In general， simple， or U-shaped stitches are suitable and facilitate revision in case of loosening.\n\n【14】Last follow-up visit was on June 2022， 30 days after removal of the prosthesis and five months after the surgery. Patient remained with excellent outcome， with minimal complaints regarding residual edema and paresthesia. The wound on the dorsum was completely healed and patient was allowed to return to work as tolerated.\n\n【15】In very large wounds， complete or partial healing may occur， leaving small， but already granulated areas that can be supplemented with grafting. In general， coverage with a propylene orthosis restores a very close to natural shape and appearance， with good sensitivity to the area.\n\n【16】Surgical Technique\n\n【17】The technique used in this case report consists of an adaptation of the technique proposed by Figueiredo 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>， initially for cutaneous losses from the fingertips and later expanded for greater cutaneous losses， both in the hand and in other parts of the limbs.\n\nThe original technique consists ofusing a synthetic polypropylene cover that is flexible and resistant to cover the entire bloody area， to contain all the inflammatory exudate， preventing its extravasation. This exudate is later progressively converted into fibrinous tissue and this later replaced by granulation tissue. In the original initial|删除段之间换行|In the case presented， the patient was taken first to the operating room for debridement of the wound and bone fixation. Coverage with polypropylene was performed at the same time. In the first week， it is likely for that the dressing to become slightly moist due to a slight extravasation of secretion. After the first week， a weekly dressing change was performed with a superficial cleaning of the covering with 70% alcohol. It is common for the patient to be anxious with the appearance of fibrinous over the weeks， mistaking it for pus. It is important to reassure the patient to maintain adherence to treatment. Over the weeks， some areas take on a darkened color due to the differentiation of the granulation tissue.\n\n【19】At approximately 6 weeks， the patient underwent revision of the sutured covering due to loosening of some stitches.\n\n【20】At approximately 12 weeks， the removal of the coverage and grafting of an area that had not yet been epithelialized was programmed.Bythe dressing appearance it seemed to beconsiderable. After removing the cover it was observed that the epithelialized tissue was larger than estimated， leaving only a discrete central area fully granulated.\n\n【21】Antibiotics were not used for prophylaxis or treatment during the patient's follow-up.\n\n【22】Discussion\n\n【23】The foot and ankle area is a common site of traumatic injuries that generate a loss of skin coverage and possible exposure to deep structures. These lesions will require coverage methods that may need a variety of reconstruction procedures to reduce the risk of infection， necrosis of noble structures and specially to avoid other undesirable outcomes such as amputations 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>.\n\n【24】Autologous grafts and flaps require a trained team， not always available in treatment centers， in addition to generating an additional damage to the donor site， which increases treatment morbidity 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. Negative pressure therapy is a relative expensive treatment， not always covered by the healthcare insurance， whether public or private.\n\n【25】The use of polypropylene prosthesis is a technique of low complexity of execution， besides being accessible and low cost， making it viable and reproducible 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>， regardless of the level of technical capacity of the surgeon and the structure of the center where the treatment is being instituted.\n\n【26】Therefore， it is believed that the technique in question should be part of the arsenal of alternatives for the treatment of skin lesions followed by traumatic events， especially at the level of the foot and ankle， given the good result that can be obtained， as well as exemplified in the reported case.\n\n【27】The application ofthis technique on foot and ankle area transcends the indications primarily described by Figueiredo 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u> and some details should be considered due to its weight bearing characteristics. First， we recommend at least six weeks non weight bearing on the operated limb but this period could be extended according to the severity and the progression of the wound. Second， we suggest that suture of the prosthesis should be performed with very close stitches to avoid leakage of the secretion.\n\n【28】Respecting these instructions， we believe that excellent outcomes could be achieved with very little expenses， and we recommend that the technique should be widespread to other surgeons especially in areas with budget limitations.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

Yet， it is not the standard of care to screen for either of these sexually transmitted diseases upon diagnosis of primary penile cancer. We present a 50 year old male who had a confirmed diagnosis of penile cancer for 2 years prior to his presentation to our clinic in Dakar， Senegal. Outside institutions repeatedly failed to screen the patient for sexually transmitted diseases， namely HPV and HIV. We share this case to emphasize the importance of sexually transmitted disease screening upon diagnosis of penile cancer with hopes to increase awareness in both developed and developing nations. We call for consensus in sexually transmitted disease screening guidelines upon penile cancer diagnoses.\n\n【2】Keywords： Penile cancer； HPV；HIV； STD screening\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Primary penile cancer is a rare malignant overgrowth of cells， typically located on the glans or the internal prepuce of the penis. It has a worldwide incidence of 1/100，000 and most commonly affects males between the ages of 50 years to 70 years. Delayed diagnosis often yields significant morbidity and mortality 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，2]</u>. While penile cancer is uncommon in Europe and North America， the developing world has much higher rates of incidence up to 8 cases per 100，000 in some countries通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. Variations in incidence worldwide are hypothesized to be affected by socioeconomic status， healthcare accessibility，cultural tradition，and psychological factors of the patient populations 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，4]</u>.\n\n【5】Over 95% of penile carcinomas are Squamous Cell in Carcinoma (SCC) 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Additionally， there are a wide variety of other histological variants， such as basaloid， verrucous， and sarcomatoid 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. The majority of lesions are found on the glans (48%)， with the remainder located on the prepuce(21%)， both glans and prepuce (15%)， coronal sulcus (6%)， and shaft (<2%)通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. Diagnosis is often clinical， though clinical presentation is variable and commonly asymptomatic initially. Lesions can present as indurated nodules， ulcers， or fun gating masses. With progression， symptoms such as itching， bleeding， discharge， or pain may occur. Advanced disease can present with palpable lymphadenopathy， weight loss and fatigue 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>.\n\n【6】Certain biological pathologieshavebeentiedto increased incidence. Poorhygiene， uncircumcised males， urethral stricture， tobacco use，and even psoralen ultraviolet A photochemotherapy have all been associated with increased penile cancer incidence in prior studies 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. Chronic inflammation may also be a critical component of tumor development， as many penile cancers arise from sites of infection， chronic irritation or injury 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Further， penile cancer is best known to have a strong association with carcinogenic strains of Human Papillomavirus (HPV). For example， HPV infection is found in 45% to 80%通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u> of penile SCC cases. This association is even higher in other histological types such as verrucous， basaloid and sarcomatoid 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. The most commonlyaccepted explanation for the association is HPV's ability to produce the oncogenic proteins E6 and E7， which interfere with the p53 and Retinoblastoma tumor suppressor genes， respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>. This carcinogenic mechanism is especially important in populations with high HPV infection rates， such as Sub-Saharan Africa. HPV incidence was found to be around 61% of the male population in Sub-Saharan Africa in 2012通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>. Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) may also play a role in SCC pathogenesis. Though a删除1换行causal link between immunosuppression and penile oncogenesis has not yet been made， men who are HIV+ carry up to an 8X greater risk of penile SCC 通用删除6(英):<u>[5，9]</u>.\n\n【7】Despite HPV and HIV's well known association with penile cancer， there is a serious lack of attention to the preventive health component of this condition. For example， the European Urological Association's (EUA) guidelines for penile cancer address diagnostic standards， staging， and possible treatment avenues that individual cases may necessitate. However， there is little acknowledgement of the public health risks that penile cancer may pose with an underlying HPV and HIV infection. Additionally， there seems to be no recommendation for penile cancer management specifically in developing nations， including Sub-Saharan Africa， which may have unique socioeconomic roadblocks. Consequently， this case report aims to emphasize the critical importance of screening for HIV/HPV upon a diagnosis of penile cancer， such that it should be included in official penile cancer guidelines. Prompt evaluation of a patient's STD status can not only decrease morbidity and mortality for the patient， but also provide preventative measures against future HPV-related cancers， as well as HIV complications in the community.\n\n【8】Case Presentation\n\n【9】We present a 50 year-old Senegalese male with a history of recurrent urethritis， who presented to our clinic for an evolving ulcerative swelling on his penis for the past 2 years. The patient's medical history is limited secondary to lack of documentation and resources from outside institutions. The patient had presented to several local clinics before the diagnosis of penile cancer was made； those records were unable to be obtained. The patient received 12chemotherapysessions before being referred to our clinic. Ofnote，the patient was polygamous with 2 wives， though became divorced since the beginning of the disease. He did not report having unprotected intercourse with other women.\n\n【10】CT scans demonstrated local invasion of the cancer into the subcutaneous fat overlying the pubic symphysis. Lymph node metastases with left inguinal necrotic lymphadenopathy of 5 cm were also present. Furthermore， there were bilateral， multiple lung nodules of different sizes， mostly predominant on the left side.\n\n【11】The patient never received an STD screening since his diagnosis. We performed an HIV and HPV test that came back positive for HIV2，previously unknown to the patient. The results also came back HPV (+) for serotype 16. As of May 2020， the patient is currently alive and being treated accordingly.\n\n【12】Discussion\n\n【13】There are no written recommendations for STD screening in patients diagnosed with penile cancer despite overwelming evidence that there is some association between HIV， HPV and penile cancer通用删除6(英):<u>[10，11]</u>.Evidenced by our patient remaining undiagnosed with HIV2after initial presentation 2 years ago， delay in STD diagnosis can have dire consequences. An earlier diagnosis for our patient may have prevented the eventual progression of his penile cancer and further metastatic disease.\n\nWe hypothesize that early diagnosis of HPV and HIV infections in patients can have a marked benefit for public health as well. With earlier identification and Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Therapy(HAART)，HIV transmission will likely decrease. A case report written by Konan et al. acknowledges a link between HIV and penile cancer|删除段之间换行|Despite the plethora of information on the internet， there is still not enough consistent information to educate developing nations on the infectious disease management ofpenile cancer. For example， the EUA never recommends screening for HPV/HIV in penile cancer patients and the American Urologic Association has no specific guidelines for penile cancer whatsoever. Consequently， Teh et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u> was right to describe finding consistent information on penile cancer as a “needle in the haystack\". Additionally， they state that there seems to be a discrepancy in the quality of websites in differing languages， with significantly lesser quality available in the developing world. With all of the inconsistencies in literature， the severity of our patient's case could have been prevented by access to clear， concise STD recommendations.\n\n【15】Necessarily，wecallforspecific，evidenced-basedrecommendations for STD testing for penile cancer diagnosis. A clear consensus would address the discrepancies and current confusion across resources.For our future patients and the entire medical community， we seek more thorough guidelines in regards to testing for HIV and HPV upon a diagnosis of penile cancer.\n\n【16】Conclusion\n\n【17】The association between penile cancer， HPV， and HIV has been well established. However， in the developing world， it is not always common practice to properly screen for STDs upon a diagnosis of删除1换行penile cancer. Prompt screening of these patients can lead to earlier treatment， better outcomes， increased public health awareness， and potential for more cost effective care. Thus， screening for sexually transmitted diseases should be the standard of care in anyone diagnosed with penile cancer.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

Due to the latest evidences， endometrial cancer molecular characterization results crucial for proper risk stratification.\n\n【2】A young woman with G1 endometrioid endometrial cancer diagnosed by hysteroscopy was treated conservatively. After cancer persistence， she underwent radical surgery for advanced disease. Post-hoc immunohistochemical analysis was performed comparing the first-diagnosis biopsy (mismatch repair deficiency) to surgical specimen (mismatch repair proficiency). Interestingly， not only the cancer changed biochemically， but it also shifted from a confined tumor to an advanced disease with bulky lymph nodes and negative endometrial infiltration. Eventually， the patient was diagnosed with Lynch syndrome.\n\n【3】A wiser evaluation of the mismatch repair deficiency should have guided to the proper therapeutic algorithm， also suggesting genetic tests. This case report represents an encouragement to further investigations on molecular assessment as a predictor for endometrial cancer risk stratification in conservative management.\n\n【4】Keywords： Cancer； Endometrium； Fertility； Genital Neoplasms； Immunohistochemistry\n\n【5】Introduction\n\n【6】Endometrial Cancer (EC) is the fourth most diffuse malignancy in developed countries， also representing the most common gynecological cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. In about 80% of cases， EC is diagnosed when the disease is still confined to the uterus. Though total hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy is considered the standard treatment， a conservative management， consisting in oral or intra-uterine progesterone with or without hysteroscopic endometrial resection and follow-up biopsies every 3 to 6 months， is recommended in women desiring off spring 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. Although considered a safe approach， a subgroup of patients shows no cancer regression， recurrence or progression to more advanced stages 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. For this reason， the study of new molecular markers able to predict response to conservative treatment is extremely important. Only a few small-population studies investigated the role of Mismatch Repair status (MMR) as a promising predictor marker for conservative treatment outcomes 通用删除6(英):<u>[4-6]</u>. In this case report， we aim to bring to attention the peculiar clinical history of a young woman diagnosed with Mismatch Repair deficiency (MMR-d) EC on hysteroscopic biopsy， treated conservatively， with a atypical disease persistence： Complete local response with spreading of cancer to pelvic and aortic Lymph Nodes (LNs)， with concurrent molecular switch into MMR-proficient immunophenotype.\n\n【7】Case Presentation\n\n【8】Medical history\n\n【9】A 37-year-old woman in good clinical conditions is referred to our attention. In her history no comorbidities or previous surgeries were reported. Family history was significant for colon cancer. The patient was nulliparous， with strong desire for offspring. In March 2017 she was diagnosed with endometrial polyposis through ultrasound， for which she underwent operative hysteroscopy in April 2017 in another hospital， with positivity for complex atypical Endometrial Hyperplasia (EAH). Histological samples from polypectomy were revised from our pathologists\n\n【10】Table 1： Results from IHC analysis： Comparison between endometrial biopsy 通用删除7(英):<u>(2017)</u> and surgical specimen 通用删除7(英):<u>(2021)</u>.\n\n【11】Endometrial biopsy (September 2017) Surgery (February 2021)\n\n|  | Endometrial biopsy (September 2017)  |  | Surgery (February 2021)  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Diagnosis  | EAH (resected polyp)  | G1 eEC (endometrial sampling)  | eEC cells in metastatic LNs  |\n| MMR status  | MSH2-，MSH6+， MLH1+， PMS2+(MMR deficiency)  | MSH2-， MSH6-， MLH1+， PMS2+(MMR deficiency)  | MSH2+， MSH6+，MLH1+， PMS2+(MMRproficiency)  |\n| ER  | 1+，60%  | 1+，10%  | 1+；5%  |\n| PR  | 3+，85%  | 3+，40%  | 1+；1%  |\n| P53  | missing data  | missing data  | wild type  |\n\n【13】EAH： Endometrial Atypical Hyperplasia； G1 Well-Differentiated；eEC： endometrioid Endometrial Cancer；LNs： Lymph Nodes\n\n【14】Transvaginal ultrasound (December 2020)\n\nEndometrium was 5 mm thick and the medicated-IUD properly positioned. Ovaries appeared normal and no endopelvic effusions or dilatation of the renal pelvis were visible. At the aortic bifurcation，on the right， a hypoechogenic， inhomogeneous， a vascular formation of|删除段之间换行|12 mm x7 mm with regular margins was identified. Other formations with the same ultrasonographic features were visible at the left external iliac vessels (16 mmx13mm)and at the left external iliac vessels (16mmx10 mm and 9 mmx10 mm). The abovementioned lesions were to be referred in the first hypothesis to lymphadenopathies.\n\n【16】Chest-abdomen-pelvis TC scan with intravenous contrast(January 2021)\n\n【17】A 1.5 cm solid nodule suspected for lymphadenopathy was detected at the right iliac bifurcation. Along the internal iliac vessels， solid and uneven bilateral formations of 2.5 cm， suspected for pathological LNs， were identified. Non-confluent LNs of up to 1 cm was observed in the inguinal-femoral region bilaterally.\n\n【18】Oncofertility counseling\n\n【19】The patient was counseled on the clinical indication of a radical surgery. Once informed， the patient voluntarily chose to keep both ovaries.\n\n【20】Surgery (February 2021)\n\n【21】The patient underwent laparoscopic Querleu-Morrow class a radical hysterectomy， bilateral salpingectomy， ovarian suspension， systematic pelvic lymphadenectomy and removal of intercavoaortic lymphadenomegaly. Before hysterectomy， a cervical injection of indocyanine green 1 cc per side was performed， for which no fluorescent sentinel LN was identified. Lymphadenomegalies of 3cm were identified in the external iliac and obturator region on the删除1换行right， and internal iliac area on the left. Hence， a bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy was performed. On examination of the para-aorto-caval region， a lymphadenomegaly of 2 cm was found at the interaortocaval level and removed. Ovaries were fixed to the psoas muscle fascia bilaterally. Surgery time was 158 min with minimal blood loss and no intraoperative complications. The postoperative stay was regular， with no complications， and the patient was discharged after three days.\n\n【22】Histological examination\n\n【23】Macroscopic， microscopic and Immunohistochemical Analysis(IHC) were performed.\n\n【24】Macroscopic and microscopic examination： The uterus was removedwithbothtubes. At theendometrialfundus， araised，necrotic hemorrhagic area of 1.5 cm was observed. Thrombized vascular structures and associated chronic inflammation with multinucleated foreign-body giant cells were recognized in its context. No residual tumor or endovascular neoplastic emboli were detected. The adjacent endometrium appeared atrophic with associated stromal pseudo-decidualization. The cervix was affected by chronic cervicitis with foci of superficial squamous and glandular metaplasia， with no evidence of neoplastic infiltration. Salpinges were negative. Out of 7 pelvic LNs removed， 2 were positive for EC metastases (1/5 at the right and 1/2 at the left). The bulky LN removed at the paraaortic region was positive for EC secondary disease.\n\n【25】Immunohistochemistry： We compareddIHC of thefirst endometrial biopsy performed in our center (September 2017) with IHC performed on the surgical specimen (February 2021).\n\n【26】Results from the comparison are shown in Table 1. IHC staining pattern for the first biopsy (September 2017) are shown in Figure 1.\n\n【27】Inguinal LNs examination\n\n【28】Due to the clinical and radiological suspicion on bilateral inguinal LNs， the patient underwent ultrasonographic-guided biopsy of one left inguinal LN localized at the 1st level of Daseler， which was the node with the most worrisome features (confluent with subverted ultrasonographic structure). Biopsy was negative for EC metastases. Nevertheless， in consideration of the highly suspected ultrasound characteristics， the patient was referred for nodal surgical staging in March 2021， during which a bulky left inguinal LN was removed and studied intraoperatively. Intraoperative analysis was negative for secondary EC disease； therefore a systematic aorticlymphadenectomy anda radicalization of the previous pelvic lymphadenectomy were performed for staging purposes. Eventually， at the definitive histological examination， over 6 aortic， 3 pelvic and 1 inguinal LNs removed， none was positive for EC metastases.\n\n【29】Genetic analysis\n\n【30】Considering the woman's family history， personal history and the aforementioned IHC features， the patient underwent germinal genetic test， which turned out to be diagnostic for Lynch syndrome.\n\n【31】Adjuvant treatment\n\n【32】In consideration of FIGO stage IIIC2， the patient was referred for adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy.\n\n【33】Discussion\n\n【34】In this case report we describetheclinicalhistoryofa youngpatient with MMR-d EC conservatively treated， with disease progression duringhormonaltreatment. We comparedtheIHC features ofthe first删除1换行diagnosis biopsy with the ones on surgical specimen. Interestingly， we identified some relevant differences： on the 2017 endometrial biopsy， tumor cells exhibit MMR-d immunophenotype， whereas the 2021surgical specimen shows features of MMR-p immunophenotype. It is crucial to underline that not only the cancer has changed from a biochemical perspective， but it has also concurrently shifted from a macroscopically confined tumor (early stage) to an advanced disease with bulky aortic and pelvic LNs. Noteworthy， we observed a complete local response to treatment， with no evidence of tumor on uterine samples， with parallel spreading of EC to pelvic and aortic LNs. A post-hoc germinal genetic examination was performed and the patient was diagnosed with Lynch syndrome.\n\n【35】These data need to be reframed in perspective of the ProMisE classifier， which outlines four molecular groups of EC with different prognosis： 1) POLE-mutated (POLE-mt， goodl prognosis， very high mutational rate and mutations in the exonuclease domain of Polymerase-e)；2) Mismatch Repair-deficient (MMR-d， intermediate prognosis， high mutational rate and microsatellite-instability)； 3) p53-abnormal 通用删除11(英):<u>(p53-abn， poor prognosis， TP53 mutations， low mutational rate and high somatic copy number alterations rate)</u>；4) p53-wild-type 通用删除11(英):<u>(p53-wt， good-to-intermediate prognosis， low mutational and somatic copy number alterations rates)</u> 通用删除6(英):<u>[7-9]</u>. In their retrospective study， Chung et al. analyzed how mismatch repair status influences response to EC fertility-sparing treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. Among 57 patients， 9 (15.8%) had MMR-d on endometrial biopsy obtained before progesterone treatment. Results show that patients with MMR-d had a significantly lower complete response rate than those with MMR-p/p53-wt in terms of best overall response (44.4%vs. 82.2%) and complete response rate at 6 months (11.1% vs. 53.3%)， concluding that molecular classification has a prognostic significance in EC fertility sparing management， thereby enabling early risk stratification. An Italian study by Falcone et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u> investigated on the molecular features of 25 patients with EC conservatively treated通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>， stating that ProMisE classifier application on resectoscopic specimens could be a pragmatic model for stratifying genetic risk of women with EC. Specifically， in the group of MMR-d conservatively-treated patients， for a 50% of women the presence of such mutations correlates withh；a worse outcome (persistence/progression or metachronous Lynch syndrome associated tumors). A retrospective Italian study of Raffone et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>， investigated the association between MMR status and resistance rate to conservative treatment， recurrence rate and MMR-d reliability in predicting the risk of recurrence 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. Endometrial samples from 69 young women affected from AEH or mucosal-confined EC were collected before conservative approach and IHC features were examined. Results show that 8.7% of women was MMR-d. For this subset of patients， resistance to treatment was more common compared to p53-wt group (33.3% vs. 15.9%) with no statistical significance (p=0.2508) and recurrence after a complete regression occurred significantly more commonly than WOI p53-wt women (100% vs. 26.4%，p<0.0001). Moreover，MMR-d status was found to be a highly specific predictive marker for recurrence(sensitivity =22.2%， specificity =100%) 通用删除6(英):<u>[10，11]</u>. Moreover， Zakhour et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>， observed that in young women with loss of MMR proteins by IHC there was a higher incidence of invasive cancer and a lower incidence of resolution with progestin therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>.\n\n【36】According to the few available evidences 通用删除6(英):<u>[8，10-12]</u>， MMR-d status seems to be related to lower response rate to treatment， higher risk of recurrence and worst prognosis compared to p53-wt. Considering this， we may deduce that a wiser evaluation of molecular the MMR-d删除1换行status should had guided to the proper therapeutic algorithm for the patient of this case report： The study of personal and family history with Lynch Syndrome blood test， a closer and more intensive follow-up program or a different surgical management.\n\n【37】This case-report spontaneously arisesquestions about the possibility to apply molecular classification in young EC patients management. The study of the role of MMR status by IHC may represent apotential stand-alone predictor marker for risk stratification in this subset of patients： EC offspring-desirers with MMR-d should be managed more intensively with the inclusion of II-level imaging in their follow-up schedule， contrariwise p53-wt women could be followed-up in accordance with current guidelines.\n\n【38】Further andlarger studies are needed for a deeper understanding of these phenomena and for a wiser application of its potential.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

During the first 24 h，he became drowsy， developed edema ofthehands and feet， and hypotension. Despite fluid resuscitation with normal saline and inotropic agents， the patient’s blood pressure remained low at 63 mmHg/23 mmHg and he was transferred to our pediatric ward for further investigation and treatment. Previously， he was a healthy child with no past medical history. The family also revealed that a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak was present in the kindergarten two months ago. The COVID-19 exposure matches the peak incidence of SARS-CoV-2 third wave (middle March 2021) in Romania .\n\n【16】The physical examination on admission showed pale， dry skin， palpebral and palmoplantar edema， red and cracked lips， conjunctival erythema， cervical lymphadenopathy， decreased skin turgor， capillary refill time (CRT<3 sec)， oliguria. He had tachypnea (respiratory rate=50 breaths per minute)， dyspnea and orthopnea， chest retractions， diminished breath sounds in both lung bases， fine crackles， 92%Oxygen Saturation (SpO2) on room air. The cardiovascular assessment showed tachycardia， (heart rate =120 beats per minute)， Blood Pressure (BP) 65/47 mmHg and muffled heart sounds. The liver edge was palpable 3 cm under the ribs. The child was drowsy， Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS=12). His weight on admission was 17.5kg， which represented a 2-kilogram weight gain.\n\n【17】Laboratory findings at the time of admission are shown in Table1.

There are three types of syndromes described as clinical phenotypes that can occur at the onset of PIMS： 1) Fever with hyperinflammation，2) Kawasaki删除1换行disease-like features， and 3) Shock 通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u>. PIMS-related shock is a frequent clinical presentation described either as vasoplegic (warm) shock unresponsive to fluid resuscitation 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>， cardiogenic， or a combination of them 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>. Cardiogenic shock is an acute state with low cardiac output which furthermore leads to hypoperfusion and tissue hypoxia 通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>. The pathophysiology of PIMS related cardiogenic shock is not fully understood. In the symptomatic phase， three main删除1换行immune mechanisms have an impact on cardiovascular involvement：the appearance of a cytokine storm， activation of immune cells(including neutrophils)， and deposits of immune complexes. The cytokine storm is mainly responsible for vasoplegia while IL6， CRP and activation of neutrophils lead to myocardial injury 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>. A similar condition to PIMS related shock state is Kawasaki disease - shock syndrome， first described by Kanegaye et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>. However， Kawasaki disease was first described in the 1960s 通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u> so during the five decades since it was reported， its pathogeny was better studied. Because of clinical similarities between PIMS and Kawasaki disease， it has been assumed that PIMS might be an immune complex-induced vasculitis and there might be several common pathways between Kawasaki disease and PIMS 通用删除6(英):<u>[191</u>.\n\n【29】Myocarditis (described in several degrees， usually subclinical/mild) is aconstantfinding in almost all patients at the onset of Kawasaki disease，before the appearance of coronaryaneurysms. Several studies reveal myocardial inflammation at the microscopic examination as part ofpostmortem examination 通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u>，on en domyocardial biopsy 通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u>， or cardiac MRI. Moreover， Printz et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u> indicate an association between the level of systemic inflammatory status in Kawasaki disease and the left ventricle ejection fraction.\n\n【30】The endomyocardial biopsy cannot be routinely practiced， being删除1换行an invasive procedure. Due to lack of consensus for the diagnosis of myocarditis， we defined myocarditis based on the criteria mentioned by Dasgupta et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u>： Elevated cardiac enzymes， ST segment elevation or depression on ECG， regional/global wall motion abnormalities with impaired LV function on echocardiography.\n\n【31】NT-pro-BNP is a polypeptide produced in atrial and left ventricle myocardiocytes when they are prone to mechanical stretch 通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u>. Therefore， NT-pro-BNP is a well-known biomarker for heart failure.\n\n【32】We hypothesize 2 possible theories. Firstly， myocarditis might have been initiated due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. It overlaps the 3rd wave of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in Romania and the child was asymptomatic. Several studies indicate that subclinical myocarditis can occur in pediatric patients during viral infections 通用删除6(英):<u>[25，26]</u>. Symptoms of heart failure appeared after a 1.5 month delay from the initial infection. Therefore， an underlying mild degree of myocardial edema might persist after the initial SARS-CoV-2 infection. It might have been in resolution (activation of myocardial fibroblasts) if PIMS-TS would not have occurred. Due to PIMS-TS， a huge amount of vasoactive cytokines were released，leading to vasoplegic shock and increasing the level of myocardial edema which might explain the pathophysiology of cardiogenic shock in this patient. Troponin level was in the normal range at the moment of admission in contrast to删除1换行a marked elevated level of NT-pro-BNP. Due to these two processes that overlapped (subclinical myocarditis and the cytokine storm which increased the level of interstitial edema of the heart) the myocardiocytes were increasingly stretched but not injured，leading to extremely high levels of NT-pro-BNP while the levels of troponin were at the upper limit of normal range values.\n\n【33】The second hypothesis refers to a newly developed PIMS-TS intramyocardial edema in a patient without myocardial damage during the acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection 通用删除6(英):<u>[27，28]</u>. Like we mentioned before， three main mechanisms are involved in PIMS-TS development， according to which pathway is more prominent， so it can clinically present as fulminant myocarditis (mostly described in adults)， acute heart failure， or mild/moderate myocardial enzyme elevation 通用删除6(英):<u>[291</u>. Acute heart failure manifestation is linked with the over stimulating vasoactive cytokine pathway which furthermore leads to vasoplegic shock. Myocardial cell injury might have happened if the2d pathway would have been more prominent (activation of immune cells， neutrophils included) together with increased levels of IL6 and CRP. In this case， the levels of IL6 are CRP were mildly elevated， not leading to an acute muscular cardiac destruction. Once newly developed intramyocardial edema and distributive shock can lead to low LV ejection fraction and clinical manifestation of shock. So we admit that the shock in our case had two components： Cardiogenic and vasoplegic.\n\n【34】The cardiogenic shock had a favorable outcome in our case using 2 inotropic agents Adrenaline (initially dosage 0.1 ug/kg/min，) and Dopamine (10 ug/kg/min) for five days， then only Dopamine for another five days alongside with cardiac remodeling medication： Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitor (Lisinopril)， Spironolactone， Furosemide and Bisoprolol 通用删除6(英):<u>[27]</u>. Clinical condition progressively improved， with resolution of pulmonary stasis， good cerebral perfusion and normalized blood pressure values within 7days， with no mechanical circulatory support required. This clinical presentation matches the information reported by several authors通用删除6(英):<u>[17，28，29]</u>， in which patients with PIMS-TS-cardiogenic shock had a favorable outcome primarily due to immune-mediated damage rather than myocardial injury post SARS-CoV-2 replication. The full recovery in such a short time (with normalized cardiac function by echocardiography in 10 days) using corticosteroids， IVIG， IL-1receptor antagonist and supportive cardiac medication could be an argument for our second hypothesis consisting with PIMS-TS related myocarditis on previously normal myocardium. In conclusion， this case presents a different clinical onset compared with other Covid-19related infections 通用删除6(英):<u>[30]</u> or PIMS-TS cases 通用删除6(英):<u>[31]</u> in Romanian pediatric population.\n\n【35】Conclusion\n\n【36】PIMS-TS is a new described pediatric syndrome which can present as several clinical phenotypes， and some of them can be life-threatening. Cardiogenic shock related to PIMS-TS (with underlying immune myocarditis) is an often clinical presentation with favorable outcome if specific treatment against cytokine storm and supportive cardiac medication are promptly administered. Further studies are necessary to know if a better prognosis in PIMS-TS related severe myocarditis is expected in patients with previously normal myocardium compared with patients with myocardial damage in acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection through direct injury of the virus (non-immune mechanism).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "6753f1f0-7312-4c80-90d5-7be244c8bd90", "title": null, "text": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】It has been a long-standing debate whether a brain abscess is a complication of stroke or is a cause ofstroke-like manifestations. Majority of case reports on brain abscess either as a complication of stroke， or as a stroke mimic are in adults. Here， we present a case of a brain abscess in a child who presented with stroke.\n\n【2】Case Presentation\n\n【3】We report the case of a 12-year old boy who was admitted to our institution for sudden onset of right-sided weakness. Four days prior to admission he started to have low to moderate grade intermittent fever associated with occasional non-paroxysmal unproductive cough. He was prescribed with Clarithromycin， antihistamine， and B2-agonist medications， with resolution of symptoms. The fever recurred 1 day prior to admission associated with 2 episodes of non projectile vomiting of previously ingested food， and a throbbing frontal mild to moderate headache. About12 h prior to admission， the patient could no longer move his right upper and lower extremities， prompting transport to the hospital where he had an episode of generalized tonic clonic seizures lasting for 10 sec.\n\n【4】The past medical history revealed that the patient had a bout of fever and cough about 3 weeks prior to admission， for which he was prescribed Amoxicillin-clavulanic and Salbutamol， with subsequent improvement.\n\n【5】In the emergency room， the patient was examined conscious， coherent， oriented to 3 spheres， verbal but unable to move his right upper and lower extremities， and febrile at 38.6C. The systemic physical examination findings were generally normal. However， the neurologicexamination revealed a flattened right nasolabial fold， inability to lift his right shoulder， and deviation of the tongue to the right on protrusion. There was 0/5 motor strength of the right upper and lower extremities. Babinski sign present at the right. Hyporeflexia was noted on the right upper and lower extremities.\n\n【6】The patient was initially admitted as childhood stroke， and was worked up along this impression. There was neutrophilia seen in the complete blood count. This， together with the fever prompted administration of antibiotics. Hyponatremia at 127.5 mEq/L was seen. The prothrombin time was prolonged with an activity of 57.4% while the activated partial thromboplastin time was normal. The lipid profile showed low High Density Lipoproteins (HDL). The urinalysis was normal. The chest radiograph and the 2-dimensional echocardiography were normal.\n\n【7】The initial non-contrast cranial CT scan only showed focal brain atropy at the right frontallobe area without any sign of hemorrhage or infarction .\n\n【8】The fever resolved on the third day of hospitalization while on the antibiotics， but the motor deficits did not improve. Physical therapy was started.\n\n【9】By the sixth day of hospitalization， the patient’s motor strength on the right upper and lower extremity was seen to be 2/5， which further improved to 3/5 the next day. Rehabilitation therapy and the antibiotics were continued.\n\n【10】The patient's condition was progressively improving， when on the 17 hospital day there was note of sudden regression of the motor strength of the affected side to 0/5. Anisocoria was also noted. A re-stroke was considered so a repeat non contrast brain CT scan was performed； this time， multiple defined masses on the left frontal lobe were seen with vasogenic edema and mass effect， consistent with a brain abscess .删除1换行cited.\n\n【11】A neurosurgery referral was made， and a contrast-enhanced brain CT scan was preceded，\n\n【12】With the medications and rehabilitation， his condition gradually improved. By the 8h post-op day， he was already able to gain full motor strength in the right leg while the right arm strength improved\n\n【13】W13D L：43\n\n【14】A repeat contrast-enhanced cranial CT scan done on the 37hospital day showed interval enlargement of the rim-enhancing fluid density in the left frontal lobe， surrounding vasogenic edema and expansile effect， right subfalcine herniation and left frontal craniotomy defect .\n\n【15】Aspiration of the abscess was performed. Culture of the abscess fluid did not yield any growth. Antibiotics were continued.\n\n【16】A repeat cranial CT scan on the 42n hospital day showed interval decrease in size of rim-enhancing fluid density in the left frontal lobe and interval decrease in rightward subfalcine herniation， still with vasogenic edema. Medications were continued and further clinical improvement was noted .\n\n【17】Patient was discharged on the 45h hospital day already isocoric， with full strength in both lower extremities and left upper extremity， and residual weakness in the right upper extremity.\n\n【18】Discussion\n\n【19】Childhood stroke is defined similarly as adult stroke： an acute onset neurological sign or symptom attributable to a focal brain infarction or hemorrhage 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，2]</u>. Just like in adults， childhood stroke can be divided into hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke.\n\n【20】Hemorrhagic stroke may be intra parenchymal or spontaneous non traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage. Focal brain damage results from hemorrhage through localized mass effect and ischemia of adjacent tissues. Cerebral infarction or ischemic stroke may result from Arterial Ischemic Stroke (AIS)， venous infarction， or Cerebral Sinovenous Thrombosis (CSVT). Focal brain damage from ischemic stroke results when there is a loss of blood flow or oxygenation to an area of brain tissue 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>.\n\n【21】Stroke in children is reported to be common. It affects 1 in 1，600to 4，000 neonates 通用删除6(英):<u>[3，4]</u>， and 2.3 to 13 per 100，000 older children annually 通用删除6(英):<u>[5-7]</u>. Hemorrhagic stroke accounts for 50% of pediatric stroke， with an annual incidence of approximately 1 to 1.7 in 100，000children 通用删除6(英):<u>[6，8]</u>. The remaining 50% of pediatric stroke is accounted for by ischemic stroke， with a slightly higher annual incidence of 1 to 2 per100，000 children in developed countries 通用删除6(英):<u>[8，9]</u>. In the Philippines， the registry of childhood diseases of the Philippine Pediatric Society， Inc.， shows that there is a total of 701 reported cases of stroke in children from January 1，2006 to December 315，2019通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>. In a country with roughly 42，311，222 children 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>，the annual incidence rate of stroke is approximately 0.12 per 100，000 Filipino children. This number is much lower than that was reported for developed Western countries. However， this may not be a true reflection of the incidence of stroke among Filipino children as the PPS registry collects data only from their accredited training hospitals.\n\n【22】The most common symptoms of acute stroke in children are similar to those in adults. These include hemiparesis and hemi facial weakness (67% to 90%)， speech or language disturbance (20% to50%)， vision disturbance (10% to 15%)， and ataxia (8% to 10%).Non-localizing symptoms like headache and altered mental status may also be present. Seizures manifest in 15% to 25% of children with stroke通用删除6(英):<u>[12-15]</u>. Seizure serves as a sentinel sign of acute stroke in children， occurring in 31% to 46% of younger children with stroke 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. Our patient presented with headache， vomiting， right-sided hemiparesis， and seizures. Clearly， our patient’s clinical manifestations are compatible with acute stroke.\n\n【23】The nature of the stroke-like manifestations of the patient on presentation was a dilemma for a time because aside from the absence of an infarcted area in the brain on the initial cranial CT scan， the search for the more common etiologies like sickle cell disease，cardiac disorders， or prothrombotic conditions were negative. A suspicion for yet undetermined infection was considered based on the presence of fever and neutrophilia in the complete blood count.\n\n【24】Literatures show that only approximately 50% of patients with ischemic stroke will have known risk factors predisposing to stroke at the time of diagnosis. However， after thorough evaluation， 40% of children with ischemic stroke are found to have 1 risk factor， 50%have 2 or more factors， and 10% have no identified risk factor for stroke. These risk factors include arteriopathies， cardiac disorders， infection， acute head and neck disorders， acute systemic conditions， chronic systemic conditions， prothrombic states， chronic head and neck disorders， atherosclerosis-related risk factors， and others 通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>.\n\n【25】The path physiology of the stroke in our patient was made clearer when a repeat cranial tomography showed multiple defined masses on the left frontal lobe with vasogenic edema and mass effect， which showed enhancement with contrast. This finding was compatible with brain abscess.\n\n【26】Brain abscess is a focal infection in the brain parenchyma删除1换行consisting of encapsulated d ous andpyogenic bacteria. Less commonly， fungi， mycobacteria or protozoa cause brain abscess通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>. Brain abscesses are reportedly rare in children， but they can cause significant morbidity and mortality 通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u>. They occur in 0.4 per100，000 children annually but may range from 0.3 to 1.3 per 100，000children 通用删除6(英):<u>[19，17]</u>. The registry of childhood diseases of the Philippine Pediatric Society (PPS)， Inc. shows that there are 1，206 cases of intracranial abscess over 14 years 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>. This translates to an annual incidence of 0.20 per 100，000 Filipino children. This number is lower than the reported incidence and contrasts with the report by Gaskill and Marlin 通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u> which said that there is a higher incidence of brain abscess in underdeveloped countries 通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u>. They more common in males in the first two decades of life 通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u>. Children 4 to 7 years old have the highest incidence of brain abscess 通用删除6(英):<u>[19，22]</u>. The locations of abscesses in the brain， in decreasing frequency， are frontotemporal， frontoparietal，parietal，cerebellar， and occipital areas 通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u>.\n\n【27】Eighty percent of children with brain abscess have predisposing factors while 20% of cases are cryptogenic 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>. Among children with predisposing factors， 30% to 50% result from contiguous focus of infection like otitis media， mastoiditis， sinusitis， orbital cellulitis通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>， or dental infections 通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u>. Approximately 10% of cases occur in cases where the body's natural barriers are disrupted like in cases of neurosurgical procedures or head trauma 通用删除6(英):<u>[17，25，26]</u>. Hematogenous spread associated with上bacteremia andimmunosuppressive conditions accounts for 40% of cases of brain abscess in children 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>. Direct spread of the organism from a contiguous focus of infection usually causes solitary brain abscess 通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u> while bacteremic spread typically causes multiple brain abscesses 通用删除6(英):<u>[27]</u>. Based on the history and the physical exam which did not show evidence of probable contiguous foci of infection， neurosurgical procedure or head trauma， and the multiple abscess lesions seen in the cranial tomogram， the brain abscesses in our patient must have resulted from a bacteremic route. However， despite work-up， there was no underlying condition that was identified. This absence of an underlying condition or a primary site of infection has been reported in 20% to 40% of patients with brain abscess.\n\n【28】The signs and symptoms of brain abscess are initially nonspecific通用删除6(英):<u>[28-31]</u>. Headache is the most common symptom， occurring in 69%of cases. Fever occurs in 45% to 53% of patients， seizures in 25%，and focal neurologic deficits in up to 50% of children with brain abscess通用删除6(英):<u>[32，33]</u>.Individually， each of these signs and symptoms is not a reliable basis for the diagnosis of brain abscess. Even the classic triad of fever， headache， and focal neurologic deficits that suggests brain abscess is present in only 20% of cases 通用删除6(英):<u>[34]</u>. Thus， a high index of suspicion is recommended. Our patient presented with fever， headache， and hemiparesis. This should have alerted us to the possibility of brain abscess on admission； however， in the absence of abscess lesions on the initial cranial tomogram， the diagnosis of brain abscess was not considered on admission.\n\n【29】Hemiparesis in cases of brain abscess is reported to be more common in children than in adults. In a review of literatures on brain abscesses in children， the incidence ofhemiparesis ranged from19.2% to 44.06% 通用删除6(英):<u>[35-37]</u>. This high incidence was demonstrated to result from the involvement of the eloquent areas of the brain with seeding of metastatic abscesses 通用删除6(英):<u>[37]</u>.\n\n【30】The question that we asked ourselves in the management of this patient was that is this a case of the brain abscess being a stroke mimic or is the brain abscess a complication of stroke. Unfortunately， there删除1换行is a dearth of literatures related to this topic in pediatrics. However， there have been reports of brain abscess as complication of stroke in adults. To date， there are 20 case reports of brain abscess after stroke that were published 通用删除6(英):<u>[38-57]</u>. All of these are reported in adults. The abscess is reported to develop 12 days to 14 months after the stroke incident 通用删除6(英):<u>[58，59]</u>. Our patient was diagnosed with brain abscess 17days after the stroke.\n\n【31】The pathogenesis of brain abscess after a stroke involves the disruption and loss of integrity of the blood brain barrier around the ischemic area 通用删除6(英):<u>[43]</u>， making it vulnerable to microbial seeding when bacteremia occurs during a systemic infection 通用删除6(英):<u>[38]</u>.\n\n【32】However， brain abscess as a complication of the ischemic stroke could not be explained by the afebrile state of our patient at the time of or immediately before the diagnosis of brain abscess was made. This made us consider an alternative scenario where the developing brain abscess acted as a stroke mimic.\n\n【33】There have also been reports of brain abscesses as stroke mimics通用删除6(英):<u>[60-70]</u>.Unfortunately again all these reports are in adults. The exact mechanism how a brain abscess presents with stroke-like symptoms is still unclear. One hypothesis is the development of paroxysmal septic emboli that causes embolic infarction which becomes the nidus for the abscess formation 通用删除6(英):<u>[61]</u>. However， the septic work-up in our patient did not reveal any focus of infection that could have thrown a septic embolus to the brain. The authors hypothesize that the stroke-like manifestations in our patient， not accompanied by an apparent infarct in the cranial tomogram， may be due to the cerebritis stage of abscess formation and its accompanying inflammatory vasculitis or in-situ thrombus formation， and that the brain abscess in our patient could have been cryptogenic in nature. It has been reported that the cranial tomography of the brain may be negative or may show only subtle nonspecific findings during the early stages of evolution of a brain abscess 通用删除6(英):<u>[71]</u>. It could have been better if a magnetic resonance imaging of the brain was done as it is the preferred imaging method in the initial examination. Sadly， our institution lacks this technology for now.\n\n【34】The most important lesson that this patient taught us， regardless of whether the brain abscess is a complication of a stroke or is a stroke mimic， is that a high index of suspicion for the possibility of a brain abscess in a patient with stroke-like manifestations is quite necessary for early diagnosis and treatment to prevent significant morbidity and mortality.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

His neurological examination revealed that he was conscious， had distorted time orientation， and was partially cooperative.

Cerebral venous\n\n【20】Discussion\n\n【21】There is no effective drug therapy in the fight against COVID-19， and the most effective way to be protected from COVID-19 is to try to prevent the spread of the COVID-19 through vaccination. There are two types of vaccines， viral vector vaccines and messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines. CVST is one of the serious side effects seen in association with the administration of mRNA vaccines， albeit rare. Vaccine-induced thrombocytopenic thrombosis is blamed for this serious side effect 通用删除6(英):<u>[7，8]</u>. However， in addition to cases with CVST accompanied by thrombocytopenia， cases who developed thromboembolic events without thrombocytopenia have also been reported duringthe post-vaccination period. In parallel， in the study of Perry et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>， in which cases that developed CVST after vaccination against COVID-19 were examined， vaccine-induced immune thrombocytopenia was observed in 70 of the 95 CVST patients， while the remaining 20 patients did not develop thrombocytopenia 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>. In comparison， the first case presented in this study developed CVST on the second day after vaccination. This is different than the results reported in the literature in that the cases presented in the literature were reported to have developed thrombosis within 4 to 19 days after vaccination. The platelet count of the patient was normal， however he was found to have hyperhomocysteinemia， vitamin B12 deficiency and homozygous MTHFR (Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase)删除1换行mutation. Accordingly， the presence of additional risk factors is thought to have predisposed the patient to thrombosis， which caused the patient to develop thrombosis as early as on the second day after vaccination. This result raises the question whether genetic examination， homocysteine， vitamin B12 level and other coagulation factors should be checked before vaccination， even if the patients do not have a history of thromboembolic events. On the other hand， the etiology of the second case presented in this study included hyperfibrinogenemia as well as obesity as a predisposing factor. Brain MRI revealed venous watershed infarct areas in both of the cases investigated in this study， and a dramatic improvement was observed in their clinics after treatment. There was extensive thrombus in both deep and superficial veins in the second case presented in this study， yet the fact that recanalization was observed in the follow-up MRV taken on the 7h day suggests that early diagnosis and treatment were effective on the prognosis.\n\n【22】In CVST， venous pressure increases secondary to obstruction， whereas capillary perfusion decreases. Initially the cerebral collateral network tolerates this pressure， yet venous stasis， vasogenic edema， and hemorrhagic infarctions occur in the later period as the capacity of the collateral network is exceeded. Decreased cerebral perfusion causes cytotoxic edema and increased intracranial pressure. There are studies in which it was demonstrated on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) that the resulting increase in intracranial pressure causes ischemia 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>. The reported etiological causes of patients with watershed infarcts secondary to CVST in the literature vary. The course of the disease was not mortal in any of these patients， and clinical improvement was observed in all of them after treatment. Deep venous thrombosis was common to all these patients. Presence of deep venous thrombosis indicates a poor prognosis as venous watershed infarcts are seen in relation thereto， but there were no patients with a mortal course among the reported cases.\n\n【23】In conclusion， early diagnosis seems to be a very effective parameter in prognosis. Additionally， the presence of genetic mutations in the two cases presented in this study in association with COVID-19 infection and COVID-19 vaccination suggests that genetic tests should be carried out in these patients.\n\n【24】Watershed infarct areas are mostly observed in hypotensive cerebral infarction. Differential diagnosis is important since different删除1换行treatments are indicated in arterial and venous watershed infarcts. It should be kept in mind that CVST may be present in patients with watershed infarct areas and clinically prominent headache， and that watershed infarcts may be of venous origin， albeit rarely.\n\n【25】Highlights\n\n【26】Watershed infarcts are not always arterial.\n\n【27】Cerebral venous thrombosis should be excluded in the presence of headache and watershed infarct.\n\n【28】Heparin may worsen the clinic in thrombosis induced by COVID-19 infection.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

These organizations work together and coordinate their efforts to improve worldwide accreditation and conformity assessment.\n\n【21】The achievement of accreditation is the result of a process that involves all the organization functions， also in terms of commitment and awareness， so that the entire structure is effectively strengthened， in terms of greater transparency and visibility.\n\n【22】For the user， accreditation is an invisible tool which， however， entails real and perceptible advantages and benefits. It ensures that the supplier has fulfilled a whole series of obligations and has deployed all the resources to be able to place on the market a service that actually delivers what it claims. This is particularly significant when the service directly impacts health.\n\n【23】ISO 15189：2012 standard\n\n【24】Accreditation according to ISO 15189 allows the medical laboratory to give evidence to its users of compliance with the commitments made ensuring also the effectiveness and reliability of the service provided in all its characteristic phases.\n\n【25】The standard is divided into two main sections：\n\nManagement requirements of the laboratory quality management system (organization， quality management system， document control， service agreements， examination by referral laboratories， external services and supplies， consultancy services， resolution of complaints， identification and control of nonconformities， corrective action， preventive action， continual improvement， control of records， internal audits， management review) and|删除段之间换行|II Technical requirements ipersonnel qualification， accommodation and environmental conditions， equipment， pre-examination processes， examination processes， ensuring quality of examination results，post-examination processes， reporting of results， release of results， information management).\n\n【27】ISO 15189 takes into consideration specific procedures and elements of the quality system concerning the processes related to the main activities of the laboratory's operational flow through an overall approach in quality management that includes all aspects of the functioning from the pre-examination to post-examination process.\n\n【28】The Standard allows the laboratory to define and keep under control the operating methods， procedures， records relating to：\n\n【29】Reception， preparation and identification of the patient；\n\n【30】Collection， transport and storage of samples；\n\n【31】Analysis techniques used1anddvalidation andSsafety procedures；\n\n【32】Reporting criteria and methods；\n\n【33】Skills and training of the personnel involved；\n\n【34】Problem management methods and， more generally， a proactive：approachthrough actionss aimedaatcontinuouis improvement.\n\n【35】This Standard provides the definition and management of types of aspects， processes and sub-processes： Are there specific standards to help the laboratory in dealing with these activities?\n\n【36】Materials and Methods\n\n【37】Although the version of ISO 15189：212 is not yet aligned with the most recent management standards， such as ISO 9001：2015 and ISO/IEC 17025：2017 (in terms， for example， of \"process approach\"， \"risk based thinking\"and“ISO High Level Structure)， it is also possible to identify some relevant and peculiar processes：\n\n【38】Risk management；\n\n【39】0 POCT-Point-of-care testing；\n\n【40】删除8:<u>口 </u>Measurement uncertainty of measured quantity values；\n\n|  | Preanalytlcal Phase  |  | Analytlcal Phase  | Analytlcal Phase  | Postanalytlcal Phase  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  | Analytlcal Phase  | Postanalytlcal Phase  |\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |\n|  | Missing tube 通用删除7(英):<u>(7)</u> Nonrefrigcratedsample 通用删除7(英):<u>(7)</u>  |  |\n\n【44】删除8:<u>口 </u>Security management；\n\n【45】Audit processes.\n\n【46】Focusing on these， attention should be paid to assess the existence of specific standards that allow the implementation of the requirements in the most exhaustive possible way； interesting reference documents have been identified and following analyzed.\n\n【47】Risk management\n\n【48】“The laboratory shall evaluate the impact of work processes and potential failures on examination results as they affect patient safety， and shall modify processes to reduce or eliminate the identified risk and document decisions and actions taken.(ISO 15189，$4.14.6)通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>.\n\n【49】Laboratory analysis is a fundamental phase in the patient care process.

Managing the analytical-diagnostic process means integrating all the phases that make up the analytical path， placing the laboratory in the condition of ensuring in real time the control of decentralized instruments， keeping the clinical risk at a low and clinically acceptable level. Health systems must in fact guarantee services that are safe， effective，patient-centered，timely， efficient and equitable also in economic terms.\n\n【65】Despite the spread of POCT systems， supported by the publication of the standard EN ISO 22870：2016-\"Point-of-Care Testing (POCT)-Requirements for quality and competence\"通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>， there is not much evidence in literature that demonstrate a real advantage in terms of improvement of the outcome (13% of the case studies)， however the help that POCT can give in terms of maintaining the quality standards necessary seems very effective for care 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>.\n\n【66】Measurement uncertainty of measured quantity values\n\n【67】“The laboratory shall determine measurement uncertainty for each measurement procedure in the examination phase used to report measured quantity values on patient’s samples.

Measurement uncertainty must also be estimated for the most relevant quantitative phases of the examination processes that provide nominal qualitative results.\n\n【72】Knowledge of uncertainty of the examination performed in the medical laboratory is necessary to be aware of the reliability of its results. The fundamental aspects are repetition and level 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>：\n\n【73】Whatever the method appliedforthe laboratory examination， the “accuracy of the uncertainty\" is evident from repetitions of the examination on the same material (conditions of repeatability). In support of this comes the Internal Quality Control(CQI) which allows to identify the dispersion of the numerical quantitative results and the frequency of positives for the nominal qualitative results；\n\n【74】The uncertainty also depends on the level of property measured in the material， both for numerical quantitative and nominal qualitative results.\n\n【75】Security management\n\n【76】“The laboratory and associated office facilities shall provide an environment suitable for the tasks to be undertaken， to ensure the following conditions are met.

It defines how to establish and maintain a safe working environment in a medical laboratory. The standard states that a work area safety manual must be readily available with mandatory reading for all employees and must contain security policy， fire prevention， electrical safety， chemical safety， radiation exposure， biological risks， and hazardous waste disposal.\n\n【82】The safety manual must include detailed instructions for evacuation from the workplace and the protocols to be put in place to deal with any accidents. The safety program (evaluated with Safety program audits) must be verified and reviewed at least once a year and the premises must be inspected (Safety inspection) at least with the same frequency.\n\n【83】Audit management\n\n【84】“The laboratory shall conduct internal audits at planned intervals to determine whether all activities in the quality management system， including pre-examination， examination， and post-examination：删除1换行a) Conform to the requirement of this International Standard and to requirements established by the laboratory， and删除1换行b) Are implemented， effective， and maintained.” (ISO 15189， S4.14.5)通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>.\n\n【85】ISO 15189 requires that a documented procedure for the management of audits must be in place that an audit program must be defined that includes the treatment of all elements of the management system. Internal audits must be carried out by competent and independent personnel (with respect to the activity being audited) and the standard EN ISO 19011：2018-“Guidelines for auditing management systems\" 通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u> is expressly mentioned as a guide to follow for the execution.\n\n【86】This standard has aligned with many recently published ISO standards by including a risk-based approach： An audit approach that considers risks and opportunities of the audit activities.\n\n【87】The risk-based approach influences planning， conduct and reporting of audits in order to ensure that the latter are focused on significant issues for the client and to achieve the audit program objectives.\n\n【88】The process approach is central to this standard as auditors should understand that conducting a management system audit means auditing an organization s processes and their interactions in relation to one or more standards of management systems. Results are achieved more effectively and efficiently when activities are understood and managed as interrelated processes that act as an organic system.\n\nThe investigation techniques， therefore， should include interviews guided by the 5 \"key questions\" of aprocess audit structured according to the logical PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) sequence：|删除段之间换行|1.

For this purpose，there are various standards to support a Medical Laboratory to guide it in the implementation of a management system compliant with ISO 15189； these standards provide more details to demonstrate the compliance of key processes with the requirements ofthe standard and guide thelaboratory towards planning and implementing actions to address the risks and opportunities of the various processes involved. This represents the basis for increasing the effectiveness of the management system， obtaining better results and preventing negative effects that could cause harm to patients，laboratory staffand environment.\n\n【96】The consistency of diagnostic resultsSbetween different laboratories (even from different countries) is facilitated when medical laboratories comply with these standards in the correct， complete， effective and efficient implementation of their ISO 15189system.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

Multiple obsessions (60%) and compulsions (48%) are present in most patients over time 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>.\n\n【5】Like Developed countries， the prevalence of OCD is ranged from 1% to 2% in Bangladeshi children and adolescents 通用删除6(英):<u>[7</u>.通用删除6(英):<u>8]</u>. Unlike children’s age group， interference from obsessions， the mean obsession score， and extreme OCD are significantly higher in adolescents 通用删除6(英):<u>[9，10]</u>. However， sometimes OCD patients present in an unusual way that their assessment and diagnosis become so difficult and they face legal issues or multiple consultations in different specialties. This unusual presentation is not uncommon among the children and adolescent's population as evident in the contents of the miscellaneous group of OCD 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>. Here we depicted a case of an adolescent boy presented with stealing and perfectionist behavior facing social harassment and legal difficulties later diagnosed and treated as a case of OCD.\n\n【6】Identifying Inform atio n\n\n【7】Tahsan (apseudonym)， a 15 years old boy， student of 9th grade，hailing from the semi-urban area of Cumilla， Bangladesh.\n\n【8】The main complaint“in his and mother words\"\n\n【9】“Urge to pick-up mobile phone， tendency to complete every work in an unusually perfect way， repeated checking behavior， irritability for the last two years”\n\n【10】History of present illness\n\n【11】Tahsan was quite well two years back. Then he gradually developed to practice some behaviors symmetrically following the death of his uncle. He described an urge to repeat certain actions删除1换行until complete perfectly. He used to replace everything in the same places in the house. He wanted to get a \"just perfect\" feeling. If someone displaced household things he became angry with that person. He had repeated urges of certain motor acts， usually socially embarrassing ones， for example， and the urge to slap others. Tahsan also developed checking behaviors. He was unable to leave the house without lengthy repetitive checking of school bag， door locks， water taps， and electric switches. He took longer and longer so that he was often late for school. His mother gave him a mobile/cell phone so that she can contact him when he was outside the home. He used to carry the phone in his right pocket of the pant. Gradually he felt distressed that his left pocket was empty. So， he started to take his mother's phone and put it in his left pocket without noticing his mother. Then， his mother failed to connect him. So， she did not allow him to take her phone. But Tahsan felt severe distress without taking both phones into his pockets separately. For that， he went to a mobile shop in the local area and stole a phone. Shop keepers caught him with stolen mobile and beat him collectively. He was failed to explain the cause and injured badly. He hid the total incident from his mother. Tahsan also started to avoid wearing shirts that have a pocket so that he could avoid putting another phone into them. These types of incidents took place six times in the last year. He managed new places every time and shop keepers beat him every time but did not take any legal action except last time. He stole the last phone from a mobile repair shop and they took him to the local police station. Police called his mother and handed over him without taking anylegal action after taking a written promise from his mother that it will not happen again. All these problems were associated with considerable impairment and disability in terms of role functioning， educational productivity， disability days as well as social embarrassment. After that incident， Tahsan convinced his mother that mobile stealing was not intentionally happened rather he had been suffering from a disease. They went for psychiatric consultation and wanted to know what was wrong with him.\n\n【12】Other relevant history\n\n【13】Tahsan came from a middle-class family. He was the only son of his parents. His father， 46 years， lived in Saudi Arabia for a job for14 years， and his mother， 38 years， was a housewife. Consanguinity of marriage was absent. His paternal uncle had been suffering from psychotic illness but could not mention the name of the disease. The patient was born and raised in the Cumilla district of Bangladesh. His birth and early development were uneventful. Tahsan first experienced obsessive-compulsive symptoms when he was at 10years of age. He would tell his mother to repeat some words， like“Assalamualikum (Hello)\"and“Ami Valo Achi (I am fine)\". He also got into bed with a fixed way to avoid happening of bad things. These behaviors did not cause any significant impairment in his daily life. Mother was very strict and he was often physically punished by the mother. He was a good student since early childhood and had very few friends due to his mother's strict rules and they were not allowed to his place. Tahsan never took any substance and never fell in trouble with the law. He had no psychiatric disorder and his medical history was uneventful particularly before the present problems. His predominant mood used to be within normal range with a good attitude to seniors and juniors though he was relatively less sociable with poor peer relationships. He passed his COVID-19 related leisure period bylearning to drive a motorcycle and Facebooking.\n\n【14】Mental status and other relevant exam inations on the first visit\n\n【15】An adolescent boy with an average body built and nutritional删除1换行status was sitting on a chair. He put on a T-shirt without any pockets and a pant which was culturally and seasonally accepted. His skin， clothes， and hair reflected that overall hygiene was maintained. He looked anxious a little. Though his gaze was forward， eye-to-eye contact was possible and maintained. Rapport was established and sustained. He was cooperative during the interview and aware about surroundings. There was no oddity of gesture，posture， and behavior.\n\n【16】The boy described his mood as irritable which was predominant， persistent， and pervasive in all situations. Affect was also irritable， moderate in intensity， appropriate to the settings， and congruous to the mood. He talked spontaneously； the answers were relevant. The rate， rhythm， volume， fluency， and tone of the speech were normal. There was no oddity of speech. There was no delusion， suicidal ideation. Hehad obsessive impulses and thought of doubt with themes of the need for symmetry. He， also， had compulsions in the form of checking and ordering/arranging things. However， he recognized that both obsessions and compulsions were of his own thought and action， intrusive in nature， senseless， definitely not true and tried to resist and control but failed， spending three to four hours per day which causes distress and severe functional impairment in daily life. His perception， cognitive function， and judgment were normal. His general and systemic including neurological examinations were normal. Routine and relevant special laboratory investigations were also within the normalrange.Forpsychometric evaluation， we applied Bangla validated Childrens Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive scale通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>. His total， obsessions， and compulsions scores were 31， 14 and17 respectively.\n\n【17】Differential diagnoses\n\n【18】删除3:<u>We considered OCD， Kleptomania， Conduct Disorder， and normal stealing. Tahsan had persistent obsessions and compulsions. Though the boy failed to control his urge to steal mobile phones with the evidence that he did not do it for personal use or their monetary value. He was not a case of Kleptomania as he was predominantly distressed before the act and there was no pleasure or gratification after the act. Rather， he felt irritability， guilt， and remorse after taking the phone from the shop. Our meticulous history also revealed that Tahsan had no deceitfulness， aggression to people/animals， destruction of property， or serious violation of rules that excluded Conduct Disorder. In real theft， stealing occurs due to material value or personal benefits. Family history revealed that there was no financial crisis in his family that his parents could not fulfill his demand rather he had no demand for the Smartphone.</u>\n\n【19】Diagnostic impression\n\n【20】From history， examinations， and investigations， Tahsan had been suffering from Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder with fair insight as he had both time-consuming obsessions and compulsions which causes severe distress with social and educational impairment and there was sufficient evidence that they were not due to any substance or another medical condition or another psychiatric disorder. Psychometric evaluation supported that his disorder was severe in intensity.\n\n【21】Treatment plan\n\n【22】a. Problems： Urge to pick up mobile phone， want to complete every work in a perfect way， repeated checking behavior， Irritability which results in educational and social problems.删除1换行b. Goals： Not picking up phone from shop， reduction of perfectionist behavior， reduction of checking behavior which was time-consuming， improvement of educational and social problems.\n\n【23】Interventions\n\n【24】a. Child Focus： Explanation， advice， and support to Tahsan. Psychological interventions included relaxation exercise， Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP)， thought stopping， and daily work program. Pharmacotherapy provided by capsule Fluoxetine started with 20 mg titrated to 40 mg daily 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>.删除1换行b. Family Focus： Psychoeducation， Family counseling with special emphasis on the role of the parents. Here， mother worked as a co-therapist.删除1换行c. School Focus： Liaison with school authority with providing a letter which described the disorder， current interventions， and asking help from class teachers and peer groups.删除1换行d. Social Focus： The psychiatrist gave a letter to the Police Station and Chairman of the Union Council (Local Government Body) describing the psychiatric problem that the boy had been suffered.\n\n【25】Follow-up and outcome\n\n【26】The boy was advised to follow up fortnightly for the first three months. Initial increment of anxiety and restlessness was successfully managed by short-term use of clonazepam. The patient's initial improvement was achieved after one month. CY-BOCS Bangla score was 26，21 and 11 at the end of the 15，2n and 3 month respectively with regular ERP sessions and 40 mg of fluoxetine. At that time， the patient was distress-free and was able to do his daily works including education.\n\n【27】Discussion\n\n【28】Children and adolescents with OCD are typically presented with contamination， fear of harm， blasphemous， sometimes somatic thought 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>. However， Pediatric OCD occasionally presents in such a way that does not fall into one of these themes. When symptoms appear as atypical or unusual， they may not be recognized as OCD and lead to delay in diagnosis and treatment.\n\n【29】In one study of OCD in Bangladesh， patients presented with unusual presentations such as headache (56%)， decreased sexual behavior (16%)， chronic cough (9.6%)， pain (8%)， vomiting (8%)， increase frequency of micturition (2.4%) and deliberate self-harm(1.6%) were later diagnosed as OCD 通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u>. In another study of pediatric patients， they describe 24 children with OCD. Twelve children had obsessions related to fearsome experiences of places or people and led to contamination obsessions. Twelve other children had obsessions of primary sensory experiences which later linked to objects or people， leading to compulsive behaviors to avoid that distressful sensory stimulus 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>. Rasmussen and Eisen described another case of a woman who was compelled to let the telephone ring continuously， sometimes up to 40 times， until she got the just-right feeling to her ear 通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>\n\n【30】Our case， Tahsan， had prominent obsessions as wwell as compulsions. He discussed both his obsession and compulsions in the first visit， though many patients are less spontaneously revealing in early sessions. For that， an assessment of pediatric OCD requires specific questions that can allow different insights to discuss thoughts and actions which can be embarrassing. Tahsan reported multiple obsessions such as symmetry (Thought of exactness in arranging phone， household things)， doubt (Uncertainty about previous actions of common daily activities)， and repeated urges to carry out actions which were recurrent， persistent， intrusive， and unwanted删除1换行thoughts， naturally induce anxiety or distress. He also had several compulsions such as checking behaviors， ordering/arranging things(All the pockets of the clothes should have mobile phones) which are repetitive behavior in response to obsessions. These behaviors were aimed at reducing distress and also excessive or realistically unconnected to the anticipated event. These symptoms were time-consuming (3 h to 4 h/day) and caused distress and impairment in Tahsan's educational， social andpersonal life. Not only his symptoms were time-consuming but he appeared to be a socially embarrassed， isolated adolescent whose life had been significantly ravaged by OCD. It is important to explore whether OCD symptoms can be attributable to a substance， medication， or other psychiatric conditions. From history， it appeared that Tahsan had no such history including Kleptomania and Conduct Disorder. To subcategorize OCD， Thasan had no history of Tic Disorder. Another specified related to insight， Tahsan appeared to understand his obsessional beliefs are untrue and so would fall into the insightful category.\n\n【31】Tahsan may be biologically vulnerable to develop OCD due to one of his paternal uncles had been suffering from psychotic illness. Furthermore， he appeared to have an anxious temperament. Stressful life events such as the current stressful COVID-19 situation， strict rules of his mother may have predisposed Tahsan to develop psychopathology. Compulsive symptoms of Tahsan linked to the mobile phone (Need for symmetry) may be due to easy availability of phone to child and adolescent students for attaining online class during COVID-19 related lockdown， passing leisure period by Facebooking during long school closure due to COVID-19. This symmetry phenomenology is commonly expressed by OCD patients and discussed in the literature on child and adolescents OCD 通用删除6(英):<u>[17，181</u>. Valleni-Basile et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u> described that the most common compulsion(Over 50%) in adolescent OCD patients was ordering and arranging things 通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u>. Pick-up mobile phone due to reducing distress was defined as Not Just Right Experiences’ (NJREs) 通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u>. Though he had subclinical symptoms during middle childhood， Tahsan had gradual onset of OCD following the death of his relative. His illness was exacerbated by stressful conditions like upcoming school assignments， physical assault after pick-up the phone. Moreover， excitement related to learning to drive motorcycle was act as a salient trigger factor. Despite the vicious cycle of OCD， Tahsan had numerous protective factors including a supportive mother， well financial condition， achieving well at school， and average intelligence. So， if he continued his current intervention accordingly， he may lead a better life.\n\n【32】Conclusion\n\n【33】Obsessive-compulsive disorder is usually an easily diagnosable psychiatric disorder but not always and sometimes its presentation is atypical， especially， in children and adolescents. That may result in delayed diagnosis which causes long-suffering of the patient， sometimes after legal and social harassment. Awareness of mental health problems， meticulous clinical assessment can reduce over or under diagnosis of this high impacting psychiatric disorder.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

In this article， a case of a premature infant with a gestational age of 24+1 weeks was successfully treated， but no sequelae were found during follow-up. It is reminded that the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) of tertiary hospitals in China through careful and standardized management， enables children to smoothly pass through the three major barriers of breathing， nutrition， and infection， as well as the subsequent kangaroo care and family participatory management， which can fully realize the Preterm infants aged 24 to 25 weeks survived without obvious defects.\n\n【2】Keywords： Super premature infants； Gestational age 24 weeks； Dyspnea； Sequelae\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Hospital admission\n\n【5】The patient， a female， was admitted to the hospital on September 24h，2019 because of“gestational age of 24+1 weeks and dyspnea for 40 min after birth\". The child is the second child of the second child， and the gestational age is 24+1 weeks. The mothers prenatal measurement of blood pressure is high， urine protein is +， suffering from\" bacterial vaginosis\" and given \"cefoxitin anti-infection and topical vaginal medication\"treatment. Before childbirth，\"dexamethasone needle1 course\" has been given to promote fetal lung maturity. She gave birth naturally and weighed770 g. Amniotic fluid， umbilical cord， and placenta were normal. After birth， the child breathes like breath， weak spontaneous breathing， Apgar score of 1 min， 5 min and 9 points (respiration deduction 1 point)， the gestational age of the child is less than 26 weeks， and requires prophylactic administration of pulmonary surfactant and endotracheal intubation the rewarmed porcine lung phospholipid injection 160 mg was dripped into the tube. After the drug was used up， he still had difficulty breathing and had weak spontaneous breathing. He was transferred to the neonatology department under tracheal intubation and resuscitation balloon positive pressure ventilation. Both mother and father are 32 years old. One brother is 5 years old and healthy. Physical examination：Body temperature 36.6C，heart rate 145 beats/min， breathing 68 beats/min， weight 770 gm. Ultra-premature babies have appearance， poor response， thin and shiny skin， nails not reaching the fingertips， unobvious foot texture， no nodules in the breast， and unobvious areola. The fontanelle is flat and soft， the spontaneous breathing is weak， the mouth is cyanotic， and the three concave signs are positive. Breath sounds in both lungs were low， and no wet rales were heard. The heart sounds are strong， regular and without noise. The abdominal examination was normal. The labia majora does not cover the labia minor. The muscle tone of the limbs is low， and the original reflex is not elicited. Admitted to the hospital for diagnosis of Extremely Preterm Infants (EPI) and ultra-low birth weight infants.\n\n【6】Diagnosis and treatment process\n\nKeep warm in an advanced incubator with a humidity of 90%. Give the ventilator assisted breathing SIMV mode，initial parameters： Peak Inspiratory Pressure PIP 14cmH20 (1cmH，0=0.098kPa)， Positive End Expiratory Pressure PEEP 5 cm H，O， Respiratory frequency (Respiratory Rate RR) 35 times/min， inhaled oxygen concentration (Fraction of Inspired Oxygen FiO，) 30%， Inspiratory time (Inspiratory time Ti) 0.35 S. Blood sugar and blood pressure were normal on admission. No pathogenic bacteria grow in sputum culture. Afterwards， the ventilator parameters were gradually lowered. On the third day of admission， the ventilator parameters were： PIP 12 cm|删除段之间换行|H0， PEEP 4 cm HO， RR 30 times/min， FiO， 23%， Ti 0.35 S. The gestational age was corrected at 26+1 weeks (2 weeks after birth) and mechanical ventilation was stopped. Because ofapnea， a noninvasive ventilator was given bi-level positive pressure ventilation. Corrected the gestational age of 28+3 weeks and stopped the non-invasive ventilator， changed to nasal cannula oxygen inhalation， corrected the gestational age of 29 weeks， changed to incubate oxygen. Correct gestational age and stop oxygen at 31 weeks. After admission， he was given penicillin combined with ceftizoxime for anti-infective treatment， penicillin for 1 week， and ceftizoxime for 10 days. Pulmonary infection occurred at 36 weeks of gestational age was corrected， cefoperazone and sulbactam anti-infective treatment was given for 1 week and the drug was stopped after recovery. Correct gestational age at 37 weeks and start kangaroo care. After birth， he was given umbilical vein catheterization for 14 days， and then PICC catheterization was given for 2 times， which was maintained until drug withdrawal. After 2 weeks of admission， the rat nerve growth factor was used to nourish the nerves. After the condition was stabilized， the premature infants were treated with massage and music. On the second day of admission， caffeine citrate was given to treat apnea， and the maintenance dose was 10 mg/kg until the gestational age was corrected 36 weeks. After birth， give vitamin K and sulfacetamide to prevent bleeding for 3 days， keep quiet， avoid sound and light stimulation， reduce movement， and maintain internal environment stability. Head ultrasound was monitored once a week， and there was no abnormality. Cardiac color Doppler ultrasound examination was performed 2 weeks after birth： Atrial level and left-to-right shunt were recorded， aortic level and small left-to-right shunt were recorded， and the shunt beam width was about1 mm to 2 mm， indicating patent foramen ovale and patent ductus arteriosus. The child had no hemodynamic changes， and the arterial catheter was not given specialtreatment. Correction of gestationalage at 27 weeks and re-examination of cardiac color Doppler ultrasound showed that the foramen ovale was patent and the arterial duct was closed. Reexamination of cardiac color Doppler ultrasound every two weeks afterwards showed that the foramen ovale was patent. After admission， he began to actively support parenteral and parenteral nutrition， monitor height and head circumference every week， and monitor weight gain trends every day. Nasal feeding started on the4th day after birth， micro-feeding， deep hydrolyzed milk powder，and non-nutritive sucking. Each time the stomach tube was fed 1 ml， once every 3 h， and then every 3 to 5 days with 1 ml each time， the feeding was well tolerated， and the gestational age was corrected 26+2 weeks and the breast milk nasal feeding was started. Correct the gestational age of 28+4 weeks and start partial oral feeding. After correcting the gestational age at 32 weeks， all oral breast milk was fed 13 ml/time， weighing 1300 g， and breast milk fortifier was added. Amino acids were administered intravenously within 24 h after birth to prevent negative nitrogen balance， fat emulsion was added 24 h later， and parenteral nutrition was used to supplement energy and various nutrients. Three weeks after birth， the blood routine examination revealed anemia， and erythropoietin was added， oral iron was used to prevent anemia， and a blood transfusion was given. Corrected the gestational age from 32+4 weeks， check the ophthalmology fundus every 2 weeks， and continue to return to the ophthalmology clinic after discharge. No abnormalities were found. Corrected for 41weeks of gestational age， the head MRI showed no abnormalities. The patient was hospitalized for 128 days. At discharge， his length was50 cm， his head circumference was 34 cm， and his weight was 3210g. The Neonatal Behavioral Neurological Assessment (NBNA) score删除1换行was normal. Six months after birth (corrected age of 2 months)， the length is 58 cm， the head circumference is 38 cm， the weight is 4900g the NBNA score is normal，and the hearing screening and brainstem auditory evoked potential are normal.\n\n【8】Discussion\n\n【9】EPI less than 28 weeks has a high mortality rate， mainly due to perinatal asphyxia， intracranial hemorrhage， congenital malformations， hyaline membrane disease， pulmonary hemorrhage， persistent pulmonary hypertension， and various infections. In recent years， there have been more and more reports on the successful treatment of preterm infants with gestational age less than 28 weeks. There have been reports of survival at the minimum gestational age of 21 weeks 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. The survival rate of EPI at 23 weeks and 24 weeks in European and American countries is 44.4% and 69.2%通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. There is still a big gap between my country and foreign countries.\n\n【10】Our department successfully treated a case of 25+3 EPI in2016， and the follow-up developed well. The patient who has been successfully treated is one of the youngest premature babies in the region. The experience is summarized as follows：\n\n【11】Body temperature management\n\n【12】Close cooperation with obstetrics and pediatrics medical staff， the temperature of the delivery room is 24 to 28 degrees， the radiant table is preheated， the umbilical cord ligation is delayed for 1 min after the baby is born， and then placed on the radiant table to keep warm， the child has weak breathing， provide rescue treatment such as tracheal intubation and intra tracheal application of pulmonary surfactant， which is the first step for the successful treatment of children. After entering the neonatology department，live in an advanced incubator， maintain a constant temperature and humidity， and a humidity of90% to avoid excessive weight loss， reduce insignificant water loss， and restore birth weight 10 days after birth 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>.\n\n【13】Respiratory management\n\n【14】Respiratory distress syndrome： The child's prenatal mother gave a course of adrenocortical hormone treatment to promote lung maturity. Prenatal application of adrenocortical hormone not only promotes lung maturity， but also accelerates the production of alveolar surfactant and reduces premature birth the incidence and severity of hyaline membrane disease in children 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. After birth， he was weak in spontaneous breathing and breathing like a wheeze. He was given tracheal intubation and preventive pulmonary surfactant treatment immediately. At the same time， the T combined resuscitator is used to assist breathing， which ensures that a certain end-expiratory pressure is maintained and prevents the open alveoli from collapsing again. After being transferred to the neonatology department， he was given mechanical ventilation and adopted a protective ventilation strategy 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. The child’s breathing was assessed in time， and mechanical ventilation was stopped 2 weeks after birth and changed to non-invasive ventilation 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>.\n\n【15】Apnea： The chance of apnea in ultra-premature infants is very high. Caffeine citrate treatment is started on the second day after birth， which shortens the time of mechanical ventilation，reduces the number of apneas， and effectively protects brain cells 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>.\n\n【16】Preventionofbronchopulmonarydysplasia： Bronchopulmonary dysplasia is a major cause of death from EPI. We mainly evaluate breathing in time， adopt permissive hypercapnia strategies， constant volume mode， and minimize PIP and tidal air. In order to avoid the删除1换行occurrence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia BPD)， early mechanical ventilation was stopped and changed to non-invasive ventilation. Oxygen was completely stopped at 31 weeks of gestational age 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>.\n\n【17】Nutritional support\n\n【18】Early micro-feeding： The child will start nasal micro-feeding 48h after birth， starting from 1 ml each time， once every 3 h， adding milk once every 2 to 3 days， adding 1 ml each time during the feeding process， there was no feeding intolerance such as gastric retention， vomiting，and abdominal distension. Early micro-feeding contributes to the integrity of the gastrointestinal tissue structure， improves the secretion and activity of digestive enzymes， and promotes the development and maturity of gastrointestinal motor function 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>.\n\n【19】Early breastfeeding： Premature babies choose breastfeeding first通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>， and inform mothers and family members of the importance of breastfeeding. The mother is very cooperative and insists on delivering breast milk until discharged from the hospital. When breastfeeding volume reaches 80 ml/kg.d， add breast milk fortifier， start with half fortification， and give full fortification after 3 days. During the hospitalization of the child， vomiting， abdominal distension， gastro esophageal reflux， and necrotizing enterocolitis did not occur.Mother feeding can reduce the incidence of nosocomial infections， reduce the number of days， and reduce the cost of children with children 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>.\n\n【20】Parenteral nutrition： 24 h after birth， internal and parenteral nutrition is given amino acids via the umbilical vein to provide sufficient energy， reduce catabolism and prevent negative nitrogen balance. After 24 h， add fat milk， vitamins， trace elements and other intravenous nutrition to ensure the supply of liquid and calorie 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>. Monitor the baby’s weight， length， and head circumference. The growth process is smooth 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>， and all indicators are above the 10h percentile when discharged from the hospital.\n\n【21】Infection prevention and treatment： Prevention is the first， strict implementation of aseptic operation technical specifications， attention to hand hygiene， centralized operation，dedicated operation and care， prevention of cross-infection， rational use of antibiotics， and active control of infection.\n\n【22】Prevention of brain injury in premature infants： Brain injury is an important factor affecting the prognosis of the nervous system of EPI. How to reduce and avoid brain damage is a problem that everyone faces. After birth， the patient should minimize movement and irritation， and regularly perform bedside cranial ultrasound monitoring. Hemostatic drugs and a course of neurotrophic therapy were used prophylactically for 3 days after birth. Pay attention to maintaining vital signs and internal environment stability. After the condition is stable， give music therapy and touch premature infants， pay attention to nutritional support， and ensure the needs of brain development 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>. Give kangaroo nursing and family participatory nursing， and teaches parents the methods and skills of nursing premature babies 通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u>. After active intervention， the NBNA score was normal after correction for age 2 months， and the hearing screening and brainstem auditory evoked potential were normal.\n\n【23】Prevention of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP)： Reasonable use of oxygen， the inhaled oxygen concentration is less than 30%， shorten the time of oxygen use as much as possible， and correct the gestational age of 31 weeks and have stopped oxygen. Corrected the gestational age from 32+4 weeks and the fundus were checked every 2weeks. After discharge， the ophthalmology clinic continued to follow删除1换行up，and there was no abnormality in the monitoring of the retina 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>.\n\n【24】Other aspects： Maintainfluiddbalance， prevent excessive fluid from causing arterial ducts to open， maintain blood sugar stability， phototherapy to reduce jaundice and prevent bilirubin encephalopathy， erythropoietin and iron agents prevent anemia in premature infants， research suggests that erythropoietin has brain protection 通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>. At present， the development of vision， hearing， intelligence， and motor functions are normal， and there is no abnormality in head MRI.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

Vedolizumab， a gut-selective monoclonal antibody to the a437 of integrin， has been used in such patients， but data on its efficacy are limited. Our case suggests the efficacy and safety of vedolizumab as induction therapy in CARP patient without a previous experience with anti-TNF agents. Larger studies with a higher number of patients are required to confirm these findings.\n\n【2】Keywords： Vedolizumab； Chronic antibiotic-refractory puchitits； Ulcerative Colitis\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Ulcerative Colitis (UC) is a chronic disease ofthe colon and rectum. Primarytreatment is medical therapy. Restorative total proctocolectomy with Ileal Pouch-Anal Anastomosis (IPAA) is one of the surgical modalities used to manage patients with refractory UC or develop severe complications such as colonic perforation， hemorrhage， or toxic megacolon. The ileal pouch serves as an internal reservoir of feces in the absence of rectum. Many patients develop long-term complication so called pouchitis with an estimated incidence ranging from 46% to 82%， which includes a range of symptom severity such as abdominal cramping， pelvic pressure， and increased stool frequency with urgency， to more debilitating symptoms including abdominal pain， rectal bleeding， disorder defecation and incontinence 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Pouchitis is a nonspecific inflammation in the Ileoanal Pouch Anastomosis (IPAA). The pathophysiology of pouchitis remains poorlyunderstood. Gut microbiota have an important role in fact increased bacterial levels and ileal reservoir dysbiosis appear to be major contributors 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. Pouchitis may be difficult to treat as well as have a negative impact on the quality of life in these patients. Since dysbiosis is a key factor for pouchitis development， there is evidence for a therapeutic role of probiotics 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u> (i.e.， VSL#3 was able to prevent a relapse during a follow-up period of 9 months)通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u> and antibiotics. Antibiotics therapy's， particularly ciprofloxacin and metronidazole， are the mainstay of treatment for acute pouchitis after having excluded other diagnoses (infections， Crohn’s disease of the pouch， ischemia and irritable pouch) 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. However， about 10% to 15% of patients with acute pouchitis do not respond to these treatments and develop chronic pouchitis， which is defined by symptoms persisting for more than 4 weeks. These patients often require prolonged courses of antibiotics combinates with steroid therapy (budesonide) 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>， immunomodulators (azathioprine) 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>， and mesalamines with varying efficacy. CARP is diagnosis when patients do not respond to a 2-week course of ciprofloxacin， metronidazole， or rifaximin for pouchitis 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>. CARP is one of the most common causes of pouch failure.\n\n【5】Patient information\n\n【6】In our patient， a 52-year-old Caucasian male， restorative proctocolectomy had become necessary 28 years ago in severe refractory ulcerative colitis. Ileoanal Pouch Anastomosis (IPAA) was performed in 1999. Pouchitis was first diagnosed in 2020.\n\n【7】Timeline\n\n【8】In August 2021， he developed a chronic diarrhea with up to 30 to 40 liquid (including 6 nightly) stools， accompanied with blood and mucus， associated with diffuse abdominal pain and bloating affecting his quality of life.\n\n【9】Diagnostic assessment\n\n【10】Laboratory work-up revealed Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR)， C-Reactive Protein(CRP) and stool calprotectin with no abnormalities. He denied sudden weight gain or weight loss. Endoscopy showed inflammation， ulcerations， edema and mucous exudates in the pouch and in the删除1换行afferent ileal limb. In particular，linear ulcerations were present in the pouch， circular ulcerations in the ileal mucosa. Histology confirmed the active phase of ileal ulcerative chronic inflammation combined with signs of regeneration (fibrosis).\n\n【11】Therapeutic intervention\n\n【12】He started probiotic therapy， with VSL#3， but without successful clinical effects. Then he was prescribed metronidazole，from 250 mgto500 mg orally two times daily. After many therapeutic interventions with metronidazole， the patient was unable to tolerate it. He was prescribed ciprofloxacin 500 mg orally two times daily， but without successful clinical effects. In the end he was prescribed ECN Nissle capsule and dipropionate Beclomethasone， from 5 mg to 10 mg orally one time daily， which developed corticosteroid resistant.\n\n【13】Therefore， this severe flare of pouchitis was refractory to metronidazole， Ciprofloxacin，VSL#3， ECN NissleeCapsule， dipropionate beclomethasone and mesalamine. Stool studies for clostridium difficile， viruses， and bacteria were negative. Endoscopy and Histology showed no improvement. For this reason， the patient was switched to anti-integrin therapy and showed sustained clinical and endoscopic response to Vedolizumab 300 mg i.v. at weeks 0， 2， 6， and every 8 weeks.\n\n【14】Follow up and outcomes\n\n【15】After four doses， pouch and ileal ulcerations had healed completely and edema and mucous exudates were no longer present. C-Reactive Protein and stool calprotectin were also negative. Clinically， the patient is now in good condition，reports about 15 daily stools without any abdominal discomfort.\n\n【16】Discussion\n\n【17】Biological therapy such as anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)(infliximab， adalimumab) agents 通用删除6(英):<u>[9，10]</u>，vedolizumab or ustekinumab are some ofthe options used to treat chronic pouchitis. Vedolizumab is a monoclonal antibody that selectively blocks gut lymphocyte trafficking by interacting with a4B7 heterodimer 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>. The key to understanding the potential efficacy of vedolizumab is based on the fact that dysbiosis contributes to the attraction of leukocytes that will undergo adhesion by the integrin-MAdCAM interaction 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>. However， the effect of vedolizumab treatment on Chronic Antibiotic Refractory Pouchitis (CARP) is very limited. The largest study was a retrospective multicenter cohort study at five academic centers in the United States including 83 IPAA patients with endoscopically confirmed inflammation of the pouch. Some 87% of patients were previously treated with antibiotics for pouchitis， and 51% previously were treated with anti-TNFs for pouchitis. After at least 3 months follow-up， 71% of patients exhibited a clinical response， and 19.3%achieved clinical remission； 54% had endoscopic improvement while 17.6% achieved endoscopic healing. Patients who developed pouchitis symptoms within 1 year postoperatively were found to be less likely to respond to VDZ 通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u>. In a recent review Ribaldone DG reported that vedolizumab has significant efficacy in chronic refractory or antibiotic-dependent pouchitis， also in patients who failed to respond to other treatments including those with anti-TNF agents 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>. In literature， only twenty-one patients had a biological treatment with vedolizumab for CARP without a previous experience with anti-TNF agents 通用删除6(英):<u>[14-17]</u>. Our case is important because it evaluates the efficacy of vedolizumab as a first-choice biological treatment in CARP and represents the first case report which evaluates a histological improvement thanks to the effectiveness of删除1换行vedolizumab in the treatment of chronic refractory pouchitis. In our single patient refractory to multiple therapies， we found good clinical and endoscopic response encouraging further investigations on clinical response， mucosal healing and histological improvement. In a recent meta-analysis Saurabh Chandan demonstrated that clinical improvement in symptoms was reported by 48.7% patients treated with VDZ， clinical remission was achieved by 45.4% patients treated with VDA and finally， endoscopic improvement and remission was seen in 61.2% patients treated with VDZ. Biologic therapy is safe and effective short-term as well as long-term in the treatment of CARP通用删除6(英):<u>[19，20]</u>.\n\n【18】Conclusion\n\n【19】Vedolizumab showed consistent treatment benefits across clinical， endoscopic and histological endpoint， together with safety consistent. Vedolizumab intravenous is effective in chronic refractory or antibiotic-dependent pouchitis so that can be value its use like first line in the biological therapy can be evaluated as confirmed by a recent study where demonstrates that T cell movementing mechanisms are important and vedolizumab antagonism in pouchitis has functional effects. A phase- 4 study aiming to evaluate the efficacy and safety of vedolizumab in the treatment of chronic pouchitis (EARNEST) has just been completed confirms these findings.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

On the chest CTalarge volume of fatty tissue and bowel was seen in the anterior mediastinum. There was no history of trauma. An initial diagnosis of Larrey hernia was made and the patient was operated on. Laparotomy revealed a large defect in the tendinous centre of the diaphragm and pericardium with intrapericardial displacement of the omentum and the transverse colon. The viscera were reduced into the abdominal cavity and the defect was closed using a Teflon patch. The patient was questioned again about any trauma in the past and he remembered a car accident20 years earlier. In the early postoperative course transient atrial fibrillation occurred and next pleural and pericardial effusion was diagnosed， requiring thoracentesis and pericardiocentesis Further course was uneventful and the patient was discharged home. Although this condition is rare， delayed diagnosis of diaphragmatic and pericardial rupture should be taken into consideration in patients with epigastric symptoms， who sustained torso trauma in the past.\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Traumatic Intrapericardial Diaphragmatic Hernia (TIPDH) is a rare consequence of blunt torso trauma. Most such injuries are diagnosed in the acute period because of symptoms associated with organ displacement or with concomitant injuries. Rarely， the injury is missed in the immediate period and the diagnosis may be delayed for months or years.\n\n【4】Case Presentation\n\n【5】A sixty-nine-year old male presented with epigastric discomfort and pain. Medical history was irrelevant. A physical examination did not show any evident pathology. At the chest X-ray， widening of the lower mediastinum was present， with anterior mediastinal mass seen on the lateral view . Contrast-enhanced CT of the chest and abdomen revealed large volume of fatty tissue and bowel in the anterior mediastinum .\n\n【6】An initial diagnosis of Larrey hernia was made and the patient was scheduled for surgery. Transverse laparotomy ~3 cm below the xiphoid process was made. Transverse colon and almost the whole omentum were displaced upwards and through the large defect in the diaphragm. After reduction of the viscera into the peritoneal cavity  the defect was exposed， involving the central tendon of the diaphragm and pericardium and penetrating to the pericardial sac .\n\n【7】Because of the size ofthe defect primary repair was not attempted and a Teflon patch was used to close it. Several Ethibond No 2 sutures were put around the defect， placed through the diaphragm and pericardium (and anteriorly through the costal arches). The Teflon patch was tailored to the size of the defect and the parachuting'technique was used to place it in the proper position .\n\n【8】The abdomen was closed without any drains. The patient was questioned again aboutanytrauma in the past and he remembered a car accident 20 years ago with no serious injuries diagnosed at that time. On the 2nd day after surgery atrial fibrillation occurred with symptomatic hypotonia， and was successfully treated pharmacologically. On the 7th postoperative day， a chest X-ray was performed\n\n【9】Discussion\n\ndue to fever and revealed fluid accumulation in the left pleural cavity. Thoracentesis was performed with 300 mL serous fluid removed. On the next day the follow-up chest X-ray showed widening of the heart silhouette and ultrasound examination confirmed pericardial fluid. Under the ultrasound guidance， cannula was inserted into the pericardial sac and 500 mL of bloody-stained fluid was removed. During the next 2 days fever subsided，50 ml serous fluid was drained from the pericardium and the cannula was removed. On the 13h postoperative day right-sided thoracentesis was performed and 300mL of serous fluid was removed. Further course was uneventful and the patient was discharged home on the 14 day after surgery. During|删除段之间换行|Diaphragmatic rupture associated with pericardial.rupture resulting from the blunt torso trauma， referred to as TIPDH is a rare condition. One hundred well documented cases were described in the literature， the first two as early as in 1910 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Avast majority of these injuries are diagnosed in the acute period after trauma. On rare occasions this type of injury is missed and the diagnosis is not made until symptoms caused by displacement of viscera occur. To our best knowledge， only 45 cases of delayed presentation of TIPDH were described so far， with the delay ranging from 23 to 23 years 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. We describe a patient who presented with epigastric pain and discomfort20 vears after torso trauma sustained in a motor vehicle accident.\n\n【11】The reason for missing the diagnosis in the acute period may be the small size of the rupture， with no organ displacement. Surgeons focus their activity on clinical priorities， which may include different types of intra-abdominal injuries， requiring immediate repair. Also， its location deep in the upper part of the peritoneal cavity may contribute to missing it， even if laparotomy is performed. Because of constant contractions of the diaphragm a small-size rupture tends to enlarge gradually over a long time. This， together with the pressure gradient between the abdominal cavity and the chest， causes slowly progressing displacement of viscera.\n\n【12】The first review including 17 cases of TIPDH was published by Larrieu et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>， in 1980 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>， followed by 58 cases reviewed in 1986by Van Lohenhout at al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>， and 82 cases described in 2001 by Reina et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. The literature search has shown 18 more cases described in detail since then 通用删除6(英):<u>[2，5-19]</u>.Traumatic intrapericardial diaphragmatic hernias constitute a heterogenic group， depending on the type and location of rupture and the route of visceral displacement. They can be categorized in 4 main types .\n\n【13】Reportedly， the most often displaced organs are colon， stomach and omentum 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>， which was also seen in our patient. What was particularly rare in our patient is the very long time since the initial trauma to the presentation， being as long as 20 years， the second longest interval published to date. Despite a large volume of displaced删除1换行omentum and colon， the patient’s symptoms were relatively mild， probably due to slowly increasing volume of displaced viscera， over a very long period of time. The patient did not report any complaints that might be associated with the bowel obstruction. It is likely， that the empty space inside the enlarged pericardial sac， resulting from reduction of the bowel and omentum into the abdominal cavity contributed to the accumulation ofexudate in the postoperativecourse. Although this condition is rare， delayed diagnosis of diaphragmatic and pericardial rupture should be taken into consideration in patients with epigastric symptoms， who sustained torso trauma in the past.\n\n【14】Funding Statement\n\n【15】This paper was financially supported by statutory grant of Jagiellonian University.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

It was found on admission that the patient had had psoriasis vulgaris； the patient had no therapy for six years and he had no regular checkups. Due to progression and high CT scan severity score and elevated serum IL-6， the decision was made to administer the patient tocilizumab. Upon administration， psoriatic lesions were in retreat. Even though there are some reports describing tocilizumab induced psoriasis， some studies have demonstrated a high level of IL-6 in psoriatic plaques. Therefore， therapies that disrupt IL-6 signaling could be a treatment option for psoriasis.\n\n【2】Case Presentation\n\n【3】A 38-year-old male patient was admitted to our hospital with bilateral pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. On admission， the patient’s history showed that he had had psoriasis vulgaris for eight years. At the time of disease onset， the patient went to a dermatologist where he was prescribed methotrexate. As the patient reported， he was in remission while using this drug. However， six years ago， he stopped taking the therapy and stopped going to regular checkups. With no therapy， the disease was active again. On admission， the physical examination revealed well-demarcated， non-coherent， silvery plaques overlying a glossy homogeneous erythema on extremities and trunk.\n\n【4】The patient also reported fever， fatigue and cough a few days before the admission. He was prescribed vitamins and antipyretic by his general practitioner， but he was not feeling better. On the day of the admission， he was examined in our hospital and the X-ray imaging revealed bilateral pneumonia. Inflammation markers were elevated (CRP 113 mg/L) and nasopharyngeal swab was taken for a PCR analysis to a SARS-CoV-2. As a part of the regular procedure for physical examination， oximetry was performed， and the patient's peripheral oxygen saturation was about 95%， so he was given oxygen support. During the hospital stay， he was prescribed therapy as per COVID-19 guidelines and it included intravenous antibiotics， probiotics， vitamins and low molecular weight heparin. The following morning， during the regular visiting round， it was observed that the patient wasn’t clinically and subjectively better， so it was decided to perform a CT scan of thorax. This diagnostic procedure confirmed bilateral interstitial pneumonia in progression with a CT severity score 17 out of 25. This score indicated that the pneumonia was severe and IL-6 blood analysis was done. Serum IL-6 was elevated (50.84 pg/mL)， so our anesthesiologist coordinator was consulted about the next step. The decision was made to administer tocilizumab i.v.(in recommended dose 8 mg/kg). Two days after the administration oftocilizumab， the patient was clinically and subjectively better， inflammation markers in laboratory analysis showed a drop while the psoriatic lesions were in retreat . The ongoing hospital stay was without complications and the patient's peripheral oxygen saturation was about 98% without oxygen support. Ten days later， the patient was discharged from the hospital. Written informed consent for this paper and clinical images was obtained from the above-mentioned patient.\n\n【5】Discussion\n\nBiologics approved for psoriasis by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) includes： Etanercept， infliximab and adalimumab (all targeting TNF-a)， ustekinumab (targeting IL-12/IL-23 p40)， secukinumab， ixekizumab (targeting IL- 17A) and brodalumab (targeting IL-17A receptor) 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>.

Trastuzumab based therapy has demonstrated to reduce recurrence rates， however CNS metastasis remains a sanctuary site for metastasis. Several clinical trials have evaluated the effectiveness of systemic therapies for brain metastasis， however patients with leptomeningeal disease were not included in such trials1，2.\n\n【22】To our knowledge， this is the first reported case of a HER2positive breast cancer with brain and leptomeningeal involvement that achieved a complete response after treatment with pertuzumab plus trastuzumab and docetaxel and maintained this response for 34months.\n\n【23】The CLEOPATRA trial validated the use of pertuzumab in combination with trastuzumab and docetaxel for the first line treatment of HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer； however CNS metastasis was an exclusion criterion 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. One phase II clinical trial evaluated CNS response in 25 patients treated with pertuzumab plus trastuzumab. Although CNS Overall Response Rate (ORR) was 12%， accounting for four partial responses， no patient achieved a total response 4.\n\n【24】To date， the only phase III trial that proved increased overall survival in patients with untreated CNS involvement is the HER2CLIMB trial 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. This trial randomized 291 patients with untreatedbrain metastases excludingleptomeningealdisease to receive tucatinib plus capecitabine plus trastuzumab versus capecitabine plus trastuzumab. Amongst all patients with brain metastasis， the tucatinib arm experienced improved overall survival(18 vs. 12 months， HR=0.58， 95% CI 0.40-0.85) 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u> and improved overall response rate (47% vs. 20%，p=0.03)通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. Fourpatients achieved a complete response- three in the trial and one in the control group.\n\n【25】Other clinical trials and clinical reports have documented the effectiveness of other systemic therapies including trastuzumab-emtansine 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>，lapatinib plus capecitabine 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u> and fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>. However， patients with leptomeningeal disease wer excluded from such trials.\n\n【26】There are some publications of case reports of patients with leptomeningeal disease responding to systemic anticancer therapies for HER2 positive breast cancer. For instance， a published case of a patient treated with intrathecal trastuzumab maintained a complete response for at least 31 months 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>. Nevertheless， this is the first se ever reported of a complete leptomeningeal response following treatment with trastuzumab pertuzumab and taxanes.\n\n【27】In spite that this is a unique case for theliterature， we acknowledge that we lack an imaging study after WBRT and before systemic therapy. Therefore， although we believe that this patient responded to the combination of pertuzumab plus pertuzumab plus docetaxel， WBRT may have contributed in some degree to the achievement of this complete response.\n\n【28】Conclusion\n\n【29】This case constitutes the first report of a leptomeningeal and brain complete response following treatment with pertuzumab plus trastuzumab and paclitaxel.

With almost half of North American population having allergies to one or more common environmental antigens， it is imperative for us to look at the most upstream level involved in this reaction pathway. Though allergic reactions are rarely life-threatening it is a common issue in today's society that had led to much distress and loss of time.\n\n【11】To truly understand the mechanisms of an allergic reaction， we will try to analyze the earliest beginning of a reaction by looking at the impact of genetics and the cytokines involved in allergic reaction. While the most classical and common pathway involving IL-4 has been studied， we will be looking at a newer， less explored pathway involving IL-33 which has been very significant in allergic reactions and can be used as a future target for therapy.\n\n【12】IL-33 and ST-2\n\n【13】There are a group of damage-associated molecules released by tissue epithelial cells in response to external stimuli. These molecules are known as “alarmins.” One of the main alarmins being studied has been Interleukin-33 (IL-33). Originating from the IL-1 family of cytokines， IL-33 has been recently observed to be expressed in many allergy responsive cells such as epidermal， smooth muscle and epithelial cells. As we analyze allergies and the human response， it is important to appreciate this on an upstream level to comprehend all the signaling pathways and use this to evolve our knowledge base to create better treatments in the future 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>.\n\n【14】IL-33 plays a vital part in allergic response through various pathways and one of the initial stages involve binding to a membrane-bound receptor called Suppression of Tumorigenecity 2 (ST-2 receptor) and an (IL 1-R co-receptor) IL-1Receptor accessory protein via a heterodimeric receptor complex. This leads to activation of the primary signal MyD88 cascade pathway via homotypic protein-protein reactions. Other pathways involved include an increase in IL-5 cytokines that are IL-4 independent producing T-cells. Th2 cells， in general， respond via two pathways： the classic pathway involves IL-4， STAT (signal transducers and activators of transcription proteins) and GATA3 (DNA sequence“GATA\"binding transcription factors) cascades while the non-classical pathway induces IL-5 production. This is polarized by IL-33 via the ST2 receptor and leads to a stronger allergic response.\n\n【15】The IL-5 cytokine also increases production of NF-kB (nuclear factor KB)， MAPKs (Mitogen Activated Protein Kinases) and OVA (Egg protein ovalbumin) that increase inflammation and activation of tissue-resident cells with ST-2. The IL-33/ST2 complex also increases TH2-inducing cytokines like Th17 that leads to cell-mediated airway inflammation via Mast Cells (MC).\n\n【16】The MyD88 pathway\n\n【17】The MyD88 signal cascade involves the MyD88 adaptor protein to increase production of several other proteins and cytokines including IRA K4 (Interleukin-1 receptor associated kinase 4)， TRAF6 (transcription factor 6)， IL-13 and IL-6. Increased IL-5 and induce goblet cell hyperplasia in respiratory epithelial cells 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. This in turn leads to heavier mucus production in respiratory epithelial cells and a stronger allergic response. These responses were highlighted by when they found administration of IL-33 failed to induce IL-5 and IL-13 secretion by MyD88 -/-T cells 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. They also found that IL-33 induces NF-kB p65 and the MAPK p38， JNK %(c-Jun N-terminal删除1换行kinases) and ERK Y (extracellular signal-regulated kinases). Though IL-33 was reported to be integral to mast cells and allergic responses， the role of ST2 has been controversial for Ag-specific asthma. They concluded in that the IL-33/ST2 signaling is more involved in acute allergic response than chronic allergies.\n\n【18】The processing and release of IL-33\n\n【19】As part of the IL-1 family， IL-33 does not possess signal peptide to release the proteins via endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi pathway. Hence， via external stimuli like allergens or injury， IL-33 is released by epithelial， endothelial， smooth cells and fibroblasts. The involvement of IL-33 in the development of allergic rhinitis induced by ragweed pollen challenge as IL-33 knock-out mice failed to induce ragweed pollen induced allergic reaction 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. They found that Type2 Innate Lymphoid Cells (ILC2) localized in mucosal tissues like lung and intestine， adipose tissue and lymphoid organs like spleen and lymphoid tissue were major targets of IL-33 due to their high expression of ST-2 receptors. Thesecells also produced high quantities of type 2 cytokines IL-5 and IL-13 which was previously discussed as part of the signal cascade involving IL-33/ST2/MyD88. The various functions played by IL-33 have resulted in theorizing IL-33 to be both a cytokine and an intracellular nuclear factor with transcriptional regulatory functions 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>.\n\n【20】The Novel Alarmin\n\n【21】IL-33 is considered a “novel alarmin\"due to its secretion upon necrosis or damage and released upon responseto antigen. It is notably increased in expression in asthmatic patients vs. normal patients. It has been reported to induce airway bronchoconstriction through mast cell activation in murine models and found IL-33 protein in the lungs of mice with OVA/alum-induced airway inflammation 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. This is due to the increased expression of tryptophan hydroxylase I by IL-33 that leads to serotonin synthesis and storage causing airway obstruction in asthma. It is also noted to be higher in patients with atopic dermatitis founded in epidermal keratinocytes. The high number of ILC2s in epidermal skin cells and lymph nodes release IL-5 leading to eosinophilic dermatitis. These are some of the many ways IL-33 is involved in various allergic reactions.\n\n【22】Future uses and novel therapy targeting IL-33\n\n【23】To create an effective future treatment， we have to appreciate the basic genetic component of IL-33 and understand the target region. IL-33 consists of an N-terminal helix-turned helix motif responsible for nuclear translocation and chromatin binding. It also has an IL-1like C-terminal domain， which is cleaved by a caspase to form a删除1换行mature 18kDa peptide from the original 30 kDa peptide. The deletion of the N-terminal domain containing the chromatin-binding motif has led to early lethality in mice by constitutive secretion of IL-33 in serum leading to multi-organ failure 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>.\n\n【24】One of the endogenous mechanisms that was studied was the recently reported IL-22 cytokine that originated from the IL-10， expressing REG3y from lung epithelial cells in mice that suppress IL-33 expression and accumulation of ILC2s in the lung. Another idea is to sequester ILL-33 in the nucleus of IL-33 producing cells. The parasite Heligmosomoides polygyrus releases a product named H. Polygyrus Alarmin Release Inhibitor (HpARI) that binds to IL-33via the N-terminus and tethers active IL-33 within necrotic cells 通用删除6(英):<u>[61</u>. Other approaches involve controlling the bioactivity of IL-33 as it can be rapidly inactivated by oxidation of four critical cysteine residues that result in extensive reconfiguration of the ST2 receptors.\n\n【25】All these novel therapy approaches require further testing and clinical trials but the fact remains that IL-33 is a key factor in allergic responses. Targeting the IL-33/ST2 pathway will be a critical component in the future treatment of allergic reactions and the more extensive our knowledge grows on the vital IL-33 genetic and secondary pathways， the better future therapy will be to treat and prevent patients with allergic reactions.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

Antifungal treatment and surgical debridement are the pillar of treatment. Gastrectomy should be performed as soon as possible if single anti-fungal treatment and surgical debridement are unavailing.\n\n【5】Introduction\n\n【6】Mucormycosis is a very rare and potentially fatal infection caused by fungi of the subphylum Mucoromycotina.

A total gastrectomy and esophagojejunostomy was performed， the specimen was sent for histological analysis  and the patient was referred to intensive care. The clinical and biological course was excellent.\n\n【17】A brain-face-chest-abdomen and pelvis computed tomography was performed， which did not show any other location of the disease.\n\n【18】Anatomopathological examination of the specimen confirmed the diagnosis of gastric mucormycosis .\n\n【19】Discussion\n\n【20】We reported d asuccessful surgical treatment foOrrgastric mucormycosis.

Different approaches of medical or surgical treatments are proposed in literature， ranging from the conservative management 通用删除6(英):<u>[4-6]</u>， local vasopressin injection followed by curettage or curettage and local methotrexate injection通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>， transvaginal Ultrasound (US)-guided selective reduction 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>， uterine artery embolization and hysteroscopic removal of both gestational products 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>， microwave ablation of the cervical pregnancy ring forceps 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>， as well as an ultrasound-guided intracervical Foley balloon placement and cerclage 通用删除6(英):<u>[11，12]</u>， complete cervical evacuation and expectant management 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>.

Her medical history删除1换行included two previous IVF attempts with autologous oocytes at another clinic. At that time her AMH was 0.7 ngml and both treatment cycles were unsuccessful. In her first IVF attempt using donor oocytes， three high quality blastocysts were created. They were transferred in two consecutive cycles and did not result in gestation. Another donor-oocyte cycle followed， in which she received two grade 1 fresh blastocysts. Ten days after transfer， B-HCG test of 355mUI revealed an early gestation. The first ultrasound 26 days post-transfer showed one intrauterine gestational sac and another in the cervix， with both embryos measuring Crown Rump Length (CRL) of 0.5 cm and with active heartbeat . The patient received extensive information and counseling on her condition. After different treatment possibilities were discussed， we decided for a US-guided aspiration of the cervical gestational sac to best preserve the intrauterine gestation. The procedure was performed in a local hospital， under general anesthesia， on day 28 after embryo transfer. The cervical gestational sac was punctured using a 17 G single lumen oocyte aspiration needle under US-guidance. The treatment approach was successful in aspirating the contents of gestational sac. The patient was discharged home after 24 h observation. The histopathological examination confirmed embryonic remains and products ofconception from the aspirate. There was minimal bleeding during and after the procedure. On the second post-operative day， the patient presented with painless vaginal bleeding and was readmitted to the hospital. Trophoblastic tissues of the cervical ectopic conceptus were gently removed using a curette， under ultrasound guidance. Histopathology analysis confirmed the presence of chorionic villi in the gestational tissues. An ultrasound performed four days after the curettage revealed a viable intrauterine gestation. Some residual trophoblast tissue could still be detected into the cervical canal. Serial obstetric US six days later revealed the persistence of a heterogeneous， hypervascular mass measuring 2.7 mm x2.0 mm in the cervical canal near the internal os， corresponding to remains of the cervical gestation chorionic villi. Two weeks after the curettage， the cervical heterogeneous mass persisted and the intrauterine gestation followed normal development. Fortnightly US surveillance revealed a shortened uterine cervix， at 20weeks gestation. A cervical pessary was inserted at 22 weeks gestation to avoid preterm delivery. The patient was prescribed absolute bed rest until 37 weeks gestation， when labor contractions started. The pessary was removed and the cesarean section was schedule for the next day. The patient delivered a healthy baby girl weighting 2960 g and 46 cm.\n\n【17】Discussion\n\n【18】The present case report describes the successful treatment of a CHG after IVF， using US-guided aspiration of the ectopic gestational sac， followed by curettage， pessary placement due to cervical shortening and absolute rest. The frequency of different forms of heterotopic gestations is much higher after IVF， than after natural conception 通用删除6(英):<u>[2，3]</u>. The clinical management of a CHG after IVF imposes specific challenges， considering that IVF pregnancies are highly desired and treatment for the termination of an ectopic gestation may also put in danger the viable intrauterine one.\n\n【19】To our best knowledge， this is the first description of a CHG detected at an early gestational age and treated with US-guided aspiration of gestational sac， cervical curettage and pessaryplacement. Although the curettage of the cervical canal was carefully performed， cervical shortening occurred and the placement of a pessary was Iiecessary to avoid preterm delivery.\n\n【20】The patient was 41 years of age and that was her first pregnancy， after four unsuccessful embryo transfers. The early detection of the extra uterine gestational sac at 6 weeks was paramount for the success in the CHG management， without pregnancy loss of the viable intrauterine gestation and fertility preservation. Majority ofthe CHGs are detected after vaginal bleeding， at more advanced gestational age. Thus， particularly after IVF cycles in which more than one embryo is transferred， the first US scan should include a careful evaluation ofthe cervical canal to exclude a heterotopic gestation at the cervix.\n\n【21】Different treatment options are described for the resolution of cervical heterotopic gestations. However， some of the treatments may result in undesired outcomes， such as infertility 通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u> and intrauterine gestation loss 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. Sonographically guided injection of various agents， into the ectopic gestational sac is effective， but it is also associated with persistent trophoblastic tissue 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>. US-guided aspiration of cervical conceptus results in immediate termination of the ectopic gestation and there is a minor risk to cause harm to the intrauterine pregnancy.\n\n【22】In conclusion， considering that there is no consensus on the best treatment for CHG， it is important to report the factors that contributed to the successful resolution of the present case. Early detection and US-guided aspiration performed by an experienced operator， careful follow up of the remaining embryonic tissues， monitoring of cervical canal along the gestation to avoid preterm delivery due to a possible shortening of the cervix after curettage and placement of cervical pessary to ensure a full-term gestation represent a safe and effective management of CHG， with fertility preservation and favorable live birth outcomes for IVF patients.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

Because of the lower risk of intraoperative complications， possibility of using regional anesthesia， reduced infective morbidity， lesser pain and early return to routine activities， vaginal hysterectomy should be performed in preference to abdominal hysterectomy where possible. It can often be safely performed in women with prior caesarean section， nulliparity and a bulky uterus， after a thorough patient assessment. Long term follow up data from various studies show a low incidence of vault prolapse. Where feasible， the vaginal route should be preferred for hysterectomy.\n\n【2】Methods： It was a retrospective study in which the case notes of 336 patients undergoing vaginal hysterectomy at a single center over a 5 year period were retrieved. The demographic profile， intraoperative and postoperative data and five year follow up details of these patients was evaluated.\n\n【3】Results： The average age of the patients was 57 years and the most common indication for surgery was uterovaginal prolapse (81.8%). The mean duration of surgery was 61.6 min and the average blood loss was 50.1 ml. Four patients (1.2%) had intraoperative complications. Six patients (3.3%) had grade 2 or more vaginal vault prolapse at 5 year follow up.\n\n【4】Conclusion： Vaginal hysterectomy is safe and cost effective， and should be the approach of choice for hysterectomy whenever feasible in view of its advantages and lower complication rates. It can often be safely performed even in the presence of generally accepted contraindications.\n\n【5】Keywords： Vaginal Hysterectomy； Prolapse； Complications； Contraindications\n\n【6】Introduction\n\n【7】通用间距删除-1:<u>Citation：</u>\n\n【8】Vaginal hysterectomy is a procedure which follows all the parameters of minimally invasive surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. It has beenlong-practiced and has even been mentioned in the descriptions of Berengario de Carpi 通用删除7(英):<u>(1470-1550)</u> 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. When choosing the route and method of hysterectomy， safety and cost effectiveness must be kept in consideration 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. Because of the lower risk of intraoperative visceral injury， possibility of using regional anesthesia， reduced infective morbidity， lesser pain and earlier return to normal activities， vaginal hysterectomy should be performed in preference to abdominal hysterectomy where possible 通用删除6(英):<u>[3，4]</u>. Where this is not possible，laparoscopic hysterectomy may avoid the need for an abdominal hysterectomy. However， the length of the surgery increases as the extent ofthe surgery performed laparoscopically increases and there is a greater risk of substantial bleeding and damage to the urinary bladder and ureters when compared to vaginal hysterectomy 通用删除6(英):<u>[5，6]</u>.No benefits were found for laparoscopic versus vaginal hysterectomy in a few studies 通用删除6(英):<u>[5，6]</u>.\n\n【9】While the most common indication for a vaginal hysterectomy is pelvic organ prolapse， its use is not limited to urogynecology and pelvic floor reconstructive surgery. Other indications include uterine fibroids， adenomyosis， abnormal uterine bleeding， endometrial hyperplasia or early endometrial malignancy and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 通用删除6(英):<u>[7，8]</u>.\n\n【10】Studies have concluded that a large uterus (>14 weeks size)， nulliparity， previous caesarean delivery， pelvic laparotomy or need for oophorectomy rarely constitute contraindications to vaginal hysterectomy 通用删除6(英):<u>[8-13]</u>. Doucette et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u> have reported that if the vagina can allow access to divide the uterosacral and cardinal ligaments，uterine mobility is usually increased enough to allow vaginal hysterectomy，even in cases where there is minimal uterine descent 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>. When the uterus is删除1换行enlarged， vaginal hysterectomy often can be accomplished safely by using uterine size reduction techniques such as wedge morcellation， uterine bisection and intramyometrial coring 通用删除6(英):<u>[12，14]</u>. In patients with large uterine fibroids vaginal hysterectomy can be attempted if the surgeon is familiar with uterine morcellation， resources to convert to an abdominal route expeditiously are available， the size of the pelvis allows adequate exposure and the contour of the fibroid allows some degree of uterine descent 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>. In a study by Davies et al， the proportion of vaginal hysterectomies performed can be increased by a factor of 6 if the criteria for vaginal hysterectomy is extended to patients without clinically significant prolapse 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>.\n\n【11】The vaginal axis is better maintained after a vaginalorlaparoscopic hysterectomy than after an abdominal hysterectomy 通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>. Completing a procedure vaginally could substantially decrease the total operative cost， in part because of its low associated morbidity rates 通用删除6(英):<u>[17-19]</u>. It can be successfully adopted as a same-day discharge procedure 通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u>.\n\n【12】Materials and Methods\n\n【13】We conducted a retrospective， descriptive， non-comparative study in women undergoing vaginal hysterectomy for various indications between January 15， 2007 to December 315， 2011 at KK Women's and Children’s Hospital， Singapore. Inclusion criteria were medical indication for vaginal hysterectomy like pelvic organ prolapse， uterine fibroid， abnormal uterine bleeding and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. Patients with concomitant vaginal mesh insertion or sacrospinous ligament fixation were excluded from the study. All surgeries were performed by the same surgical team. The Centralized Institutional Review Board (CIRB) approval was taken before the commencement of the study.\n\n【14】The medical records of these patients were retrieved and their demographic data was analyzed. The preoperative fin dings including the degree ofprolapse， as assessed by the Baden-Walker classification system were noted. The intra-operative details like concomitant surgeries， type of anesthesia， and mean duration of surgery， mean blood loss， intra-operative complications and weight of the uterus were analyzed. Postoperative complications， length of hospital stay， duration of catheterization， histology report of the uterus， readmission rate and reason for readmission were noted.\n\n【15】Patients were followed up post operatively in the urogynecology clinic at 3 days after discharge and then at 1 month， 6 months， 1，2，3，4and 5 years postoperatively. At all these visits， patients were assessed for symptoms of vaginal vault prolapse， urinary incontinence， voiding difficulty or dyspareunia and a clinical examination was done.\n\n【16】The data was analyzed using the SPSS software with frequency， mean and standard deviation used for quantitative variables. Chi square test was used for analyses in patients with concomitant procedures who had longer duration of surgery， more blood loss， longer duration of hospital stay and greater re-catheterization rates. The difference was considered significant at a P value equal to or less than 0.05.\n\n【17】Results\n\n【18】A total of 1，024 women underwent vaginal hysterectomy for various indications between January 15，2007 and December 315，2011. Of these， 774 case notes could be retrieved. Four hundred and thirty eight patients underwent concomitant vaginal mesh placement or sacrospinous ligament fixation and were excluded from the study. Three hundred and thirty six patients were included in the study. The删除1换行mean age of the patients was 57 years with the youngest patient being35 years old and the oldest aged 86 years. The mean parity was 2.9. Ninety-six percent of them had previous vaginal deliveries . The pre-operative symptoms included lump coming out of the vagina in 82.1 percent， voiding difficulty in 3% and stress urinary incontinence in 37.5 percent of the patients .\n\n【19】Twenty nine percent of women had grade 3 cystocele to 4cystocele on pre-operative examination， 58 percent of them had grade3 to 4 uterovaginal descent and 32.5 percent had grade 3 rectocele to 4 rectocele. Thirty eight percent of them had demonstrable stress urinary incontinence .\n\n【20】The indication for vaginal hysterectomyywas uterovaginal prolapse in 81.8 percent of these women， fibroid uterus in 14 percent， Table 1： Demographic characteristics.\n\n| Patient's Characteristics  | N=336  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Age (years) mean ± SD (range)  | 57.0±10.2通用删除7(英):<u>(35-86)</u>  |\n| Parity mean ± SD (range)  | 2.9±1.6通用删除7(英):<u>(0-13)</u>  |\n| Previous vaginal delivery n (%)  | 323(96.1)  |\n| Previous Caesarean delivery only n (%)  | 4(1.2)  |\n| Nulliparous n (%)  | 9(2.7)  |\n| Sexually active n(%)  | 153(45.5)  |\n| Postmenopausaln (%)  | 217(64.6)  |\n\n【22】Table 2： Preoperative symptoms.\n\n| Pre-operative Symptoms  | N=336  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Lump at Introitus n (%)  | 276(82.1)  |\n| Voiding Difficulty n(%)  | 10(3.0)  |\n| Urgencyn(%)  | 74(22.0)  |\n| Urge Incontinence n(%)  | 43(12.8)  |\n| Stress UI n (%)  | 126(37.5  |\n\n【24】Table 3： Preoperative examination.\n\n| Pre-operative Symptoms  | N=336  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Cystocele n (%)  |  |\n| (a) Grade 0  | 86(25.6)  |\n| (b) Grade 1  | 45(13.4)  |\n| (C) Grade 2  | 108(32.1)  |\n| (d) Grade 3  | 93(27.7)  |\n| (e) Grade 4  | 4(1.2)  |\n| Cervical Descent n (%)  |  |\n| (a) Grade 0  | 24(7.1)  |\n| (b) Grade 1  | 24(7.1)  |\n| (C) Grade 2  | 179(53.3)  |\n| (d) Grade 3  | 94(28.0)  |\n| (e) Grade 4  | 15(4.5)  |\n| Rectocele n (%)  |  |\n| (a) Grade 0  | 53(15.8)  |\n| (b) Grade 1  | 88(26.2)  |\n| (c) Grade 2  | 180 (53.5)  |\n| (d) Grade 3  | 13(3.9)  |\n| (e) Grade 4  | 2(0.6)  |\n| SUIn (%)  | 128(38.1)  |\n\n【26】Table 4： Intraoperative details.\n\n| Parameters  | N=336  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Indication for surgery n (%)  |  |\n| (a) Uterovaginal prolapse  | 275(81.8)  |\n| (b) Fibroids  | 47(14.0)  |\n| (C) Adenomyosis  | 19(5.7)  |\n| (d) Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia (CIN)  | 4(1.2)  |\n| Anaesthesia n (%)  |  |\n| (a) Regional  | 88(26.2)  |\n| (b) General  | 248(73.8)  |\n| Patients with concomitant surgeries n (%)  |  |\n| (a) Pelvic flaor repair  | 153(45.5)  |\n| (b) Mid urethral sling  | 131(39.0)  |\n| (c) Oophorectomy (vaginally)  | 12(3.6)  |\n| Duration of surgery (min) mean ± SD (range)  |  |\n| (a) Mean  | 61.6±21.9通用删除7(英):<u>(24-155)</u>  |\n| (b) Vaginal Hysterectomy (VH)  | 51.9±16.6通用删除7(英):<u>(24-91)</u>  |\n| (C) VH + Pelvic Floor Repair (PFR)  | 56.8±20.1通用删除7(英):<u>(25-130)</u>  |\n| (d) VH + Mid urethral tape  | 71.0±22.4通用删除7(英):<u>(27-155)</u>  |\n| Blood Loss (ml)mean ± SD (range)  |  |\n| (a) Mean  | 50.1±47.0通用删除7(英):<u>(5-400)</u>  |\n| (b) VH  | 61.4±57.5通用删除7(英):<u>(5-300)</u>  |\n| (C) VH + PFR  | 47.3±46.8通用删除7(英):<u>(5-400)</u>  |\n| (d) VH + Mid urethral tape  | 48.9±42.1通用删除7(英):<u>(5-300)</u>  |\n| Weight of uterus (g)(n=329) mean ± SD (range)  |  |\n| (a) Mean ± SD (range)  | 101.6±82.7 通用删除7(英):<u>(20-533)</u>  |\n| (b) <200n(%)  | 291(88.4)  |\n| (c) 200-<300 n (%)  | 28(8.5)  |\n| (d)≥300n(%)  | 10通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u>  |\n| Intraoperative complicationsn(%)  | 4(1.2%)  |\n| (a) Bladder Perforation  | 1  |\n| (b) Rectal Perforation  | 3  |\n| Histopathologyn (%)  |  |\n| (a) Normal  | 267(79.5)  |\n| (b) Fibroids  | 167(49.7)  |\n| (C) Adenomyosis  | 97(28.9)  |\n| (d) Endometrial hyperplasia/carcinoma  | 14(1.7)  |\n| (e) Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia (CIN)  | 7(0.9)  |\n\n【28】adenomyosis in 5.7 percent and carcinoma in situ of the cervix in 1.2percent， with some patients having more than one indication .

Among the patients studied， there were 9 nulliparous women and four patients with no previous vaginal deliveries， with two of them having undergone two previous caesarean sections. Vaginal hysterectomy was possible in all of these patients without any intraoperative complications. Augustine et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[26]</u> in their study on vaginal hysterectomy in nulliparous women without prolapse found that the success rate in multiparous women was more than that in nulliparous women， but the difference was not statistically significant 通用删除6(英):<u>[26]</u>. The difference in success rates may be explained by the technical difficulty due to a narrower vagina and lesser uterine descent in nulliparous patients. The rate of complications for nulliparous women was three fold higher in their study.

Glomus tumors are rare soft tissue tumors that have similar incidence in both genders. Mostly， diagnosis is made in people between 20 to 40 years old and symptoms may precede years before 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. There are several variants of glomus tumor besides classic histology， including glomangioma， glomangiomyoma and glomangiomatosis. Glomus tumor often occurs in the skin of distal extremities like subungual region of finger， palm， wrist， forearm and foot 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Occurrence in the visceral organ is rare， including gastrointestinal tract，lung， mediastinum， pancreas and kidney通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. There is no definite guideline on treatment ofrenal glomus tumor.\n\n【9】In this report， we describe a 54-year-old woman who presented with a rare primary glomus tumor in the kidney， along with a literature review.\n\n【10】Case Presentation\n\n【11】A 54-year-old female with past history of dyslipidemia and hypothyroidism\n\n【12】A left renal mass around 4 cm in diameter with calcifications and septa in the upper pole was noted under Computed Tomography (CT) accidentally . The tumor was partially enhanced， heterogenous and border was clear. She denied hematuria nor palpable mass except occasionally left flank pain during these days.\n\nAfter fully discussion with the patient， she decided to receive laparoscopic partiall nephrectomy under the suspect of renal cell carcinoma. The operation course was smooth and no acute complication was noted. Macroscopically， the resected tumor was measured 45 mmx30mm x 30 mm in size and was confined to the renal parenchyma|删除段之间换行|From histopathological examination， immunohistochemical stains of tumor showed immunoreactivity for Smooth Muscle Actin(SMA) and Muscle Actin . No expression within the tumor cells for Desmin， CK， PAX-8，INSM-1，Synaptophysin， CD31， CD34， HMB-45 nor GLUT-1. Glomus tumor was impressed based on immunohistochemical stains features mentioned above. Other part excised along with the tumor showed chronic pyelonephritis microscopically. Discharge was arranged for the patient on the sixth day after the operation.\n\n【14】As of now， no renal function impairment was noted during follow-up after the operation. Computed tomography followed four months after the operation showed no recurrence of tumor. The patient received follow-up with CT annualy and was free of disease at sixteen months after the operation.\n\n【15】Discussion\n\n【16】The normal glomus body is a specialized form of arteriovenous anastomosis that regulates heat. The most distribution site of glomus body is extremities，including digits and palms and it is usuallylocated in the stratum reticularis ofthe dermis. Based on report from Masson， the normal glomus body is composed of afferent arteriole and turns into four preglomic arterioles， which blend with an irregular， thick-walled segment known as the Sucquet-Hoyer canal containing the arteriovenous anastomosis 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>.\n\n【17】Glomus tumors are tumors of mesenchyme that resemble the normal glomus body with smooth muscle and vasculature. Masson firstly proposed the concept of glomus tumor in 1924， according to three cases diagnosed as upper extremity tumor with intermittent sharp pain 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. Symptoms subsided after tumor excision. He found out the tumor structure was similar to glomus body and suggested that it was related to hyperplasia or overgrowth of glomus body.\n\nAccording to report from Mayo Clinic， estimated incidence of glomus tumor was 1.6% among 500 consecutive soft tissue tumors.

Few literatures may also have reported glomus tumor in gastrointestinal tract， the genital organ， oral cavity， trachea， mediastinum， heart and lymph nodes. So far， there are several cases of renal glomus tumor and were summarized in Table 1 通用删除6(英):<u>[2，4-13]</u>. Classically， glomus tumors are solitary， while Okada O et al. and Sawada S et al. ever reported multiple subungual glomus tumors in patients with Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) 通用删除6(英):<u>[14，15]</u>. Symptoms of glomus tumor often disproportionate with size.

There are no specific symptoms among these cases， include flank or abdominal discomfort and microscopic hematuria.Overall， most cases were diagnosed accidentally under image examination.\n\n【23】Radiology image is widely used for differential diagnosis of renal mass. Currently， due to low incidence rate and radiologic characteristics， it is not easy to diagnose glomus tumor of the kidney depends on only image 通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>. Many previous reported cases showed enhanced， heterogenous lesion under CT with clear border. In our case， image revealed diffused calcification and malignancy was suspected. During the operation， firm texture of tumor was noted， which was different from common renal tumor.\n\n【24】Glomus tumor usually occurred in middle-aged people. Zhao et al. ever reported one case of a young girl with past history of tuberous sclerosis complex diagnosed as renal glomus tumor at the age of age通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. The patient received partial nephrectomy and was free of disease at 16 months of follow-up.\n\n【25】Tissue biopsy or pathology from surgery is necessary for confirming the diagnosis of glomus tumor. Immunohistochemical diagnosis is made based on immunoreactivity for both common muscle and smooth muscle actin regardless of different location of tumor 通用删除6(英):<u>[17，18]</u>. Renal glomus tumor is distinguishable from renal cell carcinoma because it is positive for muscle markers while negative for epithelial markers including cytokeratin and epithelial membrane antigen. Immunoactivity of desmin of tumor was variable， ranging from focal positivity to no expression 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>. It is reported that peripheral/subcutaneous glomus tumor expressed CD34 positivity more frequently than visceral glomus tumor 通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u>. S-100 protein， various cytokeratin's and other markers induding CD31，HMB-45， CD117， CD20， CD45， C56 and CD57 showed negative result mostly通用删除6(英):<u>[6，7，18，20]</u> .\n\n【26】Previous study has defined the criteria for possible malignancy， which includes 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> tumor size larger than two centimeter and deep location inkidney； 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> display ofatypical mitotic figures； 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> significant nuclear grade and mitotic activity (5 mitoses/50 HPF) 通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u>. In our cases， tumor size was larger than two centimeter and located deep in upper pole of left kidney， while pathology report showed no obvious increased mitosis or necrosis. Surgical resection remained mainstay treatment in previous reported cases 通用删除6(英):<u>[2，6-9，11，13]</u>. Mostly， the prognosis was acceptable， either pathological report showed atypical and malignant or benign glomus tumor. Lamba et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u>， however，删除1换行firstly reported malignant renal glomus tumor with pelvic bones and spine metastasis. Palliative chemotherapy and radiation therapy was given while poor response was noted. The patient passed away within six months after diagnosis.

The patient received radical nephrectomy and adrenalectomy for the tumor and he was free of disease at six months of follow-up通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>.\n\n【27】In conclusion， renal glomus tumor is an uncommon tumor that encompassed unspecific clinical symptoms. It is challenging to distinguish renal glomus tumor from other renal tumors including renal cell carcinoma bysymptoms，laboratoryandimage data. Definite diagnosis was always made based on histopathological examination. There are still limited data and consensus for treatment of renal glomus tumor due to scarcity.

This study aims to classify open-access microRNA data of patients with colorectal cancer liver metastasis and without liver metastases using the XGBoost method， one of the machine learning methods， and reveal important genes that may cause liver metastases.\n\n【2】Methods： This retrospective study considered the open-access microRNA expression data of patients with colorectal cancer liver metastasis and without liver metastases. The dataset consists of miRNA data from 10 CRC tissues from patients with liver metastases and 10 CRC tissues from patients without liver metastases.XGBoost was constructed for the classification via ten-fold cross-validation. Accuracy， balanced accuracy， sensitivity， specificity， positive predictive value， and negative predictive value performance metrics were evaluated for model performance.\n\n【3】Results： With respect to the feature selection method，23 microRNA were selected， and modeling was performed with these input variables. Accuracy， balanced accuracy， sensitivity， specificity， positive predictive value， negative predictive value， and F1 score obtained from the XGBoost model were 95%， 95%，90%，100%，100%，90.9%， and 94.7%，respectively. Based on the variable importance findings acquired from the XGBoost， microRNA 4306， microRNA 2115， and microRNA 4708 can be employed as potential biomarkers for liver metastases.\n\n【4】Conclusion： As a result of the study， genes that could be biomarkers for colorectal cancer liver metastases were identified using a machine learning-based prediction approach. Following clinical validation of the obtained microRNAs in subsequent research， therapeutic procedures based on this microRNA scan be established， and their usefulness in clinical practice can be documented.\n\n【5】Keywords： Colorectal cancer； Liver metastases； Machine learning； Biomarker\n\n【6】Introduction\n\n【7】The fourth most common cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide is Colorectal Cancer(CRC)， one of the three most prevalent cancers 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. 1.9 million new cases of CRC were diagnosed in 2020， while 935，000 CRC patients died 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. The worldwide incidence of CRC has been rising at a 3.2% yearly rate， starting with 783，000 cases in 1999 and rising to 1.8 million by 2020. This trend is expected to persist 通用删除6(英):<u>[2-6]</u>. The improvement of diagnostic procedures and treatment modalities， such as surgery，adjuvant chemotherapies， andpalliative medicines， has resulted in a decline in CRC mortality rates in recent decades. After curative treatment， the metastasis of colorectal cancer is still a big problem， and it is the leading cause of mortality due to CRC. Tumor metastasis remains the most significant barrier to CRC treatment and prognosis. The most prevalent site of distant spread is liver metastasis， and around 15% to 25% of CRC patients will have distant metastases at the time of original diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>[7，8]</u>. Liver metastasis of CRC may be related to factors such as the presence of the portal vein system， which directly connects the colorectal and liver and is associated with abundant blood supply， the location of the primary tumor and its histological type 通用删除6(英):<u>[9，10]</u>.\n\n【8】Curative resection and chemotherapy are standard treatment modalities in patients with Colorectal Cancer Liver Metastasis (CCLM) 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>. However， due to factors such as the location and删除1换行size of the tumor， the presence of extrahepatic disease， unresectable disease， or comorbidities of the patients， the surgical treatment option can be applied only in 10% to 20% of the cases， and the 5-year survival rate is very low 通用删除6(英):<u>[12，13]</u>. Those who are unsuitable for surgery also have a worse prognosis. It is， therefore， necessary to find more effective targeted therapies for CCLM. Therefore， understanding the mechanisms underlying CRC and investigating the highly sensitive and specific molecules associated with metastasis， particularly during colorectal liver metastasis， is crucial to improve patient's clinical outcomes and overall survival 通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u>. In this process， it is very important to understand the molecular mechanisms and to carry out purposeful studies. Although many previous studies have identified various molecules involved in the initiation and development of colorectal liver metastases， the mechanisms still remain unclear 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>.\n\n【9】There is still no holistic understanding of the process of carcinogenesis and metastasis in CRC， and studies for the causes of metastasis have focused on limited molecular markers. Next-generation sequencing， a high-throughput technology， is widely used to detect complex genetic changes to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the molecular pathophysiology of diseases and to identify various biomarkers to determine prognosis and treatment efficacy. Thanks to these genomic technologies used， molecular mechanisms related to diseases can be illuminated， and genes，RNAs， etc.， that may be disease-related biomarkers can be detected 通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>.\n\n【10】Aiming to develop computer algorithms that can be developed with experience， machine learning aims to provide descriptive information to researchers in the analysis of large， complex datasets of computers. When exposed to new data， machine learning learns based on previous data and makes predictions about new data. In the past ten years， thanks to the availability of big datasets and increased processing power， machine learning approaches have achieved outstanding performance in a number ofresearch. Therefore， machine learning is perhaps most useful for analyzing and interpreting large genomic datasets and may be used to describe a wide variety of genomic sequence elements 17，18.\n\n【11】In this study， in order to identify microRNAs that may be biomarkers for CCLM； by making bioinformatic analyzes from an open-access microRNA dataset belonging to CCLM is aimed to model the data set formed by overexpressed RNAs with XGBoost， which is a machine learning model， and to determine the possible biomarker RNAs with the variable importance values obtained.\n\n【12】Materialand Methods\n\n【13】Data set and variables\n\n【14】This current research was conducted using data from a case-control study published by Qiaoming Zhi et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u>. The dataset consists of miRNA data from 10 CRC tissues from patients with liver metastases and 10 CRC tissues from patients without liver metastases. In the current study， this dataset was used to identify miRNAs differentially expressed between the two groups by bioinformatic analysis and to identify miRNAs that could be biomarkers using the machine learning method.\n\n【15】Bioinformatics analysis phase\n\n【16】For CCLM， which was examined for miRNA expression profiles， differential expression analyses were performed using the limma package available in the R programming language 通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u>. Differential expression analysis is known as the statistical analysis of normalized删除1换行read count data to find the quantitative differences present in expression activities in different group situations. As a result of the analysis， a gene table in order of importance and a volcano plot to visualize differentially expressed genes are obtained. Log2FC>1was used to identify upregulated genes， and log2FC<-1 to identify downregulated genes in the analyzes performed 通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u>. Up-regulated miRNAs are shown in red， down-regulated miRNAs are shown in blue in the volcano plot used to visualize genes with differential regulation， and miRNAs that do not show any change in expression between the 2 groups are shown in black.\n\n【17】Modelling phase\n\n【18】The modeling phase starts with variable selection. In the bioinformatics analysis， LASSO variable selection method was used in the variable selection stage made from differently expressed miRNAs. The variable selection phase is one of the most important steps in any predictive modeling project. Basically， variable selection is the process of deciding which data/variables to include in the study while developing a statistical model. Variable selection is a feature identification process on a data set that has an effect on the dependent variable. The high dimensionality of the explanatory variables that have an effect on the dependent variable can lead to both long computation times and over-learning of the data. For this reason， before performing statistical modeling， the variables with the most important features， that is， the variables that explain the model the most， should be selected 通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u>. The datasets obtained by gene expression also have very large volumes. Therefore， variable selection methods are applied before modeling with these datasets. The LASSO variable selection method used in this study imposes a constraint on the sum of the absolute values of the model parameters， and this sum must be less than a fixed value (upper limit). To achieve this， the method uses a throttling (narrowing-regulating) operation that penalizes the coefficients of the regression variables and causes some of them to drop to zero 通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u>. Modeling was done with the data set obtained by the variable selection. In the modeling phase， XGBoost， which is a tree-based method from machine learning methods， was used. XGBoost is a machine learning method based on gradient boosting and decision tree methods and has found application in many areas. This method， which has a very high predictive power compared to other algorithms， is 10 times faster than other methods and includes a series of regularizations that can improve the overall performance of the model and reduce overfitting and overlearning通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u>.\n\n【19】In order to ensure model validity， the n-fold cross-validation method， one of the resampling methods， was used in this study. In this method；\n\n【20】First， the dataset is divided into n pieces， and the model is applied to n pieces.\n\n【21】In the second step， one of the n parts is used for the testing process， while the other n-1 parts are used in the training process.\n\n【22】In the last stage， the average of the values obtained from the models is evaluated for the cross-validation method.\n\n【23】Accuracy， balanced accuracy， sensitivity， specificity， positive predictive value， negative predictive value，and F1-score metrics were used to evaluate the performance obtained as a result of the modeling. Finally， in order to identify miRNAs that could be biomarkers， variable importance values were calculated， giving information about how much the input variables explain the output variable.\n\n【24】Biostatistical analysis phase\n\n【25】Shapiro Wilk test of normality was employed to determine whether the variables had anormal distribution. Data were summarized as mean ± standard deviation. Independent samples t-test was employed to compare data. p-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. IBM SPSS Statistics 25.0 program was used in the analysis.\n\n【26】The process flow diagram\n\n【27】The process flow diagram of the used models is also shown in Figure 1 for a better understanding ofthe system.\n\n【28】Results\n\n【29】There are 9 female and 11 male patients in the current study. The mean age of the patients was 63.4±11.51. While the mean age of patients without liver metastasis is 64.9 ± 5.85， the mean age of patients with metastasis is 61.9±15.50 vears.\n\n【30】When the data obtained as a result of the bioinformatics analysis were examined， 72 microRNAs with down- and 24 up-regulation were found. According to the table in which the microRNAs with the smallest adjacent P. value are listed， 4 of the first 10 microRNAs were downregulated，5 of them were upregulated， while 1 of them did not. The results obtained according to the bioinformatics analysis are tabulated in Table 1.\n\n【31】The volcano plot， where we can see all differentially expressed genes， is as follows .\n\n【32】According to the results of the biostatistical analysis performed with 23 microRNAs selected by the variable selection method， statistically significant differences were obtained between the groups with and without liver metastasis with CRC. Mentioned 23microRNAs show differences for 2 groups. Biostatistical analysis results are given in Table 2.\n\n【33】The values of the performance metrics obtained as a result of modeling with the XGBoost method are as follows .\n\n【34】The graphical presentation of the metrics is as follows .\n\n【35】According to the variable significance values obtained as a result of the modeling， the 3 microRNAs were the most differentiated microRNAs among the 2 groups. The graphic showing of these microRNAs according to the obtained variable importance values is given in Figure 4.\n\n【36】Discussion\n\n【37】CRC is still frequent cancer. Most cancers， including CRC， may have a single clonal origin in the early stages of the disease. Still， a malignant tumor contains multiple populations of cells with distinct characteristics such as growth rate， karyotype， immunogenicity， drug susceptibility， and ability to expand. And develop metastases.\n\n【38】Table 1： The results of the bioinformatics analysis.\n\n| ID  | adj. P. Val  | P.

Therefore， many researchers have tried to understand the genetic characteristics of metastatic clones， since clones with metastatic potential are genetically different from|删除段之间换行|Accordingtothebioinformaticanalyzes， it was determined that 72microRNAs showed different regulation in the CCLM state compared to the CCR. Of these， microRNA 4708， microRNA 4306，microRNA142， microRNA 4516， microRNA 345， id=42614， microRNA 2681， id=147834， id=148143， microRNA 33b are the microRNAs with the smallest adj p-value values and the most differentiated.

Often， these tumors will present as hematuria- which is regarded as benign. Because of this presentation， pediatric patients often are not diagnosed until years after their initial presentation. We present a 4-year-old female patient who presented initially at 6 months with progressive hematuria that ultimately ended up being diagnosed with a bladder teratoma. In conclusion， bladder teratomas should be included in the initial work-up when presenting with hematuria.\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Bladder tumors are uncommon in children with an incidence of 0.1% to 0.4% during the first two decades of life 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Malignant teratomas， yolk sac tumors， and all germ cell tumors in pediatric patients are exceedingly rare and most often affect females 通用删除6(英):<u>[2-4]</u>. There has been no specific genetics identified for bladder teratomas specifically， but there have been familial cases of ovarian teratomas identified in several subsequent generations 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>.\n\n【4】Teratomas are the most common germ celltumor and are defined histologically as a combination of ectoderm， mesoderm， and endoderm as well as being grossly heterogeneous with both solid and cystic features 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. Most mature cystic teratomas are composed of ectoderm-derived epidermis， sebaceous glands and hair follicles and mesoderm-derived dermal stromal elements. However，there have been rare cases of teratomas Containing Gastrointestinal (GI) epithelium and an organized GI tract which is true in this case 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. The most common teratomas are sacrococcygeal and ovarian in origin， with bladder teratomas being exceptionallyrare 通用删除6(英):<u>[2，4]</u>. Teratomas are primarily asymptomatic and often found incidentally on imaging. When allowed to grow undiscovered， they have been shown to have mass effects in the affecting organ. When localized to the urinary system，teratomas have been shown to emulate bladder and ureteral calculi such as lower urinary tract symptoms， hematuria， and urinary retention 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>. The most pathognomonic symptom of bladder teratoma in pilimiction， the passage of hair in urine 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>.\n\n【5】There is little known about bladder tumors in the pediatric population，so it can lead to a delay in diagnosis and deleterious therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. Although the surgical management ofthese tumors is well reported， there is no consensus on the surveillance or follow-up of these patients 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. We report the case of a 4-year-old child presenting with a bladder teratoma and discuss the diagnostic and therapeutic aspects of bladder tumors in children.\n\n【6】Case Presentation\n\n【7】删除10:<u>cited.</u>\n\n【8】This is a 4-year-old female child， with no notable pathological history， referred from a regional hospital to our department for gross hematuria with clots. This clinical picture evolved from the age of 6 months with initial intermittent terminal hematuria then progressing to total hematuria associated withhypogastric pain. She had been hospitalized several times in different hospital systems without any definitive etiology being attributed to this hematuria before being referred. On physical examination， the patient presented with pale mucous membranes， hypogastric tenderness， and a soiled diaper with observed blood clots. A biological assessment had demonstrated a microcvtic hypochromic anemia at 4.8 g/dl with a hematocrit of 12%. An Emmel test performed came back positive. The kidney workup was unremarkable. An ultrasound of the urinary tree indicated an irregular peripheral tissue thickening of the bladder wall， vascularized by Doppler， suggesting a bladder tumor. A uroscan was performed and revealed a tumor of the bladder dome associated with right inguinal and external iliac lymph nodes . A cystoscopy under general anesthesia删除1换行b) Frontal Reconstruction\n\n【9】Discussion\n\n【10】The benign nature of hematuria misleads clinicians when approaching a diagnosis of bladder teratoma. However， the most frequent reason for consultation for a bladder tumor is hematuria as seen in our patient 通用删除6(英):<u>[9，10]</u>. Teratomas typically have a median age presentation of 30 years old which why this differential not expected通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>. Contributing to the complexity of this case， teratomas have an insidious nature growing at a slow-rate with an average of 1.8 mm per year subsequently further delaying their diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>.\n\n【11】The first-line examination in children is the ultrasound of the urinary tract， given its accessibility 通用删除6(英):<u>[10，12]</u>. Cystoscopy allows a definite diagnosis， but is rarely used in children given the need for general anesthesia and the risk of urethral injury 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>. Cystoscopy was used in our patient preoperatively 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>.\n\n【12】Treatment for bladder tumors includes partial cystectomy versu radical cystectomy. Partial cystectomy has obvious advantages over radical cystectomy. Namely， its bladder-saving approach avoids the need for urinary diversion， maintains erectile function in males， can be done under regional anesthesia， and is associated with lower morbidity and mortality 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>. In our patient， we used the partial cystectomy approach. Several other cases of bladder teratomas also used partial cystectomy approaches with success 通用删除6(英):<u>[11，14]</u>. The prognosis for bladder tumors is often favorable as shown by a meta-analysis with a recurrence rate of 3.4% and death rate of 1%通用删除6(英):<u>[141</u>.\n\n【13】Conclusion\n\n【14】Despite the often-benign nature of hematuria in children， it is essential that any practitioner eliminate a bladder tumor. An ultrasound and a cystoscopy will confirm the diagnosis. The evolution is favorable after resection of the tumor.

According to the World Health Organization， the number of disabilities and deaths caused by PD is higher than any other neurological disorder. That nearlyone million Americans are living with PD. Most evidence suggests that the disease affects nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons in the basal ganglia and produces less dopamine， which causes movement problems associated with PD. The classic PD motor features cardinal symptoms of bradykinesia， cogwheel-like rigidity， tremor at rest， and postural instability. Treatment is symptomatic and there is no treatment to prevent progression of the disease 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，2]</u>.\n\n【2】Case Presentation\n\n【3】The patient is a 64-year-old female who presents to the emergency department with seizure and consciousness disturbance. She was diagnosed with PD at the age of 51， received regular medication (Madopar， Switane， Bromocriptine， Lexapro， Lexotan)， and got well-controlled. This was accompanied by decreased tendon reflexes and rigidity of four limbs， resting tremor， bradykinesia， and progressive change with wheelchair bound since 2019/02. The Hoehn and Yahr Scale was from stage IV to V. According to her family， she has frequent tremors， sweating and trismus episodes about twice a day after COVID-19 pneumonia in May 2022. On outpatient Examination Electroencephalography (EEG) on September 2022， showed diffuse background slowing，predominantly at 7 Hz to 8 Hz， and frequent sharp waves in the right temporal. In October2022， she has discharged from our hospital for bloodstream infection and urinary tract infection. During admission， intermittent seizure episode without consciousness change was noted， and Valproic acid was prescribed. The EEG was followed and showed excessive beta activity (14 Hz to18 Hz) in the frontal area， but no epileptiform discharge. However， a seizure was noted again and consciousness disturbance (E2 V2 M4) and the patient came to our ER. Desaturation and bilateral pneumonia were noted， intubation was performed， and she was transferred to the intensive care unit for further management.\n\n【4】At admission， intermittent generalized tonic-clonic seizures developed and fluctuated consciousness level， which subside after Lorazepam injection. The lumbar puncture was performed， CSF routine and panel of meningitis pathogens showed no evidence of CNS infection. Bloodstream with Corynebacterium species infection and sputum FilmArray concern of MDR K. pneumonia ESBL， Carbapenem wass prescribed as ID physician recommendation. Bronchoscopy was performed， and the final sputum report Burkholderia cepacia complex (Meropenem MIC 1 mg/L). We kept catheter free due to urinary tract infection with Escherichia coli (only Amikacin MIC 16mg/L). The cEEG was performed showed no epileptiform discharge. Because of the generalized dyskinesia in the cluster and intermittent agitation， we already gave her Lorazepam， charged the AEDs to Briviact with Lacosamide， tapered Madopar， and added Biperiden regularly， but to no avail. Under the impression of time-locked to Levodopa administration， we discontinued Levodopa and titrated Biperiden， but no response was noted. We then titrated a low dose Midazolam infusion， and her consciousness returned to clearness. Yo-yoing or biphasic dyskinesia was suspected，and Amantadine， Neupro patch and low dose Clozapine were administrated. The patient showed no more motor complications in the recent 72 h and we discontinued Briviact. However， an episode of involuntary movement with alert consciousness was detected， it was resolved 10 mins after the infusion of Lorazepam.HLA-B typing revealed that the patient was not a carrier of the warning gene， and we switched Lacosamide to Trileptal. The patient passed the weaning test and was extubated with smooth respiratory pattern.\n\n【5】Discussion\n\n【6】Uncontrollable movement disorders associated with the use of certain medications， especially the side effects of anti-psychiatric drugs， include dyskinesia and akathisia. Parkinsons disease is the best-known movement disorder， causing recurrent involuntary movements without disturbance of consciousness. Dyskinesia is characterized by short， twisting movements ofthe face，mouth，fingers， or extremities. Akathisia as a type of internal agitation， excessive and purposeless movement， probably rocking back and forth， striding， or making a fist repeatedly 通用删除6(英):<u>[3，4]</u>. Our patient’s clinical manifestations include unusual movements， mouth twisting， writhing movements of the four limbs， tightly closed eyes， and sweating. The movements may resemble tics corresponding to dyskinesia.\n\n【7】Ahlskog and Muenter 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u> reported in a meta-analysis that patients who received levodopa treatment for 4 to 6 vears had about40% motor fluctuations and up to 90% median dyskinesia when treated for 9 years. In advanced disease stages of the disease， the therapeutic window of levodopa becomes narrower and the major of patients develop motor complications， which are especially more common in young onset PD. We need to reduce the levodopa to preserve the levels and avoid treatment complications such as motor and nonmotor fluctuations and Levodopa-Induced Dyskinesia (LID). Long-term motor complications of levodopa therapy were response fluctuations (hypokinetic phenomena) and involuntary movements(hyperkinetic phenomena)， such as yo-yoing or diphasic dyskinesia通用删除6(英):<u>[6-8]</u>. In Hoehn and Yahr stage 4 or 5 patients， motor fluctuations were present in 71% and dyskinesias in 60%通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>.\n\n【8】Fluctuations in motor symptoms of different states PD patients alternate between ON with peak-dose dyskinesia to being OFF.“ON\"the satisfactory effect of treatment for the good motor function is described. In contrast，\"OFF\"is the reduced effect oftreatment due to marked parkinsonian symptoms. However， as the disease progresses and gastric empty slowly， it can be observed to switch rapidly and unpredictably change between the “ON- and OFF-status\" of the motor status in PD patients. Sometimes referred to as “yo-yoing， possible explanations include altered pharmacodynamics as well as pharmacokinetics 通用删除6(英):<u>[6，7，9，10]</u>.\n\n【9】In addition to fluctuations， abnormal involuntary movements were also a common complication， called dyskinesia or dystonia. Our patient’s clinical symptoms appeared in the form of twisting movements involving the limbs， face， and trunk， which was closer to the diagnosis of the athetoid. Initially， the dyskinesia improved after a reduction in levodopa dosage. However， as the progress diseases， dyskinesia can occur at peak levels as well as when the effect of an individual dose is waning， causing repeat dyskinesia-improvement-dyskinesia， also called diphasic dyskinesia 通用删除6(英):<u>[11，12]</u>.\n\nMedication management of motor complications includes non-ergoline dopamine receptor agonists and N-Methyl-D-Aspartate(NMDA) receptor antagonist is an adjunct in fluctuating disease.

Our patient had multiple vascular variants including azygos anterior cerebral artery， hypoplasia of the left A1 segment and， anterior communicating artery， aortic origin and， hypoplasia of the left vertebral artery with left main terminal branch Posterior Inferior Cerebellar Artery (PICA)， old occlusion of the amputated basilar artery at the top with collateral circulation by bilateral Anterior Inferior Cerebellar Artery (AICA) arteries and， via PICAS.\n\n【3】Discussion： The set of brain anatomical variants found in the anterior and posterior circulation and post-infarction changes via bilateral AICA and right PICA is rare in the literature， especially about the clinical presentation of the patient. Following the above， it is important to report this case due to the low prevalence of the set of anatomical variants described and the absence of similar cases described in the literature.\n\n【4】Keywords： Brain anatomical variants； Acigos artery； Brain infarction posterior circulation； Infarction basilar artery\n\n【5】Introduction\n\n【6】Anatomical variants in the central nervous system are frequent， especially in the Willis Polygon， which has a classic structure only in 20% to 25% of people 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，2]</u>. The variants can be classified as fenestrations， duplications， hypoplasia’s， agenesis， infundibular origins and， persistent communicating anomalous anastomosis 通用删除6(英):<u>[2，3]</u>.\n\n【7】These variants are mainly found incidentally but sometimes are associated with ischemic events that tend to differ from the classically described vascular territories， the most clinically relevant variants are： 1) Bilateral infarcts by anterior Azygos and， Percheron artery 2) Infarcts of Choroidal or Heubner's arteries and，3) Stem syndromes 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>.\n\n【8】The objective of this article is to present multiple vascular anatomical variants documented in a patient who was admitted to our hospital with a right posterior cerebral artery infarction.\n\n【9】Case Presentation\n\n【10】A 56-year-old man with a history of migraine， without cardiovascular risk factors， presented with intense holocranial headache， stabbing type， sudden loss of left peripheral vision and， left upper limb paresthesia， subsequently decreased alertness with retrograde amnesia of the event. Neurological examination showed lower left quadrantanopsy and， hypoesthesia of the left upper limb，the initial head Computed Tomography (CT) was normal .\n\n【11】Later he presented an increase of the support polygon and， lateralization in gait to the left， the Contrast-enhanced Magnetic Resonance Image (C-MRI) revealed areas of restricted diffusion in the right thalamus， posterior horns of the lateral ventricle and， right occipital lobe， compatible with acute multiple brain infarction in the right Posterior Cerebral Artery (PCA) territory . Angiotomography was performed revealing a filling defect of the Basilar Artery (AB)， absence offlow within the PCA，hypoplasia of the pre-communicating portion (A1) of the left Anterior Cerebral Artery(ACA) and， in the intracranial portion (V4) of the left Vertebral Artery (VA).\n\n【12】Additionally， a subsequent pan-angiography confirmed the occlusion at the top of the basilar artery， absence of the Posterior Communicating Arteries (PCoA) without direct cortical irrigation， since this irrigation was given by an extensive network of vascular collateralization to the ischemic territory from the Anteroinferior Cerebellar Arteries (AICAs) and， the right Posterior inferior Cerebellar Artery (PICA). It also noted a hypoplastic left vertebral artery with its origin at the aortic arch， hypoplasia of the left A1删除1换行segment and， absence of anterior communicating artery， with azygos system from A2 but dependent on the right ACA . Capillary and venous phases with normal characteristics， dural sinuses with flow pattern and normal appearance. Malformations of the brain parenchyma were not observed.\n\n【13】In the controls by clinical neurology at 3， 10， 13 months post-infarction， he did not present subsequent neurological deficit， his return to work (mechanical technician of industrial machinery) and social was without difficulties. The control paraclinical tests at11 months were positive antinuclear antibodies 1：320 fine granular pattern， positive antinuclear antibodies 1：320 centrosome pattern. Control images (pan-angiography， Doppler of renal arteries) and rheumatology evaluation were requested； however， as of the date of this case report， the patient has not had them performed.\n\n【14】In resume， the most relevant findings were right azygos ACA， absence of left A1 and， A2 segments， hypoplastic left VA with an aortic origin， absent ACoPs and， finally AB with distal flow occlusion and， extensive collateralization by AICAs and， PICAs allowing the necessary irrigation to the posterior cerebral circulation. The combination of these anatomical variants is infrequent and， even more so with the clinical findings of the patient， we started dual antiplatelet therapy with a diagnosis of minor cerebrovascular attack. Post-discharge follow-up was performed， without neurological deterioration，left lower quadrantanopsia persisted. Other studies are summarized in Table 1.\n\n【15】Discussion\n\n【16】It is important to know the cerebral vascular anatomical variants； the presences of associated cerebral vascular anatomical infarcts or arterial variants do not usually follow the classically predetermined vascular territories 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. We will deepen those variants presented in oiir case.\n\n【17】Anterior circulation\n\n【18】ACA asymmetry is present in 80% of people 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. Azygos ACA is a rare vascular variant (0.3% to 4%) 通用删除6(英):<u>[3，4]</u>， involves segment A2\n\n【19】Hypoplasia of segment A1 is reported in 10% of autopsies and complete absence in 2% of angiograms 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，4]</u>. The posterior communicating arteries may be of fetal origin， an infundibular residue， hypoplastic or unilateral absence， other types of anomalies are infrequent or have not been described通用删除6(英):<u>[1，2]</u>.\n\n【20】Other anomalies of this circulation， absent in our case， include fenestration of ACA (4% of people) 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. Duplication of the Middle Cerebral Artery (MCA) (0.2% to 2.9%)， and its fenestration in less than 1% in autopsies and 0.17% in angiography 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，4]</u>\n\n【21】Posterior circulation\n\n【22】Of all ischemic strokes， the posterior circulation represents 25%and stems 10% of cases 通用删除6(英):<u>[3，9]</u>. Vascular variants of the posterior circulation can involve the brainstem， occipital lobes，and cerebellum， the infarcts secondary to variants are rare 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，6]</u>. Additionally， 6% to10% of all strokes are initially Diffusion-Weighted Imaging (DWI)删除1换行negative， with a false-negative rate for posterior circulation strokes almost 10 times higher than that of the anterior circulation 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>.\n\n【23】The most relevant abnormalities of this circulation are those that affect VA with asymmetry (70%)， hypoplasia (26%) and fenestration(0.3% to 2.0%)通用删除6(英):<u>[2，6]</u>. PICA is absent unilaterally in 10% and bilateral in 2%. In 10% of people， this artery arises from the BA 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. The basilar variants more frequent are fenestration (0.3%to 0.6% ofangiograms)， anastomosis with Carotids (0.1%)，hypoplasia， and agenesis which are rare and almost non-existent 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，6]</u>.\n\n【24】The PCA has an absence of P1 in 10% of people， had identified four variants depending on its origin and， 15% identified fetal PCA from the Carotid Artery 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. Percheron artery infarcts can generate bi-thalamic compromise 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. This anatomical variant was absent in our presented clinical case.\n\n【25】Finally， It is also important to evaluate possible differential diagnoses with a genetic component such as Fabry， MELAS(Mitochondrial Encephalomyopathy， Lactic Acidosis，and，Stroke-like episodes)， CADASIL (Cerebral Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy with Subcortical Infarcts and， Leukoencephalopathy) and， similar通用删除6(英):<u>[7，8]</u>.

It has become an important adjunct for clinical diagnosis and procedural guidance. We present a case report of a patient who presented to our Pediatric Emergency Department (PED) and was diagnosed with myocarditis using cardiac ultrasound at the start of her resuscitation. Point-of-care ultrasound was found beneficial in making a crucial diagnosis of myocarditis at the initial stage ofresuscitation. POCUS directed the quick management and eventual connection of the patient to Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) which contributed to the better outcome of the resuscitation.\n\n【2】Case Presentation\n\n【3】A 15 months old female child was referred to the PED of a tertiary care， university-affiliated， urban facility， due to 4 days of vomiting， restlessness and high fever. Apart from atopic dermatitis， the child was previously healthy and fully immunized.\n\n【4】Parents reported that 3 days prior to her presentation， she developed fever and shortness of breath. She was prescribed antibiotics by her pediatrician for pneumonia.\n\n【5】On the day of presentation to the PED， the pediatrician did not see any improvement in her condition and referred her to our PED since she appeared pale and lethargic.\n\n【6】On arrival to the PED she was obtunded， in severe respiratory distress and pale. Her vital signs were as follows： Oxygen saturation of 70%， heart rate160 bpm， blood pressure 85/58 mmHg， temp37.30°Cand a capillary refill time of 4 sec.\n\n【7】Further examination revealed clearlung sounds bilaterally， rapid heart sounds with no murmurs and no jugular vein distention. Her abdomen was soft， non-tender， with no enlargement of the liver or spleen. Peripheral pulses were felt very weak on palpation.\n\n【8】From triage， the child was transferred immediately to the resuscitation room. While attempts were being made to establish an IV access， the PED， POCUS trained， attending performed a POCUS examination following the \"RUSH\" protocol - Rapid Ultrasound for Shock and Hypotension. Cardiac echo revealed severely poor cardiac function  with an enlarged IVC and multiple B-lines  in both lung fields. Based on these findings， the child was deemed to be suffering from myocarditis with severe cardiac failure. She was connected to fluids and given a small bolus of 10 ml/kg with normal saline and later， due to poor response， inotorpe treatment was initiated.\n\n【9】Her initial blood tests revealed leukocytosis of 26，000 cells/pl with 34% neutrophils， hemoglobin9.7 g/dL and thrombocytosis of 543，000 cells/ul sodium level was 137 meq/L， potassium 7.6 meq/L， albumin 3.8 g/dL， uric acid 13.7 mg/dL， LDH 1024 U/L with a slight elevation in liver function tests. C-Reactive Protein (CRP) level was 0.4 mg/dL， venous blood gases demonstrated a pH of 6.9 with pCO， 34 mmHg，pO， 32 mmHg and HCO3 of 8.4 mmol/L.\n\n【10】Despite all efforts undertaken， blood pressure was not restored and after consultation with the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit (CICU) team， the child was intubated and put on an Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) machine in the PED resuscitation room. Once connected，blood pressure stabilized and the child was transferred to the CICU.\n\nAt the CICU the infant remained connected to the ECMO machine for a period of 8 days with gradual improvement of her cardiac function. After two weeks， she was weaned off from mechanical|删除段之间换行|An echocardiogram prior to discharge showed mild dilation with low systolic function of the left ventricle and mild mitral regurgitation. The child was neurologically intact at discharge|删除段之间换行|In the following months， the child was admitted twice to our emergency department. She was found to be with poor cardiac function and was later diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy.\n\n【12】Ultrasound Technique\n\n【13】The RUSH protocol assesses three main components： the pump- i.e. the cardiac system； the tank - i.e. volume status； and the pipes 删除8:<u>一 </u>-i.e. the vascular system. A useful acronym in order to remember the exam components by is HI-MAP： Heart， IVC， Morrison's pouch(FAST)， Aorta and Pneumothorax.\n\n【14】Since aortic aneurysm or deep vein thrombosis are rare in children our exam focused on cardiac evaluation and volume status as reflected by the IVC and pulmonary edema.\n\n【15】The cardiac exam looks at the heart in four views：\n\n【16】1. Subxiphoid - the transducer is placed underneath the xiphoid with the probe marker directed to the right of the patient. The transducer is directed to the patient's left shoulder.\n\n【17】2. Parasternal long- the transducer is placed to the left of the manubrium with the probe marker towards the patient's right shoulder.\n\n【18】3. Parasternal short - while maintaining the same position as删除1换行for the parasternal long view， the transducer is rotated 90° towards the patient's right hip.\n\n【19】4. Four chamber views -the transducer is placed at the point of maximal impulse， probe marker towards the patient's right and the transducer is angled towards the patient s right shoulder.\n\n【20】These views enable a gross assessment of cardiac function -normal， moderately decreased， severely decreased. In addition， the heart is inspected for pericardial effusion.\n\n【21】The IVC is examined by placement of the transducer beneath the xiphoid， probe marker towards the patient’s right and the transducer is perpendicular to the xiphoid. The diameter of the IVC is compared to the aorta where the normal ratio would be 0.8 to 1.2.\n\n【22】The lungs are examined by placement of the transducer in a mid-clavicular line with the probe marker towards the patient's head， over the right and left lung. Finding of lung gliding would rule out a diagnosis of pneumothorax. Finding of multiple B lines may suggest pulmonary edema\n\n【23】Review of the Literature\n\n【24】Several studies have reported on the benefit of rapid use of ultrasound in the emergency department as a tool which influences the decision on how to manage a patient in an unstable condition1-3.\n\n【25】Ultrasound assessment of patients in shock is becoming the standard of care in emergency and critical care settings worldwide. One of the most common protocols used for this assessment is the Rapid Ultrasound in Shock (RUSH) examination.\n\n【26】The RUSH exam， a rapid evaluation of cardiac function， key vascular structures， and likely sources of hypotension， represents a comprehensive algorithm for the integration of bedside ultrasound into the care of the patient in shock. By focusing on a stepwise approach for evaluation the cause of shock defined here as \"Pump， Tank， and Pipes\"， clinicians will gain crucial anatomic and physiologic data to better care for these patients 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>.\n\n【27】Bagheri-Hariri et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u> reported an overall sensitivity of the RUSH exam of 88% and specificity of 96% 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u> with no significant difference between the emergency physician and radiologist as operators of this protocol 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>.\n\n【28】The value of using the RUSH protocol has been reported in two case files of patients， one with hypotensive shock and the other with cardiac tamponade， who presented to the emergency department in shock and were managed promptly using the RUSH protocol during resuscitation71\n\n【29】ECMO is used in cases of cardiopulmonary failure to reestablish cardiac output and organ perfusion so that permanent end-organ injury， while awaiting reversal of cardiac and other organ disease processes， is prevented. An overall survival rate of 51% was seen in children who were supported with rapid-response ECMO after suffering from in-hospital cardiac arrest that did not respond to conventional CPR 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>.\n\n【30】The use of Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) is still limited owing to low availability， especially in emergency departments. Nevet et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u> reported two children with acute myocarditis successfully treated with ECMO in the emergency department of a tertiary pediatric medical center. Given the urgency删除1换行of their condition and its presumably reversible (viral) etiology， treatment with ECMO was initiated in the department's resuscitation room. The outcome was excellent， and cardiac function remained normal throughout the 6 and 10 months follow-up.\n\n【31】Myocarditis among pediatric patients varies in severity from mild disease to a fulminant course with overwhelming refractory shock and high mortality. Because the disease is potentially reversible， it is reasonable to use ECMO to bridge patients until recovery or transplantation. Nahum et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u> reported on the course and outcome of 12 children with acute fulminant myocarditis who were managed by ECMO due to refractory circulatory collapse. They demonstrated that ECMO can be safely and successfully used for children with acute fulminant myocarditis without a need for heart transplantation.\n\n【32】ThenewPALS recommendations from 2015 emphasize the advantage of connecting the patient toECMO during cardiopulmonary resuscitation. These recommendations rely on evidence from 4 observational studies of pediatric IHCA that have shown no overall benefit to the use of CPR with ECMO compared to CPR without ECMO， but have shown better outcomes when used during cardiac arrest in children with underlying cardiac disease 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>.\n\n【33】While ECMO has been recognized in the latest PALS guidelines， ultrasound was not mentioned in the PALS section and only noted in the adult advanced cardiovascular support section， where the authors recommend that “Ultrasound (cardiac or non cardiac) may be considered during the management of cardiac arrest， although its usefulness has not been well established\".\n\n【34】We believe that due to the noninvasive nature of ultrasound and its ability to provide rapid and repeated assessment of physiology during resuscitation， this modality should move to the front line of emergency care. Integration of POCUS techniques such as the RUSH exam has the potential to augment the clinical evaluation and guide resuscitation to improve the patients outcomes.\n\n【35】Conclusion\n\n【36】This case illustrates the potential clinical impact of POCUS in the management of shock in the pediatric emergency department. The use of POCUS at the very start of resuscitation enabled the treating team to arrive to the diagnosis of severe myocarditis， and the early initiation of the complicated， drastic， yet lifesaving therapeutic option of ECMO， which ultimately improved the child’s prognosis.\n\n【37】It is reasonable to think that the rapid intervention enabled by the POCUS examination contributed to the good neurologic outcome in such a severe case.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

Its quick identification in its typical presentation， the elimination of the most severe alternative diagnosis and its management must be known in order to be adapted to the athlete's sporting objectives. Atypical forms with slow recovery are rare and represent a real diagnostic challenge. We report the case of a professional rugby player who presented an atypical Stinger injury and detail its management. This original case is an opportunityto provide a comprehensive review of the different forms and presentations of these traumatic plexopathies and their management.\n\n【2】Keywords： Plexus brachial； Sport traua； Stinger；COVID-19\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Two main types of brachial plexus injuries are traditionally described： Obstetric brachial plexus paralysis and adult stretch injuries. Both are serious and require specialized care. A third case exists：The traumatic plexopathy of the brachial plexus， better known as Stinger injury or Burner injury. It is little known to the orthopedic surgeon， yet it is a very frequent and common injury in high-level contact athletes. Owen Farrell， England rugby halfback， said when he refused to come out on suspicion of a knockout during a match at the 2021 Six Nations Tournament： \"It’s just a stinger； it has nothing to do with me.\"\n\n【5】The classic injury mechanism is a direct impact on the shoulder involving the upper limb on one side and the head on the opposite side. This corresponds to the classic move made by a tackler in rugby. This result in compression and stretching of the brachial plexus， which in some cases can lead to a transient plexopathy of the brachial plexus called a stinger injury 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Stinger in French \"dard\"refers to the symptomatology of the injury. The Stinger injury is described as an electric discharge running through the upper limb. The symptoms are generally resolved in 1 min to 2 min. They are characterized by an immediate sensation of burns and electric discharges going through the entire upper limb associated with an important weakness， even with a total paralysis of the upperlimb. In some cases， weakness of the upper limb persists over time， especially in the muscles innervated by the proximal roots (C5 and C6)； these symptoms may persist for several days or weeks 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>.\n\n【6】The 2020/2021 COVID-19 epidemics highlight a certain neurotropism of this type of coronavirus. This tropism can be manifested by mononeuropathy or multifocal neuropathy 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. Beside the known attacks of the central nervous system and their symptoms such as anosmia or ageusia， a tropism of this virus for the nervous elements composing the brachial plexus has been highlighted 通用删除6(英):<u>[4，5]</u>.\n\n【7】Case Presentation\n\n【8】We present the case of a professional rugby player with a long recovery traumatic plexopathy in an athlete who was infected with the COVID-19 virus.\n\n【9】We then propose， based on the literature data， an update on the Stinger lesion in high-level athletes.\n\n【10】We present the case ofa professional rugby player of the \"Stade Francais”evolving as secondline in the French professional league. On November 29h， 2020 in a match following a tackle on the right shoulder ， he presented a Stinger injury characterized by a transient paralysis\n\n【11】Video 1： On November 29， 2020 in a match following a tackle on the right shoulder.\n\nStandard X-ray of the cervical spine， dynamic bilateral positional Doppler ultrasound，electroneuromyogram of both upper limbs and MRI ofthe right brachialplexus were performed in order to document the lesions and to eliminate a differential diagnosis (Parsonage Turner syndrome and thoracic-brachial outlet syndrome). The|删除段之间换行|Discussion\n\n【13】Focus on the Stinger injury in high-level athletes\n\n【14】Kawasaki et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u> have shown that 33.9% of professional rugby players experience at least one Stinger injury in a season， with a recurrence rate of 37.0% 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. Nevertheless， as these lesions are well known and commonplace among contact athletes， their incidence is probably underestimated 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>.\n\n【15】The mechanism involved in most cases combines downward traction of the upper limb and forced lateral flexion of the head on the side opposite the injury. This mechanism leads to a stretching of the brachial plexus associated in certain cases with a foraminal compression of the nerve roots of the brachialplexus. These traumatic stretch injuries of the brachial plexus are classified according to the Seddon Sunderland classification 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>. They are in the majority of cases type 1 (Neurapraxia) and rarely of type 2 (Axonotmesis). Type3 lesions (Neurotmesis) are not part of the Stingerlesions and belongs to the well-known management of tear out lesions of the brachial plexus 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>.\n\n【16】Grade 1 lesions lead to a demyelination process without axonal删除1换行damage. In grade 2 lesions， the axons and myelin sheath are affected leading to a process of Wallerian degeneration， but the Schwann cells as well as the perinerve and epinerve remain intact. As previously mentioned， the Stinger injury corresponds to an immediate sensation of burning and electrical discharges running through the entire upper limb associated with significant weakness or even total paralysis of the upper limb. In some cases， weakness persists in the upper limb， more marked in the muscles innervated by the proximal roots (C5and C6)， but it can also affect any of the muscles of the upper limb； these symptoms can persist for several weeks or even months 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>.\n\n【17】Clinical examination and management\n\n【18】The context， the description of the symptoms， the spontaneous resolving character in less than two minutes and the experience of the lesions by the athlete easily allows to make the diagnosis of Stinger injury. In case of atypical symptoms (bilateral damage， damage to the lower limbs) or in case of doubt， it is needed to consider the trauma as a cervical spine damage (immediate immobilization with a cervical collar and exit on a stretcher) 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>. The acute clinical examination should initially focus on eliminating differential diagnoses， such as cervical spine trauma or a shoulder girdle injury. Secondly， a complete motor and sensory examination of the upper limb concerned must be carried out， paying particular attention to the muscles innervated by the C6 and C7 roots， which are the most frequently affected.\n\n【19】As a matter of course， even in the typical injury cases， a complete clinical examination must be repeated after the game and regularly during the first two weeks. Indeed， a normal clinical examination in the acute phase does not prevent the occurrence of symptoms in the hours or days following the trauma 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. In case oftypicallesions，there is no indication to carry out further investigations. On the other hand， if the symptoms persist， the clinical examination must be repeated. It will try to asses' pain in the cervical spine， a sensory or motor deficit in the upper limb， the presence of a supra or infra clavicular pseudo Tinel's sign， an asymmetry of the radial pulse or a muscular atrophy especially in the shoulder (Deltoid， supra and infraspinous fossa) in order to eliminate a differential diagnosis.\n\n【20】After careful palpation of the cervical spine， a Spruling test is performed. If there is associated neck pain， the diagnosis can be guide to a cervical radicular damage 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>. The Spruling test consists of applying compression，rotation and homo-lateral tilt to the lesion. The maneuver is positive when it triggers radicular symptoms in the upper limb. Patients with Stinger injury have no neck pain and a negative Spruling test 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>.\n\n【21】The value of complementary investigation in Stinger injury is controversial. In cases of typical lesions with quick resolving symptoms， no further investigation is indicated.On the other hand， in case of persistent or recurrent symptoms or in case of doubt， imaging and electro-neuro-myograms can help to document the lesion and eliminate differential diagnoses.\n\n【22】Standard and dynamic cervical X-rays， as well as cervical MRI， are used to identify a spine facture， as well as cervical roots damage. Literature data seem to highlight anatomical predispositions of the cervical spine to the occurrence of Stinger injuries 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>. Indeed， a higher incidence of foraminal or cervical canal stenosis has been found in athletes with repetitive Stinger injuries 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>.\n\n【23】In case of persistent symptoms， we perform a dynamic arterial and venous positional Doppler ultrasound in order to rule out a cervicothoracic outlet syndrome.\n\n【24】The ENMG performed after 6 weeks in case of \"long stinger\"allows on the one hand to eliminate a pre-ganglionic damage of the brachial plexus and on the other hand to specify， if any， the level of the damage 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>.\n\n【25】Brachial plexus MRI is also only performed in cases of \"long Stinger\" and if all other investigations are normal. Hypersignal of the involved roots is currently found in stretch lesions of the brachial plexus14.\n\n【26】Management and return to sport\n\n【27】The management of these injuries is mainly based on physical rest， pain management and rehabilitation.\n\n【28】Feinberg et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u> propose an algorithm of management and return to sport according to the type of injury following the Sunderland classification 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>.\n\n【29】Grade 1 lesions (Neurapraxia) are divided into three categories related to the severity of the symptoms. The lesion known as \"mild grade 1\" is defined by an immediate regression of the symptoms. In this context the sports activity can be continued immediately. In the case of \"moderate grade 1\" injuries， the symptoms persist during the sporting activity and end after the match， while in the case of \"severe grade 1\"injuries， the symptoms persist for over 24 h. In moderate or severe injury， the sport activity must be stopped， the clinical exam must be repeated regularly and the paraclinicals investigations in order to eliminate a trauma of the cervical rachis must be carried out. The return to sport can be considered as soon as the symptoms disappear.\n\n【30】For Sunderland's grade 2 lesions， sports activity must be stopped immediately for 15 days minimum. The clinical exam must be repeated.\n\n【31】Paraclinical investigation are performed for cervical spine trauma， an EMG should be performed if symptoms persist for more than 15days. The return to sport can be considered as soon as the symptoms regress and paraclinicals investigations are normal.\n\n【32】In order to reduce the incidence of spine and nerve injuries， sports federations have progressively changed the rules of high-risk sports by being more and more restrictive and by sanctioning risky behaviors more severely. For example， at rugby，head-on tackles， high tackles and tackles above the waist are now prohibited in France and in most international competitions.\n\n【33】Regardingequipment， although their benefits are not scientifically validated， wearing \"pads\" on the shoulders in order to absorb shocks and the use of medical devices limiting hyperextension such as the“Cowboy-Collar\" for American soccer players are becoming more and more common 16.\n\n【34】Conclusion\n\n【35】The damage to the nervous system due to the neurotropism of COVID-19， although still unknown， seems to be more and more described and documented， the most common disorders are anosmia and agueusia. In addition to these， mononeuropathy or multifocal peripheral neuropathy have been described. Plexus lesions in patients with severe covid-19 infection were initiallyanalyzed as \"resuscitation neuropathies\"and consequences of prone sessions. The existence of a few cases of the upper limb deficits in patients who have not had any prone sessions has suggested the existence of a COVID-19 tropism for the nervous elements of the brachial plexus.\n\n【36】In our case the athlete had a positive COVID-19 PCR test on9/11/2020，during a systematicscreening of an official competition.He had no symptoms and was able to return to training and competition as soon as the regulatory isolation was over.\n\n【37】The occurrence of a stinger lesion in a professional athlete who played rugby intensively andhad neverpresented this symptomatology， brought us to search an additional subjacent lesion. The MRI showed diffuse damage to the roots of the brachial plexus.\n\n【38】We are unable to state that the lesion developed by the player is related to his contamination by COVID-19. But this leads us to wonder： \"Did a neurotropism of the COVID-19 virus in the brachial plexus facilitate the occurrence of a Stinger lesion and slow down his recuperation?", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

Incidence and epidemiological data on BT are still largely unknown， and the causes are multifactorial. Early detection and timely intervention are crucial in determining the outcome of the disease. In this report， we present a case of an Asian man with mild congestive heart failure， who was diagnosed with painless myocardial infarction and BT， and eventually achieved successful thrombosis resolution.\n\n【9】Case Presentation\n\n【10】Patient information\n\n【11】A 50-year-old Asian man， transferred from a community hospital， presented with slight shortness of breath upon waking from sleep， edema in his feet for three days， and a cough without production for the past month. He had a history of well-controlled hypertension for five years.

Electrocardiogram revealed sinus tachycardia， complete right bundle branch block， and an old anterior myocardial infarction. A chest computed tomographic scan showed mild pulmonary congestion and small bilateral pleural effusion.\n\n【16】Transthoracic Echocardiography (TTE) revealed a large left atrium and ventricle， hypokinesis of the left ventricle's apical and删除1换行mid segments， and a large mural thrombus (2.64 cm x1.27 cm) at the apex of the left ventricle (Supplementary Video 1).

However， seven days later， the INR ranged between1.2 and 1.6， and the patient suddenly developed hemoptysis， chest tightness， and hypoxemia while standing to urinate， with a blood pressure of 127/84 mmHg， pulse of 112 beats/min， and Spo2 of 92%. No significant changes were noted on the electrocardiogram， and TTE showed no signs of right ventricular pressure overload. Despite high suspicion of pulmonary embolism， computed tomography pulmonary angiography was not performed due to the patient’s refusal. On the second day， increased CTNI levels of 0.576 ng/ml were detected (normal range： 0-0.034 ng/ml) . The patient no longer had symptoms of hemoptysis， and the warfarin continued to be adjusted to make the International Normalized Ratio (INR)\n\n【24】Follow-up and outcomes\n\n【25】Subsequently， the patient was transported to the catheterization laboratory. Coronary angiography demonstrated 100% occlusive thrombosis in the proximal Left Anterior Descending artery (LAD)，adrug-elutingstentwasimplanted.Serialechocardiographic assessments were performed， and the thrombi gradually decreased in size at five days after adequate anticoagulation and disappeared at 12days after INR reach 2-3 .\n\n【26】Discussion\n\n【27】Biventricular Thrombosis (BT) is a rare but extremely dangerous删除1换行disease whose epidemiological， etiological and clinical features have not been thoroughly studied. Despite the high prevalence of myocardial infarction， our literature analysis revealed that only 7 case reports of BT associated with MI were available in full.\n\n【28】Epidemiology\n\n【29】Since the number of BT cases due to MI is extremely rare， we refer to published knowledge on the epidemiology of left ventricular thrombus in myocardial infarction. The incidence of Left Ventricular (LV) thrombus was 6.3% to 15% in patients with ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI)， and 19.2% in those with anterior STEMI and LVEF less than 50%， after the widespread use of Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，2]</u>. This indicates that BT maybe more common in patients with anterior STEMI and lower LVEF after PCI， just as what we found in our case. Considering the high prevalence of MI， it is possible that the incidence of BT is underestimated. Among seven reported cases associated with BT，3cases were old myocardial infarction and 5 cases of acute MI， and the features of them were list .\n\n【30】Pathophysiology\n\n【31】Thrombus formationinvolyesLthe threecomponentsCof Virchow's triad， which include blood stasis， endothelial injury， and hypercoagulability. Myocardial infarction has acute endothelial exposure with associated loss of myocardial contractility， and particularly anterior myocardial infarction with low LVEF， often involves the apex and can lead to blood stasis and endothelial injury 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Blood stasis can be triggered by myocardial akinesis or dyskinesis， while endothelial injury can cause inflammation and hypercoagulability by exposing subendothelial tissue and collagen to the circulating blood， leading to the formation of thrombus通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>. A 32-year-old male was reported to have an acute myocardial infarction combined with thrombosis that occurred after cocaine ingestion 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. The mechanisms of cocaine-induced myocardial infarction include coronary artery spasm and unstable plaques 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>. Myocardialinfarction occurs when fragile， but not necessarily narrow atherosclerotic plaques are disrupted under hemodynamic stress 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>. In our cases， as seen in the literature， anterior myocardial infarction with low LVEF supported the formation of BT.\n\n【32】Acquired and hereditary risk factorsSoften trigger hypercoagulability， accelerating thrombosis and embolism， such as Factor V Leiden mutation， antiphospholipid antibody syndrome， heparin-induced thrombocytopenia， anddanticoagulant protein deficiency. There has been one reported case of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) complicating anterior wall MI leading to BT formation， where COVID-19-induced hypercoagulability has been widely discussed 通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u>. Our patient had no history of long-term medication use and showed no evidence of hereditary hypercoagulability，suggesting that decreasedventricular wall contraction caused by myocardial infarction was the key factor in thrombus formation.\n\n【33】Diagnosis\n\n【34】Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) is considered the gold standard for diagnosing intracardiac thrombi， but it's not commonly used in clinical practice. Instead， BT is usually found incidentally during routine TTE. Out of the seven cases reported，only one was diagnosed with BT through CMI 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>， while the others were diagnosed through TTE. This patient underwent a comprehensive evaluation at a community hospital， but incomplete testing may have led to删除1换行missed diagnoses. During the further TTE exam， low echogenicity intracardiac masses were observed， along with a decreased Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) and weakened ventricular wall contraction. This finding is consistent with the five other cases reported where Myocardial Infarction (MI) was associated with BT. All of these patients had a significant drop in LVEF， with four of them having an LVEF below 30% (excluding the three cases where LVEF was not mentioned) . This supports the idea that decreased ventricular wall contraction resulting from MI is one of the key factors in BT formation， caused by slow blood flow and stasis.\n\n【35】Anterior STEMI， proximal LAD infarction， and LVEF below 30%are strong predictors of LV thrombus. However，thrombus formation can also occur in patients with an LVEF greater than 30% or in those with diabetes， which is a major cause of asymptomatic myocardial infarction. Therefore， health education should remind patients to watch their juice intake， as consuming more than 100% of daily recommended fruit juice intake can increase the risk of developing diabetes 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>.\n\n【36】Therapy\n\n【37】Anticoagulant therapy remains the cornerstone of treatment for thrombotic diseases. According to the 2021 American Heart Association/AmericanStrokeAssociation stroke prevention guidelines， in patients with stroke or transient ischemic attack and LV thrombus， systemic antagonists， such as vitamin K antagonists， are recommended for treating left ventricular thrombus after MI for three months (Class I)， with a target INR value of 2 to 2.5 通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>. In our case treatment， we used bridging low-molecular- weight heparin anticoagulation with warfarin， and achieved good results. Currently， new oral anticoagulant drugs are started to be use in the treatment of left ventricular thrombus 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>， and their efficacy in BT may need to be verified in left ventricular thrombus before they can be widely promoted.\n\n【38】Prognosis\n\n【39】The characteristics of thrombus mobility， including thrombus mobility and protrusion， have been used to identify patients at high risk of embolism. Among seven patients with myocardial infarction， three described thrombus mobility， and there were seven cases of pulmonary or systemic embolism， with four cases of residual thrombus and three deaths after the follow-up period ended . We reported that the patient's thrombus was resolved after 12 days of full anticoagulation with warfarin， with no evidence of embolism and a good prognosis.\n\n【40】Conclusion\n\n【41】Currently， the risk of BT in patients with myocardial infarction may be underestimated，especially in those with painless myocardial infarction. Clinicians should focus on high-risk populations， such as anterior wall myocardial infarction combined with low LVEF.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

This phenomenon was named“catastrophic”antiphospholipid syndrome “CAPS” by Asheron， thus the other name “Asheron Syndrome”通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. The CAPS Registry is an international registry for patients who develop catastrophic APS； it was generated by the European Forum on aPL in the year 2000. Analysis of the registry showed that the predisposing factor was primary APS in 46% of patients， SLE in 40%，lupus-like disease in 5%， and different autoimmune diseases in 9% 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. It is noteworthy to state that 46% of CAPS patients may present de novo without any event of previous thrombosis. However， 53% had precipitating factors 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>.

Her past medical history is significant for ulcerative colitis on mesalamine， HTN， DM， and CVA. On postoperative day 2 she developed“Catastrophic Antiphospholipid Syndrome”(CAPS) and passed away 10 days after the surgery.删除1换行view.\n\n【9】Three months prior to presentation， she had presented to the hospital with a thrombotic stroke in her left middle cerebral artery. Thrombolysis with tPA was attempted and failed. Thrombectomy was performed 10 h after the beginning of her symptoms. During thrombectomy through the femoral approach， the wire failed to pass through her common femoral artery bilaterally but was successfully passed through her right brachial artery. Post-thrombectomy she was started on Enoxaparin 40 mg and Aspirin 100 mg daily.\n\n【10】It is worth stating that 11 days prior to her stroke， the patient presented with a 3-week history of diarrhea and was diagnosed with a flare up ofher ulcerative colitis and was thus started on Enoxaparin40 mg daily. Thus， our patient had her stroke despite being on prophylactic anticoagulation.\n\n【11】As the wire failed to pass through her femoral artery (bilaterally) during thrombectomy， CT angiography was performed2and删除1换行demonstrated a complete occlusion of her infrarenal aorta， extending to the common iliac arteries consistent with Leriche syndrome. The inferior mesenteric artery was completely occluded. She had multiple splenic and bilateral renal infarcts. The colon had a tubular lead-pipe appearance . She had an irregular atheromatous plaque within the aortic arch .\n\n【12】Concerningthe hypercoagulability workup， the patient had a negative lipid profile， with HDL cholesterol of 32 mg/dl， LDL cholesterol of 24， and TG of 138. Negative ANA， C3， C4， Homocysteine， Protein C， Protein S， Procalcitonin， Antithrombic activity， Factor VIII， p-ANCA and c-ANCA. She also had negative Cardiolipin Ab IgG and IgM， Phospholipid Ab IgG and IgM. Her Lupus anticoagulant was positive， but she was on Enoxaparin， thus it was interpreted as a false positive result， especially with the negative cardiolipin Ab.\n\n【13】She had a Fecal calprotectin of >2100 (high quantity >200micrograms/g). Ten days after her stroke， she was discharged with right sided hemiplegia and aphasia on Aspirin and Rivaroxaban.\n\n【14】Three months following her CVA， the patient was admitted for an aortobifemoral bypass. Preoperatively， she was switched from Rivaroxabanto enoxaparin. She had Patient Controlled Epidural Anesthesia (PCEA) inserted directly preoperatively for postoperative pain control. Intraoperatively， the right external iliac artery was atherosclerotic. 5000 Units of unfractionated heparin were injected intravenously before clamping of the aorta. An anastomosis was performed between Dacron graft and the aorta， then between the graft and both femoral arteries. At the end of the procedure a positive right and left Common Femoral Artery (CFA) pulse was felt.\n\nPostoperatively， ultrasound showed flow in the SFA and profound a bilaterally. In the ICU， the patient developed altered mental status with worsening ofher aphasia. Brain MRI did not show new changes. Enoxaparin was started 40 mg SC BID 5 h post-operatively. Her|删除段之间换行|Post-embolectomy， the patient developed d rhabdomyolysis complicated by AKI， she also had hypotension unresponsive to IV fluids and became tachypneic but was not able to compensate for her metabolic acidosis. She was intubated， started on norepinephrine and antibiotics and on day 3 post-operatively she was started on hemodialysis. Methylprednisolone 100 cc once was given due to a possible component of adrenal insufficiency and was continued at a rate of 50 cc q 6 h. The skin on her right thigh also showed livedo reticularis， but these were not confirmed by biopsy due to financial reasons. She developed thrombocytopenia with a platelet count reaching 49 000/mm. Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT) and Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC) were ruled out as she had a D-dimer of 3.06 and a fibrinogen level of 354. Her mental status was disturbed as she was intubated， off sedation， with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of3. Brain CT did not show any changes.\n\n【16】CT angiography showed acute mesenteric ischemia involving the small bowel secondary to a proximal SMA thrombus ， multiple scattered hepatic infarcts， occlusion of both renal arteries distally  with increase of the bilateral renal infarcts. Bilateral lower lobar arterial pulmonary emboli . Her Beta 2 Glycoprotein Abs IgM and IgG were positive， Lupus anticoagulant and Anticardiolipin IgG and IgM were negative. She was continued on methylprednisolone 50 mgq6 h and therapeutic range unfractionated heparin monitored by Anti-factor X a assay. Due to her poor prognosis， her family changed the authorization to comfort care only. She deteriorated and passed away 10 days post-operatively.\n\n【17】Discussion\n\n【18】Asheron et al. proposed criteria for diagnosing CAPS. Certain features were common between these patients： Multiple organs (>2)删除1换行involved， many small vessels obstruction found histologically and the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies on serology 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u> .\n\n【19】These were later validated in the year 2005 by Cervara et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u> who found that they are 90.3% sensitive and 99.4% specific 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>.\n\n【20】It is of utmost importance to have the diagnosis early； but， due to multiple reasons， it is challenging. Aside from the fact that CAPS is a rare disease， it might not be thought of in patients without a known APS. Even if considered， not all diagnostic criteria may be met； especially in the acute setting 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>.\n\n【21】Regarding management of patients with CAPS，early initiation of treatment， within 8 hours of diagnosis， was considered of extreme importance. The first and most important treatment for such patients is therapeutic level anticoagulation 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. Steroids， anticoagulants and plasma exchange combined provided the highest recovery rate 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>.\n\n【22】We present a case of a 52-year-old female， with no previous pregnancy attempts， not known to have APS who was operated on and died after developing probable CAPS. Yet， she is known to have ulcerative colitis. The aim of this case report is to emphasize the importance of identifying CAPS as a differential diagnosis for patients who develop thrombocytopenia with no DIC nor HIT； but， with multiple organ damage and are not known to have APS nor SLE. This is of utmost importance as rapid treatment may save the life of the patient.\n\n【23】We also aim to emphasize the probability of CAPS in the large population of patients with IBD and increase the level of suspicion for CAPS in surgical patients. There is evolving evidence that the pathogenesis of formation of both arterial and venous thrombosis involves antiphospholipid antibodies 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>. In fact， in a studyconducted by Kraiem et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>， titled antiphospholipid antibodies and procoagulant profile in Tunisians with IBD， the authors concluded that the antiphospholipid auto antibodies， mostly IgA ab2GPI antibodies， were very often found in Tunisian patients with IBD. They suggested more prospective studies be conducted to learn about this marker's exact function and clinical relevance 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>.\n\n【24】A case report published by Stammler et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>， further supported recommendations that anti- vitamin K medication is the anticoagulant of choice in patients who have all three positive antiphospholipid antibodies 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>. Our patient， who had only 2 of the three antibodies positive， was on Enoxaparin 40 mg daily before she had her stroke. She had her stoke， despite being on enoxaparin which was prescribed to her due to an ulcerative colitis disease flare up. Postoperatively our patient developed CAPS triggered by the surgery.\n\n【25】Importantly， in preparation for her postoperative pain， a PCEA was placed preoperatively. On POD 4， while the patient was on therapeutic anticoagulation， removal of the PCEA was problematic， as it would requires interruption of the anticoagulation due to fear of an epidural hematoma. This is an area of controversy， and further删除1换行studies are required for identifying patients who are not fit for epidural pain control due to their hypercoagulable state that might require uninterrupted therapeutic anticoagulation post operatively. Patients with hypercoagulable state could be identified as being a relative contraindication for placement of apreoperative PCEA.\n\n【26】In conclusion， we encountered a case of probable CAPS in a patient not known to have antiphospholipid syndrome but known to have ulcerative colitis. It was a dramatic experience to have a patient develops such a chaotic sequence of events. Despite its rarity， CAPS should be kept in mind as one of the differentials in a patient with known ulcerative colitis who develops thrombocytopenia with multi-organ dysfunction following surgery. The early diagnosis of the disease with early management with uninterrupted therapeutic anticoagulation and steroids could save the life of the patient. Further studies are required for finding the incidence of developing CAPS in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.\n\n【27】Placement of a PCEA is an area of controversy that requires further studying. Surgeons must always keep in mind that surgery acts as a trigger for developing a hypercoagulable state leading to CAPs.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}
